0;IT;Gartner Inc;2018-05-17T00:17:57Z;Australian company develops world’s largest 3D printer ;Titomic’s bus-sized device adds scale to technology that is transforming manufacturing;Titomic, an Australian company, unveiled on Wednesday what it said was the world’s largest and fastest metal 3D printer— a development it said that could revolutionise the advanced manufacturing industry.The bus-sized printer is capable of making complex aircraft wing parts of up to nearly 9m in length. It can also print metal bike frames in around 25 minutes. The technology has attracted overseas interest with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri partnering with Titomic this week to explore using its “kinetic fusion” 3D printing technology at its shipyards.“Only a year ago people thought it would not be possible to use this type of printing process to make large-scale metal parts for industry,” Jeff Lang, chief executive of Titomic, told the FT. “Now we do are doing it larger and faster than anyone else.”By utilising three-dimensional digital models, 3D printing enables the creation of more complex and lightweight structures than traditional manufacturing methods and with less waste of materials. Some experts predicted it could spur a shift away from mass production back to local manufacturing in the markets where the products were sold. “3D printing removes the labour cost element in manufacturing by automating processes,” said Milan Brandt, professor of engineering at RMIT University, a technology and science-focused institution based in Australia.3D printing technology is already shaking up some advanced manufacturing sectors, according to Gartner, the research company, which predicts three-quarters of aircraft will fly with 3D printed components by 2021. It forecasts a fifth of the world’s top 100 consumer goods companies will use 3D printing to create custom products by then.Last year BP initiated a study to determine whether the rise of small-scale digital manufacturing using 3D printers would reduce the need to ship goods around the world, disrupting oil markets.“3D printing can provide an exponential increase in the speed of production lines,” said Mr Lang, who added that one of their 3D printers can do the work of 50 people. “It could enable, for example, US bicycle manufacturers, which tend to manufacture in cheap-labour zones, to begin to bring back local production.” Titomic’s technology was co-developed with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia’s national science agency. It has adapted existing cold spray technology — a technique used in the past mainly to deploy metal coatings and repairs to existing infrastructure.Titomic uses an additive manufacturing process, which sprays titanium alloy particles on to a scaffold, layer by layer, from a print head or nozzle, rather than by stamping or cutting metal panels on assembly lines. It does not use lasers or heat to melt metals — a method used by earlier generations of 3D printers, which have struggled to print metal components of any scale due to thermal distortion. Mr Brandt said Titomic’s technology was probably the world’s largest commercial 3D printer, although it was possible the Chinese defence establishment had developed similar printers. He said the technology was a step forward in terms of 3D printing at scale but cautioned that the printed components might not be as strong as those made using traditional methods, and might require some post-processing finishing. Mr Lang said Titomic’s 3D printing technology could get the metallurgy to within 1-2 per cent of standards produced by traditional manufacturing processes.Max York, Australia chief executive of General Electric, which previously held the record of developing the world’s largest 3D printer, said additive manufacturing was poised to become a disrupting force.Mr York said GE used the process to combine 855 separate parts into just 12 when designing a turboprop engine, adding: “It turns the whole classical design for manufacturing process on its head.”
1;IT;Gartner Inc;2018-04-11T21:55:15Z;Worldwide PC shipments fall for 14th straight quarter, Gartner says;;Worldwide PC shipments fell for the 14th consecutive quarter, Gartner said on Wednesday, on lower demand in China and the US and delayed orders ahead of the release of new models.Global shipments of personal computers — which include desk-based PCs and notebook PCs but not Chromebooks or iPads — fell 1.4 per cent to 61.7m units in the first quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. Shipments fell 2.9 per cent to 11.8m units in the US and 3.9 per cent in the Asia-Pacific market — led by a 5.9 per cent drop in China.“This was driven by China’s business market, where some state-owned and large enterprises postponed new purchases or upgrades, awaiting new policies and officials’ reassignments after the session of the National People’s Congress in early March,” Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said.PC shipments also declined as some inventory was carried over from the end of last year and vendors awaited newer models, with Intel due to release the latest generation of core processors in the second quarter.The report showed that Texas-based Dell saw the biggest increase in shipments, up 6.5 per cent year-on-year. And while Dell secured the largest market share in the US, HP retained the top spot globally with 20.8 per cent of the market share.A separate report from IDC, however, showed that global PC shipments were little changed at 60.4m units, exceeding its forecast for a 1.5 per cent year-on-year decline in the first quarter. This marks the third straight quarter where traditional PC shipment volume has been roughly flat. IDC includes desktops, notebooks and workstations in its methodology.“The market is continuing on a resilient path that should see modest commercial momentum through 2020,” said IDC research manager Jay Chou.The PC market was expected to grow again in 2018 after years of decline amid the rising adoption of smartphones.
2;IT;Gartner Inc;2018-03-02T18:23:33Z;Time to worry about smartphone innovation;Struggle of gadget makers to generate buzz at MWC highlights shift in market;When the relaunch of a two-decades-old banana-shaped phone manages to create the most buzz at the world’s biggest telecoms show, it is time to start worrying about smartphone innovation.The phone in question — the old Nokia 8810 — was not even great in 1996, and looked more ridiculous than ever when relaunched with 4G at the Mobile World Congress this week. But it does highlight how far the market has shifted from hardware to services in just a few years.Mobile World Congress, an event designed to show off cutting-edge connected devices, instead showed just why the fortunes of the smartphone industry have turned so quickly. Its vast halls of cheap Android-based devices, with broadly the same shapes and functions, caused little excitement. Even Samsung’s big ideas this year stopped not much further than improving the camera on its flagship phone, which does not seem much given the Korean group’s $12bn annual R&D budget.It is no surprise that global smartphone sales fell for the first time in the last quarter of 2017, year-on-year, according to Gartner. Executives at telecoms groups say people are holding on to phones for longer, or buying older devices when the latest sells at twice the price with barely more functionality.Compounding the problem, the companies that make hardware such as smartphones, connected watches, or VR headsets have quickly found their supposedly groundbreaking devices easily copied by low-cost Asian manufacturers. Call this the IBM problem, which faced an existential threat as soon as Asian groups started churning out cheap PCs in the 1990s. But here IBM also provides a few tips to the future, with its pivot to software and solutions. By the time of IBM’s iconic “solutions for a small planet” ad campaign in 1996, the company was trumpeting voice recognition and ecommerce — producing the sort of digital enterprise backbone that ended up helping develop the internet economy.Likewise, the focus for successful tech groups has shifted towards operating systems and services. The 5G networks that were the other main feature of the telecoms congress were pointing to a move beyond smartphones, and to the development of smart homes and cars. Apple and Samsung may still make money from their phones, but they have considerable advantages in cross-referencing suites of connected devices from fridges to speakers.The latter, another of the gadgets tipped for big things this year, provides a snapshot of how competition is changing. Companies are not just battling over who can get the plastic devices into the house, but over who gets to have the sound of the voices of their personal assistants heard in the living room: Alexa, Bixby or Siri. This is reflected in the barely profitable prices being offered by the leading manufacturers. The money is to be made in your home PA, with any resulting opportunity to sell and advertise.Such AI-based platforms are being developed by an ever more dominant grouping, comprising Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung and Microsoft. Companies just making gadgets are simply hanging on to their coat-tails now. Hence the huge valuations carried by the tech groups on the stock market relative to erstwhile rivals that have concentrated on making devices. But still, at least for this former tech reporter, there is a moment of mourning this week for the glory days of the smartphone — sometimes great, sometimes ludicrous, but rarely dull.
3;IT;Gartner Inc;2018-02-22T18:49:57Z;Global smartphone sales fall for first time;Incremental upgrades fail to persuade users to trade up;Global sales of smartphones declined in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period a year earlier, marking the first year-on-year decline as consumers were slower to upgrade their devices.Nearly 408m smartphones were sold to consumers in the final three months of last year, according to Gartner, a 5.6 per cent fall from the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first fall since the research firm began tracking the market in 2004.Although demand for features such as 4G connectivity and high-quality cameras remained strong, new products with only incremental improvements failed to motivate users to trade up, according to Anshul Gupta, research director.A decade of growth now means most people have access to a smartphone or tablet device but the latest research will be worrying for the telecoms industry, which has experienced falling sales in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market.As demand for new smartphones has slowed, manufacturers and chipmakers have begun to look towards alternative products to embed their technologies in, including ‘internet of things’ devices and automated cars.The Gartner report said Samsung remained the most popular smartphone brand by sales with a market share of 18.2 per cent, followed closely by Apple with 17.9 per cent.Samsung’s profit and average selling price could improve if its next flagship phones, the successors to its Galaxy series which are expected to launch this year, are successful.Gartner also expects strong demand for the iPhone X to bring a delayed sales boost for the US company in the first quarter of 2018.Chinese phone manufacturers Huawei and Xiaomi were the only companies to see sales grow, largely driven by strong demand in Asia.
4;IT;Gartner Inc;2017-10-26T17:57:34Z;Gorillas in the mist await cloud players old and new;Traditional IT companies are struggling not to be picked off as laggards in new world;Sometimes, in the midst of a technology shift that takes years to play out, you have to stop the clock to see what is happening.Relative value has been seeping away from old-line IT companies as the cloud becomes a significant locus for computing. It is not a binary choice for tech buyers, who are facing massive sunk cost in their existing systems — as this week’s alliance of convenience between Google and Cisco Systems shows. But there is no disguising the direction of travel.Between them, IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc, Cisco and VMware are now worth about $420bn — only 15 per cent more than this same group (before the HP break-up) was worth a decade ago.These companies, taken together, represent a large chunk of what, not so long ago, was thought of as the IT sector. The cloud has changed all that. To put it in perspective: their entire market capitalisation is equivalent to the extra value added over the past decade by Amazon, the leading cloud player.True, Amazon’s business still revolves mostly around ecommerce and logistics. But the solid profit margins of its cloud business, Amazon Web Services, are supporting the entire enterprise. The sheer scale of the addressable market — global IT spending should hit $3.5tn this year, according to Gartner — supports the analysts who argue that this will eventually become Amazon’s main business. That puts into perspective the messy transitional period the IT world is now in — and will continue to struggle through for a long time to come.When traditional IT companies first coined the term “hybrid cloud” — meaning the mixture of computing on their own premises and cloud-based services that is now the reality of life for most big consumers of IT — they were sounding a plea for continued relevance. But the pure cloud players are now making the same case, and building the relationships needed to work in this world. Amazon struck a deal with VMware last year, and now Google has allied itself with Cisco.The truth is, despite the tectonic shifts that seem to upend established tech companies with regularity, IT is a business with very long residuals. The heyday of the mainframe computer ended many years ago, but IBM is still reckoned to derive nearly half its profits from selling the machines, along with related software and services.However, that should not distract from where value — both in business and stock market terms — is shifting. The cloud is no longer just about buying extra storage capacity or processing capacity. Many of the most advanced development environments and higher level services for application developers are now being supplied from the cloud.With the partnership announced this week, Google will be creating many of those tools for Cisco’s customers. And machine learning is the not-so-secret weapon that will do much to drive the next round of cloud development: the chance for outside companies to plug into the artificial intelligence developed for the search giant’s own services could be a big draw in future.Some IT companies, at least in the stock market’s eyes, have already come through the Valley of Death represented by this transition. Microsoft has added $350bn in market value in the past 10 years. Oracle, after leading a wave of consolidation among traditional software companies, is finally getting a cloud lift that has added $120bn in market cap.The market value comparisons are pertinent. The IT sector has always gone through cycles, as periods of innovation give way to scrambles for consolidation. The winners are the ones best positioned when consolidation hits.After an incredible run as two of the winners from cloud-based software applications, Adobe and Salesforce are worth $85bn and $72bn respectively. That might make them look like survivors of the cloud transition. But it is all relative.When Microsoft toyed with buying Salesforce three years ago, for a reputed $60bn, it would have represented about 17 per cent of the larger company’s then-stock market value. Now that Microsoft has a much higher market cap, paying perhaps $80bn now would only represent 13 per cent of its present worth.The cloud is big enough to contain a multitude of software, services and infrastructure companies and more will emerge as it expands further. But there are already gorillas in the mist and — from the traditional IT players to the pure-play cloud services — no one can feel safe.richard.waters@ft.com
5;IT;Gartner Inc;2017-10-17T07:30:16Z;PC market set to return to growth in 2018;Windows 10 upgrade by businesses along with growth in China and Russia spark revival;The PC is set to stage a comeback in 2018, after the rise of smartphones sent sales of desktop and laptop computers into decline in recent years.The latest industry prediction suggests a return to growth for PCs next year, as businesses upgrade their computers, while markets including China and Russia rebound.Gartner, the research company, predicts the global devices market will grow by 2 per cent in 2018 to 2.35bn units. That would represent the fastest rate of growth since 2015.Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner, said the “misconception persists” that the world has gone completely mobile and relies on smartphones, when many people still use desktop computers, laptops and tablets for specific tasks including reading, watching videos and writing long emails.He said users holding on to older PCs for a longer period remains an issue for the market and that traditional PC shipments will probably shrink 4.4 per cent in 2018. That decline is more rapid than the 3.6 per cent drop that was recorded in the third quarter of this year as component shortages led to price rises that weighed on shipment growth.Yet businesses have started buying computers again, as more companies upgrade to Windows 10-based computers, according to Gartner. It predicts the overall market for PCs, including ultramobile laptop models, will rise 0.8 per cent in 2018 after a stable 2017.Mr Atwal said the PC market in Russia is expected to grow 5 per cent this year, with expansion continuing into 2018. Growth in that market will be driven by desktop computers, which are more aggressively priced than mobile computers and hybrid devices.Another growth driver will be China, where sales of PCs have been slow in 2017 because of security and privacy concerns related to Windows 10. With Microsoft now working with a Chinese government agency on an approved version of the software, Gartner expects a positive affect in 2018 as sales of ultramobile computers ramp up.The total PC market is expected to drop to 263m units this year from 270m in 2016, but is forecast to top 265m in 2018. That compares to 352m in 2011.The research company also expects phone sales to grow in 2018, with shipments expected to rise 2.4 per cent and smartphone sales seen rising 6 per cent to 1.6bn — about 86 per cent of overall mobile phone shipments. The iPhone X is seen as a sales driver in North America, China and Western Europe. With the phone not available until November, the impact of sales will not be felt until 2018.That could follow a weak fourth quarter of 2017 when component shortages could limit supply of new phones, particularly at the lower end of the market.
6;IT;Gartner Inc;2017-10-10T22:22:04Z;Global PC shipments decline for 12th straight quarter but HP bucks fall, Gartner says;;Worldwide PC shipments fell for the 12th consecutive quarter amid weakness in the US market, research group Gartner said on Tuesday.Global shipments of personal computers fell 3.6 per cent from a year ago in the third quarter to 67m units as signs of stabilsation in key regions like Japan, Latin America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) were offset by weakness in the US, according to preliminary estimates from Gartner. America saw a 10.3 per cent drop — its fourth straight quarterly drop — to 14.7m units.“Weak back-to-school sales were further evidence that traditional consumer PC demand drivers for PCs are no longer effective,” Mika Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said. “Business PC demand is stable in the US, but demand could slow down among SMBs due to PC price increases due to component shortages.”HP was the only major PC maker to clock a gain, with a 4.4 per cent increase in shipments to 14.59m units — marking its fifth straight quarter of PC growth and taking its market share to 21.8 per cent. Lenovo, which came in second reported a 1.5 per cent drop to 14.36m units, making it the eighth drop in the last 10 quarters and putting its market share at 21.4 per cent.Meanwhile, shipments of Apple’s Mac computers fell 5.6 per cent to 4.6m units seeing its market share slip to 6.9 per cent, compared 7 per cent a year ago.The shortage of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips, that worsened in the third quarter, lifted prices of components and weighed on shipments. “The component price hike impacted the consumer PC market as most vendors generally pass the price hike on to consumers, rather than absorbing the cost themselves,” Mika Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said.
7;IT;Gartner Inc;2017-09-18T17:54:16Z;John Chambers to step down at Cisco Systems;Executive chairman who led network giant from mid-90s will depart at end of year;John Chambers, one of the towering figures from the tech boom of the late-1990s, is to step down as chairman of networking equipment company Cisco Systems, the company said on Monday.His departure comes a decade and a half after Cisco enjoyed a brief spell as the world’s most valuable company, and comes as the company is going through an upheaval in its business caused by the rise of cloud computing.Mr Chambers stepped back as chief executive two years ago, handing the reins to former head of sales Chuck Robbins, but stayed on as executive chairman and has remained a prominent face internationally for the company.“It needed a different type of person to lead it through this transition,” said Glenn O’Donnell, an IT analyst at Forrester Research*. “They needed someone to come in and really shake things up. It hasn’t made [Mr Robbins] popular with a lot of people inside Cisco.”Mr O’Donnell said Mr Chambers had picked the right moment to cede control, rather than risk the company’s future by staying on too long — a fate that befell Ken Olsen at Digital Equipment Corporation, the Boston-based company that foundered on the transition from the mini-computing to PC eras.With an affable salesman’s charm, pronounced West Virginia accent and expansive enthusiasm, the voluble Mr Chambers rode the first wave of the internet boom to overtake the world’s biggest communications equipment makers. The routers and other IP-based gear it produced ended up swallowing most of the voice calls and other traffic that flowed over other networks, undermining giant telecoms equipment companies of the era, such as Nortel and Lucent.“Our competitors from 10 years and before are gone,” said Mr Chambers, 68, in an FT interview on Monday. Referring to constant talk in the tech world of successive start-ups that would turn into a “Cisco killer”, he said: “Nobody’s been able to get us.”Cisco emerged from a group of small IP networking companies in the mid-1990s, rising from $1.2bn in revenue when he took over to $48bn last year. “We got the market transitions right. We innovated at a pace other companies couldn’t,” Mr Chambers said.At one point during the boom, Cisco overtook Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable company, as its stock market value topped $600bn — a level that would still make it the third most valuable today, behind Apple and Google’s parent, Alphabet.There were concerns when he stepped down as chief executive that his full-time executive role would overshadow his successor. However, he said he had cut his role to half-time about a year ago, and insisted that the development of his “partnership” with Mr Robbins, who will take over as chairman in December, had been part of a well thought out plan.His departure at the end of the year will leave Larry Ellison of Oracle and Michael Dell as the only heads of leading US tech companies from the 1990s to still play an influential role in the industry.Mr Ellison, who has also handed over the chief executive responsibilities while still playing a central role in strategy, is steering Oracle through a major transition to the cloud. Mr Dell, meanwhile, bought back the PC company that bears his name in the largest buyout and has since turned it into one of the world’s biggest IT companies in terms of sales.A former computer salesman who got his start at IBM, Mr Chambers joined Cisco in 1990 and rose to become chief executive in 1995.* This article has been amended to reflect that Glenn O’Donnell is an IT analyst at Forrester Research
8;IT;Gartner Inc;2017-08-28T13:01:55Z;New Fitbit smartwatch and headphones take aim at Apple;Partnership with Adidas marks effort to regain leadership of wearable tech market;Fitbit is teaming up with Adidas as it takes on Apple with its first fully-fledged smartwatch, Ionic, and new wireless headphones. Ionic is the first of what Fitbit chief executive James Park said would be a series of smartwatches, as it looks to regain its position at the top of the wearable technology market, a position that analysts say it has lost to Apple Watch in recent months. The $300 device — which boasts four-day battery life, new wireless music and payment features, and improved GPS and heart-rate tracking — will go on sale in October. Adidas, the German sportswear group, will sell a special edition of Ionic starting early next year, boosting Fitbit’s profile in Europe and Asia. In Fitbit, Adidas has a new ally against Nike, which first partnered with Apple on a customised version of its Watch last year. Adidas lags behind Nike in the US sportswear market but has been gaining share in recent months. Fitbit is banking on Ionic to reverse its declining sales, as simpler fitness trackers reach saturation point in many developed markets. The San Francisco-based company’s revenues this year are expected to fall by as much as a quarter compared with 2016. Ionic’s launch is “definitely a big event in the company’s history”, Mr Park said in an interview. “We’ve rarely entered a new category with this much effort and push behind it.” While the majority of Fitbit’s revenues in the fourth quarter will still come from its earlier products, Mr Park added: “Our entry into smartwatches — and Ionic is not the only product in our smartwatch road map — allows us to re-establish a growth profile for Fitbit looking forward.” [The Ionic’s] upgraded sensor can detect blood oxygen levels as well as heart rate and steps, meaning it could eventually help diagnose medical conditions such as sleep apnoeaThe unveiling of Ionic, alongside new Flyer wireless headphones and updated Aria scales, comes ahead of the anticipated new version of the Apple Watch, which is expected to include a cellular wireless connection when it makes its debut next month. Ionic, which unlike an Apple Watch works with both iOS and Android smartphones, features a slimline design that Fitbit says was inspired by the space age. Its upgraded sensor can detect blood oxygen levels as well as heart rate and steps, meaning it could eventually help diagnose medical conditions such as sleep apnoea. A colour touchscreen will also offer guided workout sessions, powered by a revamped Fitbit Coach app, and customisable watch faces. Analysts at Gartner estimate that 41.5m smartwatches will be sold globally this year, up 19 per cent from 2016, generating $9.7bn in revenues. The consultancy predicts that smartwatches will be the second best-selling kind of wearable device by 2019, after Bluetooth headsets. Fitbit’s $130 Flyer wireless headphones, which pair automatically with Ionic watches, are designed to be workout friendly with a secure and sweat-proof design. While Flyer headphones, at $130, are cheaper than Apple’s $160 AirPods, the Ionic is at least $30 more expensive than the cheapest available Apple Watch. Gartner estimates the average selling price of a smartwatch is $223. Mr Park believes Ionic can command a premium price because of its four-day battery life (Apple Watch lasts just a day or two), improved GPS reception thanks to “nanomoulding technology” that he says is unique in wearables, and the ability to stream music from Pandora, the internet radio company. Thanks to the acquisitions of Coin and Pebble last year, Fitbit’s watch will also support third-party apps, such as Starbucks and Strava, as well as contactless payments with Visa, MasterCard and American Express cards. Although multi-day battery life means Ionic can track sleep, continuous use of both music and GPS will consume all the device’s power reserves in around 10 hours. Like the Apple Watch, Ionic’s screen remains dark until wearers raise their arm or push a button, in order to lengthen battery life. Customers can order an Ionic starting on August 28, with the first shipments arriving in late September. The device will go on general sale in October.
9;IT;Gartner Inc;2017-08-24T17:18:48Z;Dixons Carphone rings alarm on UK smartphone market;Retailer blames warning on lack of handsets but analysts point to structural shift;Dixons Carphone, Britain’s largest retailer of smartphones, is blaming consumers’ reluctance to upgrade and a lack of handset innovation for an unexpected profit warning issued on Thursday.But analysts are questioning whether there is a structural shift in how consumers buy their phones.The retailer’s warning coincided with the launch of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 which, alongside the impending launch of Apple’s latest iPhone, had been expected to act as a catalyst for a new upgrade cycle as consumers trade in older models for “$1,000 smartphones” offering an array of new features.Yet Seb James, chief executive of Dixons Carphone, argues it would be “Pollyanna-ish” to presume that expensive new models will kick-start a recovery, as consumers are holding on to old handsets for about six months longer than previously. He says it is “quite rational” that consumers have delayed phone purchases given the rising cost of handsets in the UK — and what he calls “relatively incremental handset improvements”.“The S8 is a great phone but it is quite pricey. You are [looking at] an extra £600 or £700 for a waterproof screen or inductive charging and quite a lot of people are saying ‘no thanks’,” says Mr James.He expresses some confidence the market will rebound, with many Apple users holding on to phones “on their last legs” in anticipation of the iPhone 8 launch later this year.Yet the Dixons Carphone update adds fuel to the argument that UK smartphone consumers have become more discerning, and are happier to buy SIM-only data deals direct from networks while hunting for cheaper handsets online. Such a change in consumer behaviour would have a marked impact on longstanding business model of Carphone Warehouse, which merged with Dixons in 2014.Michael Prew, managing director at investment bank Jefferies, says: “Dixons Carphone really just moves cardboard boxes around with no in-store added value — so it’s just a logistics business with expensive high street storage. Another nail in the high street coffin which is contracting relentlessly to food and fitness. The value of these businesses is transferring from shops to sheds.”Britain has traditionally been a subsidy-led market where consumers pay for an expensive handset over the lifetime of the contract, a model that had suited Carphone Warehouse. Yet consumer habits appear to be changing.Roberta Cozza, an analyst with Gartner, says: “What we now have in the UK is a very knowledgable buyer who knows what they want. It is the decoupling of the data plan from the cost of the device.”The UK smartphone market is in decline, contracting 5 per cent in 2016 to 34m handsets according to Gartner — a sharper fall than the 2 per cent drop across western Europe.That was partly due to the poor showing of the iPhone 7 and industry experts have predicted an “avalanche” of orders for the iPhone 8. Mr James says his company expects similar volumes to the iPhone 6S in 2015 when the new model hits the shelves.Another problem for Dixons Carphone is a lack of variety at the device level, with almost three-quarters of phone owners in the UK now using an iPhone or Galaxy smartphone.Apple and Samsung’s combined market share rose to 71 per cent at the end of June compared with 62 per cent only 18 months earlier, according to Gartner. Second-tier handset makers including Huawei and Lenovo have struggled to make their mark in Britain meaning there is less competition and less reason for consumers to head to Dixons Carphone’s stores to check out new models.Some analysts say that “alarm bells”, rather than ringtones, have started to sound at the retailer with its shares dropping almost 20 per cent on its warning that profits will be £360m-£440m, compared with analyst expectations of closer to £500m. Simon Bowler, an analyst with Exane BNP Paribas, says: “Of greatest concern are changes in the mobile market which threaten to undermine Dixon Carphone’s share and profitability.”Mr James denies that the significance of the independent mobile phone retailer is receding. The collapse of Phones4u in 2014 raised concerns that networks were intent on tightening their grip on the retail market by pushing more sales through their own stores and websites.“We’ve grown not shrunk. Our market share is growing. Phones4u is absolutely not relevant,” says Mr James, noting that smartphone sales only account for a portion of Dixons’ overall business. The retailer connected 37 per cent of new contract subscribers last year according to its accounts.Neil Mawston, executive director at research company Strategy Analytics, says that the retailer may have not helped its own cause by launching a low-cost network called iD Mobile that has encouraged many customers passing through its doors to trade down, not up, by taking lower-priced contracts.“Carphone Warehouse may have to start closing some of its UK or European retail stores if things do not improve for the retailer in 2018,” he says. “It is not the next Phones4U, because it has a much stronger top-market position, but Carphone does have some bumpy times ahead.”
10;IT;Gartner Inc;2017-08-24T07:20:57Z;Dixons Carphone tumbles 30% after warning on mobile phone market;;Dixons Carphone shed almost a third of its market value after the UK smartphone retailer warned of a slowdown in the mobile phone market as a weak currency and lacklustre innovation has prompted consumers to hold on to their handsets for longer.The shares tumbled 27.2 per cent shortly after the open in London to £1.60. Thursday’s fall was the steepest in more than five-and-a-half years, Bloomberg data show.The phone retailer said in a trading update that it is “too early” to say whether key product launches will invigorate the market, but that it is “prudent to plan on the basis that the overall market demand will not correct itself this year.”Dixons’s cautious tone may spark concerns for investors in makers of smartphones, such as California tech-giant Apple, that are under increased pressure to provide customers a reason to upgrade their devices.Gartner, the research group, predicted last month that global smartphone shipments will rise 5 per cent in 2017. But it also noted that “the smartphone market is now more dependent on new devices that offer something different, as users are extending their purchasing cycles and need to be enticed to make a replacement.”Dixon management now expects the group will generate profit before tax for 2017/18 in the range of £360m to £440m with core trading profitability in line with last year.“Over the last few months we have seen a more challenging UK postpay mobile phone market,” said Dixons chief executive Seb James said, adding: “currency fluctuations have meant that handsets have become more expensive.He also said: “Whilst this investment will cause a shortfall in profits for our phone business we do however expect overall profit in our core retail operations to be in line with last year supported by good progress in our UK & Ireland, Nordic and Greek electrical businesses.”Earlier this month, broker Exane BNP Paribas downgraded Dixons to “underperform”, citing changes to the UK mobile phone market and threats to Dixons’ profitability such as new entrants BT and Sky are competing aggressively for market share.
11;IT;Gartner Inc;2017-06-28T17:41:05Z;KKR exits Visma in one of Europe’s biggest software buyouts;Singapore sovereign fund and HgCapital increase stakes in Nordic cloud service;KKR, the US buyout giant, has sold its entire stake in Visma, a Norwegian software company, for £1.4bn to a group of investors that include GIC, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, three people familiar with the transaction have said.The deal, to be officially announced late on Wednesday, is set to become one of the largest ever European software buyouts, with an enterprise value of £4.1bn.HgCapital, the UK private equity group that had an existing stake in Visma, will hold 45 per cent of the equity in the web-based services business. GIC has bought a 12 per cent stake.Other investors include private equity groups Cinven and Montagu and Intermediate Capital Group, the London-listed specialist asset manager, which together will retain roughly a 38 per cent stake.Whilst Cinven is still an investor in Visma, the private equity group has decreased its stake from 28 per cent to 17 per cent.Management will also retain a minority stake of close to 7 per cent in the business, the people said. Øystein Moan, Visma’s chief executive, will continue in his post.The sale comes as private equity groups and large institutional investors are awash with cash and under increasing pressure to deploy capital. By the end of last year, the buyout industry had $820bn in unspent cash, according to Preqin, the data provider.KKR acquired a 70 per cent controlling stake in Visma in 2010, and then reduced it to roughly 30 per cent in 2014 when it sold to Cinven and HgCapital.Visma, which focuses on the Nordic region and provides accounting financial software and other administrative services to companies and governments, increased revenues by 21 per cent last year.It grew earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation by a third to $225.1m in 2016. Since 1997, it has increased revenues and profits by more than 15 per cent per year.The Oslo-based company has been able to sustain growth thanks to a string of acquisitions of smaller peers and the increasing popularity among businesses of cloud-based software, as they look to reduce the costs of owning expensive hardware. A recent report by tech research firm Gartner found cloud-computing services are growing by roughly a quarter per year in Europe.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningThe new and existing owners will continue to acquire businesses and customers to further expansion, the people said. Management is also considering expanding in new geographies, including Eastern and Central Europe.Private equity buyers have been particularly keen on technology assets in recent times, with Advent International and Bpifrance snapping up Safran’s identity and security businesses last year at €2.4bn, according to Preqin.Visma shareholders were advised by Arma Partners, Lazard, Deloitte, Skadden and Bain & Co. Morgan Stanley and ABG Sundal Collier advised the selling shareholders KKR and Cinven.
12;IT;Gartner Inc;2017-05-02T18:33:21Z;Microsoft takes on Google in the classroom;New version of Windows will enable cheaper laptops to compete with Chromebooks;Microsoft has launched a full-scale bid to take back control of American classrooms from Google and Apple, as the rival technology giants fight for the loyalty of future generations of customers.On Tuesday, it announced software designed to lure back teachers and school administrators, including a restricted version of Windows for a new family of low-cost laptops starting at $189 that would compete with Google’s Chromebook family.It also unveiled its own higher-end Surface Laptop — a $999 rival to the MacBook, the expensive notebook that Apple offers to students at a discount and dominates university campuses.However, the main thrust of Microsoft’s announcement appeared aimed at dislodging Google, which has stolen a lead in US classrooms with its Chromebook machines and software tools to help teachers manage schoolwork and reduce the complexity of administering students’ machines.“I see it as strategic and wanting to be in front of the next customers,” said David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner. Microsoft was trying to protect the long-term health of its Office productivity tools by putting them in front of children, he added.Chromebook, launched in 2011, was Google’s attempt to displace existing laptops with a new kind of machine that runs apps in a browser over the internet, rather than depending on software installed on the device.The computers have made little impression on the wider market, but have caught on in US schools, where they have a 58 per cent market share, according to Futuresource Consulting. Windows dominates elsewhere in the world, accounting for 65 per cent of school computers.On Tuesday, Microsoft unveiled its response in the shape of Windows 10 S, a version of Windows that is restricted to only downloading apps from the company’s own Windows Store, rather than running all the normal Windows applications for their PCs. The limitation is meant to prevent students downloading unapproved programs or filling their machines with software that reduces performance, the company said.Restricting the apps that the machines can run carried an echo of a previous, failed attempt by Microsoft to reinvent its operating system for a different style of mobile computing.Windows RT, announced in 2011, was a response to Apple’s iPad, and ran on laptops using chips designed by ARM, rather than the standard Intel-based architecture of other PCs. The software failed to catch on because of a paucity of applications available for it.Restricting the apps that can be used on Windows 10 S devices is “a fairly serious limitation”, said Mr Smith, since users would expect a Windows-branded computer to be able to run the full range of existing applications.Among other things, the limitation would mean that users would not be able to download and use Google’s Chrome, the most widely used browser. That would raise issues of “compatibility and perception”, said Mr Smith, since many app developers wrote their software to work best on Chrome.
13;IT;Gartner Inc;2017-02-27T05:01:44Z;Phonemakers at Mobile World Congress pin hopes on 5G;Equipment makers may find it hard to deliver on new network’s utopian promise;Barcelona in late February is a hunting ground for pickpockets, for it is there that members of the telecoms industry annually convene to show off their latest wares, some of which still have yet to be announced.About 100,000 people will attend Mobile World Congress this year. Delegates will come from all sectors of the industry, including makers of the base stations that transmit phone signals, producers of the mobile devices that receive them and developers who make the apps that phones depend on.High on the industry agenda is 5G, a network technology that aims to make data communication speeds significantly faster than its predecessor, 4G. Mats Granryd, director-general of the industry body GSMA, which organises the conference, says: “We will move away from being vague on the prospects of 5G this year to concrete proposals.”There could be up to 200 launches of so-called 5G-lite by carriers this year as they prepare for its arrival in 2019.The coming of a faster network has been hailed as a possible boost for the telecoms sector, with Asian, US and European governments vying to take a lead in the new technology.A survey from UK telecoms company O2 predicts national 5G coverage would directly contribute an additional £7bn a year to Britain’s economy by 2026 and that the economic impact will be felt almost twice as quickly as that of fibre broadband, first tested by BT in 2009.Network equipment makers at Mobile World Congress will try to deliver on the promise of a fully digital and constantly connected society. But the utopian vision of 5G has led some to question whether it will deliver all the services and economic benefits being promised, particularly as squeezed telecoms companies are as yet unwilling to stump up the projected funds to build the networks. These could cost €56bn in Europe alone.Growing acceptance of services powered by artificial intelligence, such as voice assistants, is also fuelling this market upswingOne analyst quipped in the conference run-up that no network technology has been so talked about so early in the cycle. “That might be because there isn’t much else to talk about,” he says.Nokia will get in on the 5G act as the network equipment maker vies with Ericsson and Huawei to win orders for the new technology. However, the Nokia brand will also return to the consumer smartphone market for the first time in three and the half years since Microsoft bought its handset business.Some are confident the new Android-based range — made by Finnish company HMD — will become a force to reckon with. New BlackBerry devices, made under licence by third parties, will also come to market, despite the Canadian company signalling it would exit the sector last year. Others think Samsung’s woes with its exploding Galaxy Note 7 last year could let them in. Hopefuls include second-tier makers LG with its G6, and Huawei with its P10.93Number of countries that have mobile money usersSuch products could attract hungry buyers. Professional services group Accenture, which surveyed 26,000 consumers worldwide, found 54 per cent planned to buy a new smartphone this year, with especially high numbers of possible customers in India and China.That is welcome news for a market in which growth in 2016 slowed to 5 per cent from the 14 per cent posted a year before, according to research company Gartner. It also puts pressure on device makers to swim against the tide of what CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood calls the “sea of sameness”. As the Android software operating system underpins 82 per cent of smartphones sold, differentiation is difficult.David Sovie, global managing director for Accenture’s electronics and high-tech business unit, says features such as voice control should help sales. “Growing acceptance of services powered by artificial intelligence, such as voice assistants, is also fuelling this market upswing,” he says.The coming of 5G is likely to be the dominant conference talking point, even though the reality for many people around the world is that such a debate masks a daily struggle to get any sort of connection at all. Telecoms companies have started to discuss solutions, such as flying drones, or helikites, being deployed in remote areas of developed countries to deliver mobile broadband to spots land-based masts cannot reach.£7bnAmount O2 says 5G could add to UK’s economy by 2026It is yet to be seen whether those people who object to brutalist mobile phone masts spoiling the countryside will welcome War of the Worlds-style drones, or if the promise of blanket coverage will be enough to keep complainers quiet.The problem is more acute in the developing world, where connecting the unconnected remains a perennial difficulty. Facebook’s plans to deliver broadband across Africa suffered a setback last year when the SpaceX rocket carrying its $200m satellite exploded on the launch pad. The failure showed that delivering the latest in telecoms infrastructure is both expensive and tricky.Paul Lee, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at professional services provider Deloitte, says: “The world is getting more connected, but there are still billions to connect. Mobile connections are approaching the 5bn mark. So there are still over 2bn to go. There are also varying degrees of quality of connectivity. There are some 200 carriers yet to launch 4G services, but we are likely to see some operators launch 5G services this year.”This is not just a problem in remote places. More than 1m UK homes and businesses have what are deemed to be slow broadband access speeds, while 4G coverage is patchy even in cities. According to data from OpenSignal, a wireless company, the UK, once a pioneer in the mobile industry, now ranks 54th in global rankings of 4G coverage. “There is massive variation in mobile speed,” says Deloitte’s Mr Lee.The GSMA’s Mr Granryd argues that pushing mobile data to more places is the “nuclear reactor” for improving people’s lives. The demand for portable “electronic money” so people can use phones to withdraw or transfer funds, for instance, has strongly taken hold in emerging markets where many have not had access to traditional banks. These have caught up with contactless wave-and-pay technologies available to bank card and phone users in countries such as the US and UK. There are about 500m mobile money users across 93 countries, mostly in Africa and Asia.Christophe Uzureau, vice-president of banking and investment services at Gartner, says mobile finance has evolved rapidly. Different models have emerged but the most advanced, such as Alibaba’s Alipay in China, have added benefits, like assisting Chinese tourists with the processing of international payments. This evolution goes hand-in-hand with improved connectivity.The advent of 5G could accelerate development of digital services. But the GSMA says the industry also has to focus on the provision of more relevant local content if mobile is to blossom. As Mr Granryd points out, only 0.1 per cent of India’s web pages are in Hindi while more than 400m people speak the language. Hauling up masts alone will not be enough to make 5G a global success.
14;IT;Gartner Inc;2017-02-23T05:00:16Z;Smartphones to find their voice again at MWC in Barcelona;Mobile World Congress set to show how voice AI advances will reshape handset design;The mobile industry may have almost lost its voice in recent years, in the age of the data-focused smartphone, but next week’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona could mark a comeback for talking into your telephone.The rise of artificial intelligence, voice recognition and the “personal digital assistant” are expected to dominate the presentations and booths at the world’s largest mobile phone trade show. More than 100,000 people are expected to attend.Future 5G networks, virtual reality and the latest attempts to sell wearable technology as a mainstream product will also be themes.Apple does not present at the show and in the absence of Samsung, which has opted to delay the launch of its Galaxy S8 smartphone after its product safety issues last year, the rest of the industry has a rare opportunity to stand out.The inclusion of voice-activated functions built around Amazon’s Alexa, adopted by Huawei, and Google Assistant, which to date has only appeared in the company’s own Pixel phone, will be highlighted. Sony, which has its own Ear assistant, is also expected to make some noise.Ben Wood, analyst at CCS Insight, said: “Voice, for years, has been deeply unfashionable, but with a number of devices launching at MWC, it will be fashionable again.”Voice activation is not a new innovation, with Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana already vying for attention, and Samsung responding with the acquisition of Viv last year.The voice recognition platforms will reduce dependence on the touchscreen and let users get the information they want without taking the phone out of their pocketWith the advance of voice, smartphone design that was becoming formulaic can be rethought, say analysts.Mr Wood describes a “sea of smartphone sameness” in the sector, where Android-powered handsets have captured virtually all the non-iPhone share. Their uniformity shows a lack of new ideas, beyond increasing the screen size, speeding up the processors and improving the pixel count of the camera lens.Roberta Cozza, from the Gartner research firm, says that digital assistants will mean selling an experience with the device, rather than emphasising the features of the handset. This is more important with the wearable technology boom running out of steam.“Users are getting bored with all this useless data,” she says. “The voice recognition platforms will reduce dependence on the touchscreen and let users get the information they want without taking the phone out of their pocket.”This could pave the way for the abolition of buttons on smartphones in the future, according to Mr Wood, who has predicted that “all-screen” phones will start to gain traction given many consumers predominantly use smartphone and tablets to consume video.“Voice becomes the knobs and buttons of the next generation of devices,” he says.MWC will also see the introduction of “gigabit phones” that can support more virtual reality content and 4K ultra high definition screen resolution. CCS Insight also predicts the rise of 360 degree cameras that can take “surroundees”.One incremental change could be the thinning of the bezel — the border around the smartphone screen — with Xiaomi’s Mi Mix handset perhaps a sign of things to come, in pushing the screen to the very edge of the phone.Network vendors at MWC will see it as an important opportunity to set out their stall for a 5G future.Ericsson has gone all in on proving its 5G credentials with live demonstrations of hyper-fast data speeds set to take place.Huawei, the Chinese vendor, has been more circumspect and has instead pushed its cloud networking platforms.Rethink Wireless, the research firm, said that approach anchors 5G in the current requirements of operators “not just the 2020 dreams of a few”.The launch of a Samsung Galaxy model at Mobile World Congress is an annual event akin to Barcelona FC’s march through the Champions League around this time of year.Yet, just as the city’s footballers have faltered, down 4-0 to Paris Saint-Germain after the first leg of the latest round, Samsung will not be launching its Galaxy S8, after its disastrous recall of the Galaxy Note 7 last year forced it to delay plans.That leaves the door open for another brand to take centre stage and become the most talked-about handset at the world’s biggest mobile phone show.The Chinese makers have long tried to steal the limelight at Barcelona, with Huawei and ZTE installing booths in the arrivals terminal at the airport in previous years.Xiaomi, once tipped as a challenger to Apple, is skipping the show, but fast-growing Oppo, the largest phonemaker in China, will be out in force to test appetite for its phones.Some familiar names will also appear. Nokia phones will resurface, although under the stewardship of HMD, a Finnish company staffed by ex-Nokians who believe the brand still has legs. The phones will be made by Foxconn in China, however.BlackBerry may have stopped making phones, but a new device with the Qwerty keyboard and rumoured to be called the Mercury will debut. That phone would be made by TCL, a Chinese manufacturer.The absence of Samsung could also encourage second-tier premium brands. Sony, LG and HTC will all look to increase market shares in 2017, with phones designed to attract iPhone and Galaxy consumers looking for something new.
15;IT;Gartner Inc;2017-02-16T15:22:38Z;Lenovo profits fall 67% as mobile and data centres struggle;World’s biggest PC maker has record market share, but faces ‘sizeable’ challenges;Lenovo shares sank almost 7 per cent after the world’s biggest PC maker reported a 67 per cent fall in profits to $98m in the final quarter of 2016.The company, which pulled off one of China’s earliest big overseas acquisitions when it bought IBM’s PC business in 2005, said it faced “sizeable” challenges in its main business lines of data centres, mobile devices and PCs.Worst hit was the mobile division, where it sold just 15m phones in the quarter. Lenovo, which acquired the struggling Motorola handset business from Google for $3bn in 2014, recorded revenues of $2.2bn in the quarter, a year-on-year drop of 23 per cent, compared with industry growth of 7 per cent.Sales of the Moto branded phones were up by a fifth quarter on quarter, lifted by shipments to India and Latin America. Lenovo lost money on every handset sold, with a pre-tax loss margin of 7.1 per cent.Lenovo is among the Chinese handset makers going global. Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner, this week said Lenovo and brands such as Oppo, BBK, Huawei, ZTE and Xiaomi “are aggressively expanding into markets outside China, where they will continue to disrupt the top smartphone players in 2017”.Overall profits fell well short of the consensus of $145.9m forecast by analysts, according to Bloomberg. Last year, the group unveiled its first loss in six years — $128m in its fiscal year to the end of March.Undeterred, Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo chairman and chief executive, put a positive spin on the latest numbers.“Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and the two new businesses still in transition, Lenovo delivered a solid performance last quarter,” he said.“Our PC business remains strong, our mobile business has made steady progress, and our data centre business now has a clear improvement plan in place. Although it takes time to build the core competence in these two new growth engines, we are confident to achieve break-even and profitable growth in them.”The PC business outperformed the industry, with revenue growth at 2 per cent year-on-year, giving Lenovo a record global market share of 22.4 per cent.The group is still trying to turn around its data centre business, which includes storage and software, and which saw sales drop 20 per cent to $1.1bn. Sales were up slightly on a quarterly basis, led by a 27 per cent jump in North America and a 10 per cent gain in Latin America.Lenovo, which has headquarters in Beijing and North Carolina, saw its shares close 6.7 per cent lower on the news on its main listing in Hong Kong.
16;IT;Gartner Inc;2016-11-17T09:30:36Z;Samsung smartphone sales slide after Note 7 fiasco;;Samsung suffered its worst ever decline in smartphone sales in the third quarter, after the disastrous launch of its Note 7 phablet saw it lose almost a fifth of its market share, according to industry research firm Gartner.The Korean group’s share of global smartphone sales fell to 19.2 per cent in the third quarter, compared to 23.6 per cent in the same period last year.Sales declined 14.2 per cent year on year, the biggest decline on record.Samsung was forced to pull the plug on its flagship premium phone in October, after a series of fires caused by overheating batteries forced it to recall the phones twice.Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner, said:The decision to withdraw the Galaxy Note 7 was correct, but the damage to Samsung’s brand will make it harder for the company to increase its smartphone sales in the short term.Apple, the second largest maker of smartphones behind Samsung, did not benefit from its rival’s woes, however, as its sales and market share continued to fall.Chinese groups were the only major smartphone vendors to increase sales in the period, with Huawei, Oppo and BBK Communication Equipment all gaining market share. Huawei’s quest to overtake Apple in global sales gathered pace, with the gap beteween the two companies closing to less than 3 per cent.Slowing growth in the smartphone market is putting extra pressure on developers as competition grows. Global smartphone sales were 5.4 per cent higher than the third quarter of last year, compared to annual growth of more than 14 per cent in 2015. Growth is forecast to slow down even further over the rest of the decade, to as low as 3.8 per cent by 2020.
17;IT;Gartner Inc;2016-09-14T11:25:19Z;Amazon launches AI speaker Echo in UK & Germany;;Amazon has announced the launch of its artificially intelligent speaker, the Echo, for £149 in the UK and Germany from this autumn.The cylindrical speaker can perform tasks including ordering food online via JustEat, playing music through Spotify or ordering minicabs on Uber, based on vocal commands, writes Madhumita Murgia, European Technology correspondent.The retailer will also launch a smaller £49 version called the Echo Dot, both in the US and Europe, that can connect to your own speakers via Bluetooth.Amazon executives have said they believe the next big computing platform will be voice-powered. Launched in late 2014, Alexa has about 3,000* different “skills” powered by third parties, such as Google-owned thermostat maker Nest and music streamer Spotify.The algorithms behind Alexa have been developed by labs in Cambridge, UK, Germany and Poland according to David Limp, senior vice president of devices at Amazon.Although Amazon has not disclosed sales numbers, analysts at Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimate it has sold about 3m Echo devices. Over the summer, the Echo and Dot devices have been frequently on back-order, suggesting Amazon is having trouble keeping up with demand.In the UK, about 9 per cent of households have some sort of home automation solution, according to a Gartner consumer survey.“We’d expect that a product such as the Echo will help move the home automation market [in the UK] forward as it makes the usage more intuitive,” said Jessica Ekholm, Gartner’s research director of personal digital services and connected home products.“Why use an app to control your home when you can just speak softly to it?”Image courtesy of Amazon*This report has been amended to indicate Alexa has 3,000 skills, not 300.
18;IT;Gartner Inc;2016-09-07T23:30:58Z;Sony announces two new PlayStation 4 models;;Sony’s PlayStation revealed its future plans for the PS4, the fastest-selling console in PlayStation history and Sony’s shining hope for bolstering profits this year.The Japanese giant announced two new gaming consoles: a slimmer $299 PS4 and a high-end $349 PlayStation Pro, marking the first time in the history of PlayStation that a higher-end system was introduced in the middle of the platform’s lifecycle, writes Madhumita Murgia, FT European tech correspondent.The Pro comes with an upgraded graphics chip that doubles its graphics power, 1TB storage and support for 4K video and the PlayStation VR. It will also host new Netflix and YouTube apps that allow streaming of 4K and HDR content.The three-year-old PS4 has already crossed 43m in console sales, which is roughly double sales of Microsoft’s Xbox One, according to Gartner analysts. A 15 per cent increase in sales during the first quarter of 2016 boosted Sony’s quarterly performance to a surprise profit of ¥21.2bn, despite analysts predicting a loss of ¥39bn.The new model, along with the cheaper new PS4, will aim to generate further revenue from games and subscription sales. The company predicts it will sell 20m PS4 units by the end of its financial year.Andrew House, president and global CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, said:By accelerating the innovation cadence at PlayStation, we’re introducing choice in the marketplace, enabling gamers to choose the PS4 model that meets their needs.Sony’s takeover of the living room will continue with the launch of the new Playstation VR next month, along with a suite of new games. According to Sony’s chief executive Kaz Hirai, most of the games for PS VR at launch were specifically created for VR: “It could be the same franchise and have the same title but it’s not a remake of a game done for PS4 for example”, he told the Financial Times earlier this month. “It’s built from the ground up.”
19;IT;Gartner Inc;2016-08-18T07:43:35Z;Samsung stretches smartphone lead over Apple in Q2;iPhone maker and Xiaomi lose ground in key Chinese market;Apple and Xiaomi have lost further ground in the fiercely competitive smartphone market, according to quarterly sales figures, with lesser known Chinese brands stealing a march on the former industry stars.The leader Samsung has also stretched its advantage over Apple, selling 32m more smartphones than the iPhone maker in the second quarter compared with 24m more than Apple a year earlier, according to worldwide second-quarter sales figures for smartphone makers from Gartner, the research firm. They show those for the iPhone fell for a third consecutive period. They dropped 7.7 per cent to 44.4m units from 48m in the same three months in 2015.Apple enjoyed a strong quarter in Eurasia, Africa and eastern Europe, but that was offset by a 26 per cent drop in sales in China, which has been the company’s growth engine, and other mature Asian markets.Xiaomi’s worldwide sales edged slightly higher during the period, but its market share dropped two percentage points to 4.5 per cent as it fell further behind larger rival Huawei and was overtaken by Oppo, another Chinese competitor. Gartner said that Xiaomi, which has long been tipped as a challenger to more established brands, has felt the pressure in markets including India, and has lost ground in the race to launch eye-catching new products this year.Figures from IDC, a rival research company, released this week showed Xiaomi’s shipments fell 38 per cent in China, its home market, to 10.5m during the quarter. IDC cited competition from Oppo, which launched a fast-charging phone, and Huawei, which has built Leica lenses into its premium models, for the decline although sources within the Chinese market disputed the IDC numbers.Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner, said the second quarter could prove to be a nadir for the iPhone, with many consumers delaying a new purchase until the launch of the latest version later this year. She added that Apple had made inroads into the corporate market with its iPhone SE model, which has provided a lower cost alternative to BlackBerry and Windows phones than the higher end iPhone models.That was clear in shipments of smartphones as measured by operating system during the quarter, with BlackBerry and Microsoft‘s Windows, which once dominated the enterprise market between them, scraping a combined market share of less than 1 per cent.Less than 2m phones built on Windows software and 400,000 BlackBerry phones were sold during the second quarter, according to Gartner. Android, Google’s operating system, took a market share of more than 86 per cent in contrast, with almost 300m handsets sold during the quarter.Overall sales of smartphones to end users hit 344m in the three-month period, up 4.3 per cent year on year, with Samsung and Huawei growing fast and lesser known brand Oppo surging into the top five, after its sales grew to 18.5m from 8m.A 14 per cent drop in sales of feature phones — basic handsets — dragged the overall mobile phone market down 0.5 per cent.
20;IT;Gartner Inc;2016-07-25T16:01:05Z;Virtual reality start-up goes from Liverpool to Silicon Valley;A meetings app from vTime demonstrates the technology’s potential for social interaction;"Most enthusiasts for virtual reality, me included, believe 2017 is going to be the year the technology moves from its extended fanfare to becoming a significant part of people’s lives. Most VR supporters similarly believe, as does Mark Zuckerberg, who bought the Oculus company in 2014, that social interaction in virtual reality will be the leading use that VR is put to, ahead of gaming, entertainment and education.But most are still hazy as to how socialising in virtual reality might work.A compelling answer is to be found in Liverpool, on the top two floors of a former tea warehouse in Toxteth, right across the road from the sadly defunct Cain’s brewery, which provided virtual reality of a different kind for generations of Scousers.If the idea of one of the standard bearers of the coming VR revolution being from Liverpool 8 rather than Palo Alto sounds like the stuff of local authority public relations blah, consider this: in May, the company, vTime (“The VR Sociable Network”), was named by Gartner, the analyst, as one of four 2016 “Cool Vendors in Consumer Mobile” — an accolade often given to start-ups on the brink of the big time.Former Gartner Cool Vendor winners have been Airbnb, Instagram and Dropbox, and between 60 and 80 per cent of Cool Vendors go on to become acquired. In vTime’s citation, Gartner said: “Virtual reality and its immersive experiences are one of the hottest technology topics in 2016, and socialising using VR is in its starting block.”VTime was founded in 2013 by games industry veteran Martin Kenwright, and funded to the tune of some $5m to date from the sale proceeds of a previous business, Evolution Studios, to Sony. Mr Kenwright started out from his bedroom in a council house in Runcorn, and founded Evolution on a converted pig farm.The app offers social interaction in VR, from family get-togethers to romantic one-on-ones to business meetings. They are even working with the NHS to “change the face of engagement” — the VR doctor’s appointment may be close, with all the savings in effort and money that could allow.The system does not require any equipment beyond a smartphone with a data connection, a simple VR headset such as a £5 Google Cardboard and the free vTime app.You can choose a variety of virtual settings for meetings — round a boardroom table, round a camp fire, on a mountain top, in a Roman city, a sports bar, and so on.So far so good, but what does the vTime you look like? Here’s the thing that can be hard to get your head around. You build, in the vTime app, a Pixar-like, animated avatar of yourself. Neither the software nor hardware currently available could make a convincing photo-real, expressive you.And until you’ve tried it, it’s fair to say having your avatar self meet your friends’ or colleagues’ avatars in a CGI ancient Pompeii seems hopelessly lacking in emotional worth.Yet in practice, it’s bizarrely human and realistic — so much so that not only does conversation quickly become lifelike and unselfconscious, but the real world seems a little colourless and flat when you “come out of VR” — a phrase that I suspect will become common in the near future.“We’re continually asked, can I take a picture of my face and put it on my avatar?” vTime’s chief marketing officer Julian Price explained in a (real-life) meeting in the Liverpool HQ — shortly before flying to San Francisco to open a vTime office on Market Street, in the heart of the tech action.“The answer is, if you put a super-real-looking avatar into a stylised destination, your brain sees there’s something wrong — the effect has been called ‘uncanny valley’. Also, if a real, photographic face doesn’t animate accurately, you get actual nausea and discomfort.”I do see this as the end of the information age and the start of the experience ageBut isn’t a vTime meeting just a glorified — or perhaps not so glorified, given the avatar issue — video conference call?“With FaceTime or Skype,” says Mr Price, “you’re looking through a window into someone else’s world. With vTime, after a couple of minutes, say, in the boardroom, talking, you’re actually in the same destination together.”“It’s experiential, and it has a completely different quality. It’s teleporting you to place you’ve never been, and it creates a sense of presence we don’t think anyone else has come close to.” Elements such as seeing your breath in a cold location or hearing 360-degree sound effects make it like being drawn into a “personal Pixar film”, he says.Being a new form of social media still relatively short of users, random groupings of people on vTime are common.“We had a real example of a group chatting around a virtual camp fire that included a Nasa rocket scientist, a nurse in India and a geologist in New Zealand,” says Mr Price. “And a couple in the US have met and got engaged in vTime. They’re hoping we’ll build them a virtual wedding chapel and we’re thinking of it.”Unexpected psychological effects of vTime meetings are accumulating. Users report finding it exceedingly hard to lie, when looking even into someone’s simulated eyes. The simulated location chosen for a meeting also affects the way people behave — they speak more intimately in a bar than in a boardroom.A team in Liverpool monitors proceedings 24/7 for the inevitable obscenity and other misbehaviour problems. “We’re very strict, we police it and we have zero tolerance,” says Mr Kenwright. “We operate like Facebook, so users have to be real people, with real names.”The proof of the pudding is in the traction vTime is achieving. The app, launched in December, has been downloaded a third of a million times in 191 countries, with 75 per cent in the US. There are already, says the company, “hundreds of thousands of active users” which is, for any online company, the key metric, and the one they keep to themselves.No wonder, as Mr Kenwright claims, vTime is well-known to Silicon Valley and his company is co-operating at a high level with several of the behemoths there, although he does not want to make public the details at the moment.It is not unlikely, he hints, that the California-Merseyside connection may turn out fruitful in the next few months.“I’m taking a punt here with putting so much of my own money into social VR,” he explains. “But I do see this as the end of the information age and the start of the experience age.”“The thinking from the beginning was, let’s disrupt a trillion-dollar industry, and let’s do it in the most deprived part of Liverpool and give something back to where I grew up. And we’ve come so far, it’s really Twitter or bust for me.”jonathan.margolis@ft.com

21;IT;Gartner Inc;2016-07-07T07:19:09Z;Gartner warns of Brexit blow to UK tech spending;Discretionary outlays to fall as much as 5 per cent as pound slides and prices rise;The collapsing pound and uncertainty surrounding Brexit are set to wipe as much as 5 per cent off previously expected spending on technology in the UK this year, Gartner has warned.The projected decline will come as both consumers and businesses delay buying items such as new smartphones, PCs and tablets as they become more cautious and find their overall spending squeezed by sharply rising prices on imports, the tech research group said.Along with this cut in “discretionary” tech spending, companies are also likely to abandon some of the mergers and acquisitions and strategic expansion plans that normally lead to extra spending on IT, said John-David Lovelock, vice-president of research.Only a day before the Brexit vote, Gartner issued a forecast for 1.7 per cent growth in UK tech spending this year, from last year’s £123.9bn. The UK’s vote to leave the EU will slice 2-5 per cent from that, Mr Lovelock said.Since the year is already half over, that implies a second-half drop of much greater magnitude, though Gartner said different seasonal patterns in various parts of the tech market made it hard to generalise.The expected scale and rapidity of the slump would put it on a par with the 2008-09 financial crisis, when tech spending by UK businesses and the government dropped by 7.7 per cent.But the Brexit collapse looks set to last much longer: the 2016 decline would only reflect the first phase of retrenchment, before the country even triggers the Article 50 that will lead to negotiations with the EU, with highly uncertain consequences for tech demand, said Mr Lovelock.Meanwhile, the plunge in sterling looks likely to feed through quickly into higher prices in British shops. US-based PC maker Dell confirmed an across-the-board price rise to UK retailers this week, following a report in The Register that it had pushed through double-digit increases.The company refused to confirm the scale of the rises but said the move had been forced by sterling’s fall against the dollar, the currency in which its components are priced.Sterling’s decline will also be felt in other technology costs. For instance, companies typically pay an annual maintenance fee that is equal to 20 per cent of the original purchase price of new software. Much of this is priced in dollars, leaving British companies that have not already paid their 2016 fees facing a price increase, said Mr Lovelock.The immediate hit to tech spending does not reflect more intangible factors that will hurt the UK tech sector, such as the impact of the Brexit vote on the most internationally mobile part of the sector’s workforce.Software developers working in the UK and paid in sterling will be drawn by higher salaries elsewhere, particularly if they are not British and worry about their status after the country leaves the EU, Mr Lovelock said.
22;IT;Gartner Inc;2016-06-13T18:10:06Z;Microsoft recruits help in strategy shift;LinkedIn deal an opportunity to propel growing services group;"With its disastrous acquisition of Nokia’s handset division three years ago, Microsoft was looking backwards as it sought to fight an old battle. In reality, it had already lost the smartphone wars to Apple and Google, leaving its Windows operating system out in the cold and leading to the ignominious writedown of the unit last year.Satya Nadella, who became chief executive in the shadow of that deal, is now placing a much bigger bet on what he hopes will be Microsoft’s future: not technology platforms like operating systems and handsets, but the applications and services that run on top of them.The result — the $26.2bn purchase of professional networking site LinkedIn — is by far the biggest acquisition in Microsoft’s history, dwarfing the $8.5bn it paid for Skype five years ago or the $7.3bn for the Nokia assets.Mr Nadella had already revealed a potential appetite for giant deals to make up for lost time, as he tries to accelerate the move from the old world of PC- and server-based software to the new world of cloud computing. A year ago, Microsoft briefly considered a bid for Salesforce.com, the leading seller of cloud-based application software, a deal that would have cost more than $60bn.But while buying LinkedIn reflects the same strategy of using acquisitions to build a faster-growing cloud services company, it was not the deal many financial analysts and technology experts had been expecting.The reaction of Gartner analyst Brian Blau sums up a wider sense of surprise: “Seemingly odd.” A company that makes most of its money from helping recruiters target people to hire is combining with one whose largest business involves creating much of the basic software workers use every day at work.Mr Nadella tells the Financial Times that access to LinkedIn’s data and its 433m individual users, along with their professional connections, will put Microsoft in a position to “reinvent business processes and productivity”.The professional profiles people create on LinkedIn, he suggests, could be fed into other Microsoft services, from Word and PowerPoint to Skype. Microsoft could inject information about users of its Office productivity tools, such as their upcoming meetings or projects they are working on, into a common news feed based on their LinkedIn network and interests. And salespeople who rely on Microsoft software could pull in data from LinkedIn to find out more about potential leads.In terms of finances, at least, Microsoft should be able to take the acquisition in stride. Even after allowing for $46bn of existing debt, the software company still has more than $70.5bn of net cash on its balance sheet. Almost all of its liquid resources are overseas, given the higher taxes it would have to pay if it brought the cash back to the US, and Microsoft said it would borrow the money needed to buy LinkedIn.But Wall Street’s confidence in Microsoft’s ability to pull off a giant acquisition has been hit by recent failures. Besides writing off most of the Nokia acquisition cost, the software company also wrote off the most of the $6.3bn it paid for online advertising company aQuantive nearly a decade ago. The company “has never done well” with large deals, UBS software analyst Brent Thill pointed out in a note to investors. Mr Blau put it more bluntly, calling Microsoft’s acquisition record “terrible”.One question is whether LinkedIn represents as strong a network as Microsoft claims. Used mainly as a site for recruitment, LinkedIn has been trying for years to turn itself into a more active network that users turn to more frequently in their daily jobs.Wake up the users

Offer of $196 a share represents a 50% premium to professional network’s closing price on Friday“There have been signs of slowing growth and engagement,” says Mr Blau. “They’ve been struggling.” He adds, however, that LinkedIn is still “a great brand, and they’re top of what they do. They have the world’s best collection of people at work.”Microsoft’s record in integrating large-scale acquisitions into its own software and services has also been patchy. The acquisition of social network Yammer, for instance — designed to help workers connect more easily with colleagues — has not yielded a breakthrough in the company’s wider set of collaboration tools. Nor has Skype’s internet calling become a key tool in other Microsoft products.“It’s done fine — but I don’t know if they’ve taken it to places Skype wouldn’t have gone to on its own,” says Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC.Perhaps even more significantly, Microsoft will have to prove that it can integrate a large-scale operation into a strong internal culture built around its historic PC software dominance. There could be a “culture clash” between LinkedIn’s younger staff, based in Silicon Valley, and Microsoft’s “grown-up culture” at its headquarters near Seattle, says Mr Thill.To lessen those worries and calm the nerves of LinkedIn’s workers, Mr Nadella says the professional network would continue to be run from its Silicon Valley headquarters. But that, in turn, will make it harder to get the claimed integration benefits from the deal, says Mr Blau.Mr Nadella’s response to such questions: “Of course we’ll learn from the past.”After all the pain from earlier acquisitions, Microsoft investors will certainly be hoping he is right."

25;IT;Gartner Inc;2016-03-28T15:06:20Z;Apple is standing up for its rights, not thwarting the FBI;The company has done the right thing to stress-test these issues in court;"People have long worried about technology invading their lives. The front cover of Newsweek magazine, illustrated by a telephone, camera and tape recorder, once captured those fears, asking: “Is Privacy Dead?” The date: July 1970.Since then, we have seen the mass introduction of personal devices such as laptop computers, smartphones and health monitors. Today, more than 6bn such devices are connected to the internet. According to Gartner, a technology research company, 5.5m are being added each day. Most of them are vulnerable to being hacked by those ingenious or devious enough. We truly live in a golden age of surveillance, in which every step we take and every heart flutter we make can be recorded, for better or worse.Our governments are desperate for us to keep that information secure — but, understandably, they also want selective access to that mass of data when national security demands. The technology companies, which often stand between governments and users, have mostly been happy to comply with lawful requests for such data.Apple’s latest transparency report, covering the first six months of 2015, records that the company received 3,824 requests for device information from US law enforcement authorities. It provided data in 81 per cent of those cases.The company operates a 24-hour hotline to respond to such requests and promptly helped the police investigate the San Bernardino attacks last year when two Islamist terrorists murdered 14 people. But when the FBI later demanded that Apple write special software to help crack a locked iPhone used by one of the killers, the company resisted, claiming this could jeopardise the security of all iPhone users. The FBI accused the company of obstructing its investigation. A heated row has ended up in court.This month, the FBI hit the pause button on those legal proceedings, saying it might have found another way of cracking the iPhone. Nevertheless, the case raises important issues of principle and precedent that resonate in all democratic countries trying to balance the demands of security against the rights of privacy. In spite of the odium heaped upon the company, Apple has done the right thing to stress-test these issues in court.As the Center for Democracy and Technology, a civil rights organisation, has argued in a court submission: “If the government succeeds in this case, the relationship between technology providers and users will be forever altered.”This is not the first time US law enforcement agencies have tried to force Apple to override its security procedures, and on occasion the company has complied. Last year, however, at the invitation of a New York judge, Apple contested such an order in a case involving a drug dealer who subsequently pleaded guilty. In February, that judge ruled in the company’s favour.Even though the New York and San Bernardino cases differ in important respects, the ruling by Judge James Orenstein is worth reading because of the arguments he highlighted.The issue of principle concerns whether a company can be conscripted by the government into taking actions that it believes endanger its users’ rights and its commercial interests. It is one thing to hand over all accessible data upon receipt of a lawful request; it is quite another to be forced to create a backdoor into its own products.Judging there was a significant legal difference between active obstruction and passive refusal, Mr Orenstein ruled: “Apple is not ‘thwarting’ anything — it is merely declining to offer assistance.” The issue of precedent revolves around whether it is appropriate for the government to use the All Writs Act of 1789 to force Apple to comply with its demands, as it has tried to do in both cases. Mr Orenstein concluded it was not, given that Congress had recently rejected legislation granting such powers.The judge called for further debate in Congress between legislators who understood the technological realities of a world that their predecessors could not begin to conceive. “It would betray our constitutional heritage and our people’s claim to democratic governance for a judge to pretend that our Fathers already had that debate, and ended it, in 1789,” he concluded.Mr Orenstein’s ruling is far from the final judgment in the broader debate. The Department of Justice is appealing against his decision. This may all seem a messy process, but it can sometimes prove to be the useful means by which democracies grope towards greater legal clarity.john.thornhill@ft.com"

That figure is expected to double from 2015 levels to 66.71m units in 2017, with smartwatch adoption rising “largely due to Apple popularising wearables as a lifestyle trend,” according to Angela McIntyre, research director at Gartner.The Apple watch, which was introduced only last year, had record sales in the holiday quarter as the company expanded distribution. Some analysts have said the company could unveil the second-generation of the Apple watch at its March event.Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR & Co said that the Apple watch could represent a “pivotal opportunity to diversify beyond core devices” and that “the wearables category potentially has a silver bullet product that can start to move consumers towards this new avenue of technology growth and drive adoption of the Apple watch”.Research from Gartner also offered some hope for wearable cameramaker GoPro — which having misjudged the market with its Hero4 Session camera warned that sales in the fourth quarter would disappoint analysts and that it was axing 7 per cent of its staff.While GoPro faces increasing competition, the company could stand to benefit from sales of bodyworn cameras that are expected to climb from 50,000 units last year to 1.05m units in 2017, according to Gartner.Gartner expects wearable device sales to rise 18.4 per cent year-on-year to 274.6m units in 2016 with revenues of $28.7bn.

Its fourth-quarter results underlined the challenge facing its PC-dependent business, with revenues at the division slipping 1 per cent from a year ago to $8.8bn.With worldwide PC sales declining 8 per cent last year, according to research firm Gartner, Intel is instead tapping demand for chips used in data centres as well as designing chips used as web-based technologies push into cars, manufacturing sector and appliances.Revenue from its data centre division was up 5 per cent to $4.3bn, while revenue at its Internet of Things division strengthened 6 per cent to $625m from a year ago.Intel forecast revenue of $14bn for the current quarter, just shy of the $14.16bn that analysts had expected, according to Bloomberg.Intel shares are down 5 per cent this year, and dropped 3.8 per cent in after hours trading.

Sales over the holiday period failed to revive global PC shipments in the final three months of the year, prompting sales to fall a record 10.6 per cent from the previous year and falling for the fifth consecutive quarter, research firm International Data Corp said on Tuesday.It was the first time since 2008 — around the time when Apple launched the iPhone and smartphone adoption began to rise — that PC shipments fell below 300m units.Gartner, another research group also said on Tuesday that PC shipments fell 8 per cent in 2015 to 288.7m units from the previous year.In fact, Apple was the only PC maker in the top five to see shipments grow in 2015, while Acer reported the biggest decline.This time around shipments were impacted not just by rising competition from smartphones and increasing lifespans of new PCs but also by turmoil in financial markets driven by China and weakness in international currencies.The good news however is that both firms expect things to improve this year. Gartner expects the decline in PC shipments to slow to 1 per cent next year, from the 8 per cent decline clocked in 2015.The analysts at IDC struck a slightly rosier note:PC replacements should pick up again in 2016, particularly later in the year. Commercial adoption of Windows 10 is expected to accelerate, and consumer buying should also stabilize by the second half of the year.Most PC users have delayed an upgrade, but can only maintain this for so long before facing security and performance issues. We continue to believe that a majority of these users will purchase another PC, motivated by new products and attractive pricing.

The bad news is that the reported hybrid is a merger of the businesses of Toshiba and Fujitsu and Sony’s Vaio spin-off, rather than any radical new design.The consolidation of consumer electronics in Japan is a continuing theme as companies struggle against foreign competition in shrinking markets. Third quarter worldwide PC shipments fell nearly 8 per cent year-on-year as a lack of compelling products left people hanging on to their old desktops and laptops. There are no Japanese names left in the top six, where the US and China/Taiwan dominate with Lenovo, HP, Dell, Apple, Acer and Asus respectively. However, in their home market, a Fujitsu-Toshiba-Vaio combination would assemble a leading 33 per cent market share. Then all they would have to do is come up with PCs that people actually want to buy.

While revenues are surging, the tracks of operating losses are heading higher as well.

31;IT;Gartner Inc;2015-11-24T09:46:41Z;Xiaomi launches new phone to counter Huawei challenge;Chinese device maker launches latest flagship model in an effort to revive flagging sales;Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has launched its latest flagship phone, in an effort to revive its dwindling sales momentum and bridge the gap with rival Huawei.The Redmi Note 3, which retails in China for Rmb899 ($140), was the centrepiece of the launch presided over by Lei Jun, Xiaomi chairman. The device has a metallic body and upgraded battery, as well as a fingerprint sensor — a feature that rival Huawei rolled out earlier this year and that Xiaomi has been criticised for omitting from previous models.Aside from the high-tech innovations, the Redmi Note 3 featured another telling feature: packaging designed to better sell in stores. Analysts said that the decision was an important marketing move given that Xiaomi, which formerly relied on ecommerce for virtually all its sales, has become increasingly reliant on offline sales.While ecommerce allowed Xiaomi to save on costs during its start-up period, offline sales have become vital to preserving the technology group’s position in China’s top echelon of smartphone makers.CK Lu, Gartner’s China smartphone expert, estimates that offline retail channels now account for half of Xiaomi’s sales, though the smartphone maker said that its sales were 70 per cent online.“As sales of online channel is hitting ceiling, Xiaomi in the past year has being increasing its push into the retail market,” said Mr Lu.Xiaomi is not focusing on market share as an indicator of success, said Mr Lei at the launch, amid conflicting data about whether Xiaomi has been recently overtaken by Huawei as China’s top seller of smartphones.“It doesn’t matter how much competitors bad-mouth each other,” said Mr Lei. “Under the common joint efforts of all our competitors, we have made Chinese phones the mainstream product in the global market. We’ve all improved together.”Earlier this month, figures from Canalys, the Shanghai-based research group, showed Huawei leading Xiaomi in the Chinese smartphone market. The figures were a reversal from late last year when Xiaomi had briefly taken the number one spot in the hyper-competitive China market.Further data from consultancies IDC and Gartner were inconclusive, with IDC showing Xiaomi ahead in the three months to September with 15.8 per cent market share, while Huawei lagged behind on 15.6 per cent.Gartner, however, had Huawei slightly ahead with 15.6m in sales for the three-month period, compared with 15.1m for Xiaomi.Huawei’s smartphone sales have grown more than 80 per cent year-on-year in China, while by some measures Xiaomi has seen year-on-year declines, according to Canalys. IDC, on the other hand, reported that Xiaomi had year-on-year Chinese smartphone sales growth of 11 per cent in the three months to September.Additional reporting by Ma Fangjing
32;IT;Gartner Inc;2015-09-07T16:58:54Z;Apple: bigger than big;Developing markets other than China may be the way to remain smartphone top dog;"Apple is cursed with making the world’s most successful item of consumer electronics. The iPhone has sold 220m units at $650 apiece over the past year. Nice trick; how on earth to repeat it?It will not be easy. Assume the iPhone replacement cycle is two years, that a cheery 95 per cent of buyers from two years ago recommit to the brand, and that prices are steady. For Apple to hit analysts’ revenue growth targets over the next 12 months, it must sell something like 80m iPhones to first-time customers. That is the population of Germany. This model is crude; it ignores how product releases delay demand (or pull it forward), but it points to the scale of the challenge.This, naturally, makes investors nervous. So does the fact that trends shift rapidly in handsets. BlackBerry’s hardware revenues peaked at $16bn in 2012 and fell to $7bn two years later. So shareholders will be watching closely on Wednesday, when Apple is expected to unveil the latest iteration of the iPhone. At this point in the cycle Apple usually makes improvements rather than a brand new handset. It is placing bets on other devices too, including the watch and a TV box, and experimenting with cars. But it needs to keep growing the iPhone in order to keep its share price up.The meat of recent iPhone growth has come from China. When, in 2011, Apple started splitting out results for “Greater China”, revenues were 9 per cent of the whole. Now they are well over 20 per cent and climbing. Yet there are other big markets. Buried invisibly within the “Europe” line on Apple’s results is India, a market of more than 1bn people.In China, the iPhone accounted for 13.5 per cent of smartphone sales in the first half of the year, according to Gartner. The corresponding statistic in India is 1.8 per cent. Indians favour Samsung and homegrown brands such as Micromax. Persuading more of them to switch would give Apple a bit more diversity to soothe the worrywarts.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

Expertise was developed in response to what the country sees as a growing threat to security but it is increasingly being promoted as an economic opportunity.Total spending on information security worldwide is forecast to grow 8.2 per cent in 2015 to $76.9bn, according to research by Gartner, and a series of high-profile cyber attacks last year, including breaches at Target, JPMorgan and Sony Pictures, pushed cyber security up the corporate agenda.Team 8 said it aimed to act as an “operational think-tank” for companies grappling with the threat from both organised crime and state-backed hackers. A team of researchers, entrepreneurs and others will be on hand to advise on new ventures.Israel’s cyber security sector has been built largely on the back of the military, many of whose graduates move into business after their compulsory military service is over. Israeli companies have been pioneers in areas such as internet firewalls and antivirus software, developed in large part by former soldiers.Israelis who served in Unit 8200 are particularly pervasive in high-tech because of the cutting-edge skills that they learn in the army and the informal networks with fellow soldiers they maintain after leaving.Intelligence is one of the biggest issues for Israel’s security survivability. A lot of intelligence happens in the cyber arenaTeam 8’s founders include Israel Grimberg, another veteran of Unit 8200 who has been active in Israel’s cyber industry, and Liran Grinberg, an entrepreneur who served five years in the intelligence corps.Unit 8200 recruits its soldiers straight from Israeli secondary schools, handpicking students with superior quantitative and problem-solving skills. The unit is so secretive that serving soldiers are forbidden from discussing most aspects of their service, even with family members.A group of dissenting military reservists from 8200 last year provided a partial — and mostly unflattering — glimpse of the unit’s activities, which they said included intrusive surveillance of Palestinians.Mr Zafrir declined to speak about details of his service in 8200. However, he said that members of the IDF’s intelligence units had special expertise in “self-learning and working together on unknown problems”.He added: “Intelligence is one of the biggest issues for Israel’s security survivability.“A lot of intelligence happens in the cyber arena, but I don’t want to go more into that.”We are committed to maintaining Israel’s position as a global cyber power and as such we have to implement a policy that protects cyber spaceTeam 8’s first company will focus on fighting “advanced persistent threats” — attacks targeting the core of an organisation’s network — and be headed by Ofer Israeli, formerly of Check Point, the Tel Aviv-based cyber security company. It hopes its customers will be large companies, including banks, insurers and online retailers.The new “cyber foundry” will face competition from established Israeli cyber security companies such as Check Point — whose headquarters is across the street from Team 8’s Tel Aviv office — or, in the US, big incumbent companies and venture capital funds that work closely with entrepreneurs on cyber start-ups.In Israel, the symbiosis between the state, the military and the private sector in the field of cyber security is perhaps closer than elsewhere.In a speech last year, Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister, said that Iran, Israel’s biggest regional enemy was “first and foremost” behind cyber attacks against it, and that Israel had built an “Iron Dome of cyber security” that parallels the famed missile interceptor’s ability to protect against rockets.“We are committed to maintaining Israel’s position as a global cyber power and as such we have to implement a policy that protects cyber space as an open space and the basis for global growth,” he said.The country is also positioning Beer Sheva, the biggest city in the southern Negev region, as a hub for new cyber companies. Several Israel Defence Forces bases have been moved to the region as part of a larger plan to promote development, and free up real estate in central Israel.Companies and investors are working in Beer Sheva alongside the city’s Ben Gurion University on what the hub’s supporters describe as a unique ecosystem for the industry. EMC and Deutsche Telekom are among the companies that have moved to a business park there.

35;IT;Gartner Inc;2015-01-27T16:49:36Z;The internet of things: expect the spectacular — but just not yet;In the short term at least connected objects will struggle to live up to expectations;By this time next year, we may have become disillusioned with the internet of things. The idea that every object — from toasters to street lights — could be connected to the internet and be communicating with us has been hyped for several years.It reached a peak this month at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where more than 900 companies exhibited connected products. Samsung, makers of products from fridges to phones, said that within five years all of its appliances would be able to connect to the internet.The predictions for the number of objects that will be connected are big — from technology research company Gartner’s forecast of 25bn connected physical objects by 2020 to tech company Cisco’s more bullish 50bn forecast.Cue the ennui. Just as the internet hype of 2000 led to disillusionment, the internet of things will struggle to live up to expectations in the short term.Companies, certainly, remain unconvinced by the business case. A survey by Gartner of 1,500 chief information officers last August found that only 22 per cent had deployed or were experimenting with the internet of things.The remaining 78 per cent either thought it irrelevant or at the too-early stage.One problem is that the technology is still a little expensive, says Maurizio Pilu, partnerships director at Digital Catapult, a UK government organisation that helps support new projects.The price of a simple wireless sensor will soon be as low as £1, a price point at which this could become a mass-market proposition. But other parts of the kit, including communications and battery modules, might still come in at £20 to £40, which, Mr Pilu says, is too high.“It needs to become closer to £3 to £4, [then] the business case begins to make sense,” he says.Telecoms networks have to change to meet the requirements of billions of low-power devices that need to connect constantly to the internet to transmit small amounts of data. The cost of sending such data over the network will have to come down.“It is not scalable for a low-cost device to pay several dollars a month just to have connectivity,” says Zach Shelby, director of technical marketing for the internet of things at Arm, the chip designer.Security will need to be improved to ensure that internet-connected objects cannot be hacked and hijacked. Physical attacks over the internet are happening. At the end of last year the German federal office of information security revealed that machinery at a German steelworks was severely damaged when hackers gained access to control systems via the internet.When everything from traffic lights and cars to home heating systems are linked online, the potential for harmful hacks increases further. However, the simple, low-power devices used for the internet of things might not be able to handle heavy encryption, or may not be patched and updated if a security flaw is discovered.“There are big security holes and quite a lot of work needs to be done to fix them,” says Jim Tully, analyst at Gartner.Interconnectivity of devices is an issue that needs resolving. If your toaster cannot talk to your TV, or if the street lights are not on the same system as the rubbish bins, the networks will be less useful. Persuading all manufacturers to agree looks tricky, as a number of competing industry groups are each pushing their own standard.“Everyone says ‘yes, lets ensure interoperability — as long as it is my version of interoperability’,” says Mr Pilu.The internet of things will raise privacy concerns, as it makes a fresh level of tracking and data collection possible. In the same way that companies and governments can follow what people do online — the websites they visit, what links they click — it will become possible to track almost everything an individual does in the physical world.Companies are interested in the marketing possibilities this presents. Yet public opinion will have to decide whether there should be limits on what can be monitored.While these issues are being resolved, large-scale internet of things projects are rolling out slowly. The projects with the clearest business case have to do with saving money on municipal street lighting and bin collection. General Electric says San Diego will save $254,000 a year by replacing some 3,000 street lamps with an intelligent lighting grid where each individual lamp can be remotely monitored and adjusted. The system makes it easy to pinpoint lamps that need changing and switch off those not in use.Philadelphia, meanwhile, was able to reduce its rubbish collection costs from $2.3m to $720,000 in part by fitting rubbish bins with sensors that were triggered when the container was full, eliminating unnecessary collection trips to half-empty bins.More complex projects are still in a development phase. Milton Keynes in the UK will this year fit parking spots with sensors that tell drivers when the space is free. Mr Pilu, who is helping to launch the project, admits that it will be difficult to measure the return on an investment like this.Medical and research uses are being explored. Research from AT&T, the US telecoms multinational, for example, has partnered with 24eight, which makes pressure sensors that can be embedded into shoe inner soles. They have distributed slippers with an internet-connected chip to elderly people at a care centre in Texas, and are using the foot movement data they receive to diagnose health problems, such as the initial stages of Alzheimer’s disease.“In the early stages of Alzheimer’s you might get up to make a cup of tea but for a moment forget where you were going. That small wandering pattern, which others might not initially notice, could be an early warning sign,” says Mr Tully.He believes some of the “wacky” personal items on display at CES may evolve into industrial-scale applications. Vessyl, a cup that identifies any liquid poured into it, might sound like a toy for those wanting to keep tabs on their drinks intake. But what about applying the concept to a car and monitoring that the right fuel is in the tank?“We will see hundreds of little applications that will be eventually woven together to make a smart city,” says Mr Pilu. “I believe this will develop in an evolutionary way.”But do not expect the internet of things to do spectacular things just yet. For the time being, expect more internet-connected bins and street lighting, while businesses work out just what else these ecosystems can do.
36;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-12-10T14:16:52Z;The future of smartphones is in EM: Gartner;;"How do you like your smartphones and tablets? Light or large? Black or white? For most consumers in emerging markets the question is: cheap or cheaper?This is the market manufacturers should be focusing on, according to a new report by Gartner, a technology research company, which estimates that no less than 78 per cent of global smartphone sales will come from developing economies by 2018.In many emerging markets people generally have one device for all their browsing and messaging needs, while their peers in the western world may own several devices – a tablet for browsing, a notebook for work and a smartphone for selfies.This may be changing: Gartner predicts that by 2018 over half of users will go to a tablet or smartphone first for all online activities, leaving clunky laptops behind.“This behavior will adapt to incorporate wearables as they become widely available for users,” says Van Baker, vice president for research. “As content consumption tasks outweigh content creation tasks, this will further move users away from the PC.”The global smartphone market has been growing rapidly, with shipments up 40 per cent in 2013 to 1bn units worth $266bn, according to CCS Insight, a market research company. But the next wave of growth will come from emerging markets, as the rising middle class slowly shifts from feature phones to their first smartphones.Thanks to the falling cost of devices and of data services in India, for example, vendors shipped some 23.3m smartphones in the third quarter of this year, up from 12.8m in the same period a year earlier, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC).That sounds like good news for smartphone and tablet makers. It’s even better news for manufacturers producing the cheap devices with less impressive specs that are particularly popular in emerging markets.Gartner expects that by 2020, 75 per cent of smartphone buyers will pay less than $100 for a device. Sales of high-end smartphones, it predicts, will stagnate, with replacement phones accounting for a large portion of sales.Karan Thakkar of IDC says: “In emerging markets, there is more demand for value-for-money products. Hence, the average selling price is on the lower side. However, in the developed market the ASPs [average selling prices] are healthy. Mid-range and high end devices form a sizeable chunk.”This affects competition among smartphone manufacturers. Between them, Apple and Samsung captured two thirds of industry revenue in 2013. But in fast-growing emerging markets, low-cost local manufacturers are adding a further layer of competition.This year, Xiaomi became the biggest smartphone vendor in China – a market that accounted for 37 per cent of global shipments in the second quarter of this year, at 108.5m units. Xiaomi took a 14 per cent share of that market, according to data from Canalys, thanks to 240 per cent year-on-year growth.The story is not much different in India. The two charts below, from IDC’s quarterly report on smartphone and tablet sales, include names readers in the west may not recognise. Micromax, Lava, Karbonn and iBall are Indian vendors that have entered the market offering affordable devices to the country’s aspirational middle class.At Karbonn, for instance, more than 85 per cent of shipments in the period were of handsets priced below $100.Thakkar adds: “Local players are increasing their presence quarter on quarter. Marketing budgets and the resource cost add to overall expenses. For international device vendors, such cost are higher than for Indian handset vendors. Plus the margins are a bit lower at Indian handset vendors.”Gartner’s insights may also affect the growth plans of online businesses, from social media platforms to ecommerce sites, all of which must invest in quality apps that run on basic smartphones to grab the large customer base in emerging markets.This could involve developing technology in-house or acquiring small tech groups.In India, for example, Facebook gets around two thirds of its mobile traffic from simple feature phones. It has been investing in developing a user friendly app for this market. For Facebook, the key is allowing users with basic devices to load images easily and allow advertisers to place and target ads on the Facebook app.Back to beyondbricsRelated reading:

37;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-12-10T00:00:03Z;Wearable tech and cars boost demand;App developers hope latest devices will boost demand;“Exciting new experiences, right on your wrist.” That was the promise made by Apple’s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing Philip Schiller at last month’s launch of Watchkit, the software development tool for the forthcoming Apple Watch.Watchkit, said Mr Schiller, will enable developers to build apps that Apple Watch wearers can use to turn off house lights after they have left home, find the latest flight information on their way to the airport or make alternative plans to get there if their train or bus is late. American Airlines has already built an Apple Watch app, as has social-media photo company Instagram.According to a report from Deloitte, downloads of mobile apps to smartphones and tablets are slowing, but the stream of coming devices could trigger a development gold rush, which is likely to kick-start another phase of the app economy’s development.Wearables, such as Apple Watch, the Google Glass headset and fitness-oriented wristbands such as FitBit, which measures exercise, calories used and sleep, are leading the charge, but apps for in-car “infotainment” systems, healthcare monitors and home appliances are not far behind.Such “smart” devices are the fastest-growing element of the “internet of things”, the linking of everyday objects to the internet so they can collect and receive information from other connected devices and web-based services.The numbers of interconnected items — excluding PCs, tablets and smartphones — are forecast by IT market research firm Gartner to swell to 26bn units in 2020, from 900m in 2009.It is thanks to apps that devices are able to collect and convey information about their usage, current state and immediate environment, as well as receive instructions and updates remotely from their manufacturers.Today, most devices come preloaded with apps that help users make the most of the features and functions their phones or tablets offer, although an increasing number can be supplemented with extras from third-party developers available on app stores.A proliferation of apps could signal problems ahead, warns Andy Hobs­bawm, co-founder and chief marketing officer of Evrythng, a British start-up. If every device comes with its own app, he explains, each interaction that customers have with it takes place within a silo. Setting the mood for a dinner party in a “connected home” — dimming lights, selecting music, warming the oven and setting the thermostat — could be a multi-app, multi-step process.Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research agrees, noting that individual apps running on individual smart products, create “walled gardens” for users that it is hard to add services to.Mr Hobsbawm comments: “Market fragmentation before consolidation is probably unavoidable, but a consumer backlash against millions of discrete apps seems inevitable.”Mr Gillett says that integration platforms such as Android Auto, Apple’s HomeKit framework and Samsung’s SmartThings, signal another approach, one that recognises the need to let customers add or integrate other devices, apps or services to items they already own, rather than forcing people to buy brand-new products.Industry insiders say that cloud-based services are needed that can connect the apps running on multiple devices, al­lowing users to share data and providing a central point from which to manage individual privacy settings and information access.In this scenario, smart products themselves connect with each other to deliver easier interconnectivity. A washing machine may well come with its own app, for example, but it might plug in to a cloud-based integration platform in order to be able to communicate with a smartphone-based home management app such as Apple HomeKit, with product support services from retailers such as Tesco or Target, and with other in-house appliances.In some cases, these interactions might be automated, without a person needing to use an app at all. In June, for example, home monitoring specialist Nest announced that it was working with carmaker Mercedes-Benz on a software integration project. As a commuter drives home from work, at a certain point in the journey the central heating or air-conditioning in their home can be switched on automatically by their in-car system, guaranteeing a warm (or cool) house on their arrival.Evrythng already provides this kind of integration platform to clients that include drinks manufacturer Diageo and consumer goods provider Unilever.

They were trading up 13.17 per cent at 371.75p in early afternoon trading in London.WANdisco’s technology makes it possible to ask complex queries of this data and get answers very quickly, rather than doing more traditional, slower analysts. It has invested heavily in technology that harnesses the power of multiple computers in the cloud to let data to be stored and updated almost instantly from many locations, as well as crunched with clever algorithms.The deal with Capital One marks the company’s first foray into the financial services sector. It said the deal will bring in $250,000 a year, covering 30m bank customers and billions of transactions across credit cards, ATMs and mobile phones.However, the company still makes most of its money from storage and collaboration services, but has struggled to sell its more exciting analytics product to clients, despite conducting pilot trials with customers including British Gas and University of California Irvine.David Richards, chief executive, said the contract represented a new phase of moving from trials to full-blown implementations, adding the coming months were likely to bring in several more.The market for “big data” and analytics was worth about $14.4bn in 2013, according to research group Gartner and is expected to grow as companies try to get a competitive edge by using digital technology to better understand their customers, businesses and markets.Hortonworks, a major supplier of the open-source database technology known as “Hadoop”, recently filed for an initial public offering at an expected valuation of more than $1bn. It has a partnership with WANdisco that lets the UK company cross-sell products.More than three quarters of chief information officers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa said they were shifting their focus to predictive analytics and actively experimenting with their own data, according to a recent survey by research group Gartner.Aside from the risk aversion of industries such as financial services, one of the problems is that executives are unsure what to do with the masses of information they are collecting, analysts say. Companies such as Fusionex, another Aim-quoted stock, are looking to address this issue by creating intuitive products for visualising data.

An ereader version of the paper is already available on Kindle devices.The new offering aims to expand the Post’s national and international audience at a time when it, like other newspapers, is shedding print subscribers and print advertising revenues as readers shift to digital editions. The app will initially carry sponsorship from Sprint and Ford’s Lincoln marque.“With 42m monthly readers and growing this is another step forward in our effort to serve an even larger national and global audience,” said Fred Ryan, publisher of the Washington Post.Mr Ryan, whom Mr Bezos tapped in September, was a founder of the digital news site Politico. At the time, he told the FT he intended to “use the opportunities that technology presents to expand our reach.”Just how big a boost the paper will get is unclear, however. Amazon does not release sales data for Fire devices, but Post executives said the app would reach “tens of millions of people.” Apple’s iPad is used by more than half of US tablet owners, according to eMarketer, so the Fire is battling several other Android tablets for the remaining minority of the market.Overall tablet sales in the US have been stalling, with units sold up just 1 per cent in the year through November 1, according to consumer research group NPD. Gartner predicts that tablets will represent less than 10 per cent of all device sales (including PCs and mobiles) this year.For Amazon, the initial exclusivity of Post content may be appealing to consumers looking to choose a tablet. However, the app will be available for purchase on Apple and Android devices next year.The app will be free to Fire customers for the next six months. It will come pre-loaded on new Fire devices and will be available as a software update for existing owners. Following the initial free period, it will cost $1 for another six months. After that it will cost $3.99 a month.Mr Bezos has been channelling money into the Post since he bought it for $250m in 2013. More than 100 people have been hired in the newsroom – some to replace those who have left – and the paper has been expanding its digital and international initiatives.
40;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-11-10T20:01:11Z;Opinion divided over consulting firms’ dedicated online teams;Some companies see ‘digital’ units as innovative, others dismiss them as marketing hype with little strategic value;As companies feel the impact of digital developments on their brands, consulting firms are forming internal teams or acquiring young specialist businesses to create dedicated online units.Firms need significant alliances, says Paul Connolly, director of the Management Consultancies Association Think Tank, particularly with technology, social media or digital companies.“They don’t wear a collar and tie, appear corporate or look at home in a consulting firm,” he says. “They are a bit different and don’t necessarily fit a standardised corporate mould. They think differently and have different perspectives.”It is a question of translating “the radical implications of something potentially amorphous and intangible that is only recognisable by its works”, Mr Connolly adds. “They can turn it into financial, recruitment or business model implications that the captains of industry can get their heads around. There is a continuing role for those with a respectable, high brand value.”Deloitte Digital was set up in April, 2014. It brought together people from across the firm, including experts in design and art.“The digital arm of an organisation needs to speak with a different voice, to address the changing online world,” says Royston Seaward, a partner at Deloitte Digital. “The idea is not to move away from ‘Deloitte’, but rather to establish a slightly different brand and team that is associated with an edgy, innovative way of working.”However, Pat Sullivan, research vice-president at Gartner, the analysts, is sceptical about the rebranding efforts of many firms. “Repositioning is easy from a marketing perspective,” he says. “They can aggregate and combine businesses and put on the ‘digital’ label, but they are not changing what they do, how they do it or their business model. It really is marketing hype right now, rather than a reality of fundamentally changing things.”We think ‘digital’ is pervasive, so why separate it from the rest of the firm?Other firms are making no specific response or changes, asserting that digital has never been a separate issue and has always been central to all their work. “We think ‘digital’ is pervasive, so why separate it from the rest of the firm?” says John Levell, EY’s UK and Ireland head of digital.“It is easy to get distracted by attractive digital ‘packaging’ of a standalone function,” he says. “But putting a team into a little box on its own can make it more difficult to take a properly holistic perspective when it comes to delivering sustainable outcomes for clients. Our values and culture already sustain a high level of diversity and skills, which really supports the creativity and innovation that digital requires.”Digital certainly requires a wider range of skills than firms have traditionally had available internally, hence the move to acquire some of the younger, more nimble companies specialising in tech and media.Donald Shields, head of digital transformation at Cognizant in the UK, explains that the online challenge was originally seen as an add-on to existing brand communications, so working with a small digital agency was all that was required.Consumer behaviour, however, has since been totally transformed by the online world, so the digital strategy of a business is often fundamental to its overall strategy and goals. “With this increased significance, companies now need partners that can provide more than the traditional consulting services,” he says. “They must offer a wide breadth of digital expertise to help them truly integrate digital with the rest of the business.”The disruptive nature of digital could still have an impact on branding. With a move from advice to providing fully operational specific solutions, new business models will be required. This includes working with clients under different names to produce narrow industry-specific solutions. One example is Accenture setting up Taleris, a joint venture with GE Aviation to help airlines and cargo carriers increase efficiency through data analysis and optimisation.Mr Connolly says digital is a “known unknown” for many clients, which will continue for some time to choose trusted advisory brands to disentangle and demystify it for them.“Members are radical about digital,” he says. “In terms of scale and impact, more than 60 per cent say it is comparable with the industrial revolution.”——————————————-Disruptive technology lies behind growthDigital and technology services increased their share of consulting revenues in the UK by 6 per cent in 2013 and now account for a quarter of income, according to the Management Consultancies Association.While previous growth reflected broader technology trends, this is coming from disruptive technologies, such as social media, the cloud, analytics, mobility and 3D printing.“Digital can be harnessed to create value, but this requires a level of imagination and creativity,” says Alwin Magimay, partner and head of digital and analytics at KPMG.“Successful consulting companies will focus on the network and ecosystem of innovation and start-ups.“The pace of change is accelerating, but there is still some way to go [for digital].”
41;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-11-07T16:29:55Z;Making money in an age of machines;Robots are increasingly performing tasks once done by humans;"When I was a teenager I worked as a waitress for a while. When I wasn’t doing that I was counting quarters in a casino in Miami, working in a bookshop (the only job from which I have, so far, ever been fired) or pulling pints in what was then a relatively low-grade pub on Ledbury Road in west London.That makes me one of millions. One in eight Americans has at some point worked in McDonald's and pretty much every member of my generation has experience of waiting tables. That was our introduction to the world of work. But here’s an odd thing: taking beer orders shouted across a damp bar on a Saturday night might be an experience our children never have. Why? Because those kinds of jobs are being automated.A few weeks ago McDonald's announced new technology “to make it easier for customers to order and pay for food digitally and to give people the ability to customize their orders”. Think mobile ordering and self-ordering kiosks. Chili’s Bar & Grill is starting a tablet ordering system and Applebee’s is doing the same in 2,000 of its restaurants. In China a fully robot-staffed restaurant (yes, they cook too) has been running for a few years. There’ll be no real people left behind any fast food counters in 15 years.This is partly about cutting the cost of labour. The clamour for higher minimum wages is rising (it has just gone to $15 an hour in San Francisco) and savvy employers know that even without legislation, wages won’t stay static in the west for ever. Wage growth might be sluggish here, but in the US worker compensation was up by an annualised 2.2 per cent in the third quarter.It’s not just about nasty capitalists trying to avoid paying a living wage: ordering via machine is quicker and better. Robots don’t get sick, get pregnant, ask for more money, argue about repetitive tasks, or fall in love with their co-workers. They might also be better sales people than people. Are you more likely to sign up to a loyalty programme on an iPad in your hand while you wait for an order, or on a form shoved at you by a harassed teenager at the counter?Nor is it just about restaurants. According to research company Gartner, one in three jobs will be replaced by some kind of software, robot or smart machine by 2025. Visit a factory today and you can see how. I went to a sawmill last year. From the second the logs rolled off the lorry the only human interaction came via a computer control room. They were sized, sorted and cut on orders from a software system. Amazing.Technological change is at the intersection of employment, nominal economic growth and inflation risk – the focus areas of global policy makersRobots are already cleaning hospitals, vacuuming the houses of people slightly richer than you; picking strawberries in Japan (with a camera that analyses ripeness). But this also isn’t just about boring jobs. Take what you can when you can, said one strategist to me a few days ago when I was wondering whether to write more or not. “Give it a decade and both our jobs will be being done by a machine.” Far fetched? Not really. Futurist Ray Kurzwell reckons that by 2020, computer processing power will have reached the level of a human brain. Middle-aged bankers might want to look back to their first graduate job: how much of it is automated now? A third? We don’t need junior number crunchers any more.It’s the same in journalism. I had two assistants when I first started out as an editor. Now I have an iPad. I miss the girls. But there it is. The same goes for train drivers: I was mildly surprised to see last month that the trains at the Tokyo Disney Resort have no drivers, but run very smoothly. We also don’t need so many cameramen or pilots – aerial footage of everything from war zones to farmland comes from drones. And what of nurses? If remote devices can monitor patients with heart disease and diabetes and infrared light can guide robots to the right veins to take blood from, we don’t need so many of them either. The same goes for surgeons.Do we need to worry? A little. This kind of change is very deflationary and our radicalised central bankers can’t cope with that. It’s also bad for people with the wrong skills. If robots can do everything simple, being good at simple things is useless (see Race Against The Machine by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee for more on this).But we shouldn’t be hysterical either. Creative and innovative people will do well and there’ll still be plenty of jobs in newish service areas. Think one-on-one full time help for the elderly (of whom there’ll be many more). Robopets aside, companionship will remain a human function. So will gardening, fixing old cars, decorating and plumbing. At the same time, with labour costs no longer a big deal, we can expect reshoring to accelerate, which will bring some employment with it.And all these machines will need designing, building and controlling. Let’s not forget the internet as we know it is only 20-odd years old. Imagine trying to explain to an agricultural labourer in 1930 that his grandchildren would be making £100,000 a year each as computer programmers.So what should you do? Bring up creative children; give them something to differentiate them from machines. Second, think about investing. Getting into robotics isn’t easy. In their soon-to-be-released book Fast Forward, Jim Mellon and Al Chalabi run through some of the innovators in the sector: Kuka AG, the world’s biggest player in industrial robots and US-listed Intuitive Surgical and Hansen Medical, both of which work in robotic surgery, are obvious places to start.So what should you do? Bring up creative children; give them something to differentiate them from machines. Second, think about investingBut many of the best companies are privately held and clear winners haven’t yet emerged. With that in mind you could look at a newish exchange-traded fund listed in the US – the Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF. It isn’t at all cheap by ETF standards – the ongoing charges are 0.95 per cent but at the moment, there isn’t much competition.This also seems a good time to point you in the direction of the new (to the UK at least) Guinness Global Innovators Fund. This is cheaper (an introductory management fee of 0.25 per cent) and invests in companies positioned to benefit from innovation in all areas. It clearly isn’t specifically about automation but it is hard to see how any company wanting to drive growth via innovation these days can do so without using technology.Finally, a note on communication: not all technology works perfectly and I have had some trouble with my FT email address.

42;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-10-21T20:00:24Z;Internet of things is ready to deliver;Wearables will refine the technology further;Imagine products en route from manufacturer to customer, shuttling between warehouses and trucks, all the time chattering away, conveying information about their location and status via a vast network of smart sensors and readers.This is not a utopian vision, but the way things are at some technologically advanced companies.Rob Carter, chief information officer at US shipping group FedEx, comments that the internet of things “isn’t some bright line we’ll cross one day”. It has already arrived.As far back as 1979, FedEx founder and chief executive officer Fred Smith expressed the idea that “the information about the package is as important as the package itself”.FedEx parcels, for example, are labelled so that, when scanned, they convey information about where they are from, where they are going and the route they will take.Delivery staff, meanwhile, are armed with handheld devices that capture the customer’s signature on the doorstep. All that information is stored digitally.“It’s important to put the maturity of the internet of things into perspective,” agrees Michael Burkett, an analyst at Gartner, the technology market research firm.He says some aspects are more mature, such as commercial telematics systems used in trucking fleets. These integrate computer programs with telecommunications.Others, such as smart fabrics that use sensors in clothing and industrial fabrics to monitor human health or manufacturing processes, are just emerging.Mr Burkett also believes that an imminent explosion in the number of intelligent devices available is set to make supply chains smarter than ever.The internet of things, he reckons, is forecast to reach 26bn installed units by 2020, up from 900m five years ago.That has significant implications, he says, for “the information available to supply chain leaders and how the supply chain operates”.Emile Naus, former head of logistics strategy at Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer, and now partner and technical director at LCP Consulting, a specialist supply chain strategy firm, speaks of a big opportunity for companies “to create better supply chains and, in the process, build more certainty into those supply chains”.The kind of certainty created by sensors and live tracking, he says, could enable companies to offer guaranteed delivery times and run fewer trucks on less circuitous, fuel-intensive routes.It is not just information about the location of physical assets that will boost supply-chain visibility. Data about their condition and state will be important, too, says Mr Naus. “I see this particularly with food products, with perishable goods. If you can track the temperature they are kept at throughout the supply chain, you have a better chance of extending shelf-life and reducing waste.”Paul Clarke, chief technology officer at Ocado, a UK online grocery retailer, says the internet of things is about people too. Human intervention will always be necessary to deal with supply-chain deviations and exceptions, he says, which is where wearable technologies come in.Devices such as smart watches or Google Glass-style headsets could be valuable for Ocado’s warehouse and transport staff. “There is massive potential here for getting vital information to them regarding orders and deliveries in the most immediate, convenient and safest ways,” Mr Clarke says. The company’s technology staff are already experimenting to identify the best uses for such technology in its supply chain.“Supply chain leaders must design their processes to operate in a digital business world,” says Gartner’s Mr Burkett. “They must fulfil customers’ new expectations and the volatile demands digital marketing will create.”Supply chains must meet those expectations by converging people, business and things and “incorporating fast-emerging capabilities such as internet of things technology and smart machines into this design strategy”, he says.
43;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-10-21T17:00:54Z;Google leaps into new virtual reality;Technology group leads $542m investment in Magic Leap;A group of investors led by Google has ploughed $542m into an ambitious private company that claims to have invented a new form of virtual reality, in the second biggest technology venture capital funding round of the year after Uber raised $1.2bn in June.The investment in Florida-based Magic Leap comes as Facebook pours hundreds of millions of dollars into Oculus, its own virtual reality acquisition.The race between Google and Facebook to find ways to catapult users into an alternative reality has already drawn thousands of software developers to the field and sparked one of the most intriguing new frontiers in technology, said Brian Blau, analyst at Gartner.But he added that the devices are still at an early stage of development and the breakthrough applications capable of drawing a mass market have yet to be invented.Announcing the financing on Tuesday, Rony Abovitz, Magic Leap’s founder and chief executive, said that his company’s technology goes beyond current conceptions of mobile computing, augmented reality and virtual reality, with a technique it calls “cinematic reality”.The technology overlays graphics on to the real world by projecting an image on to a user’s eyeball, making it a form of semi-immersive augmented reality. The technique echoes the approach Google has already taken with its Glass headset, which also works by overlaying information on to the real world.Facebook has taken a different stance, opting through its $2bn acquisition of Oculus earlier this year for a fully immersive form of virtual reality that completely blocks out the real world. The Magic Leap technology could combine the “immersion of VR alongside the freedom of AR”, said Piers Harding-Rolls, analyst at IHS. “If this is successful, this could widen the appeal of these new platforms and experiences and open up a whole new area of growth.”Google is showing results from heavy investments in areas beyond search, with notable inroads in the mobile, video and display marketsOutlining an ambitious goal for his company, Mr Abovitz said the Magic Leap technology would be used to “communicate, purchase, learn, share and play”. His broad ambitions for the technology to act as the interface for all online activity echo Facebook’s hopes for its own virtual reality headsets.Most analysts, however, argue that it will take many years before immersive technologies such as this are used for a wide range of everyday activities. “I expect games to take the lead in adoption of VR technology, not virtual shopping or virtual tourism as suggested, which may come later but are less compelling,” Mr Harding-Rolls said.Besides Google, which led the fundraising from its own balance sheet rather than through its venture capital arm, other investors included Qualcomm Ventures, Legendary Entertainment, KKR and Paul Allen’s Vulcan Capital, as well as Silicon Valley venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Andreessen Horowitz.Before founding Magic Leap, Mr Abovitz was co-founder and chief technology officer of Mako Surgical, a company that specialised in robotic surgery and surgical implants.

Global PC sales were down 0.5 per cent year on year in the third quarter, according to market research group Gartner.Intel made its debut at New York Fashion Week this year with a high-fashion bracelet containing an embedded chip that it developed along with trendy brand Opening Ceremony. The company also spent $1.5bn on a 20 per cent stake in a major Chinese chipmaker that specialises in making processors for low-cost tablets and phones, one of the faster growing parts of the market.“There’s this explosion of devices that compute and connect to the internet, and our strategy is to participate across this range of devices,” said Stacy Smith, Intel’s chief financial officer.However, its internet of things unit remains far smaller than its core PC business. Sales of IoT devices rose 14 per cent year on year to $530m, while revenue in its PC segment hit $9.2bn, up 9 per cent year on year.To jump-start new and more mobile PC designs, it launched a new chip in the quarter, named Core M, designed for the unusually thin and light computers sometimes known as ultrabook. New products using that chip will be on the market by the end of the month, said Mr Krzanich.Intel has been aiming to sell 40m tablets this year and has already sold 15m, it reported, up from nearly none in past years. Among the buyers of its chips is Samsung, the largest manufacturer of high-end Android phones and tablets.“The strategic importance of these capabilities continues to grow,” said Mr Krzanich.Emerging markets such as China and Latin America have proved weaker than markets like the US, while enterprise sales have been generally stronger than consumer sales, he said.Intel reported third-quarter revenue of $14.6bn, up 8 per cent year on year and slightly above forecasts of $14.45bn. Earnings per share came in at 66 cents, against a forecast of 65 cents. Last quarter it raised its full-year sales forecast to 5 per cent annual growth, up from a flat forecast in April.
45;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-09-19T13:55:41Z;Are social networks an answer to email overload?;Overflowing inboxes can affect productivity as ‘knowledge workers’ spend 28% of their time dealing with messages;"In 2011, Thierry Breton, chief executive at Atos, the information technology services provider, set an ambitious goal for his staff: to give up internal email for good by the end of 2013.Critics said his efforts were doomed to fail – and, to a certain extent, they were right. Atos did not manage to eliminate internal email by the end of last year. But it did cut volumes by 60 per cent.More importantly, the “zero email” initiative has got the company’s 76,000-plus employees working together in more effective ways, according to a June 2014 report on the project by Anthony Bradley and Samantha Searle, analysts at Gartner, the IT market research firm.Overcoming big barriers to change sometimes requires drastic actions, they say. Despite the Atos campaign’s controversial name, eliminating internal email was never the real goal. That, say Mr Bradley and Ms Searle, was to “move collaboration activities out of email and into a more suitable environment”.In that sense, “zero email” has been a resounding success. As well as the reduction in internal email traffic, Atos now has more than 74,000 staff registered on the social networking platform it owns, blueKiwi. Every month, they create around 300,000 posts on the internal site and view almost 2m pages.But why does this represent an improvement – and what is the big problem with email, anyway?According to analysts at strategy house McKinsey, it is partly a matter of productivity. In a 2012 research study, they found that the average “knowledge worker” spends an estimated 28 per cent of the working week reading and responding to email and almost 20 per cent searching for internal information or tracking down colleagues who can help with specific tasks.“But when companies use social media internally, messages become content; a searchable record of knowledge can reduce – by as much as 35 per cent – the time employees spend searching for company information,” the McKinsey researchers write.Time spent dealing with email, they add, is typically slashed by between 25 and 30 per cent.There are other problems, too, says Nikos Drakos, a Gartner analyst. “From a worker’s perspective, email is probably still the best mechanism for focused conversations between small groups of participants working together towards a specific goal,” he says. “But from an organisation’s perspective, a great deal of valuable knowledge and content can get hidden or buried in individual email accounts and may be lost forever when an employee leaves the company.”Nor does email do a good job of prioritising issues or allocating tasks, says Mr Drakos, when forwarded and “carbon-copied” messages bounce backwards and forwards between large groups of employees.This can lead to chaos, says Adrian Butera, director of Compton Green, a real estate company based in Melbourne, Australia: “For us, email had become too busy, too distracting. There was too much clutter, too many ‘reply alls’. But the worst thing for me was that we were sometimes missing customer emails among all the internal ones.”Radical action was called for, he says. This involved a blanket ban on internal emails and the rollout of an enterprise social network, based on the tibbr platform from Tibco Software.That, Mr Butera decided, would enable Compton Green’s sales associates out in the field to work together more
effectively on the marketing and sale of properties.Persuading Compton Green’s staff of the benefits of this approach was not as difficult as Mr Butera had feared.“The average age of employee in our firm is 30 and there was an instant understanding and appreciation of the idea of a ‘Facebook for work’,” Mr Butera says.Today, some eight months after the internal social network went live, anyone who is even tempted to revert to internal email to contact a colleague can expect a backlash.“It’s quite funny,” says Mr Butera. “You see an immediate response from recipients: ‘I’m not reading this. You need to tibbr it’.”At Archant, a UK-based publishing house, meanwhile, employees have taken the lead in setting up groups on the company’s four-year-old Connect social network, says Chris Thompson, the company’s head of development. This is based on the Socialcast platform from VMware.Archant’s accounts department, for example, used email for many years to make sure that regional sales executives were chasing outstanding payments from their clients. Now, there is an accounts payable group on the Connect network, where details of outstanding payments are posted.“It’s not supposed to be a name-and-shame exercise,” says Mr Thompson, “but having a product code up there and the name of the person responsible for that code is an incentive [for them] to make sure that money comes in on time.”There are also travel groups, where Archant employees can post reviews of places where they have stayed or eaten on work trips, and a popular photography group, where keen amateur snappers can share their latest images.Another group focuses specifically on Archant’s content management system, providing a repository of information, advice and documentation for those using the publishing tool in their day-to-day work.“All in all, it’s more effective than email for the whole company to share important messages with each other, whether those are work-related or more social in nature,” says Mr Thompson.“And because employees have found their own uses for the platform, they get better value from it, too.”"
46;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-09-12T11:22:31Z;Cyber security: first mover disadvantage;Everyone gets hacked, and cyber security shares are rising;"Target. Home Depot. Jennifer Lawrence. Everyone gets hacked, and cyber security shares are rising. Palo Alto Networks is up 70 per cent this year; Fortinet has risen a third. Gartner forecasts worldwide spending on cyber security will reach nearly $80bn next year, growing 8 per cent, more than twice as fast as IT spending overall.Profit remains behind the firewall, however. FireEye’s revenues more than doubled last year but it has never turned a profit. Palo Alto Networks saw revenues grow 50 per cent last year to $600m; its profit was all of $9m last quarter – news that sent its stock price up a tenth when announced on Wednesday.One challenge for these “next generation” security companies is that the price of becoming an established brand name is high. Huge sums are spent on marketing: FireEye’s costs here were 100 per cent of revenues in the last quarter. Palo Alto Networks’ were lower, but still high, at 50 per cent.The first movers say their products are superior, but the secrecy of the security industry works against them. Without information on attacks and breaches, it is nearly impossible to determine whose software is best. Anecdotal evidence is often the only kind. Independent testing is difficult and often irrelevant: attacks come in totally new forms. And once a new concept is proven – such as FireEye’s “simulated sandbox” approach – it is soon mimicked by bigger brands. Hence the marketing budgets.The system is stacked against the first movers in another way too: high-security enterprises like banks and casinos layer new products over existing ones, guaranteeing a certain level of sales for the old guard. This is where the value is, too: FireEye’s enterprise value is seven times this year’s expected sales (even after its share price has fallen two-thirds from a March peak). Palo Alto Networks, at nine times, is more expensive, having turned the corner on profitability. Compare those valuations to the less sexy Symantec, trading at two times – and which is profitable. Despite firing its chief executive in March, Symantec’s plodding stock has risen 5 per cent in the past year. That looks like the more secure bet.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com"
47;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-08-05T14:55:57Z;Xiaomi’s rise in China continues;;Just four years old, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has shot up sales rankings to become the top smartphone seller in China, the world’s largest smartphone market, according to data by Canalys, the technology research company.In a report released this week the company said Xiaomi’s shipments in China grew 240 percent year on year, to 15.1m in the second quarter, write Charles Clover.Xiaomi’s phones has achieved an almost cult like status among users, with the look and feel of iPhones, while its chief executives cultivate comparisons to late Apple CEO Steve Jobs. But analysts say the real selling point is the price – a third to a fifth of the price of the iPhone. “They are positioning as the affordable Apple,” said CK Lu, an analyst for Gartner, the global tech consultancy.Xiaomi’s cheapest phone, the Redmi, which retails for Rmb799, was responsible for the biggest jump in sales, according to Canalys. For comparison, an iPhone 5s sells for around Rmb5000.While Xiaomi’s feat is undeniably impressive, the statistics for smartphone sales in China are notoriously fickle, with little consensus on what you should count and what not to. Some analysts still put Xiaomi’s China sales below the likes of Huawei and Lenovo.Canalys data includes not just phones shipped to end users but also to retailers and ecommerce sites, including Xiaomi’s official store on Taobao, China’s largest ecommerce site, according to Jingwen Wang of Canalys.IDC counted Xiaomi’s second quarter sales more conservatively at 12.9m. While IDC also counts phones shipped to retailers, their lower number reflects cross checking with Xiaomi’s suppliers and less reliance on Xiaomi’s own figures, said analyst James Yan.Gartner, meanwhile, only counts end user shipments, and not shipments to retailers. They will be publishing their statistics next week, which might present an even different picture.Xiaomi has been able to keep its prices low partly due to clever selling strategy of marketing entirely through their online shop, meaning they do not have to cut expensive revenue sharing agreements with physical retailers said Mr Lu. However many stores buy the phones in order to resell them at a markup – in practice it makes it hard to count how many have been sold to end users and how many shipped phones have just wound up as inventory.

Sales are expected to range between $36bn and $36.5bn, also ahead of consensus expectations.“We think it is possible more of the beat was due to healthcare reform; in which case it would appear that HCA’s increase in guidance for the year is rather conservative since that benefit will continue,” Wells Fargo analyst Gary Lieberman said.The results sent shares of HCA almost 11 per cent higher to close at $60.99. Rival hospitals also climbed following the report. Tenet Healthcare advanced 8.32 per cent to $48.71, Community Health rose 8.57 per cent to $46.25 and LifePoint Hospitals increased almost 6 per cent to $65.06.Shares of US homebuilders rose after a report from the National Association of Home Builders showed confidence of builders touching a six-month high in July.The housing index climbed above 50 as sales slowly picked up after a slump exacerbated by the cold winter. A reading over 50 indicates more home builders view the market positively than negatively.Confidence was lifted by rising buyer traffic and improving expectations of sales in the coming six months.“This is the first time that builder confidence has been above 50 since January and an important sign that it is strengthening as pent-up demand brings more buyers into the marketplace,” Kevin Kelly, the chairman of the association, said.Lennar shares rose 2 per cent to end at $40.69, KB Home advanced 2.21 per cent to $18.01, Hovnanian increased 3.14 per cent to $4.60 and DR Horton climbed 2.15 per cent to end at $24.69.Yahoo was under pressure after the Sunnyvale-based web portal and search engine said sales continued to slide. Yahoo said first-quarter sales, excluding traffic acquisition costs, fell 3 per cent from a year earlier to $1.04bn.Chief executive Marissa Mayer said she was “not satisfied with the results” and that Yahoo had to “work faster to ameliorate the negative trends” in the company’s display advert business.Ms Mayer has relaunched several web portals in the past year in an effort to woo consumers to its sites, including new sites on food and technology.Despite those investments, the company continues to forecast declining sales. Yahoo executives expect third quarter sales to fall as much as 6 per cent from a year earlier to $1.02bn.Shares of Yahoo slipped 5.11 per cent to close at $33.79.Intel rose 9.27 per cent to $34.65 after it reported revenues climbed to $13.8bn from $12.8bn in the same quarter a year earlier, helped by corporate demand for traditional PCs.Sales of PCs in the US rose in the first quarter, according to research groups IDC and Gartner, as companies ditch computers using Windows XP, Microsoft’s now obsolete operating system.The unexpectedly better picture for PC sales has helped make Intel one of the best-performing technology shares this year.International Game Technology shares advanced 9.16 per cent to $16.92 after Gtech, the Italian-owned gaming technology group, said it would buy the company for $6.4bn.Gtech, which is best known for operating Italy’s state lottery, said it planned to merge with IGT under a newly formed UK holding company.It added shareholders in Las Vegas-based IGT, which designs and makes computerised gaming systems, would receive $13.69 in cash plus 0.1819 shares in the new company, equivalent to $18.25 per share.Overall, US equity markets drifted higher. The S&P 500 climbed 0.42 per cent to close at 1,981.57 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.45 per cent to 17,138.20.

49;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-07-08T15:29:45Z;5 things to know about Samsung’s guidance;;To accompany its preliminary quarterly earnings guidance on Tuesday, Samsung Electronics for the first time issued an explanatory note, to address “investors’ concerns about uncertainties”. Here are some of the key issues facing shareholders after Samsung’s 24 per cent year-on-year earnings decline.1. The Chinese smartphone marketChina is now by far the world’s biggest smartphone market, representing about 40 per cent of global sales by unit, but Samsung is under siege there from Xiaomi, Lenovo and a swarm of other lower-cost homegrown rivals. According to the research firm Gartner, Samsung’s market share in China has stabilised at around 18 per cent, down from a peak of 25 per cent late in 2011. Samsung’s economies of scale make its low-end phones far more profitable than its Chinese rivals’, and Tuesday’s guidance justified the weak performance by stating that the second quarter is typically a slow period for this market in China. But the build-up of unsold stock in the country suggests Samsung has been overly bullish on its prospects there.2. Apple and the fight for the premium marketSamsung also found itself sitting on smartphone inventory in Europe, where premium phones play a bigger role, which may reflect unexpectedly poor sales at the high end of the market. This could raise questions about the popularity of the flagship Galaxy S5 phone, even after Samsung said it had shipped 11m of the devices to retailers in the first month after its April launch. Samsung says it expects a boost in the coming months from the launch of various new devices, with a new version of its Galaxy Note phablet rumoured for September. But the same month is expected to bring a fierce new challenge from Apple, which is tipped to release an iPhone with the large screen favoured by Samsung’s high-end customers.3. Restructuring and shareholder returnsSamsung’s free cash flow has increased dramatically over the past two years, and its gross cash stood at Won61.5tn ($60.8bn) at the end of March. Yet returns to shareholders, as with most South Korean companies, remain miserly: even after an increase announced to appease unhappy investors, last year’s dividend amounted to a yield of only 1 per cent. With chairman Lee Kun-hee still hospitalised nearly two months after a severe heart attack, attention has shifted to the implications of the succession of control to a new generation. Some analysts speculate that Samsung will plough billions of dollars into share buybacks or dividends, after a handover to Mr Lee’s children, to help them pay inheritance tax and maintain strategic control.4. Memory chipsSamsung’s earnings growth over the past four years has been driven by its smartphone business, which generated about two thirds of the company’s operating profit last year. But the semiconductor business accounted for 60 per cent of earnings as recently as 2010, and a sustained improvement in profits from memory chips will be vital to strong earnings growth in the near future. Fortunately, margins in that sector have been boosted by a wave of consolidation in the sector that has left just a handful of players in each of the NAND and DRAM sectors, with Samsung the biggest producer in each. However, future profits from this business will hinge in part on how far the remaining manufacturers, including Samsung, resist the temptation to make large-scale capacity additions.5. New business areasSamsung ended the statement by promising growth in a range of new business areas – a crucial message for a company whose current earnings drivers are all past their days of fast growth. It vowed to expand its offerings to businesses, new wearable devices – Samsung stole a march on Apple with its Galaxy Gear smartwatch – as well as smart home appliances.It did not mention medical technology, seen by some investors as one of the most promising new areas. The need to conserve capital for these new businesses is at the core of Samsung’s argument against calls for cash returns – a claim that has received short shrift from some foreign shareholders.
50;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-06-27T16:21:52Z;Big Data: welcome to the Matrix;Fast growth, a big market, and the chance of a buyout;If you haven’t heard, big data is everywhere. But not for investors: pure-play options are as rare as a glitch in the Matrix. You can place your bet on Splunk, a data cruncher with a market capitalisation 20 times revenues. Or Qlik, a Swedish business intelligence software company with 30,000 users and half a billion dollars in sales. Otherwise, try Tableau, which sells user-friendly visual analysis software and is doubling its revenues every year.Prospects are sunny: Gartner data shows that businesses spend $16bn a year on software for business intelligence and analytics, and the market grows 8 per cent annually. Incumbents – Oracle, SAP, IBM and SAS – collectively control about 60 per cent of the market, but they have not been growing as fast as the overall market. The type of software offered by Tableau and Qlik – “data discovery” – is the fastest growing segment, pulling in more than $2bn annually. And there’s room to grow further: a Gartner survey found only 8 per cent of businesses are using big data analytics at all.These companies are not perfect. Tableau’s net income is turning negative as it churns more money into marketing. Qlik’s revenue growth has fallen into the teens (shock, horror), and uncertainty looms over the launch of its next product, says UBS. Splunk – which says it can index any machine data in any format – has not yet figured out how to turn a profit.Owning all three might not be a bad bet. If they were combined into a single mythical company – let’s call it Tablunklik – the aggregate results would be impressive. Tablunklik would have revenues of more than a billion dollars and would be growing 40 per cent annually. Profits would be slim – with operating margin of 5 per cent last year – but at least they would exist. The price is more appealing after falling 30 per cent since March 1. The only problem is that remains expensive from the perspective of the big guys who might someday make an acquisition: Tablunklik’s market cap is more than $13bn. Down the road, Tablunklik will either succeed wildly, die spectacularly, or get bought. In two out of three scenarios, shareholders get a happy ending.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
51;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-05-27T12:48:40Z;Digital advances drive functions together and lift IT spending;"Ecommerce, analytics and mobile apps are forcing CIOs and CMOs to co-operate; with interview of the two executives in these respective roles at Vail Resorts";"Marketing and IT may have their differences, but they have a growing amount in common, too. Both suffered budget cuts during the recession, with their activities seen as optional, rather than essential.“Both functions are [considered] discretionary spending,” says Jennifer Beck, a vice-president at Gartner, the technology analysts. “People think: if the numbers don’t look good, let’s cut IT and marketing.”More recently, both areas have seen renewed growth. Spending by marketing departments on technology – from apps to social media and “big data” – is one of the fastest-growing areas of corporate technology. But much, if not most, of it is being managed outside the IT department.This has led to suggestions by analysts that the chief marketing officer will spend more on technology than the chief information officer.Projections by Gartner suggest this point will be reached by 2017, although as Ms Beck points out, this does not mean that the CMO will be taking over the CIO’s role. The jobs are, and are likely to remain, very different.“The CMO is a very creative function, despite the fact that it has become more data driven, but CIOs like a more disciplined approach,” she says. “CMOs and digital marketers are big risk takers, and digital technology allows them to take greater risks, for example by experimenting in social media.”Other analysts suggest, though, that while marketing technology spending is growing rapidly, it is doing so from a low base. “CMO tech spending is 0.1 per cent to 0.3 per cent of revenue, against an IT budget of 2 to 3 per cent of revenue. It is growing, but would have to grow very quickly to make up that difference,” cautions Shvetank Shah, executive director at CEB, the business advisory group.“It is a myth that CMOs want to run IT,” he adds. “What CMOs are interested in, is rapid experimentation.” Marketers want to test ideas, and hand those that work on to other departments, such as IT, sales, or operations, to scale up and run.Nonetheless, marketing now accounts for some of IT’s largest projects. Anita Chandraker, head of IT delivery at PA Consulting Group, says: “With the rise of digital channels, a lot of marketing-led IT spend is identifying customer needs, and predicting what customers are going to do.”Adobe, the creative software company, now spends more on digital than any other form of marketing, and not just because the company also makes digital marketing tools, says Ann Lewnes, chief marketing officer.“At Adobe, 74 per cent of our marketing spend is on digital,” she says. “Last year, our second largest IT programme was our marketing programme,” notes Gerri Martin-Flickinger, CIO.IT involvement, though, is essential if marketing projects are to be effective.Five years ago, Thomson Reuters’ intellectual property and science division introduced a marketing automation platform. Rather than relying just on an email system, the software brings together online activity as well as email responses and leads from events such as trade shows.“It transforms how we are doing marketing. We can communicate more efficiently, and effectively,” says Kim Yeatman, director, marketing operations.As critical is the way the marketing system integrates with other business software, especially the company’s customer relationship management (CRM) application.“Our platform synchronises data with CRM, which is maintained by the technology team. It is a two-way sync. CRM is the system of record,” says Ms Yeatman.It is analytics and ecommerce, however, that are really driving marketing and IT closer together. CMOs and their teams might be comfortable developing mobile apps, or managing social media and content marketing, but these are often discrete areas of operations.Once systems start to share data with core business applications, as they will if they want to draw on operational data, projects are far more likely to need the support of IT.Some mobile apps, too, fall into this category: mobile apps may have started as purely promotional, or as a shop window. But if they involve mobile shopping, or mobile banking, then operations, IT, security – and for physical goods, the supply chain – will need to be involved. This is something marketing is unlikely to be able to support on its own.And analytics projects will, inevitably, need access to business data, as well as offering the potential to pass data back to other business systems.“We are looking at big data, in terms of being able to bring in disparate data sources, and give tools [to marketing] to turn that into useful information,” says Jolyon Ingham, CIO of building supplies company Grafton Group, and a member of the Corporate IT Forum Advisory Group.“In terms of what marketing is looking for: analytics is the key. It’s about driving that capability . . . I do see marketing and IT working more closely together.”This is prompting marketing departments to become more technically-minded, but also IT to become more familiar with the tools that marketing departments need to use.“It does change what IT does,” says Brian Whipple, global head of Accenture Interactive. “The marketing and sales technology that exists today is still fragmented. There are fewer people on the IT side who have grown up with this technology; a lot of folk in IT are not familiar with marketing tools. These have grown up on the CMO side.”But, he says, IT will “skill up” to meet the demand.What matters less, though, is who owns the budget; in fact, digital initiatives are now so important to many businesses that funds are allocated at board level. Even where they are not, marketing and IT are increasingly likely to pool resources.“Who pays is not important. It is how the programme helps our customers, or helps our sales,” says Adobe’s Ms Lewnes.——————————————-Vail Resorts: Marketing and IT chiefs learn to ski in tandemAt Vail Resorts, chief marketing officer Kirsten Lynch is proud of the job her team does telling potential customers about the holidays the US ski resort company offers, writes Jessica Twentyman.“But it’s so much more powerful when our guests tell their own family and friends what a fabulous time they’ve had at our resorts,” she says.Increasingly, she adds, they do that through social media, so over the three years she has been at Vail Resorts, she has worked regularly with Robert Urwiler, chief information officer, to launch a string of digital services designed to help guests make the most of their vacation.“We tend not to look at our work as a series of projects that require input from both marketing and IT,” says Ms Lynch. “It’s more about working together on an ongoing basis to address the company’s strategic priorities.”Says Mr Urwiler: “What makes this relationship work is that we both respect each other’s domain, and each other’s expertise within that domain – but we don’t stick to rigid boundaries in our discussions.“We’re not at all shy in weighing in with our opinions on each other’s issues, challenges and opportunities.”Perhaps the most visible manifestation of their joint efforts is Vail Resorts’ web and mobile application, EpicMix. First launched in time for the 2010-11 ski season, EpicMix uses RFID (radio frequency identification) chips, embedded in season passes and daily tickets, to track skiers’ and snowboarders’ progress around the company’s 10 US resorts.By collecting data through hand-scanning and automatic readers at turnstiles, ski lifts and on ski runs, EpicMix feeds back data to guests through their own, personalised portal, so they can see the number of vertical feet they have skied on a given day and the chairlifts they have ridden. They can also earn points and medals for their achievements on the slopes.But more importantly, guests can opt to share this information with friends and family on Facebook and Twitter, along with photos of themselves in action, taken by Vail Resorts photographers located on the slopes, who identify them via their individual RFID chip.EpicMix has been a big hit with the young and digitally-savvy audience of skiers and snowboarders who visit Vail Resorts each year, says Mr Urwiler. “That makes it fun for us, but it’s also a challenge, because this audience does have high expectations and regularly interacts with other high-end brands all over the planet.” By the end of every ski season, he says, he and Ms Lynch are already hard at work on enhancements to EpicMix for the next season.For the 2013-14 season, for example, they introduced EpicMix Academy, which enables learners – both children and adults – who attend Vail Resorts classes to track their progress as certified by the company’s ski-school instructors.“The reason Kirsten and I are here, working together, is not to maintain the status quo, but to keep pushing the envelope,” says Mr Urwiler.“I think some chief information officers tend to think of problems as technical issues.“My advice to them is to get to build a personal connection with the chief marketing officer and get to understand new business opportunities.“Build a consensus on what success might look like for your company.”Ms Lynch agrees: “Part of the strength of our relationship as chief marketing officer and chief information officer is that at the heart of everything we do and discuss is not a reaction to the latest technologies, but an understanding of the services that we hope our guests will use and enjoy.”"
52;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-05-25T14:07:22Z;Google deal highlights risk of leaving staff to their own devices;Once cyber security measures have been put in place, the policy can have a positive effect on staff;Google’s acquisition last week of Divide, a start-up that lets users securely separate their work and personal data on smartphones and tablets, has put the bring your own device trend, or BYOD, in the spotlight.As its name suggests, BYOD allows staff to use their personal electronic devices for work purposes. Its proponents point out that people regularly use multiple devices for work, depending on where they are, even if there is no BYOD policy.Corporate IT departments also tend to lag behind when it comes to rolling out new kit. “Ten years ago, you got a lot of the best new technology from your employer,” says Patrick Irwin, a product manager at Citrix. “Now, consumer devices move much faster.”When implementing BYOD policies and ensuring that staff are not adding devices to the company network willy-nilly, what issues should you be aware of?Start by familiarising yourself with the devices that are supported. Rob Smith, a research director in mobile and client computing at Gartner, says this can be complex. “With Android devices you often need to specify the handset and service provider,” he notes.If a device is acceptable, it should be subject to an enrolment process where the IT department checks it for viruses and then loads the appropriate enterprise software.There is a financial side to consider, too. Companies may pay staff a stipend to compensate them for using their own devices and in some countries this is seen as a taxable benefit.However, the biggest area to watch out for is employee behaviour. People often have a laid-back attitude to personal devices which is inappropriate if they hold potentially sensitive corporate information. “Businesses need to provide guidance to employees,” says Mr Irwin. “They need to understand how to protect data, store and access data.”With personal devices, staff may think nothing of connecting to open WiFi networks in coffee shops or installing popular apps, which they naively assume are safe. There is also a tendency for people to use apps and services they are familiar with for business. To discourage this, Mr Smith suggests you make staff more aware of corporate alternatives: “Rather than saying, ‘you can’t use Dropbox’, you should be saying, ‘use this enterprise file sync instead’.”When staff leave the company, their devices may need to revisit IT in order to have corporate data erased. Likewise, personal devices may need software installed for remote wiping in case they get lost or stolen.If all this sounds like a lot of hassle, there are upsides. Mr Irwin points out that BYOD can represent an opportunity for businesses as the staff using these devices sometimes discover new ways of working.“In the end,” says Mr Smith, “BYOD costs about the same as providing devices – but the users are happier.”workingsmarter@ft.com

That leaves the government in profit on the bail-out so far.Ally had sought to sell shares between $25 and $28 but was met with lacklustre interest. Shares declined more than 4 per cent to close at $23.90.Rite Aid, the third-largest US drugstore chain, rallied after the company forecast robust sales over the coming year.The company said it expected revenues in fiscal 2015 to range from $26bn to $26.5bn as same-store sales climb as much as 4 per cent. The guidance was ahead of Wall Street forecasts for $25.8bn.Rite Aid shares climbed 8.44 per cent to $6.94.Overall, US equities slid as technology stocks sold off and momentum from the release of Federal Reserve minutes on Wednesday faded.The S&P 500 fell 2.09 per cent to 1,833.09 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.62 per cent to close at 16,170.22. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped more than 3 per cent to finish at 4,054.11.
54;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-02-20T17:31:19Z;Is $19bn a lot of money?;;Is $19bn a lot of money? It certainly sounds like it – that’s what Facebook thought WhatsApp was worth when it scooped up the messaging app on Wednesday.The fate of social networks depends on being able to turn huge pools of users into a source of cash. So one way to assess whether Mark Zuckerberg got value for money is to look at how much he paid per WhatsApp user compared with the price of each person in other networks:At $42 a head, the WhatsApp deal makes the $6 per person that Rakuten doled out for Viber in its $900m swoop look positively miserly. The per-user premium is a quarter higher than what Facebook paid for Instagram back in 2012. But it starts to seem more reasonable when you consider Facebook’s and Twitter’s users are worth around three times the price of a WhatsApp-er, according to the enterprise value of those companies.Add into the mix that WhatsApp messages appear to have reached or overtaken the roughly 20bn SMSes that are sent everyday – and the growth is picking up pace:WhatsApp message volume growth is still accelerating. Has probably now overtaken SMS. pic.twitter.com/KsR85MplrtNot surprising, then, that Gartner estimates that 90 per cent of mobile data revenues will come from non-SMS sources by 2018.It’s worth noting, though, that the deal is not just about expanding Facebook’s user base, as the overlap will be substantial. Around 70 per cent of WhatsApp users will also have a Facebook account, reckons Tim Shepherd of research group Canalys.Benedict Evans, who is responsible for the chart above and is now at venture capital group (and Facebook investor) Andreessen Horowitz, writes:[The deal] shows the continued determination of Facebook to be the ‘next’ Facebook. … [T]he winner-takes-all dynamics of social on the desktop web do not appear to apply on mobile, and if there are winner-takes-all dynamics for mobile social it’s not yet clear what they are.Another way to look at the deal is Facebook is trying to shore itself up against a drop-off in users under the age of 24. “What Facebook is paying for is engagement at the youth tier and the youth segment of the market,” says Mr Shepherd. In the US, WhatsApp’s penetration has almost caught up with Facebook in the 16-24 age bracket – who are also the most avid users of rivals Twitter and Snapchat:Source: On Device Research, November 2013Finally, there’s an element of Facebook wanting to strengthen its relationship with users outside of the developed world. “It’s as much about buying engagement in these regions as it is about growing the user base,” says Mr Shepherd. “Facebook is primarily interested in having a high level of engagement in people looking at their device and gathering information it can use to sell marketing.”WhatsApp, for example, is significantly more popular than Facebook messenger in Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia. And with the exception of China, where WeChat dominates, chat apps appear to be jostling for position even more aggressively in emerging markets than in the US:Source: On Device Research, November 2013When the dust from WhatsApp deal settles, the test will be whether Facebook has absorbed – and can avert the consequences of – the tough wisdom dished out by Mark Zuckerberg’s character in the film The Social Network:Users are fickle… The users are interconnected, that is the whole point. College kids are online because their friends are online, and if one domino goes, the other dominos go, don’t you get that?
55;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-01-28T21:01:46Z;Analytics and mobility among big 2014 trends;Mobility and analytics will be high on corporate IT spending plans;"Cloud computing, data analytics, mobility and socially en­abled business processes are reshaping corporate IT, while the emergence of machine-to-machine communications ushers in the “ internet of everything”.John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco, the supplier of networking equipment, predicted in his keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this month that the internet of everything – connecting people, devices and machines – would drive the next wave of global innovation and deliver $19tn in profits and cost savings to the private and public sectors over the next 10 years.While this wave would be powered by an explosion in the number of connected devices – predicted to grow from 10bn to 50bn units over the next few years – Mr Chambers said it would be about far more than the number of internet-enabled devices and sensors. “This transformation will change the way people live, work and play.”In the meantime, enterprise software is expected to be the strongest growth segment of the global IT market in 2014, according to figures prepared by Gartner, the IT research firm. Spending on business software is expected to grow 6.8 per cent to $320bn this year, after rising 5.2 per cent in 2013.Richard Gordon, managing vice-president at Gartner, says: “Investment is coming from exploiting analytics to make B2C [business-to-consumer] processes more efficient and improve customer marketing efforts.”He adds: “Investment will also be aligned to B2B [business-to-business] analytics, particularly in supply chain management, where annual spending is expected to grow 10.6 per cent in 2014.”After marking time in 2013, the total global IT market will grow 3.1 per cent to $3.8tn this year, Gartner predicts. It says spending on devices, including PCs, laptops, mobile phones and tablets, will grow 4.3 per cent in 2014 after slipping 1.2 per cent in 2013.However, the firm slightly revised downward the compound annual growth rate for IT services between 2012 and 2017. This mainly reflects reductions in outsourcing growth rates, specifically, in co-location, hosting and data centres.“Chief information officers are reconsidering [increasing the size of their data centres] and are instead planning faster-than-expected moves to cloud computing,” says Mr Gordon.Over the past 12 months, the cloud has become an easy choice for mainstream organisations, says Andrew Brabban, Fujitsu UK’s director of application services. In the US, for example, 80 per cent of organisations and consumers use public cloud services. Mr Brabban says: “There will be a focus for cloud services in three areas: management, integration and aggregation.”Chris Curran, PwC US Advisory’s chief technologist, identifies business analytics as the top trend to watch. “With business analytics, companies are realising the advantages of increased innovation, improved productivity, enhanced customer experience and loyalty, and lower costs.”He says advances in sensors, display technologies, and devices will enable companies to monitor people, entities, behaviours, events, and objects.“Companies will use data originating from these and other technologies to apply new analytic, statistical and computational modelling techniques,” he says.Mr Curran also identifies socially enabled business processes as a big business technology trend. “Business processes across the enterprise will deeply entangle social and community capabilities to enable a new generation of connected employees,” he says.In addition, he says that, since consumers are using their mobile digital devices to monitor their health, check their bank accounts and pay their bills, many companies will need to develop a mobile customer engagement strategy.Among corporate IT leaders, two main technology priorities emerge, according to Gartner’s recent CIO Agenda 2014 survey: renovating core IT processes and exploiting new technologies and trends.“The core of enterprise IT – infrastructure, applications such as ERP, information and sourcing – was built for the IT past and needs to be renovated for the digital future,” says Gartner’s Dave Aron.But he warns that the skills required to undertake the renovation of core IT are different from those needed to exploit such new technologies and trends as digital design, data science, “digital anthropology”, start-up skills and agile development.“Most businesses have established IT leadership, strategy and governance, but have a vacuum in digital leadership,” he says. “To exploit digital opportunities and ensure the core of IT services is ready, there must be clear leadership, strategy and governance. Individual digital leaders are not enough; all business leaders must become digital leaders.”——————————————-Data points: Technology by numbersMobileDevicesWorldwide combined shipments of devices – PCs, tablets, ultramobiles and mobile phones – are projected to reach 2.5bn units in 2014, a 7.6 per cent rise on 2013, says Gartner. For PCs alone, shipments fell 10 per cent last year to 315.9m units, the worst decline in PC market history. RBC Capital Markets predicts PC unit sales will fall a further 5 per cent this year.Operating systemsAndroid is on course to surpass 1bn users across all devices in 2014. By 2017, more than 75 per cent of Android’s volumes will come from emerging markets.PaymentsForty-three per cent of respondents to Ovum’s recent Consumer Insights Survey chose banks as their most trusted mobile payments service provider. Then come credit card companies (13 per cent), online payment providers (9 per cent) and mobile operators (6 per cent).InvestmentMobile operators invest more than $100bn a year in capital spending on their networks. The EU used to account for a third of the world’s telecom capex investment, but that has fallen below 20 per cent.

56;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-01-26T17:35:38Z;Nintendo: Wii need to talk about consoles;It may be too soon to pull the plug on hardware sales;Terrible earnings are great news for anyone trying to force a strategic overhaul. Nintendo’s profits warning this month was cheered by analysts wanting the games maker to quit hardware and release Super Mario and his friends on to other makers’ mobile devices. Nintendo’s full earnings – and, hopefully, a response to its critics – are due this week.About four-fifths of smartphone app sales are from games – a market where revenues will top $20bn next year, Gartner reckons. Nintendo has the strongest brands in gaming. And the capital light mobile story sells: Tokyo-listed GungHo – the company behind Puzzle & Dragons (it’s big in Japan) – has a market capitalisation of nearly $8bn based on just a few hits. Meanwhile, the Wii U – Nintendo’s follow-up to the wildly successful Wii console – is a disaster. Sales forecasts have been cut by two-thirds a year after its release.But hardware accounts for 63 per cent of Nintendo’s revenue (it does not say what its hardware margins are). Giving that up because one console flopped is a huge risk. Further, aside from Mario, Nintendo’s biggest hits have been physical games, such as Wii Sports, which cannot be replicated on a smartphone. Immersive role-playing games, such as Legend of Zelda, seem unlikely choices for the casual mobile gamer with five minutes to kill at the bus stop. And mobile gaming is not a sure-fire success. The industry is dominated by dedicated start-ups like Supercell, King and Rovio. Established games makers such as Activision Blizzard have struggled.Perhaps Nintendo can play two games at once. Plug into app stores with simple time-wasting games, like those it pioneered on its Gameboy and DS handheld devices, but keep its hand in the hardware business, with a tablet or a basic home console for family gaming (like the original Wii). The Wii U is a dud but it need not mean game over for hardware just yet.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
57;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-01-16T19:53:55Z;Taming the digital dragon;;"Digitisation - the restructuring and reworking of business processes for the digital age - is gathering pace across multiple sectors.But company IT leaders feel overwhelmed by the prospect of building digital leadership while renovating the core of IT their infrastructure to support a digital future, reveals a global survey of more than 2,300 Chief Information Officers conducted by Gartner.To help understand the factors lying behind this apparent lack of confidence and the challenges posed by corporate digitisation, I asked Dave Aron, vice-president and Gartner Fellow, about the conclusions he draws from the survey. The following is an edited version of his answers.The CIO Agenda 2014 survey reveals some rather alarming findings about company IT leaders’ preparedness for a digital future. What’s going on?The fact is that company IT leaders are facing all the challenges they have had for many years, plus a torrent of digital opportunities and threats. Digitalisation raises questions about strategy, leadership, structure, talent, financing and almost everything else. Many IT leaders feel ill-prepared to face these challenges while also ensuring that the core of enterprise IT is fit for purpose.The 2014 CIO Agenda survey found that, as we head towards the third era of IT in the enterprise, 51 per cent of company IT leaders are concerned that the digital torrent is coming faster than they can cope and that 42 per cent don’t feel that they have the talent needed to face this future.What is so different about this so-called ‘third era’ of enterprise IT?During the first era of enterprise IT, the focus was on how IT could help do new and seemingly ‘magical’ things such as automating operations to create massive improvements in speed and scale, and providing business leaders with management information they never had before. The downside was that the IT organisation was often a little unreliable and a poor communicator.All this came to a sudden end with the Y2K problem and the dotcom boom and bust. There was less tolerance for an unreliable ‘black box’ IT organisation in the business. We entered the second era of enterprise IT, an era of industrialisation of enterprise IT, making it more reliable, predictable, open and transparent. However, while, this second era has been necessary and powerful, tight budgets and little appetite for risk left scant room for innovation.Now we are entering a third era of enterprise IT. Technological and societal trends such as the Nexus of Forces and the Internet of Things are not only improving what businesses do with technology to make themselves faster, cheaper and more scalable, but fundamentally changing businesses with information and technology, changing the basis of competition and the portfolio of businesses people are in, and in some cases, creating new industries.Why is this shift such a big deal, surely IT has always been about change?It is certainly true that in the IT industry, we have become inured and immune to new buzzwords and messages about how everything is changing. But this time it really is. This is both a company chief information officer’s dream come true and a career-changing leadership challenge.Against the backdrop of this gradual shift to growth and company specialisation in the use of IT, there is a much bigger tectonic shift happening. Every industry and every geography is being radically reshaped by digital opportunities and threats. Current enterprise IT is simply not set up to easily deliver on these digital dreams. This is why talk of the ‘digital dragon’ – potentially very powerful, but also potentially destructive if not tamed.If company IT leaders feel they do not have the talent needed to address an increasingly digital world, what specifically are they missing?There are five talent areas that most companies don’t possess, at least in sufficient numbers: digital design, data science, digital anthropology, start-up/ small business partnership/ vendor management and agile development. These are all particularly challenging because not only are most companies short of them, there isn’t a big enough talent pool to draw from globally. Companies need to get creative, recruiting people based on aptitude and underlying capabilities rather than proven experience, working with universities to develop skills, job rotations etc.So, what can company IT leaders do to tame this ‘Digital Dragon’?It’s tempting to think that the chief information officers and the IT organisation just need to absorb some of the new technology and societal trends into what they are doing already – to do it just a bit faster, cheaper and smarter. But if we dig deeper, we see something more fundamental going on.This year will be a year of dual goals: responding to continuing needs for efficiency and growth, but also shifting to exploit a fundamentally different, digital paradigm. Ignoring either of these is not an option.The top CIO technology priorities for 2014 reveal two complementary goals: renovating the core of IT and exploiting new technologies and trends.The core of enterprise IT – infrastructure, applications such as ERP, information and sourcing – was built for the IT past and needs to be renovated for the digital future. The talent needed to execute on renovation includes different skills, such as digital design, data science, ‘digital anthropology’, start-up skills and agile development.Most businesses have established IT leadership, strategy and governance but have a vacuum in digital leadership. To exploit new digital opportunities and ensure that the core of IT services is ready, there must be clear digital leadership, strategy and governance. But individual digital leaders are not enough – all business leaders must become digital leaders.Will we see a rise in CIOs’ budgets in 2014 to accommodate this challenge?In terms of business leaders’ focus, we are seeing a gradual but undeniable shift toward growth. However, despite the need to grow, there is pressure on IT budgets. The global weighted average expected change in CIOs’ IT budgets is an increase of 0.2 per cent. This is especially challenging since there is the need to both renovate the core of IT systems and services, and exploit new technology options.More than ever, the size and shape of IT budgets are unique to each enterprise and that, coupled with a shift to digitalised business models, means there can be no more vanilla IT. The more that information and technology get intertwined in the customer experience, and the more IT serves the most strategic and tactically nuanced parts of the business, the less appropriate it is to have the same IT as everybody else – even in the same industry.Company IT leaders also report that a quarter of IT spending will happen outside the IT budget in 2014. This is a direct result of the new digital opportunities that are more entwined with customer and colleague experiences, and that may, in some cases, reflect concerns that the IT organisation is not fast enough or otherwise ready for more digital opportunities.How will company IT leaders address this imbalance?There is an inherent tension between doing IT right and doing IT fast, doing IT safely and doing IT innovatively, working the plan and adapting. The second era of enterprise IT has been all about planning IT right, doing IT right, being predictable and creating value while maximising control and minimising risk. However, to capture digital opportunities created by the third era, chief information officers need to deal with speed, innovation and uncertainty. This requires operating two modes of enterprise IT: conventional – that is to say ‘safe and steady’ and non-conventional or ‘non-linear’, which could be described as ‘fast and agile’.Achieving this bimodal capability is an absolute necessity as the era of digitalisation poses many ‘non-linear’ challenges such as the need to absorb disruptive new business models enabled by new digital technologies; the need to scale up and down in Internet time and the need to explore and evolve solutions that are surrounded by uncertainty.This is not a quantitative improvement; it’s a fundamental change in the way information and technology show up in the enterprise – a rethinking of the role of the company IT leader and the IT organisation, and the rest of the business’s expectations. If this transition succeeds and tames the digital dragon, massive new value for businesses can be created, and with it, a renewed role and greater credibility for the chief information officer and the IT organisation. If, however, the dragon isn’t tamed, businesses might fail and the relevance of the IT organisation will almost certainly disappear.The worldwide Gartner CIO Agenda Survey was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2013 and included 2,339 CIOs, representing more than $300bn in CIO IT budgets in 77 countries.Dave Aron is a vice-president and Gartner Fellow in Gartner’s CIO research group, focusing on IT leadership issues."
58;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-01-15T00:01:16Z;Zapping through the mobile payments maze;;Mobile payments is a hot topic in technology circles – but there are as many definitions of what the term means as there are companies vying for the dollars of finger-swiping, screen-staring shoppers.One part of the market is an extension of ecommerce – ways to help consumers shop online via their mobile. This is what Vocalink’s start-up Zapp will be trying to crack when it launches later this year, after announcing on Wednesday that it will be enabled for 35 per cent of UK account holders and 60 per cent of UK merchants.It is a crowded and fragmented market. Other segments include person-to-person payments, services that help retailers cut the costs of processing transactions, and ways of allowing customers to pay in-store on their smartphones.There are about 7bn mobile phone accounts worldwide, but only 1.3bn credit and debit accounts, according to Morgan Stanley. This gap indicates there is money to be made both by increasing the total volume of transactions and in replacing existing card transactions with mobile payments, it adds.The question is which of the many new entrants will become profitable.The real money, analysts say, lies in companies that use their platform to analyse and resell consumer data to retailers – as well as offering reward schemes and targeted advertising to consumers.“The key thing to look at is what value the service is offering to customers and whether the customer cares about this value proposition,” says Sandy Shen of technology firm Gartner.So far consumers are not flocking to use smartphones in stores instead of credit cards, with services such as Google Wallet and Isis struggling to attract users. In a back-to-the future moment, Google launched a debit card for its digital wallet at the end of last year.Part of the problem is the profusion of technologies. These range from “near field communication” chips that use radio signals to process payments by touching phones against a reader, to QR codes that can be snapped with cameras.The different options can be baffling and prevent a standard developing among shoppers and retailers. Between 2011 and 2012, the number of customers wanting to pay with a smartphone at shop counters fell 3 percentage points to 10 per cent, according to a survey by payments consultancy Vantiv.Zapp has pushed back the release of its in-store option from the start of 2015 to the end of that year because of the difficulties of integrating smartphone payments at shop tills.“ ‘Mobile payments are dead, long live digital payments’ is the mantra,” says Ian Foottit, a consultant at Deloitte. Businesses need to look at smartphones as just one tool in an overall shopping experience, rather than a commercial panacea to increase transactions, he says.What is likely to encourage the adoption of mobile payments is an appreciation that payment itself is incidental.Later this year PayPal will introduce a device called Beacon, a small piece of hardware that retailers can install to alert them to when customers step into the store, and which can be used to send coupons or marketing messages to the user’s phone.“What often seems like a payments play is actually a play on information,” says Jens Münch, UK managing director of iZettle, a Stockholm-based company that uses mobile technology to provide low-cost card processing for small businesses.Another question is whether the sector will consolidate around one company or technology that consumers use in different contexts, or whether different companies will capture different consumers – a payments service for restaurants and another for impulse purchases made after seeing an ad, for example.“This market is big enough to accommodate multiple players,” says Ms Shen. “I think the technologies are going to compete with each other and be suitable for different use cases.”
59;IT;Gartner Inc;2014-01-15T00:01:16Z;Smartphone payments app gets UK banks’ backing;Initially, the mobile payment system will only work for online purchases;A smartphone app allowing shoppers to pay for purchases direct from a linked account will be made available to 18m UK bank customers this year – in the latest sign that the banks are gearing up for rapid adoption of mobile payment systems.Known as Zapp, the app is due to launch between September and October and will be available to account holders with five UK banks: HSBC, First Direct, Nationwide, Santander and Metro Bank. Together, they hold 35 per cent of all current accounts in the UK.Zapp has been developed by Vocalink, the group that runs the UK’s payments infrastructure, and which is owned by a consortium of 18 banks and building societies. Vocalink has so far pumped £33m into producing the app.Initially, the mobile payment system will only work for online purchases, but Vocalink expects it to be enabled for in-store transactions in late 2015 – cutting out the need for credit cards both online and on the high street.“We are literally building, from the ground up, a whole new payments ecosystem,” said Peter Keenan, Zapp’s chief executive. He likened the effort to the creation of SWIFT, an industry standard for sharing information about financial transactions developed from the 1970s.Zapp is one of several mobile payment systems competing for a share of the mobile payment market, which research firm Gartner estimates will be worth $721bn by 2017.Technology groups, telecoms companies, e-commerce groups and credit card providers are each trying to exploit their particular strengths to appeal to consumers and retailers alike.Both Google and Visa now offer digital wallets, while Vodafone, EE and Spain’s Telefónica have teamed up to launch Weve, a payments and marketing platform based on phone numbers.For banks, Zapp represents an opportunity to rebuild their reputations after the financial crisis and foster relationships with their customers, said Mr Keenan.However, some appear to be hedging their bets, with four of Zapp’s partners signing up to a parallel scheme organised by the bank-run Payments Council that will let people send money to one another using mobile phone numbers, due to launch this spring.Barclays, which has not signed up to Zapp, has its own payments service known as Pingit.But Tony Prestedge, chief operating officer of Nationwide, said the competitive advantage of such standalone products is likely to erode in the longer-term, as co-operative schemes, like Zapp, make the technology ubiquitous.“I see it as a ticket to the game to be a credible current account provider in the UK,” Mr Prestedge argued.Zapp’s technology works by generating a secure token that authorises a payment directly from a shopper’s current account to the merchant. Users of the initial version of the app can visit an e-commerce website on a mobile device, and will then be offered the option of paying via Zapp, before being returned to the site.By cutting out the need for credit cards, Zapp hopes to capitalise on customer concerns about fraud and identity theft. In December, Target admitted that cyber criminals had stolen the credit card details of up to 40m of its customers.Zapp is enabled for use with retailers that handle 60 per cent of UK transactions by volume, thanks to partnerships with payment processing companies including WorldPay and Sage Pay.Some analysts questioned the usability of the launch version, though. “People don’t want to jump from website to website, app to app, to complete a transaction,” said Sandy Shen, an analyst at technology research company Gartner. “They want to complete a transaction in a few clicks. You have to balance the security with the convenience and the user experience.”
60;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
61;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-12-03T21:00:30Z;Enterprise apps: Employees sign up with the company store;An in-house app market means greater control in bring-your-own-device world;By 2017, one in four organisations will have deployed an enterprise app store, where employees can download company-sanctioned apps to their mobile devices.That forecast comes from IT market research company Gartner, where analysts see a range of benefits for companies.“Enterprise app stores promise greater control over the apps used by employees, greater control over software expenditure and greater negotiating leverage with apps vendors,” says Gartner analyst Ian Finley.Some companies have already made a start. At Essilor International, the big French manufacturer of ophthalmic lenses, the domestic sales force has been armed with iPads to take to customer meetings. The apps they need to make a sale are downloaded from the company’s Essi Store, an enterprise app store built with technology from Airwatch, a mobile device management specialist.The tools available to them there include an electronic catalogue of all the company’s lenses, animated presentations that help them market specific kinds of lenses to customers and an internally developed customer relationship management application, Teranga. The latter gives them instant access to details of leads, existing customer accounts and sample contracts, explains Mathieu Ngo, IT project manager at Essilor International.At the back end, he explains, IT administrative staff can “follow the number of apps downloaded, notify users about the availability of new apps and updates and push the apps to an employee’s iPad”. The team is working on a project to push apps to Windows 8 tablets and plans new sales force apps for 2014, he says.Users tend to be comfortable with this kind of set-up, because it mirrors their experience of downloading apps from consumer-focused app stores such as Google Play and Apple’s App Store, says Alex Achucarro, head of mobile at Avanade UK, a business technology services company formed as a joint venture between Microsoft and Accenture.When it comes to IT professionals, he adds, “you’re pushing at an open door.” This is “because the widespread introduction of BYOD [bring your own device] policies in organisations has got managers worried about the potential risks and administrative burden associated with making sure that employees are using approved applications, securely, on a vast array of different devices”.If enterprise app stores are to compete for the hearts and minds of mobile-equipped employees, they need to offer employees the same kind of choice, flexibility and user experience as their consumer counterparts, says Mr Finley at Gartner.An enterprise app store can help IT departments achieve greater control only if it is widely adopted by employees, he points out. A limited choice of applications will doom the effort to failure.“Choice is a critical value proposition for an enterprise app store. Without it, there is no reason for a user to participate,” he says. “They should be able to research a catalogue of options and make selections based on their own preferences.”A good enterprise app store, for example, will enable users to base their choices on feedback from their colleagues and to provide their own feedback.At broadcasting company BSkyB a concerted effort is under way to increase the choice of apps available to employees on the in-house enterprise app store, My Apps.This store, based on technology from mobile device management specialist MobileIron, was implemented 12 months ago for the use of two groups of BSkyB employees.Sales advisers can download an app that enables them to show the range of programme choices available to potential customers. Engineers, meanwhile, can use apps to track and manage jobs and to place orders.But, says Amardeep Rai, a solutions architect at BSkyB, “we have seen a cross-department interest in in-house apps that wasn’t expected”.Development teams at BSkyB are working on a much wider range of apps for employees, including holiday booking, time sheet submission and expenses apps, as well as an app for tracking the balance of their canteen cash card. “And we are still in the early stages of revolutionising the way users interact with the company through mobile applications,” says Mr Rai.It is a pattern that Avanade’s Mr Achucarro has observed at many organisations. “They start off with one or two apps, but other parts of the business start to demand their own and the whole effort starts to balloon,” he says.That can present problems for in-house software development teams, he says, because employees have high expectations of an app, whether it is downloaded from a consumer or enterprise app store.In other words, software developers must focus on delivering a compelling experience and a certain amount of design flair.“The danger is that, under pressure, they find themselves rushing to cobble together a mobile app that interfaces with older back-end technology – an expenses system, for example,” says Mr Achucarro. “But if the resulting app is clunky and unattractive and, as a result, no one uses it, then they’re back to square one.”
62;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-11-26T11:52:48Z;Bharti: building up a bond warchest, but for what?;;"Bharti Airtel, India’s largest mobile operator by sales, is looking to issue debt, possibly through a eurobond, according to India’s Economic Times.Although a bond issue isn’t officially announced yet, the company confirmed to beyondbrics that six banks have announced that Bharti has approached them, asking for meetings to be set up with fixed income investors from Wednesday. The six on the list are Barclays, BNP, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Standard Chartered and UBS. And Moody’s, the credit rating agency, has assigned a rating to the bonds already.It’s still a little early to say how much the telecom operator is raising – although the Economic Times suggested $1bn.Moody’s said the debt was to be euro-denominated, helping diversify the company’s debt profile which is strongly dollar-denominated, and that the telecom operator will use the funds for refinancing. It assigned a Baa3 rating to the notes. Laura Acres, senior vice president at the rating agency commented:Bharti’s Baa3 rating is underpinned by its receipt of strong and growing
cash flows from its Indian operations, particularly in wireless, where
it enjoys a well-established and leading market position under the Airtel
brand… At the same time, concerns exist regarding its exposure to the risk of changes to the regulatory and political environments in some of the
countries in which it operates, especially after its 2010 investment into
15 (now 17) African countries.Analysts, however, suspect Bharti would be looking for funds ahead of the 2G spectrum auction to be held in India this January.“It would be going towards the upcoming spectrum auctions,” says Kamlesh Bhatia, a telecoms analyst at Gartner. “Because a lot of the bandwidth of the spectrum they have on 900Mhz is going to come up for renewal, especially in the metros.”Last time India tried to sell off this 2G spectrum it was a big disappointment as the government – still in the shadows of the previous scandals – set the base price unreasonably high.It looks like the government has done a better job setting the minimum price this time round and there will be takers at next year’s auctions. After some to and fro, on Friday ministers approved the Telecom Committee’s suggested prices for the bidding, due in January. The cost to the bidders is down by 25 per cent for the 900Mhz band and and 15 per cent for 1800Mhz.The main players in this round will be Bharti, Vodafone and Idea, plus new kid on the block Reliance Industries, according to Suresh Mahadevan at UBS.“This time the auction will go through and there is not going to be a lot of irrationality,” he says.The one bit of news telecoms analysts are still watching for is the final M&A rules for the sector as they forecast consolidation in the growing Indian market. Yet inorganic growth isn’t likely to be Bharti’s aim in raising this money.Mahadevan expects consolidation to happen among the smaller players in India’s telecoms sector, such as Aircel, Tata and Telenor.“The reality is these three guys are not even making Ebitda [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and ammortisation] today so for them the problem is one of lack of scale,” he adds. “M&A would allow them to get some scale into the business.”Bharti Airtel shares were down 2.71 per cent on Tuesday.Related reading:

63;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-10-24T23:03:13Z;Cloud storage carries potent security risk;Cloud computing technology is rife with challenges and privacy risks;Cloud computing, the technology that allows software and data to be shared on the internet, is now being adopted by large companies that say this infrastructure has become their top technology investment this year.According to research by the Business Roundtable, the US trade association for large companies, the federal government has seen 25-50 per cent savings on IT expenditure through utilisation of cloud computing, similar rates to those that have been enjoyed by the private sector.“In short, cloud computing leads to more efficiency, lower costs, and greater consumer convenience,” the BRT says.The technology is also fraught with challenges and privacy risks.For example, analysts at IT consultancy Gartner point to the dangers associated with moving “regulated data”, such as medical and financial information, to the “public cloud”, including the fact that it could lead to run-ins with auditors who may find a company is not in compliance with regulations to protect the data.Janet Stiven, a Chicago-based business attorney and member of law firm Dykema Gossett, told CFO.com magazine that it is particularly important to remember that “risks for businesses abound in the [new IT] environment, as many cloud services and mobile applications were designed for the individual consumer in mind, not the enterprise”.Some experts say one of the most worrying trends is that groups are not necessarily taking risk associated with cloud storage into account before they decide to transfer sensitive data to the technology.The three biggest risks associated with cloud computing have to do with security, data loss, and unauthorised access.The transfer of vast amounts of confidential data from a company to a cloud service means relinquishing control of data security.It is critical to understand a cloud provider’s disaster recovery capabilities in the event of an emergency and ensuring that the provider has a good understanding of document retention regulations that may apply.Companies must have a good understanding of possible physical risks to their data, including knowledge of the physical security of facilities where data are housed, resistance to natural disasters and power cuts, and personnel access to the facilities.The potential for data loss, particularly in cases of power cuts, must be at the forefront of executives’ minds when settling on a cloud provider. Here, the most important issue is ensuring that the cloud provider understands regulations and privacy rules that apply to certain kinds of data, especially information that pertains to personal health and financial records. According to Gartner, in some cases cloud presents “so much risk as to make it unacceptable, such as with highly regulated data or trade secrets”.Risks for businesses abound in the [new IT] environment, as many cloud services and mobile applications were designed for the individual consumer in mind, not the enterpriseIT procurement officials are also finding it difficult to know how best to ensure that contracts with cloud providers offer a reasonable amount of transparency.It is important, too, to test annually whether data can be exported safely in order to test the cloud provider for a potential exit from the service.According to a report by Roger Grimes, a security columnist for Infoworld, “the cloud vendor usually states that they do awesome, triple-protected data backups.”He says: “But even in cases where vendors said that data backups were guaranteed, they’ve lost data – permanently. If possible, your company should always back up the data it’s sharing with the cloud or at least insist on legalese that has the right amount of damages built in if that data are lost for ever.”Cloud computing may be exceedingly efficient but it raises unique questions about how to avoid possible breaches, particularly because the size of cloud environments makes them likely targets for hacking attacks.Experts say the first step is to ask the right questions of a cloud provider, like how data will be encrypted, who is responsible for encrypting data, how access controls function and how vulnerabilities are assessed.There are risks, as Gartner points out that data could be misused by people who still have access to it even though they are not supposed to – like former employees – because “account control tends to be weaker than enterprise applications.”
64;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-10-08T21:34:06Z;Industry will develop new IT roles, says Gartner;Era of chief digital officers is coming;"Corporate IT leaders must embrace a wave of digitisation that would sweep industry over the next six years to help create what Peter Sondergaard, head of research for Gartner, the technology research firm, called “the digital industrial economy”.If they failed, they risked being bypassed by business leaders who recognised the importance of transforming their companies into digital organisations and were ready to appoint a new category – chief digital officers – to help them achieve it.“The digital world is upon us,” said Mr Sondergaard, who delivered the opening keynote to an audience of 8,000 business and IT leaders that attended the Gartner Symposium/IT Expo in Orlando, Florida last week.“Every budget is an IT budget; every company is a technology company; every business leader is becoming a digital leader and every person is becoming a technology company,” he said, citing the example of individuals who let rooms in their homes through the Airbnb website and competed directly with hotels.“Digitalisation exposes every part of your business and its operations to these forces. It is how you reach customers and constituents; how you run your physical plant; and how you generate revenue or deliver services. Enterprises doing this today are setting themselves apart and will collectively lead the new digital industrial economy,” Mr Sondergaard said.He said this new economy would be built on the foundations of what Gartner has previously termed the “nexus of forces” – referring to cloud, social collaboration, mobile and information – and the so-called “internet of everything” – combining the physical world and the virtual.In 2009, there were 2.5bn connected devices with unique IP addresses on the internet. Most of these were cell phones and personal computers. By 2020, there would be up to 30bn devices connected with unique IP addresses, most of which would be mobile products.This, said Gartner analysts, would create a new “internet of things” economy worth $1.90tn by 2020, benefiting a range of industries including healthcare, retail and transport.“Computing power will be cheap and covert. We won’t know it is there; it will be in our jewellery and in our clothing,” Mr Sondergaard said. “We will throw more computers into our laundry in a week than we’ve used in our lifetimes so far.”By 2017, new device categories – mobile phones, tablets, and ultra-mobile PCs – would represent more than 80 per cent of device spending and nearly half of first-time computer purchases would be a tablet.Gartner also believes that many traditional technology vendors will struggle to keep pace with the changes. In the past, many of the top technology companies reigned over the industry for long periods but many of today’s leaders in areas such as cloud computing and mobile technology did not exist 10 years ago.“What many traditional IT vendors sold you in the past is often not what you need for the digital future. Their channel strategy, sales force, partner ecosystem is challenged by different competitors, new buying centers, and changed customer business model,” Mr. Sondergaard said.Increasingly, he said, chief executives and business leaders felt they could not accomplish the necessary changes with existing IT leadership. So they were assigning new leaders in charge of innovating with digital technologies.“By this time next year, we predict a tripling of titles like chief digital officer, chief digital strategy officer, chief data officer and other emerging roles,” he said, and also predicted that these would be transitory roles, which would disappear again by 2020. “By 2020, they will have fulfilled their role.”He warned that IT leaders who ignored the challenges posed by digitisation and did nothing “could end up as a custodian of back end technology facilities”. Conversely, Mr Sondergaard told his audience: “If you act now, you may lead us to 2017 and beyond to 2020.”"
65;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-09-27T19:00:56Z;Key trends in Big Data technologies;;"Not long ago, organisations convened focus groups to assess customer interest. Today, executives can ask their data specialists to find those insights in social sentiment, sales numbers, web site behavior, sensor data, and more.In the next few years, the ability to find and assess trends, turn insight into foresight, to tap the behavior of multiple audiences, and to optimise decisions will move into the hands of the executives, their teams, and even individuals.One of the recommendations that we will be making at the upcoming Gartner Symposium/ITxpo is that in the meantime, organisations must evaluate big data technologies with an eye on what’s possible and practical for seizing opportunities in the future and today.Investment in analytics and the information management infrastructure to support it has been a top chief information officer investment priority for the past six years. Yet according to a recent survey, only 8 per cent of respondents say they have deployed a “big data” project to production.Many big data deployments are still in the knowledge gathering, strategy and piloting phases and the overwhelming majority of big data initiatives are processing traditional data sources, like transactions or log data rather than a variety of data sources, such as social, email, voice, machine or sensor data. As organisations prepare for big data initiatives, they should consider the following key trends of investment driving growth.Analytics will be more pervasive. It’s not just about big data – it’s about ubiquitous data. Analytics and insights from analytics will move out of the hands of a select few specialists to be more pervasively accessible to non-traditional business intelligence (BI) users, customers, and even for personal use. Most current tools require users to know the data they want to analyse, know the questions they want to ask in advance and also possess specialised skills to initiate queries, build analytics and mathematical models and build visualisations using the tools. These skill sets are beyond those possessed by most business users.But this is changing as business users increasingly demand consumer-like capabilities that allow them to easily find causal relationships in data and allow them to use that as a basis to more precisely predict outcomes and prescribe the best action or decision to take (often in real time) to drive the greatest business value without specialised skills.Examples of scenarios on the horizon include routing a caller to the best call center agent based on the caller’s voice sentiment, interaction history, social behavior and influence and demographics. To achieve the best outcome, the call center agent is automatically sent an optimised script, offers and treatment recommendations for that specific caller. Or, carpets equipped with sensors that monitor and analyse senior citizens’ activities for dangerous abnormalities, which are then delivered via mobile devices with prescribed intervention or remedial actions for healthcare professionals and /or care givers.These types of scenarios will become more mainstream over the next two to three years with technologies that give business users human friendly and intuitive visual interaction (for example, users would be able to initiate queries and analysis using natural language voice or text questions as inputs instead of having to access BI tools) and data exploration and discovery tools with guided recommendations for finding patterns in data and for conducting more advanced types of analysis.This will be achieved by embedding and encapsulating complex analytics from users, surfacing recommendations for optimal courses of action at the point of decision (increasingly on a mobile device), and incorporating the user’s context (i.e. location, intention, sentiment, past behavior and network). In addition, social and collaboration capabilities integrated with analytics will be increasingly important investment areas making it easier to share, discuss and socialise results and to provide a mechanism for making transparent, high quality decisions.Much like Amazon users are presented with a “people who bought this item, also bought this one” recommendation, analytics users will be presented with similar guided analysis based on the social profiles and decision history of other decision makers and their previous interactions.Analytics will be more precise. Organisations are increasingly investing in capabilities that enable them to discover more precise patterns and micro predictions based on diverse data - increasingly in real time.This will require investments in advanced analytics for more precisely predicting likely outcomes with high productivity (iterating and refining many more models in a short period of time) and accuracy (on larger number of data dimensions) and in finding unknown patterns and relationships across the enterprise and within new types of data such as social, emails, call center interactions, video, and machine data.Examples include identifying fraud and cyber security threats, best next offer, predictive maintenance, predictive policing, personal monitoring for alerting and optimised healthcare, early identification of adverse new drug effects, etc.This requires new types of analysis such as sentiment, geospatial, and network analysis to find entities of interest, their relationship and influence. Organisations will also require new skill sets and may fill this gap by investing in a combination of internal skills building, outsourcing to analytics service providers or to crowd source analytic models.Analytics will enable better decision making. Decisions are a basic unit of work for all organisations. The success of every enterprise is a function of the cumulative effect of the quality of the decisions that it makes. Despite large BI investments in the name of better decision making, poor decisions are abound. Where decision rules and logic are well known, more precise and real time analytics will be applied to automate a range of operational decisions.For example, a retail food chain monitors refrigeration assets in real time to proactively predict and maintain an asset before it fails. At the same time, the quality of collaborative decisions and professional experiential and judgment-based decisions (clinical diagnosis, employee hiring, online education, personal health and wellness) will be enhanced by advanced analytics, man-machine partnerships or digital assistant models (think IBM Watson); and many more are emerging.Moving toward something that looks simple and invisible from the user’s perspective will require new types of computing capacity and power, extended capabilities and skills, and extended capabilities in information management systems, including but not limited to:Visual based data discoveryNatural-language query so non-traditional analytics users can find insights in data.Contextual engines to understand the user context (for example, who users are, where users are, what users are doing, with whom are users interacting).Semantic technologies, text, speech and video analytics to derive new insights from previously in accessible data along with algorithms that simulate the way the brain understands, aggregates and relates diverse pieces of data, reasons, and learns — much like the human brain.Advanced analytics, such as predictive modeling, machine learning, graph analytics, sentiment analysis, statistics, and simulation and optimisation techniques — including linear and nonlinear programming.In-memory computing, Hadoop, NoSQL, search technologies and event processing to handle large volumes of diverse and real time data.Information Management EvolvesAnalytics investments over the next three years will require an evolution of the information management architecture. Key enabling investment areas include data management hybrids for semantics and data integration, metadata management for transparency of source data, technology that relates business process model changes to the associated information assets, and graph analytics.Graph analysis is the best option for presenting alternative scenarios, scoring them and comparing them when combining highly disparate information asset types. It is not only possible, but highly likely that multiple connection points will exist between information that was not designed to be used together. Innovation requires comparing how to combine the same set of disparate information under multiple models.Deriving value from big data likely involves several sources of data with varying levels of structure and relationships. Different analytical outcomes can be realized at different points in the information lifecycle.For example, continuously generating computations as data flows in, can yield insights in real-time; while analysing the data in batches results in different outcomes. No single technology supports both types of scenarios. Therefore, big data technology choices will be driven in part by the physical and logical attributes of data in combination with the desired analytical or business outcome.Several different technologies must be combined when multiple outcomes are desired, such as real-time data processing and interactive data exploration. In the end, understanding what’s possible with big data through the technologies on the horizon will help organisations plot their course to innovation.Rita Sallam covers business intelligence and analytics at Gartner, Mark Beyer is the co-leader of big data research at Gartner, and covers traditional data warehousing, data integration and information management practices, and Nick Heudecker is responsible for coverage of big data and NoSQL technologies at Gartner.Previous articles in our Big Data series:Part 1: What Big Data means for businessPart 2: Building a ‘Big Data’ strategyPart 3: The art of Big Data innovationPart 4: Big Data strategy essentials for business and ITPart 5: Infonomics, the new economics of informationPart 6: Confronting the privacy and ethical risks of Big DataWe plan to publish the series a free downloadable e-book shortyly."
66;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-09-17T16:01:51Z;Management: Time to embrace digital disruption;Old procurement models can delay modernisation;Chief information officers must feel they live in a world in which the ground is constantly shifting under their feet. Their traditional focus was on picking the technologies that were most likely to result in improved internal operations. Company executives bought software if they thought it could deliver a return on investment – or they waited for the next development.So-called digital disruption– when technology changes so quickly it interrupts existing business models – was something information technology suppliers inflicted on their competitors, not their customers.But, in today’s frenzied environment, IT leaders must not only deal with internal transformation but also identify which, if any, technologies – such as mobile, social, cloud and analytic capabilities – they should be turning to.James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research and author of Digital Disruption: Unleashing the Next Wave of Innovation, says the use of such technologies will allow companies to develop products and services that will help them “undercut rivals, get closer to customers and disrupt the usual ways of doing business”.Corporate information chiefs should play an active – if not leading – role in their companies’ strategies for creating opportunities out of digital disruption, he says.“When I talk to a chief information officer, I find a clear sense that their business won’t survive the external threats from other disruptive businesses if someone doesn’t enable it to take advantage of data and digital tools,” he says.“Since they are often the people in their company who best understand the data it holds and how it can use new tools, there is a clear role for them there.”Many technology executives are held back by old ways of thinking about procurement, Mr McQuivey says. “Their job has always been to spend money in the smartest ways possible, so they are wrapped up in thoughts of vendor management, procurement best practice and approval processes,” he says. That makes it difficult to support fast, short, low-cost experiments in new ways of doing business.Also, many of the tools that might underpin the most disruptive products and services – or at least enable companies to explore their possibilities – are now available in ways that do not fit traditional IT procurement methods. Simon Orebi Gann, a former chief information officer at BP and other companies during his 30-year career, says: “Sometimes wholesale shifts take place that so completely change the ground rules that companies can take advantage of technologies they would never have had access to before.”The proliferation of third-party data centres, which allow companies to tap into sophisticated IT resources without having to own or manage the equipment themselves, is one such shift. “The technology and the timing have come together in ways that represent a step-change in opportunity for businesses,” Mr Orebi Gann says.Beyond that, hardware and software resources are now made available by some suppliers on remotely hosted servers – the cloud – on a totally on-demand basis, making experimental prototypes of services easier to model and test at low cost.Customers, meanwhile, are more accessible to companies, thanks to smartphones and tablet computers, and are comfortable giving feedback via social networking sites, creating rich sources of “big data”.Information coming from connected customers and devices increasingly can be analysed using open-source software running on cloud-based hardware, rather than costly on-site information storage and analysis systems.But access to such tools is only part of the picture, says James Woudhuysen, professor of forecasting and innovation at De Montfort University in the UK.“There is a real danger that in all this talk of disruption, what gets neglected is the research and development work necessary to deliver anything that might truly be considered new and that really meets customers’ so-called ‘needs’,” he says. “There is a process of searching and sieving and judgment that needs to be conducted.”Researchers at McKinsey, the consultancy, echo his view. In a study released in August 2013, they found that while business leaders are “bullish on digital”, with 65 per cent of the 850 senior executives surveyed saying digital technologies would increase their companies’ operating income over the next three years, technological challenges were considered a minor factor in the success or failure of these deployments.Factors thought to be more important were senior management interest and attention, programme management and the compatibility of an organisation’s structure and goals.Such findings underscore the shift in the responsibilities of IT leaders, as a report this year from IT research company Gartner noted. “Digital technologies provide a platform to achieve results, but only if chief information officers adopt new roles and behaviours to find digital value,” wrote analyst Mark McDonald.“Without change, chief information officers and IT consign themselves to tending a garden of legacy assets and responsibilities.”
67;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-09-15T21:00:39Z;Mobile phones: a touch of distinction;How can manufacturers make their phones stand out from very similar rivals?;"As my friends’ tame geek, I am often asked: “What mobile should I get? I’m due an upgrade.” It is a good question. There are so many handsets that do more or less the same things and look more or less the same that it can be hard to know where to start.In some ways it should be straightforward. There are just four main mobile platforms – Android, iOS, Windows Phone and BlackBerry – so choosing a new handset is based on what platform they already use. Yet most of my friends do not know which platform they are on. What they can tell you, is which handset they use: “I love my Samsung” or “iPhone all the way”.That is good news for handset makers that are finding it increasingly hard to stand out. Manufacturers need strong brand stories and points of difference from their rivals. Operating systems are the brands of the software houses – Apple with iOS, Google with Android, Microsoft with Windows Phone and RIM with BlackBerry. Handset makers have to assert their brands ahead of those powerhouses.“It used to be much easier,” says Carolina Milanesi, a research vice-president in the consumer devices team of Gartner, the IT research company. Before the four platforms emerged to dominate, hardware manufacturers could differentiate their handsets in a number of ways. “The [user interface] was part of that, and then you had technology and design to differentiate them – you had clamshells and candy bars and sliders. There was much more variety in the market,” says Milanesi.“Now it is a piece of glass in different sizes; there is not much that allows the vendors to differentiate other than in brand strength and quality,” she adds.The biggest of the big boys is Samsung. The Korean company sold more than 100m units in the first quarter of this year, according to Gartner, giving it a market share of 23.6 per cent. Samsung is best known for its Galaxy range of smartphones and tablets, and it is here that it focuses most of its marketing effort.The Galaxy devices use Google’s Android, which is overwhelmingly the dominant mobile device operating system. Gartner found Android held 74.4 per cent of the global smartphone market in the first quarter of 2013.Yet Samsung makes little or no mention of Android. At the launch of the Galaxy S4 earlier this year, the focus was on Samsung’s own applications, which run on its customised version of Android, TouchWiz. It knows that consumers go for the brand, not the platform. Samsung wants you to choose Samsung, not Android.People used to choose HTC. However, at the end of July it warned that it could face an operating loss for the first time, tellingly pointing to “the lack of economy of scale”.HTC’s brand story had been focused on its own custom user interface, HTC Sense, and the quality of its hardware. Certainly, the high-spec HTC One, launched earlier this year, was widely liked by reviewers, who compared it favourably with the Galaxy S4. Yet HTC dropped out of Gartner’s top-10 list in May, having shipped just 5.36m units in the first quarter of the year to give it a market share of 2.5 per cent.So how do manufacturers make their brand stand out? The most recent move has been to focus on the camera. Cameras in smartphones have been notoriously poor: there is only so much quality you can squeeze out of the small sensor and mediocre lens shoehorned into the average smartphone body. Yet despite the poor quality, billions of photos are taken and shared every day. Cameras count.Enter Nokia. It was widely accepted that Symbian, its smartphone operating system, was at the end of the road. But when the Finnish manufacturer announced that it would partner with Microsoft to make smartphones running Windows Phone, observers were surprised. It had been expected that Nokia would move to Android.Choosing Windows Phone has been an important point of brand differentiation. However, Nokia’s strongest brand story has been the cameras in its Lumia range, which compare very strongly with the competition. Mounting the camera in a gyroscope means the shutter can open for longer as shake is reduced. This in turn means photos taken in low light are much less likely to require flash – and can be very good indeed.Nokia’s marketing has focused very heavily on the quality of those images. In July, it upped the ante significantly with the launch of the Lumia 1020, which boasts a 41-megapixel camera. The image quality is stunning.But other manufacturers are elbowing their way into that space. Samsung’s recently launched S4 Zoom is the only smartphone to have an optical zoom – a lens that makes the phone look like a proper camera.Are better cameras the way forward? Gartner’s Milanesi is not sure: “The camera can make a difference as long as [it] doesn’t come with a compromise,” she says. Will the “proper” lens of the S4 Zoom put people off? Will the lack of a “proper” lens on the Nokia Lumia 1020 be too much of a compromise for serious photographers? Sales figures later this year will tell us if the camera chapter in the handset-makers’ brand stories is one that will close with “and they all lived happily ever after”.——————————————-The mobile life: apps that help you work and play on the goMicrosoft Office 365(iPhone, Android)Windows Phone (WP) users get a portable version of Microsoft Office baked in. Office 365 is finally available for iPhone (but not iPad) and Android (only in the US for now). The catch? You need an active Office 365 account. The app allows you to create, save and share documents, but is basic. It is hard to love this when everyone really wants standalone versions of the Office apps for phones and tablets – which WP users get.…VLC (iOS, Android)VLC has long been the go-to media player for computers. Newly arrived in the Google Play store, and recently reappeared in the App Store after a two-year hiatus, VLC knocks spots off any similar app. In Android, it is a dream: it will find your video files and offer to play them, and gives you the option of a file browser so you can move those files around. It is trickier in iOS. The best way to get files into the app is to use the WiFi upload option.…DuckDuckGo(iPhone, Android)Revelations about online data collection have focused minds on finding alternative providers for web functions. DuckDuckGo, a search engine that does not track users, has seen numbers jump. Now there is an app, though built for phones. It is not available for the iPad and is no looker on a bigger Android tablet. Search is good, however, delivering a choice of straightforward results and crowd-sourced “stories”."
68;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-09-12T10:07:17Z;Why ereaders are crumbling;;So sales of tablets will soon overtake those of PCs, according to the new figures from IDC. But one mobile device that isn’t surging is the ereader.Sales of ereaders, such as Amazon’s Kindle and Barnes & Noble’s Nook, seemed to have peaked – with sales currently declining faster than even those of PCs. Only 16m ereaders will be sold this year, Gartner estimates, down from 24m in 2011 and 18m in 2012. Gartner cut its forecasts for future shipments by nearly half earlier this year.Ereaders face two big problems.1) They lack functionality. The Kindle, Kobo and Nook may be great for reading texts, but they cannot offer the graphics needed for magazines, let alone the browsing or apps offered by tablets. Consumers looking to buy one device may therefore choose a small tablet such as the iPad mini.2) They last for a long time. An owner of an ereader doesn’t need to update her device every year like an iPhone user might.What’s the impact of the ereader’s decline?This might not capsize the major ereader manufacturers – Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Kobo, which have all been moving into the tablet market.But a bigger question is whether sales of content – i.e. ebooks – can continue, despite slower growth in ereaders. Some observers point to figures showing ebook sales growing at a slower rate. Others say that tablet users will continue to buy ebooks, even though reading on a LCD screen can be less pleasant. And because of the durability of the devices, it’s likely that the number of ereader owners is slowly increasing, even while ereader sales are slumping.Yet one company that is in trouble is E Ink, the Boston-based, Taiwanese-owned maker whose electronic paper is used in over 90 per cent of ereaders. Its financial performance has worsened since 2012, culminating in a $33m operating loss in the second quarter of this year, its worst result for four years.E Ink has ideas for its own salvation. Smartwatches and other wearables could use its ink. Sony is trialling PDF readers, using E Ink’s technology, at Japanese universities. Known as “virtual printers”, such PDF readers could be one route to the paperless office.But it’s not clear how profitable they would be for their backers, because there would be no tied-in content (companies would upload their own PDFs to the device).That’s why most energy will keep being diverted into tablets.
69;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-09-03T09:41:21Z;Microsoft and Nokia: key questions;;"Why now? The key seems to be Microsoft’s ambition.Since it joined forces with Nokia in mobiles in 2011, neither company has prospered. Microsoft remains a distant third to Google and Apple in terms of operating systems, while Nokia’s share of the smartphone market has collapsed from 17 per cent in 2011 to 3 per cent in the first half of this year, according to Gartner.“We know we are number three in the market, we’re not number two or one and we need to accelerate,” Steve Ballmer, chief executive, told the FT’s Richard Milne.According to Carolina Milanesi, an analyst of Gartner, “It’s all or nothing for Microsoft. They need to be successful in mobile in order to remain relevant in the computing market.”Nokia, meanwhile, had come to several realisations, according to a person involved in the deal. “One was that you need deep pockets to be in the mobile business… The second is they accepted Microsoft’s premise that the hardware-software distinction had vanished.”Will Apple and Google be worried?Microsoft will increase Nokia’s sustainability. The Finnish company’s devices and services division could have run out of cash by 2016, according to bearish forecasts from Bernstein. Greater integration of hardware and software also brings potential benefits.Yet the Windows platform will still lack a critical mass of mobile developers and consumers. It had just 3.7 per cent of the global smartphone market in the second quarter of 2013, according to IDC, although Microsoft claims it has more than 10 per cent in some market. Apple and Google “will be opting to watch closely over calling an emergency meeting,” says Ms Milanesi.Where does this leave the other manufacturers of the Windows Phone? Samsung, HTC and Huawei also produce handsets running the Windows operating system, although their share is tiny compared to Nokia’s. Huawei, which only started shipping Windows Phones this year, says its plans are unchanged by the Nokia news.Will there be any strategic decisions left for Steve Ballmer’s successor? Mr Ballmer has reshaped his top team; announced a strategic reorganisation in July; and now increased the bet on the Windows Phone, confirming the company’s embrace of hardware. “High risk but high reward,” says Ian Fogg, an analyst at IHS, of that strategy.Is that successor Stephen Elop? Ahead of the acquisition, the outgoing Nokia CEO was a weak 5/1 favourite to take over at Microsoft, according to bookmakers Ladbrokes, ahead of other past and present Microsoft faces such as Kevin Turner (6/1), Steve Sinofsky and Julie Larson-Green (both 8/1). Ladbrokes now has him at 4/6.Was Nokia considering a switch to Android? Pure speculation, courtesy of mobile analyst Benedict Evans, but it would provide another potential rationale for Microsoft to take control of the company, the largest maker of Windows Phones. However, as Mr Evans also says, the purchase of Nokia would not stop Microsoft switching to Android, if it decided that was the best option.Can Microsoft avoid a culture clash? Nokia is Microsoft’s second biggest acquisition after Skype in financial terms, but much larger in terms of personnel. Around 32,000 employees are expected to transfer to Microsoft, including 4,700 in Finland. Skype had just 640, and even then the transition has not been ideal.Will Microsoft use its $78bn of foreign cash reserves to pay for the transaction? Almost certainly yes, rather than repatriate the cash and pay tax on it. Such a strategy has been used by US buyers of European tech businesses for at least a decade.

70;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-08-20T20:15:15Z;Lines blurring between humans and machines;;"Companies need to look beyond simply replacing their human workforce with machines and computers if they are to benefit from emerging technology trends that are blurring the divide between humans and machines, say Gartner analysts.The Gartner “Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2013” report published this week argues that emerging technologies including smart machines, cognitive computing and the “Internet of Things” are beginning to redefine the relationship between humans and machines, and that the divide between them will “no longer be clear cut”.The report is designed to provide corporate strategists and planners with an assessment of the maturity, business benefit and future direction of more than 2,000 technologies, grouped into 98 areas, and highlight a set of technologies that “will have a broad impact across the enterprise”.“In making the overriding theme of this year’s Hype Cycle the evolving relationship between humans and machines, we encourage enterprises to look beyond the narrow perspective that only sees a future in which machines and computers replace humans,” said Jackie Fenn, vice-president and Gartner fellow.“In fact, by observing how emerging technologies are being used by early adopters, there are actually three main trends at work. These are augmenting humans with technology – for example, an employee with a wearable computing device; machines replacing humans – for example, a cognitive virtual assistant acting as an automated customer representative; and humans and machines working alongside each other – for example, a mobile robot working with a warehouse employee to move many boxes.”Hung LeHong, research vice-president at Gartner, says: “Enterprises in the future will use a combination of these three trends to improve productivity, transform citizen and customer experience, and to seek competitive advantage. These three major trends are made possible by three areas that facilitate and support the relationship between human and machine.”Technologies make it possible to augment human performance in physical, emotional and cognitive areas. The main benefit to enterprises in augmenting humans with technology is to create a more capable workforce.For example, consider if all employees had access to wearable technology that could answer any product or service question or pull up any enterprise data at will. The ability to improve productivity, sell better or serve customers better will increase significantly.“Enterprises interested in these technologies should look to bioacoustic sensing, quantified self, 3D bioprinting, brain-computer interface, human augmentation, speech-to-speech translation, neurobusiness, wearable user interfaces, augmented reality and gesture control,” the report says.There are clear opportunities for machines to replace humans, for example for dangerous work, simpler yet expensive-to-perform tasks and repetitive tasks. The main benefit to having machines replace humans is improved productivity, less danger to humans and sometimes better quality work or responses.A highly capable virtual customer service agent could field the many straightforward questions from customers and replace much of the customer service agents’ “volume” work – with the most up-to-date information.“Enterprises should look to some of these representative technologies for sources of innovation on how machines can take over human tasks: volumetric and holographic displays, autonomous vehicles, mobile robots and virtual assistants,” says the report.But the report emphasises that “humans versus machines is not a binary decision, there are times when machines working alongside humans is a better choice”, and points to a new generation of robots that is being built to work with humans as guides and helpers.For example, IBM’s Watson does background research for doctors, just like a research assistant, to ensure they account for all the latest clinical, research and other information when making diagnoses or suggesting treatments.The main benefits of having machines working alongside humans are the ability to access the best of both worlds, says Gartner. That is, productivity and speed from machines, emotional intelligence and the ability to handle the unknown from humans. Technologies that represent and support this trend include autonomous vehicles, mobile robots, natural language question and answering, and virtual assistants.“In order for machines to better understand humans and the environment, they will need a better understanding of human context, humans and human emotion,” says the report.This understanding in turn will lead to simple context-aware interactions between machines and humans such as displaying an operational report for the location closest to the user, better understanding customers by gauging consumer sentiment for a new product line by analysing Facebook postings, and complex dialogues with customers.Humans will also need a better understanding of machines. As machines get smarter and start automating more human tasks, humans will need to trust the machines and feel safe. The technologies that make up the “Internet of Things” will provide increased visibility into how machines are operating and the environment they are operating in.For example, IBM’s Watson provides “confidence” scores for the answers it provides to humans while Baxter, a mobile robot, shows a confused facial expressions on its screen when it does not know what to do. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has also been working on Kismet, a robot that senses social cues from visual and auditory sensors, and responds with facial expressions that demonstrate understanding.“These types of technology are very important in allowing humans and machines to work together,” says the report. Finally, the report’s authors note that both machines and humans are becoming smarter. They argue that the surge in big data, analytics and cognitive computing approaches will provide decision support and automation to humans, and awareness and intelligence to machines.Natural language question and answering technology can improve a virtual customer service representative (or Chatbot,) or be used by doctors to research huge amounts of medical journals and clinical tests to help diagnose an ailment or choose a suitable treatment plan. The report adds: “these supporting technologies are foundational for both humans and machines as we move forward to a digital future.”"
71;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-08-14T19:06:12Z;Smartphones outsell basic handsets for first time;;Sales of internet-connected smartphones have outstripped more basic handsets for the first time as customers in emerging markets have benefited from the steep drop in prices of devices featuring the latest technologies.Global mobile phone sales grew 3.6 per cent to 435m units in the second quarter of 2013, according to research group Gartner, but for the first time smartphones accounted for more than half of the market.Global smartphone sales reached 225m, a rise of 46.5 per cent from the second quarter of 2012, while sales of basic “feature” phones fell more than a fifth to 210m. IDG, a rival research group, claimed that the crossover happened in the first quarter of this year, when 216.2m smartphones were sold, out of a total 418.6m mobile phones.Gartner measured a particular surge in demand for smartphones in the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America and eastern Europe, where people often use their mobile phones as the only means of internet access. Such emerging markets have benefited from the fall in price of Android-based smartphones often made by Asian manufacturers.In a further sign of the decline of BlackBerry, the Canadian handset maker that on Monday put itself up for sale, Gartner found that Microsoft has taken its position as the third-largest smartphone operating system.Microsoft’s Windows phones accounted for a 3.3 per cent market share in the second quarter of 2013, up from 2.6 per cent in the period last year, while BlackBerry’s share of the market almost halved to 2.7 per cent.Samsung remains the best-selling handset maker with a market share of smartphone sales of 31.7 per cent, up from 29.7 per cent in the second quarter of 2012, although Apple’s position deteriorated. It took 14.2 per cent of sales in the second quarter, down from almost 19 per cent in the previous year, but ahead of the expected launch of its latest iPhone in September.LG Electronics, another South Korean manufacturer, has become the third-largest handset maker ahead of Chinese groups Lenovo and ZTE, which have built a strong position in the market based on cheap Android devices sometimes sold under other brand names.
72;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-08-06T14:46:54Z;Samsung smartwatch patents revealed;;A South Korean website has unearthed trademark and patent filings by Samsung regarding a possible smartwatch. That’s a reminder that – while Samsung and Apple squabble over old intellectual property – they will soon have a whole new set of designs to fight over.In the drawings, Samsung’s device looks like a smartphone bent round a wrist. Unlike similar products from Sony, LG and Pebble, it has a flexible screen rather than the familiar usual strap.According to Carolina Milanesi, a research analyst at Gartner:The use of the flexible display is the most interesting thing as Samsung not only would have the cost advantage from their screen technology but also some [intellectual property] advantage according to this filing.Smartwatches so far have suffered from 3 key issues: lack of design appeal, limited screen size and limited functionality. Addressing design appeal and screen size ratio will certainly help improve adoption.Whether Samsung actually goes with the design – and the name Gear, which it has registered in South Korea and the US – remains to be seen.Meanwhile, Sony’s Android-compatible SmartWatch 2 is set to launch in September, with apps available in Google Play store. Numerous other companies – including Dell, which missed out on smartphones – are also looking at developing devices.But for many consumers, the game probably won’t really kick-off until Apple gets involved.Its iWatch is now the subject of a trademark filing in several countries, although the FT has reported on delays in the design process.Even then, some analysts doubt that smartwatches have the functionality to justify the hype. Gartner forecasts that less than 3 per cent of premium phone users will have bought one within the next four years.
73;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-08-02T18:09:04Z;Big Data strategy essentials for business and IT;;"Big data initiatives are all about change – changing business processes, data sources, infrastructure, architecture, skills, organisational structures and economics. And they often result not in incremental improvements to existing business processes, but in radical changes to existing processes or even their outright displacement.One of the issues is that business leaders need to be involved in laying out the big data strategy for the enterprise, but chief information officers need to take the lead and help business leaders see how to use big data and ensure that the infrastructure and skills are in place to capitalise on it. Together, business and IT need to adopt a set of essential strategies as they embark on big data initiatives for the enterprise.Recognise how Big Data initiatives are uniqueBusiness executives should consider that big data projects tend to concentrate on acquiring, integrating and preparing information rather than the data’s functionality. This shift in focus can strain traditional approaches to enterprise architecture, project management and role definition.Another perceptible difference with big data projects, and the one we believe is given a disproportionate amount of press as a result, is the underlying technology. Traditional, even state-of-the-art, hardware, database management systems and analytics capabilities are often dispensed with in favour of technologies specific to accommodating massive, swift and diversified data and analysis. For those indoctrinated in the traditional ways of data warehousing and business intelligence (BI), these changes can be arduous.Additionally, big data initiatives require a degree of financial rumination and discipline focused on the question, “What value can we generate from this data, and is it more than it costs us to accumulate, administer and apply it?”The outcome of big data projects can be uncertain. Even more uncertain is the ability of many businesses to act on what they find in the data. With time being money, how quickly can your organisation get from focused experimentation that yields insights or innovations to its implementation and institutionalisation?Generate big ideas for Big DataBusiness sponsors must also realise that major opportunities involve ways to transform the business and disrupt the industry by asking and answering “chewy” questions that were never possible before. We discussed how to generate big ideas in our earlier article, “ Building a ‘Big Data’ Strategy.”Building on that, business executives should ask questions that go beyond the mundane answered by basic BI tools such as, “How much did our business grow in the past year?” Instead, they should ask questions that make full use of broader, deeper and more real-time data and, if answered and acted upon, could have profound effects.For example: “How can we increase customer shopping basket value by 20% and loyalty by 33% by better understanding their individual interests and behaviour, and considering a range of economic forecasts and competitor moves.”Build business leadership belief in dataUnfortunately, many business leaders are still resistant to relying on data for decision making. Especially in matters of strategy, deep personal or professional experience, or multidimensional factors; business leaders rely on intuition more often than benefits to their organisations.In strategic decision making, leaders tend to over-emphasise past individual experiences despite new or differing data indicating situational change. Even more common today, as information becomes more complex and analytic techniques become more sophisticated, is the inclination merely to discount data or formulas that one doesn’t understand.Some of the remedies to this discounting of available data that chief information officers should enact and business leaders should embrace include executive education in basic statistics, risk/scenario planning, “group think” avoidance and even decision theory; decision competitions among individuals or teams; communicating analytic insights and their transformative opportunity; or pairing data scientists directly with executive teams.Embrace investment pragmatismBig data doesn’t dramatically alter the economics of acquiring, administering and applying information assets but it does amplify it.No longer can organisations ignore the need to balance these information supply chain costs with the tangible value derived from information. One important scheme for tipping the balance of big data benefits to outweigh its cost is ensuring that the data serves multiple business purposes. Compiling, hosting and processing petabytes of data for a single business process rarely makes for sound financial fundamentals or good use of scarce skill sets.Although many Big Data investments may start out as either speculative experiments or focused entrepreneurial efforts, ultimate strategies should include expanding the utility of the data, algorithms, skills and technologies for additional business functions.Ensure infrastructure adequacyFor its part, IT needs to ensure that the technology infrastructure is sufficient for the multifaceted demands of big data. Many traditional and even state-of-the-art technologies were not designed for analytical processing or traditional data warehousing – at least not for today’s or tomorrow’s combinations of data volume, velocity and variety.IT generally defaults to extending existing systems capabilities to meet new processing demands. But since generating business value from big data are so urgent and potentially impactful, merely waiting on technology evolution is sometimes not an option. The strategy to “extend” needs to be tempered by knowing the limits of one’s current technology portfolio when larger, faster and more diverse data needs to be managed and analysed. Investing in new purpose-built technologies may be necessary.Prepare for business risksBig data also raises the spectre of significant risk to business brand and compliance. Data sources frequently include personal, sensitive or proprietary information that can be more prone to mishandling and misuse. Even when individual data sources themselves do not contain explicit information, the integration of multiple sources may enable triangulation, or a so-called “mosaic effect,” that could expose corporate secrets or identify individuals.This risk can be especially perilous when information is intended to be shared outside the organisation with business partners, suppliers, customers, trade organisations or government.Therefore, Big Data strategies, as rogue as the efforts may be, must consider governance, controls, monitoring and even contingency plans.Expand existing analytic skillsAnalytics is the Number 1 use of big data, yet common business intelligence packages are limited in their analytic capacity – particularly with unstructured data or analytics beyond hindsight-oriented reporting and extrapolation.Big Data efforts demand looking beyond traditional query and reporting capabilities to consider predictive analytics, data, text and even multimedia mining, increasingly illustrative and layered forms of visualisation, complex event processing, rule engines and natural language query.Understanding how to apply these capabilities demands a range of skills, but the new talent required to manage and leverage these information assets is in exceptionally short supply. These skills include data integration and preparation, business and analytic modelling, collaboration and communication, and creativity.The role of the data scientist is emerging as somewhat of a panacea, not only for generating new insights, but also for finding ways to use available data in automating and optimising business processes.Alter organisation structuresBig data initiatives have a strong tendency to stretch and test traditional IT organisations in unique ways. Most are badly equipped to deal with an individual business unit’s desires or attempts to manage and leverage big data on its own – often outside the context of traditional data warehouses and business intelligence efforts.Chief information officers must be prepared to effect the necessary changes because resisting them to maintain IT standards and the status quo will result in being shut out of enterprise strategy dialogues. Because big data initiatives are especially demanding on the partnerships between IT and the core business, it’s essential that both groups weigh the necessary strategies and planning to maximise the organisation’s return on big data initiatives.Doug Laney covers business analytics solutions and projects, performance management, and data-governance-related issues at Gartner and Mark Beyer is the co-leader of big data research at Gartner, and covers traditional data warehousing, data integration and information management practices.Previous articles in our Big Data series:Part 1: What Big Data means for businessPart 2: Building a ‘Big Data’ strategyPart 3: The art of Big Data innovation."
74;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-07-23T18:10:01Z;Cisco Systems to acquire Sourcefire for $2.7bn;Analysts expect surge in cybersecurity consolidation as demand for threat protection grows;Cisco Systems agreed to buy cybersecurity firm Sourcefire for $2.7bn, as the technology company looks to meet the growing demand for protection against computer and network attacks.Sourcefire earned $5m in after-tax profit last year on $223m in revenue. Cisco will pay $76 per share for the Columbia, Maryland-based company, about 29 per cent higher than the company’s closing price on Monday of $59.08.“This can’t be just a pure revenue buy,” said Adam Hils, research director at Gartner, the analyst. “If I were Cisco, I’d be looking for ways to use Sourcefire’s security expertise to do something unique in the industry.”Cisco has fallen behind smaller competitors such as Palo Alto Networks and Check Point with its cybersecurity offerings. The number of customers that have bought Cisco’s technology for preventing cyber intruders has been decreasing, Mr Hils said. Sourcefire, whose revenues increased 35 per cent last year, will give the company a new standalone offering to make it more competitive.Christopher Young, senior vice-president of Cisco’s security group, said the acquisition brings a product that is simpler to deploy and better addresses the complexity of today’s cyber attacks.“The notion of the ‘perimeter’ no longer exists and today’s sophisticated threats are able to circumvent traditional, disparate security products,” he said in a statement. “Organisations require continuous and pervasive advanced threat protection.”Researchers from FBR Capital Markets called the deal the “tip of the iceberg” in an approaching surge of mergers and acquisitions in the cybersecurity market over the next 12 to 18 months. The deal follows the acquisition of another web security provider, Websense, by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, last month.“There is more consolidation on the horizon,” Mr Hils said.Large companies such as IBM, Juniper, Symantec and EMS could look to acquire smaller security companies such as Check Point or Fortinet, FBR researchers wrote in a note.The Cisco-Sourcefire deal is expected to close in the second half of the year, pending regulatory reviews. Cisco said earnings in 2014 would be slightly diluted as a result of the purchase.Shares in Cisco closed 0.6 per cent lower at $25.56 on Tuesday.Sourcefire’s stock price jumped 27.8 per cent to close at $75.49.
75;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-07-22T20:44:50Z;Getting the most from your IT investments;;Even after years of cost optimisation, most organisations still spend almost two-thirds of their IT investments on non-differentiating capabilities. These are viewed as ‘running costs’, as opposed to investments that are perceived as growing or even transforming the business.The challenge with the current approach to managing IT-enabled investments is that it leaves little room for the initiatives that business executives say are most critical for business growth and transformation, such as business analytics and customer experience management.To improve IT’s yield and impact on business performance, organisations need to take a different approach to how they invest in IT. The first step should be to harmonise discordant views among stakeholders as to which are the ‘right’ IT investments. If the goal is to invest in the ‘right’ things, there is an implication that the chief information officer and top executives know what those things are. Yet, Gartner’s work with clients suggests that the major players in the IT investment scenario often have very different views of what the right things are.Investment priorities can vary significantly. The chief executive might be looking for technology-enabled capabilities that support revenue growth and innovation ( for example, customer experience, product development and sales optimisation), while the chief financial officer favours capabilities that support increased cost-efficiency, workforce productivity and profitability. At the same time, the chief information officer is keen to invest in capabilities that support business initiatives, balanced with investments in keeping the IT environment current and maintainable. However, business unit heads want to give priority to capabilities that support individual units’ profit and loss targets.It is important to acknowledge that each stakeholder group has different goals and ideas about how IT can best support the enterprise. Business change steering committees and other governance forums can develop harmonised views on major investments involving IT. However, consensus will not always be possible. At those moments, C-level executives must decide what is best and hold everyone accountable for the results. If priorities are not clear, and are not reflected in IT spending, value is damaged.IT financial transparency - the ability to comprehensively understand the impact of IT spending on business performance - can shed a lot of light on which are the ‘right’ IT-enabled investments for the enterprise. Of course the ‘right’ investments - those that deliver the most business impact - can change over time.Additionally, not all organisations view IT in the same light when it comes to strategic impact. Therefore, there is no single IT investment profile that is ‘right’ for all enterprises. For these reasons, it is essential to use the business strategy to plan the level of IT investment over the long term. Best-in-class organisations often put in place an investment plan that will gradually change the ratio of IT investments in the run/grow/transform model to meet the needs of the business.The table below shows how the run costs as a percentage of overall IT spending differ depending on the status of the organisation.Strategic IT investments often pay back over three to five years or more, and therefore, organisations that wish to improve the yield from IT-driven investments need to balance 12-month ROI projects with longer-term investments. Too often, enterprise leaders require all IT projects to deliver ROI within a year or so. To wean leaders off this obsession with ‘quick payback’, IT leaders must be able to quantify and communicate the benefits of their long-term investments. Specific key performance indicators (KPIs) are essential to focus stakeholders on the issue of business impact and to illuminate how the financial benefits will actually be achieved.Even with these provisos in place, there remain many reasons why organisations fail to invest in the right things, but these six obstacles are amongst the most common to be aware of:PoliticsThe notion that IT is a service organisation that exists to ‘respond to customer demand’ is flawed in these days of austerity. Most IT organisations cannot fulfil all the requests that are coming their way, and the enterprise has no hope of investing in the right things from an IT perspective unless it drops the idea that IT exists to respond to both the strategic needs and the needs of every user and business unit lead in the organisation. Choices must be made, because the enterprise cannot maximise value until the team resources are consistently devoted to the highest priorities.Poor IT Financial TransparencyCost transparency is improving, but there are still many enterprises that cannot ‘follow the money’ from a cost or value perspective when it comes to IT investments.Lack of Accountability for Investment ResultsHistorically, business stakeholders could request IT-enabled capabilities without being held accountable for their long-term ownership or the derived business value. This led to excessive and redundant IT systems that were often not sustained with ongoing investment. This approach works counter to investing in the right things, because it usually means that too many ‘orphaned’ IT systems exist, consuming investment funds that could be better spent elsewhere.Inability to Divest IT AssetsIf an organisation is unable to pull back on certain investments, it will be constrained from investing in the right things. Pulling back on IT-enabled investments can mean anything from cancelling a project to retiring an obsolete system.Low Tolerance for RiskOrganisations that are highly risk-averse tend to overdeliver on IT service levels and generally spend too much trying to eliminate all risk. Further, they fail to make IT investments that seem risky or cannot be justified with a short-term ROI. The fact is that risk can be managed, but not eliminated, and most organisations can tolerate more risk in their environments than they think. Gartner research shows that large-scale IT investments often don’t pay back fully (in terms of business impact) for five years or more. So, limiting IT investments to those that are ‘sure things’ with quick payback is the equivalent of buying no-risk investments: The investor can be assured of a meagre return.Lack of IT Involvement in Business StrategyIf an organisation wants to ensure that it is investing in the right things, the first step is to include the CIO and the discussion of IT issues in the business’ strategic planning process.Mr Solanki is a research director at Gartner.

76;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-07-11T21:53:51Z;The art of Big Data innovation;;"In business, we often deal with hype around trends in society, politics, economy and technology. We know we need to take claims of the next big thing with a grain of salt and that we should be careful not to set expectations too high. However, with big data, the opposite is true. The hype that accompanies it actually conceals the enormity of its impact on the way we do business.In order to understand the value of big data, it is important to realise that it is neither merely about “big” nor about “data.” When I speak with chief information officers and IT leaders at Gartner Symposium/ITxpo, this is one of the issues they struggle with understanding.The “big” part refers to the high-volume, high-velocity and high-variety nature of the information assets. But volume is only one aspect, and in many cases not the most difficult issue to overcome. The same goes for the velocity with which the data flows.The technologies to handle this may not be familiar, but they do exist. Instead, most of the value and challenge is in getting the most out of the new variety in the data. Current business cases in big data show meaningful combinations of smartphone location data, video feeds, internal process data, text documents and the weather forecast; just to name some of the various types of big data available today.When it comes to the “data,” it’s important to realise that the emphasis is on a different understanding of the value of information. This occurs by shifting from a traditional top-down sense, with an existing business question in mind that requires an answer, to valuing new ideas and new opportunities that emerge from all kinds of data, through a process of induction.Where Big Data SucceedsGartner called 2013 the year of experimentation for big data – a year in which companies other than Internet retailers, large and small, start to discover the value of big data for their organisations. During this time, hundreds of useful business cases have emerged. Clearly, organisations see the biggest potential in improving customer insight and interaction. But when looking at where investments have gone so far, process improvement leads the way.Operational ExcellenceIt makes sense to start exploring big data opportunities for process improvement before moving to customer value. It is always a good idea to have your shop in order before you start advertising.Asset-intensive industries, such as telecom, manufacturers, utilities and transportation, can build a strong business case to outfit equipment with sensors that help with “predictive asset maintenance.” By measuring vibration, sound or variations, maintenance on equipment doesn’t have to come by surprise. The cost of unplanned maintenance can be driven down. This is an area that is called operational technology, or OT.The leaders in this area are not your typical IT companies, but they come from manufacturing. Think, for instance, of GE and Siemens. GE especially has made a dramatic strategic move, building a value proposition based on sensor-based data streams, instead of positioning the specifics of a new engine or windmill.Other existing business cases receive new life from big data such as sales and production forecasting. More information about target audience demographics, the weather and social media activity on certain topics may improve the quality of the forecast, as well as increase the periodicity. Monthly forecasts may become daily ones, or even become event-driven.Customer IntimacyBy far the most widely recognised business case for big data are sentiment analysis. Through structured analysis of unstructured data such as social media, organisations can determine their reputation or that of their products and services in the market, and get clues on how reputation may be changing. Sometimes this can go very quickly, and immediate response is required. Targeted advertising and recommendations are another popular category. Sentiment analysis has become such an accessible analytic, and there are so many service providers offering it, that it is hard for any organisation, public sector or commercial, to justify why they are not using it.Risk ManagementBig data are very often used for fraud management. Graph analytics, in particular, can help in detecting fraud rings. By understanding relationships in the data, hidden commonalities can be discovered. In some instances, people who commit fraud share a certain location, are from a similar age group, or are seemingly disconnected companies sharing common ownership. The results are real. Not only in terms of business value, but they also lead to societal impact. The newspapers recently reported that in Europe, where healthcare is often less privatised, various insurance companies have uncovered claims fraud by dentists and other healthcare providers who were using diagnostic codes that didn’t match real procedures.Banks often use big data for improving credit scoring, using graph analytics to include social relationships as an indicator of risk, or better yet, credibility. In an ironic twist, modern technology is reinventing old values in community banking to provide knowledge that a certain family is good for its money, even though family members growing up haven’t shown that behaviour themselves yet.New BusinessPerhaps the most exciting business cases come from a new value discipline: treating information as a product in itself. Utilities and banks already provide their customers with personalised dashboards about their use of financial products or energy. Remote patient monitoring is a growth business for healthcare providers or life science companies. Wearable computing introduced a category called “personal analytics,” where consumers can measure and share health indicators such as heart rate, blood pressure and calorie consumption.Industry InspirationSuccess falls to those organisations who creatively embrace big data. However, it’s also important to note that inspiration often comes from other industries. A big data scenario from travel and transportation can, for instance, be used in retail for automated store task management. In this instance, a train company uses video feeds of its cabin safety cameras to provide information to travellers at the next station about which cabins still have enough seats available.A retailer can leverage this to count how many people enter the supermarket, combine that data with an understanding of the average shopping time on a weekend in rainy weather conditions to help predict when to open up a new cash register.In another example, shopping malls can learn from the games industry. By tracking through a smartphone where mall visitors are, coupons can be shared on the spot. Additionally, visitors earn points by tracking how many stores they visit and are promoted to the next level.In conclusion, big data are not about just handling volume, nor is it about data. It is about creativity. Combine technology advancements with human ingenuity and the possibilities are endless.Mr Buytendijk specialises in information management strategies, big data and analytics at Gartner.Previous articles in our Big Data seriesPart 1: What Big Data means for businessPart 2: Building a ‘Big Data’ strategy"
77;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-07-10T22:22:25Z;PC shipments fall for fifth consecutive quarter;Consumers turn to inexpensive tablets over desktop or laptops;The global personal computer market suffered another setback in the second quarter as shipments fell for the fifth quarter in a row, the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC market.Shipments dropped to 76m units, a nearly 11 per cent decline for the second quarter compared to last year, as consumers turned to inexpensive tablets over desktop or laptop computers, especially in new markets, according to a report released on Wednesday by Gartner, the research company.“In emerging markets, inexpensive tablets have become the first computing device for many people, who at best are deferring the purchase of a PC,” said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner. “This is also accounting for the collapse of the mini notebook market.”IDC, another research company, measured shipments at 76.5m units, an 11.4 per cent decline.The figures reinforce the argument of groups supporting the proposed Dell buyout, which shareholders are set to vote on next week. Institutional Shareholder Services, an investor advisory group, said this week that shareholders were being offered a good price in the buyout considering the crumbling PC market.If approved, they would see the risk of further decline shifted to Michael Dell, Dell’s founder and chief executive, whose move to buy back his company was described by advisers as “trying to catch a falling knife”.Dell, however, performed better than the overall market in the third quarter, with shipments falling only 4 per cent. It maintained its number three position behind Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard.Regionally, the decline was the worst in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which showed a 16.8 per cent decline because of poor economic conditions that muted consumer spending. Asia was also weak at an 11.5 per cent decline, driven by China. The outlook for both regions remains low as sellers are stuck with leftover inventory, and remain cautious about the upcoming back-to-school season.The US market showed signs of improvement. Although shipments were down for the seventh consecutive quarter, they were down significantly less than previous quarters. Shipments fell just 1.4 per cent in the second quarter to 15m units compared to the same quarter last year, according to Gartner.Both IDC and Gartner attributed the US improvement to commercial sales, suggesting a push from companies upgrading to Windows 7 in anticipation of Microsoft ending technical support for the previous version, Windows XP, next April.IDC analysts also attributed stabilisation in the US market to a levelling off of the time consumers wait before replacing an old PC.“The end result should be more PC replacements, even if consumers and companies are selective in making replacements and wait until PCs are older before replacing them,” said Bob O’Donnell, program vice-president for IDC.
78;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-07-08T17:20:17Z;Q&A on worldwide IT spending outlook;;"Business conditions remain challenging this year, constraining any significant expansion in the level of overall enterprise IT investment according to Gartner, the IT research firm, which released its latest outlook on IT spending last week.While global macroeconomic conditions are showing tentative signs of improvement, even in the Eurozone, risks remain, mostly notably in China, and geo-political uncertainties are on the rise. But despite these headwinds, strategic investment in IT continues.I asked Richard Gordon, managing vice president at Gartner, what is driving growth this year, and how the IT industry is likely to perform in the long-term.What is the latest outlook for worldwide IT spending?The 2013 dollar-valued IT spending is expected to be $3,700bn, a 2.0 per cent increase over 2012. Long term growth is expected to average a compound annual rate of 3.6 per cent from 2012 through 2017, which mean annual IT spending should reach $4,400bn in 2017.While there are many trends that are underpinning IT spending growth, including mobility which we delve into more deeply this quarter, current uncertainties surrounding the geo-political and macroeconomic environments are the ever-present anchor to IT spending growth.We have reduced our forecast for IT spending growth this year from 4.1 per cent in our first quarter outlook. However it is worth noting that currency movements account for a 1.6 percentage point drop, which means that our underlying revision has only been revised slightly downward by 0.5 percentage points.What is the most surprising finding in the first quarter 2013 worldwide IT spending outlook?Regional variations are interesting this quarter, with Japan being a real standout. Forecast IT spending in Japan has been increased by nearly 2 per cent in constant dollars despite current dollar spending growth being reduced by 8.9 percentage points. Contradictory as it may seem, this is actually in line with Japan’s improved near-term gross domestic product outlook on the one hand and the sharp decline in the value of the yen versus the US dollar on the other.Constant currency spending growth in most regions this year has been lowered. However, for Western Europe constant currency growth has been inched up slightly as strategic IT initiatives in the region will continue despite a poor economic outlook.Once again the devices market is in the spotlight. In 2012, spending on mobile phones increased driven by the higher average selling prices (ASPs), commanded by popular handsets including Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy devices at the premium end of the market.This year we are seeing a reversal of trend in the device space; consumers are delaying handset upgrades and pushing phone replacements into 2014, low-cost basic tablets are taking market share from premium tablets and PC sales continue to decline.Although mobile devices continue to grab attention, it is important to also consider the more abstract concept of “mobility”, one of Gartner’s ‘Nexus of Forces’ (social, mobile, cloud and information).How is the drive towards mobility affecting the IT spending?We can think about the impact of mobility on our forecasts in two ways. Market segments and business models related to technologies in the form of products and services (for example IT Spending) that either enables mobile behaviour in end users (e.g. devices, applications software,) or builds infrastructure, which facilitates mobile behaviour in end users (e.g. data center systems, infrastructure software, enterprise IT services, telecom services.)The impact on the devices market is clear - its current volatility is rooted in the surge of interest in new and emerging mobile devices. The explosion of mobile devices, in number, variety and use is just the starting point for cascade of requirements; higher bandwidth, secure and reliable networks, new applications, and business support for ‘bring-your-own-device (BYOD.)The telecommunication services industry is reshaping around the delivery of mobile data, which will grow from 23 per cent of the market in 2012 to 36 per cent in 2017. The impacts in software, services and data center systems is more muted, but evident. Without the surge in mobility requirements and the emergence of BYOD in the workplace, networking equipment, storage and server spend would be declining.Infrastructure software has seen a spike in growth in virtual hosted desktop, configuration management, secure web gateway and other products related to managing devices and securely providing them with content and/or access. It is the cascade of requirements that start with more mobile devices that is most interesting: more devices need more connection; more connections need more infrastructure, more storage, more security…The nature of this mix is changing dramatically and there are clear winners and losers over the next three to five years, as we see more devices needing more connection; more connections needing more custom applications, more infrastructures, more storage, and more security."
79;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-06-25T13:09:00Z;India telecoms: early price skirmishes for data customers;;"You know that things are serious when companies are willing to engage in a price war.India’s telecoms companies have been pushing data services for a while in their marketing campaigns. But now they are stepping up the battle for customers – by competing hard on rates.The price wars began last week, as Vodafone slashed data charges on 2G networks by 80 per cent to 2p per 10KB in the Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh West, and Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh areas, saying it will extend the discount to the rest of the country in stages.“This will, of course, accelerate data adoption,” Kamlesh Bhatia, an analyst at Gartner, told beyondbrics.“The idea is to start getting some momentum on the data side and building some top line growth with respect to data. They expect that 3G data will pick up and they want to create price differentiation between 2G and 3G, which is then positioned as a slightly more premium offering – until LTE [4G] comes along that is.”Now, Bharti Airtel has reduced charges for 4G data services to similar levels to its 3G offering. And Tata DoCoMo has joined the party, cutting its 2G and 3G mobile internet rates by 90 per cent across the country from July 1.India is a price-sensitive market, so these moves are likely to encourage a lot of customers to start using data services. But analysts say the low prices aren’t here to stay – as with many price wars, the cuts are just to lure customers in. Once they’re hooked, price rises are expected in the next year or two, leading to an overall increase in revenues.As the sector matures, expansion in the voice services segment is petering off. The growth in voice traffic slowed to around 9 per cent in the year ended March 31, from 15 per cent in the previous year and 26 per cent the year before that, according to data from Motilal Oswal.On the other hand, mobile internet services pose a big opportunity. Analysis from KPMG says that at the end of 2012 there were 124m internet connections, up 41 per cent in the year. Mobile access played a big part in that, with fixed line connections growing just 11 per cent, while wireless connections were up by almost 50 per cent.As companies compete for this part of the market, competition is tight. Bhatia adds: “The power of pricing is in the hands just two or three operators in India at the moment as the other operators have gone belly up.”That could be another big change: consolidation. With a Supreme Court decision forcing operators to spend large amounts rebidding for spectrum, many have scaled back operations already. The top three operators in India – Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular – now have a total 69 per cent market share in revenue terms, the highest proportion ever.But there are still a few too many competitors for the market to be profitable.“The market has to consolidate,” says Prashant Singhal, of Ernst & Young. “What we are waiting for is M&A guidelines from the DOT [Department of Telecommunications] then we will see a lot of activity.”Growth in data services usage and fewer competitors – music to the ears of some telcos.Related reading:

80;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-06-24T17:58:08Z;Tablets’ growth to prop up gadgets market;;Small, lightweight tablets will drive most of the growth in the computing hardware market this year, analysts forecast, as sales of PCs continue to fall and smartphone upgrades slow.Gartner, the market researcher, forecasts tablet shipments will increase by 67.9 per cent this year compared with 2012, at a time when the overall device market – including PCs and mobiles – will grow only 5.9 per cent.The outlook comes in advance of the release of a new range of tablets in the second half of 2013, including an upgraded iPad mini, Google’s new Nexus 7 and lower-priced Galaxy Tabs by Samsung.However, Gartner has pared back its tablet forecasts in recent months as consumers snap up “basic” 7- and 8-inch devices, while enterprise buyers look to “hybrid” laptops with detachable screens, running Windows 8, squeezing out larger and higher-priced tablets.Android’s dominance of the device market is only set to increase, thanks largely to growth in mobile phones. Gartner forecasts that 37 per cent of all devices shipped, including PCs, will run Android this year, up from 23 per cent last year, and rising to 42 per cent in 2014.Nonetheless, Apple’s iOS is the only operating system with a substantial presence across both tablets and mobile phones, as Android remains concentrated in cheaper smartphones and Windows fails to break out of the PC market, which is set to decline 10.6 per cent this year, according to Gartner.“The iPad remains the benchmark for what a tablet should be,” says Carolina Milanesi, research vice-president at Gartner.“Android has been struggling to make a stand in the enterprise space on the tablet side and with Windows 8 now coming they lost an opportunity there. It will be interesting to see whether Google wants to focus on Android or Chromebooks in the enterprise.”Google recently replaced its head of Android, Andy Rubin, with Sundar Pichai, who now oversees both its Chrome browser and its netbook operating system, and the Android platform.A new version of its Nexus 7 tablet, launched last June, is expected to go on sale with a higher-resolution screen and low price compared to the $329 iPad mini. Samsung on Monday said that its latest Galaxy Tab 3 devices would go on sale next month, starting at $199 for the 7-inch version.Analysts expect Apple to bring out a new iPad mini in the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as upgrading its larger iPad to a new, slimmer design. Sales of the iPad mini accounted for 60 per cent of overall iOS sales in the first quarter of 2013, Gartner estimates.The success of these smaller, lighter tablets and the slowing pace of improvement in smartphone hardware prompts more consumers to hold off upgrading their mobile phones for longer, Ms Milanesi says.Gartner cut its forecast for growth in the mobile phone market from about 7 per cent to 4.3 per cent this year.“We continue to see fatigue in the replacement cycle,” Ms Milanesi says. “Even with the hot devices like the iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S4, it is hard to keep the initial momentum going. Consumers are saying they’ll hang on to the same phone for another year and spend some money on a tablet instead.”
81;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-06-13T18:45:01Z;Finance chiefs’ influence over IT growing;;"Amid all the signs that corporate investment in IT is on the rise, the latest research shows that the chief financial officer’s influence over IT investments has increased considerably over the past two years.According to a joint study by Gartner, the leading IT research firm, and the Financial Executives Research Foundation (FERF), the research affiliate of Financial Executives International (FEI), chief financial officers’ influence over IT spending has increased by 44 per cent over the past 24 months reflecting the growing importance of IT in business strategy.The survey, based on the responses of 237 senior financial executives in North America, highlights the expanding influence of the chief financial officer and the fact that a significant number of corporate IT leaders still report to the company finance chief.It also confirms that chief financial officers are focusing on business intelligence and (data) analytics as top priorities for IT investments.I asked John van Decker, research vice-president at Gartner, to share some of the findings from the survey. Here is an edited version of the conversation.Just how much influence does the chief financial officer have over IT?The chief financial officer’s influence over IT is consistent and, in many organisations, is growing rapidly. Over the years we have seen an increasingly large percentage of chief financial officers ‘owning’ the IT function, and this year’s responses show that 39 per cent of IT organisations currently report to the chief financial officer.This demonstrates the need for companies to ensure that their finance chiefs are educated in technology, and underscores just how critical it is that chief information officers and chief financial officers have a common understanding of how to leverage enterprise technology.Why is the chief financial officer’s influence over IT investments on the rise?In the sample of organisations that participated in the Gartner FEI chief financial officer Technology Study, the chief financial officer’s influence has increased by 44 per cent compared to two years ago.Thirty eight per cent of those surveyed believe that this increased influence is due to the chief financial officer being an enabler of corporate strategy, and, viewing IT as key to that strategy.Even in organisations where chief financial officers are not responsible for IT, and therefore not necessarily a key sponsoring executive or key stakeholder for IT, chief financial officers are increasingly becoming major decision makers for technology investments because they generally control an organisation’s budget and are involved in scrutinising the largest-value items.What are today’s key IT priorities for chief financial officers and what will matter going forwards?The study shows that 15 of the top 19 business processes that chief financial officers have identified as requiring improved technology support are largely addressed by business intelligence (BI) and analytics, and performance management technologies.The top business process area that was identified as requiring technology investment is to facilitate analysis and decision making (59 per cent, up from 57 per cent in 2012), followed by the ongoing monitoring of business performance (50 per cent), and then collaboration and knowledge management (45 per cent, down from 52 per cent in 2012.)This clearly demonstrates that business intelligence is becoming less of a chief information officer responsibility and more of a chief financial officer and line-of-business responsibility.However, the fact that these results are consistent with those of the last five years shows that organisations are still struggling to make progress with BI and analytics. Many IT organisations have made initial investments, but these tend to be tactically focused and don’t address the more fundamental issues of data quality and consistency, which require chief financial officers and finance teams to work closely with BI specialists in IT.Corporate performance management (CPM) projects are the highest on the chief financial officer’s BI initiatives list, according to the survey. The top four priorities in this area are addressed by CPM suites, including performance scorecard; budgeting, planning and forecast; financial consolidation; and profitability management.The survey also found that chief financial officers’ understanding of the ‘Nexus of Forces’ (cloud, mobile, big data and social) is impacting chief financial officer investment priorities. Enterprises are being challenged to adapt as the nexus of social, mobile, cloud and information and the data that results from their adoption expand exponentially. Social scored low in terms of technology initiatives, but mobile, cloud (including software as a service [SaaS]) and information are priorities.Although these nexus capabilities will become more of a concern in 2014 and beyond, IT organisations must communicate how more-effective business platforms can be leveraged to deliver better architectures for business applications that are “top of mind” for the chief financial officer.For example, it would make sense to include the chief financial officer in mobile device deployment to allow him or her to access finance information and analytics. At the same time, chief financial officers are clearly sceptical about the potential of social technologies, so any investments in this area must be clearly related to business strategies and realisable benefits.What are the next steps for chief financial officers and IT?It’s encouraging to see chief financial officers taking a more proactive and engaged role in the IT investments that their companies are making. This will be crucial if organisations are to truly establish a new strategy for IT investment that responds to the desire of business to use technology to establish sustainable differentiation and drive innovative new processes, while continuing to provide a secure and cost-effective environment to support core business processes.John Van Decker is a research vice-president at Gartner, Inc. focusing on corporate performance management and financial management systems"
82;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-06-05T16:12:16Z;SAP snaps up Hybris in customer-relations coup;Company seen to act decisively to raise stakes in customer relations;Germany’s SAP added to a blistering week for business technology acquisitions by agreeing to acquire Hybris, a Swiss e-commerce software company, in order to boost its competitiveness in customer-relationship management.SAP conceded it had paid a transaction multiple “consistent with other high-growth assets”. Two sources close to the deal put the transaction value at a high triple digit million euro amount, or roughly $1bn. However, the two parties declined to confirm that figure.Hybris has more than 600 employees and had more than $100m estimated revenues in 2012.SAP’s further push into e-commerce applications takes place after rival Salesforce.com passed the German company last year as the leading vendor of customer relationship management software, according to Gartner, the consultancy.SAP’s lacklustre growth in this sector was a potential problem for the company as it views helping businesses to analyse consumer behaviour and to process vast quantities of customer data via the web and mobile devices as an important source of future growth.Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP co-chief executive, said: “It’s not about [playing] catch-up. It’s about defining the next generation CRM.”SAP plans to link Hybris to its Hana in-memory computing technology to help companies spot purchasing trends and target sales incentives in real-time.Bill McDermott, SAP’s other chief executive, described the Hybris acquisition as a “game changer”. “We are here to talk over the CRM marketplace,” he added.Last year SAP paid $4.3bn for Ariba, a cloud-based business-to-business network that helps companies collaborate in areas such as sourcing, invoicing and payment.“With corporate cash at all-time highs, many vendors are willing to pay high premiums to acquire specific technologies and expertise in an increasingly dynamic and competitive CRM market environment,” Joanne Correia, vice-president at Gartner, told clients in a recent report.SAP has long been considered a potential suitor for Hybris but the possibility of a quick transaction seemed to recede in March when Hybris completed a $30m funding round.On that occasion Meritech Capital Partners and Greylock Israel joined as shareholders alongside Hybris’ main investor HGGC, a mid-market private equity firm based in California.Based in Zug, Switzerland, Hybris has grown rapidly in recently years and its customers include H&M, Starbucks and Nespresso. Ariel Luedi, Hybris’ chief executive since 2004, is a former senior vice-president of European sales at Salesforce.comThis week IBM and Salesforce.com made acquisitions totalling a combined $4.5bn to boost their cloud computing offering. The Hybris transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2013. Hybris will operate as an independent business unit of SAP and will retain its existing management team.
83;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-06-04T18:46:16Z;Building a ‘Big Data’ strategy;;We can now predict fires in the Amazon rainforest six months before they occur by analysing sea surface data, help arrest a shoplifter who tweets outside the store by analysing social sentiment and geolocation data, and determine whether surgery is the best course of action for a patient by assessing trends across large numbers of lung cancer patients.The data-driven economy is upon us. First-generation internet companies such as Google and Amazon, have demonstrated “data alchemy” - turning data into gold - and now others realise that great opportunity can be seized by using big data and the big ideas that come along with it.But generating ideas and knowing which ones to pursue is difficult. One way to get started with big data is to conceive scenarios of extracting insights for decision-making and operational efficiency by taking advantage of the “four internets.” Separately identifiable, virtual Internets of people, of things, of data and of ideas are emerging to enable broader collaboration and knowledge, but are also an invaluable source of big data to fuel advances in business capabilities.The Internet of PeopleThe Internet of People is represented by the set of interconnected information about individuals, including their social and collective activities and interests, their attitudes, and their images, audio and video. This can offer segmented and holistic views on human behavior, perceptions and interactions in space and time. At its core, it is about customer centricity. Businesses can explore the use of big data by asking the ultimate question ‘What can I do together with you?’ instead of the more traditional, ‘what can I do to you?’The Internet of People allows organisations to expand business processes beyond the borders of the enterprise. This enables the fashion industry, for example, to find the next craze before it occurs by analysing what people talk about in social media. Or, companies can invite customers to help solve problems and exploit opportunities by giving them rewards and incentives or find what makes individuals more positive or negative and adjust the business accordingly.In another scenario, businesses identify what they wanted to know all along about the customer - if they had unlimited capabilities. Big data technologies can help find patterns for areas such as, who are the customers of our customers? What do our patients, accountable for the highest costs, have in common? How do we make connections between seemingly disparate people, places and events to detect fraud?The Internet of ThingsThe Internet of Things is the data that represents the connections between the physical and digital worlds. It is growing at an unprecedented rate because of the lowering cost of the components that are turning “things” into parts of a network. Whenever there is a possibility to get information about a physical object or a process by instrumenting it with sensors, RFID tags, transmitters, GPSs, logs and other means of sending information via wired or wireless networks, there are opportunities to analyse the data and find new patterns.Sensors can transmit information from the hardest-to-reach places, such as a working engine, a human body or a pipeline segment in a remote location.McKenney, the mechanical contractor firm, developed Business Intelligence for Buildings by tracking trends and performance over extended periods. It optimises the uses of energy, water and indoor air quality across hundreds of buildings to achieve new levels of cost efficiency, such as reducing energy usage by 5 per cent to 10 per cent. In another example, Jawbone Up is a personal system that combines a wristband and phone application to track how people sleep, move and eat to know themselves better and make smarter choices to feel better.To utilise event-driven data from things, companies explore how to prevent undesirable events such as device breakdowns, traffic jams or cyberattacks. They can also assess how to maximise positive events. These include areas such as reordering parts, administering medication or finding parking on a busy street.The Internet of DataThe Internet of Data is about bridging information silos to understand physical, societal and business environments. It achieves this by connecting data at scale, both inside and outside the enterprise.The most obvious characteristic of the Internet of Data is variety: text, logs, images, video and geolocation, combined into a data fabric, to hold the information that organisations wanted to have all along. The accelerating liberation of data is the sign of a more open society and, consequently, more open and available information. Many governments provide data about demographics, economy, weather and the well-being of their citizens. Commercial entities seek to monetise their own data.Companies should seek data-derived opportunities by detecting behavior in groups, fraud or life cycle patterns to gain new or even breakthrough insights. For example, because of linking and analysing longitudinal patient data, family history, genetics and reference data, a healthcare provider can discover a new treatment for a particular patient based on treatment results for “similar” patients.Or, companies can develop data-driven business models and information products by combining their own data, data sources from partners, and purchased information or open data. It’s also important to drive business strategy by making data-driven choices and find where evidence-based analysis can substitute or complement a “gut feel.”The Internet of IdeasThe Internet of Ideas is about the power of connected minds. It involves humans at scale and aggregates individual ideas about societal, business and physical environments through crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, leveraging open-source products and integrating ideas from outside the enterprise.In 2000, Goldcorp made an unprecedented decision to open up its proprietary geological data for the “Goldcorp challenge,” a public competition to find gold in its Canadian mine. Out of the top five entries, four have been drilled, and all four struck gold. Since then, Goldcorp has grown from a $100m company to a $9bn company.The complementary strengths of humans and technologies are mutually reinforcing. Opportunities for finding cost-effective solutions that involve human touch include business processes where instead of separating people, organisations combine human and machine intelligence for better outcomes or make decisions by relying on machine analytics. Think of the two mediocre players who used a laptop running a commercial chess program to best the chess machine that had beaten a grand master on its own.The Internet of Ideas also provides solutions for getting new ideas from outside sources or that need multiple perspectives or statistically significant representation of participants. Factual, a location-based technology company, maintains a crowdsourced definitive database of 66m local business and point-of-interest listings across 50 countries. In this case, submissions by thousands of people create detailed information that could not be obtained without individual inputs on a mass scale. Organisations can treat human minds as an equally possible analytical and business solution to find scenarios where they can benefit from crowdsourcing, crowdfunding and the expansion of enterprise borders.New opportunities require the mental shift toward accepting big data realities. Organisations must revisit the problems that were once impossible or impractical to solve: the answers were contained in the data all along, but they were hard to extract with old technologies.When organisations allow themselves to ask bigger questions of people, things, data and ideas in today’s interconnected world, they can find new answers to derive business value from big data.Svetlana Sicular is a research director at Gartner covering data governance, enterprise information management strategy and big data.

84;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-06-04T08:34:22Z;Vodafone India: new tax tussles;;"Thought Vodafone India had had its fair share of disputes with Indian telecoms regulators? Well, it’s not done yet.The Indian arm of the British service provider has now been fined Rs12.6bn ($220m) by India’s Department of Telecommunications for allegedly understating revenues in the 2008-09 and 2010-11 fiscal years, according to local press reports.It isn’t clear what the department has deemed a realistic figure for each year but Vodafone reported revenues of £2.7bn (Rs233.7bn) and £3.9bn in the years ended in March 2009 and March 2011, respectively.The company is not commenting on the matter.“Not all details are out there but clearly the role of the DoT [Department of Telecommunications] is to define the ethical standards and they’re doing that,” Kamlesh Bhatia, a telecoms analyst at Gartner, told beyondbrics. “But where I think the gap is, is in understanding what comprises gross revenues. Does that include non-telecoms services, interest, forex and those sorts of things?”For Vodafone, this is just another front in an ongoing battle with the department. The company has been at loggerheads with the Indian regulator of late; from the Rs112bn tax dispute over capital gains connected to the company’s acquisition of Hutchison Essar back in 2007, to confusion over whether 3G operators are allowed to offer services using one another’s airwaves with inter-circle roaming pacts.In the fiscal year ended March 31, Vodafone reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £1.2bn out of India, on revenues of £4.3bn. The company said regulatory changes adversely affected performance in India, though earnings were boosted by growth in voice and data services.Bhatia said: “I do think this is getting a bit too excessive in terms of regulatory oversight and an ad-hoc kind of approach to regulation… But what you have to see is that some of these issues are directly linked with policy and others are linked with standards and compliance.”This case is just one part of the government’s clampdown on tax collection, as it makes every attempt to shore up the country’s unsustainable fiscal deficit. The target is to bring the deficit down to 4.8 per cent of GDP in the current fiscal year from about 5.3 per cent.German car maker, BMW, was in the limelight last month after claims that it owes import duties of as much as $120m. And Cadbury and Nokia have also faced claims of unpaid tax.Related reading:

85;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Nokia hopes to lure iPhone users with latest Lumia phones amid decline;;"Nokia trained its sights on iPhone users with the launch of a new metal Lumia handset on Tuesday, as latest figures showed its share of the market had fallen by almost five percentage points.According to the latest data from Gartner, a steep decline in sales of cheaper feature phones – still popular in emerging markets – led to a loss of mobile market share in the first quarter of this year, from 19.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2012 to 14.8 per cent this year.At the same time, Nokia also fell from number 8 in overall smartphone sales for the quarter to, number 10. It was being outpaced by other Android smartphone makers despite improved sales for its flagship Lumia range.Nokia sold 5.1m Windows Phones in the first quarter, but overall Windows only accounted for 2.9 per cent of the smartphone market in the quarter.Even so, the launch of two new flagship Lumia devices in London on Tuesday underlines the importance of its partnership with Microsoft as growth in feature phones such as the company’s Asha models beginsto falter, with fewer users choosing to upgrade in that market.Gartner said sales of mobile phones in all regions except for Asia declined in the quarter, largely due to slowing feature phone sales, but sales of more expensive smartphones remained strong.At the event in London’s Holborn on Tuesday Nokia announced the addition of two new models to join its existing flagship, the Lumia 920, which itself hit store shelves only eight months ago.The 928, launching as an exclusive handset for Verizon in the US, appeared to be a refinement of the existing 920.However, the new Lumia 925 takes its design cues from the iPhone, sporting a thinner, aluminium frame along with traditional silver, black and white colours that mark a retreat from the brightly coloured polycarbonate of Nokia’s other Lumia phones. It even uses its metal rim as an antenna – a feature pioneered with the iPhone 4.Jo Harlow, executive vice president for smart devices, told the Financial Times that the device was in fact aimed at a “more elegant” segment of the market.“I think the comparison to iPhone is simply this: That there is something about metal that consumers love; they love to hold in their hand. So what we’ve simply done is bring metal to our design and we’ve used it in a very clever way.”Much of the presentation was spent on the 925′s camera technology, which has been a consistent selling point for Nokia’s smartphones.The Lumia 925, which will launch in the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain next month, has an upgraded 8.7 megapixel camera and new software that allows the photographer to choose from a range of split-second images – a feature also touted for the Blackberry Z10 – as well as remove unwanted object and swap faces in group pictures.Asked about Nokia’s overall drop in market share, Ms Harlow said: “I think what we see with Lumia is we’ve grown from 2.9m to 4.4m to 5.1m units and we’ve given some guidance that we expect that growth to accelerate, so we feel quite positive about the traction that we’re gaining in the marketplace.”Annette Zimmermann, a principal analyst at Gartner, said the new models would broaden the appeal of the Lumia range, especially in the enterprise market.“I think it’s a good move that they are doing this – not every person likes a red phone.”Ms Zimmermann said although smartphone sales would continue to grow, demand for the top-end models was slowing, putting more emphasis on mid-range models such as Nokia’s 600 and 700 series.“We are definitely seeing growth in the premium segments, but that will come from the mid tier devices going forward.”"
86;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-05-08T10:20:15Z;India’s Ambanis – the power of love?;;"Last month, India’s once-feuding Ambani brothers made their first step towards reconciliation since they carved up their father’s Reliance business in 2005. Investors and hacks all pricked up their ears; the news that Mukesh, the elder brother, was providing businesses for the younger Anil’s beleaguered operations was surely to be welcomed.Anil Ambani’s companies have seen their market value soar since the deal was announced – shares in Reliance Communications (RCom) have almost doubled in price. But is this just a reflection on the value of brotherly love?On April 2nd, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm signed a Rs12bn ($220m) agreement with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications to use its inter-city fiber optic network infrastructure. It was a good deal for Anil’s cash-strapped Reliance Communications, which had debts of Rs374m at the end of December. And for Mukesh, making his first moves into India’s troubled telecoms sector, it saved all the bother of building infrastructure from scratch.Since April 1st, before the deal was announced, shares in Reliance Communications have gained 96 per cent to reach Rs111.80 by 2pm on Wednesday in Mumbai. Elswhere in Anil Ambani’s empire, Reliance Power is up 22.1 per cent in the same period to Rs77, Reliance Capital has gained 17.8 per cent to Rs379.60 and the story is similar for Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance MediaWorks and Reliance Broadcast Network. Compare that with the Nifty index, up just 6.3 per cent.That’s quite a reconciliation. Or is something else going on?“That’s not the only thing that has kept them in the news,” says Kamlesh Bhatia, research director at Gartner, a technology consultancy.“There has been a deal with the elder brother but the whole thing about trying to hive off the global communications business has been in the news with a possible deal with Batelco. And there is talk in the press about RCom hiking tariffs across the board. So this is some evidence of financial re-engineering and reacting to market realities, and that is positive for RCom.”Bhatia notes that cooperation between any telecoms operators in India is well received by the market these days. “It shows there won’t be a rise in tariffs, which would eventually hurt the industry – if you have support from someone it is always a good thing,” he says.It does seem that Mukesh Ambani is picking up partners across the sector and not just propping up his brother’s business. In another step towards rolling out 4G services, Reliance Jio signed a deal on April 23rd to make use of Bharti Airtel’s submarine cable connecting India and Singapore.It’s lesson one in Finance 101: a single bit of news – even an embrace between this modern day Cain and Able – is rarely enough to explain big swings in share prices.Related reading:

87;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-05-02T12:14:43Z;Topix losers: bargain hunting;Two stocks have somehow made losses in Japan’s bull market;Being one of only two stocks to have made losses in a bull market is like watching everyone go out to play while you have been grounded. Fanuc and Nikon are the wallflowers of the blue-chip Topix 100. But with the gain in the Japanese index one-third already this year, and the index’s forward price/earnings ratio climbing 12 per cent just this month, stocks that have not rocketed should interest bargain hunters.Of course, neither Fanuc nor Nikon has been overlooked simply because of the stampede to buy easy reflationary bets like brokers and property stocks. Nikon’s shareholders were upset by a February profit warning that lowered forecast net income by a third owing to a poor camera market. It will not help either that its second biggest unit, after imaging goods, includes chipmaking equipment where global sales fell a sixth last year, according to Gartner. And Fanuc this week said first-half operating profits from its factory robots would fall two-fifths year-on-year. With that in mind, Fanuc’s loss of 9 per cent, and Nikon’s of 16 per cent, look mild.So where might hidden value lie? Nikon is the tougher case to argue. Chipmakers are careful about adding supply, while digital camera sales, even given Nikon’s high-end dominance, look dire in the face of smartphone competition. Perhaps the company will find a reason to be upbeat when it reports next week. But Fanuc’s sour outlook is at odds with its customers: Japan’s carmakers have decent investment plans and Fanuc gets about three-fifths of sales from that sector. There is also the yen. Fanuc’s operating profits move by Y2.5bn for every Y1 move in dollar-yen, Credit Suisse says, and Fanuc is assuming Y90 – a level not seen in three months.For Japan fans, there are far easier bets than these two. But most of the easy money has been made by now. Time to start looking at the laggards.
88;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-04-24T23:09:02Z;Qualcomm forecasts extra $600m in revenues;;Qualcomm, the world’s biggest mobile chipmaker by sales, said it expected an additional $600m in revenues this fiscal year than forecast, as smartphone sales increase.The San Diego-based company reported $6.12bn in revenues for its second quarter ended March, ahead of Wall Street expectations of $6.08bn. However, profits of $1.17 a share were in line with analysts’ consensus and its shares fell 6 per cent in extended trading in New York to $62.05.Qualcomm supplies processors and radio chips for smartphones, whose shipments are expected to grow at 20 per cent a year to 1.7bn in 2017, according to research firm Gartner.However, the company also cited strength in “emerging regions”, where third-generation devices have grown 34 per cent over the past year to 1.1bn. It sees potential for growth in China, where only a third of phones can achieve 3G speeds.These phones sell in volume but at cheaper prices, lowering Qualcomm’s figures for average selling prices of phones and suggesting this is the reason the revenue boost it received in its second quarter did not translate into the profits expected by Wall Street.Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm president, said the company was predicting it would increase revenues and earnings per share this fiscal year and it was growing faster than the market as a whole.“There are two things happening. We are seeing volumes increase in emerging regions, but the bigger story is we are seeing strength at the high end as well,” he said.The company was experiencing a big take-up of its higher-margin Snapdragon 600 and 800 processors, he said. These are being used in the latest tablets and smartphones, many of which will appear in the second half of the year.The Qualcomm president said quarters were becoming “lumpier” than in the past – while emerging regions could dominate in one quarter, flagship devices being launched in mature markets could be a feature the next.Qualcomm raised its estimate of 3G and 4G device shipments by the mobile industry this calendar year by 15m units, from 1.035bn to 1.05bn.Paul Jacobs, chief executive, told an analyst conference call that the company was seeing strong demand for smartphones and strong semiconductor volumes. Qualcomm had grown to become the world’s third-largest chipmaker, up from sixth place last year, he said.Last November the company became more valuable than Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues, although its market capitalisation recently slipped back below its rival’s.Net income for the second quarter was $2.07bn, up 17 per cent year-on-year, but down 6 per cent sequentially for the seasonally quieter quarter. Qualcomm raised its revenue guidance for the fiscal year from $23.4bn-$24.4bn, to $24bn-$25bn.Mr Jacobs said dividend payments to shareholders had been increased by 40 per cent and a $5bn share buyback had been authorised. Dividends of 25 cents per share, worth $431m, are being paid.
89;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-04-22T12:05:11Z;Semiconductor equipment market shrinks;;The market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment shrank by 16 per cent in 2012 amid a glut of memory chips and continued uncertainty in the sector.Spending on the equipment used to make microchips fell to $37.8bn last year, 16 per cent less than the amount spent in 2011, according to research from Gartner.“Memory manufacturing related purchases declined significantly,” said Klaus-Dieter Rinnen, managing vice-president at Gartner, referring to an oversupply of chips used in memory applications.Mr Rinnen said increased spending on other types of semiconductors was not enough to counter the decline, which began in the second quarter of last year and continued throughout 2012.The figures, which usually reflect the long-term outlook for semiconductors, paint a mixed picture for the sector. Slumping sales of traditional computer products have driven companies such as Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, to report weaker-than-expected results for its first quarter. Intel has already mothballed some manufacturing operations in response to the soft demand that caused its sales to fall 7 per cent.However, smartphone and tablet sales continue to drive growth in other types of microchips, leading manufacturer TSMC to forecast revenue growth of 17 per cent for the second quarter this year. But it is uncertain whether rising sales of such devices in China and Brazil can offset slowing demand in western markets.As current technology reaches its limits, foundries could also be delaying further investment in machinery until the next generation of machines, which use extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUL) technology, are ready for production.The research showed that the top 10 equipment makers now account for a greater share of overall spending on machinery, with a 70 per cent share of sales compared with 61 per cent in 2008.This in part reflects the increased cost of research and development as companies turn their attention to EUV and other newer technologies. Mr Rinnen said only the larger companies could afford the investment required to produce the next wave of machinery.“The advance of these large players symbolises losses of smaller players in the competitive race and an increasing dependence on a few vendors in the equipment market,” said Mr Rinnen.Applied Materials replaced ASML as the top equipment vendor in terms of sales for 2012.
90;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-04-18T20:00:46Z;Global IT spend heading higher;;"Uncertainties surrounding the global economy are the ever-present anchor to IT growth, but signs indicate a gradual improvement in sentiment about prospects for future economic growth.Gartner, the IT research firm, recently released its latest outlook for IT spending, and I asked Richard Gordon, managing vice president at Gartner, what is driving growth this year, and how will the IT industry perform long-term.Q. What is the latest outlook for worldwide IT spending?Uncertainties surrounding the prospects for an upturn in global economic growth remain the major restraints on IT growth. Although the US avoided the fiscal cliff, the subsequent sequestration, compounded by the rise of Cyprus’ debt burden, seems to have netted out any benefit, and the fragile business and consumer sentiment in evidence throughout much of the world continues.However, the new shocks are expected to be short-lived, and while they may cause some pauses in discretionary spending along the way, strategic IT initiatives will continue. We look for modestly accelerated IT spending growth in 2013, with spending increasing 4.2 per cent from 2012, or 4 per cent when measured in constant dollars.Q. What is the most surprising finding in the first quarter 20 13 worldwide IT spending outlook?The current strength in the devices market was the biggest surprise. Spending estimates for mobile phones in 2012 were increased to reflect higher average selling prices (ASPs), commanded by the likes of the popular Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy devices at the premium end of the market.We expect this effect to continue into 2013, but longer term, as competition in mature markets intensifies and the contribution to growth from emerging markets increases, spending growth on mobile phones will be hampered by lower ASPs. This short-term fillip to spending on mobile phones has driven an upward revision in device sector growth for 2013 from 6.3 per cent last quarter to 7.9 per cent now, despite flat spending on PCs and a modest decline in spending on printers.Q. What is the long-term outlook for IT spending?IT spending growth is expected to average a compound annual rate of 3.9 per cent from 2012 through 2017. There are two things we want to highlight.First, we have the current economic cycle. Since the financial crisis of 2008 / 2009 the global economy has struggled to recover from recession, which has held back business investment and dampened consumer confidence and discretionary spending. We are only now seeing more positive indicators from the important US economy while the Eurozone continues to lurch from crisis to crisis. While there is a sense that a more stable economic outlook is around the corner, until there is a more sustained period of strengthening economic growth, IT spending growth is set to remain modest.Second, we are observing a slowdown in the long-term IT market growth rate as the industry matures; the high-growth phase of the past three decades, which was built on automation and productivity improvement, has come to an end.This means that we do not expect to see a sustained return to double-digit annual growth in IT spending. Instead, within the context of overall modest growth in top-line IT spending, we wil see a targeting of IT investment toward strategically important business objectives based on The Nexus of Forces.Q. What are The Nexus of Forces and what effect is this having on having on IT spending?The Nexus of Forces - social, mobile, cloud and information - are reshaping spending patterns across all of the IT sectors. Consumers and enterprises will continue to purchase a mix of IT products and services; nothing is going away completely. However, the nature of this mix is changing dramatically. There will be clear winners and losers over the next three to five years, as we see more of a transition from PCs to mobile phones, from servers to storage, from licensed software to cloud, or the shift in voice and data connections from fixed to mobile.Richard Gordon is a managing vice president at Gartner, where he leads Gartner’s Global IT Market Forecasting program"
91;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-04-10T20:52:00Z;Business leaders embrace ‘digital’;;Major political and economic upheavals helped constrain business investment over the past two years. But, based on the latest research from Gartner, there are signs that the fog is clearing, and that corporate investments in IT and becoming “digital” will play a more prominent role in companies’ spending plans for 2013 and beyond.Business leaders, it seems, have got the message that in order to grow their companies, they will need to transform them into truly digital operations and they are beginning to embrace the strategies needed to achieve this.Gartner surveyed more than 390 company chief executives and senior business leaders across the globe between October and December 2012 and recently published their research. I asked Mark Raskino, vice-president and Gartner Fellow, what plans CEOs are making for investment and growth. Here is an edited summary of the conversation:What signs are there that 2013 will bring a much needed return to growth?Reading through the responses in this year’s Gartner CEO and Senior Executive Survey left us with one overriding thought: this is the year when business leadership teams must commit to investing bravely and deeply to redevelop the technology and information capability of their firms.After more than a decade of modest investment and sorting out the basics, it’s time to think ahead. Business leaders tell us they recognise the need to invest in ecommerce, mobile, cloud, social and other major technology categories and the capabilities they enable. That clearly can’t be done from within existing IT budgets alone, so some major new investment is called for.We firmly believe that 2013 will be a turning point year as, by a ratio of more than four to one, chief executives and other senior executives plan to increase IT investment in 2013, rather than cut it, according to the survey. As macro uncertainties subside, 78 per cent of CEOs now feel able to plan their 2013 and 2014 investments and growth.Why is this happening now?Responses to this year’s survey indicate that the beginning of the true turning point out of the aftershocks of the recession could be here at last, and the base of an economic or business cycle trough is the time to commit capital. The cost of capital is currently very low, and the cash on hand is high for most large firms. If you are going to make a major structural capability investment, now would be the best time to do it.The cost-cutting cycle is mostly finished in the majority of industries, and top-line growth and profitability improvement are needed. Product innovations are likely to be digital, and workforce capability improvements are most likely to be knowledge-based. Technology and information advances are necessary for both. A few of Gartner’s leading clients are already making new, very big bets in information and technology innovation that run to hundreds of millions of dollars of fresh investment, and we believe that many more are set to follow.You mentioned the role digital will play in future plans. How do you see this evolving?“Digital” is now a mainstream term for business leaders, perhaps the way “ebusiness” was a decade before it. Digital represents the current “new wave” of information and technology-related opportunities. The survey showed that 52 per cent of respondents said that they have a digital strategy. Not surprisingly, the proportion of leaders who say they have a digital strategy varies a great deal by industry. It’s over 90 per cent in communications and media, and over 60 per cent for financial services and insurance, whereas only a third of manufacturing and natural resources business leaders claimed a digital strategy.However, only a few companies actually use digital or IT-enabled innovation to truly lead their industries. We asked all the business leader respondents to tell us if their company is striving to be a pioneer in its industry and only a quarter (26 per cent) said they were. Among those, less than half said that digital or information technologies were their primary means of pursuing that goal. So, overall, we can say that only one in 10 companies is truly trying to lead its industry by applying digital and IT-related innovation within its business.How can CEOs make sure that digital has a real focus?Like ebusiness in the late 1990s, the use of digital risks being nebulous. When a vague umbrella term becomes widespread, it can be a recipe for poorly directed strategy, budget bloat and weak results. First and foremost, chief executives and their leadership teams must crystallise what they mean by digital strategy and work with a small subgroup from the executive team to define what “digital” means and how it manifests in the broader business strategy. They must ensure all elements of the digital strategy link clearly to the core business strategy, and that they do not form an independent, possibly distracting, program of change.The good news is that the rise of digital strategy is starting to change the leadership landscape. It’s encouraging to see that business leaders intend to alter the mix of leadership talent needed to make that change – with a new generation of chief data officers, chief digital officers and new heads of innovation on the way. The survey found that 19 per cent of business leaders expect to see a chief digital officer in their organisation by 2014, and 17 per cent expect to have a chief data officer.The desire by companies to hire a chief digital officer most often stems from a need to be more proactive and strategically engaged in the use of interactivity with consumers, citizens or others.The hiring of chief data officers is happening because some companies are realising that information should be treated like an asset, and that information assets are substantially ungoverned. The intent to create more heads of innovation is yet another signal that business leaders intend to drive out of the long recession by improving the customer offer and few innovation leaders will be able to ignore digital technologies in their work.So, overall, the signs are positive. We can see chief executives and other senior business executives want to make long-term plans to scale back leadership in technology operation and delivery management, and increase leadership in more creative information and technology exploitation.The next step requires business leaders to embrace growing digital, data and innovation needs, and not stand back from them. The biggest risk, perhaps, is that chief executives in companies with lacklustre technology capability, will continue to believe that “digital” can remain a backburner issue for another couple of years.Mark Raskino is a vice-president and Gartner Fellow in executive leadership and innovation research at Gartner.
92;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-04-04T18:19:59Z;Apple devices predicted to beat Windows;;Consumers will buy more Apple devices than PCs, tablets and smartphones running Windows for the first time this year, analysts predict, underlining the urgency of the threat to Microsoft’s platform dominance in the shift from desktop to mobile.Gartner, the market research group, forecast in a report released on Thursday that sales of tablets would overtake traditional desktops and laptops by 2015, while other analysts have predicted the shift could come even sooner.Microsoft’s strength in the corporate PC market will support its Windows business for years to come, Gartner said, but among consumers it risks falling into irrelevance, said analyst Carolina Milanesi.Last year, Apple’s combined consumer sales of 159m iPhones, iPads and Macs lagged behind the total 175m devices running Microsoft Windows. Gartner predicted that Apple unit shipments would reach 233m in 2013, overtaking Microsoft’s growth to 181m. That gap will widen in the coming years, Ms Milanesi, said. “If consumers don’t buy [Windows], developers aren’t interested in it. Microsoft needs to win in the consumer space if they want to remain relevant.”While Apple’s iPad holds more than half of the tablet market and Google’s Android is dominant in smartphones, Microsoft’s Windows has failed to make headway in the mobile era.Horace Dediu, independent mobile analyst at Asymco, forecast last year that tablets would overtake PCs in autumn 2013.Devices shipped running Android will exceed 1bn for the first time in 2014, Gartner predicted, more than Apple and Microsoft’s platforms combined. However, companies such as Amazon and Facebook are prioritising their own often-competing services at the expense of Google’s in Android, and in China many Android devices ship without any Google services at all, raising questions about the benefits Google receives from its platform’s dominance in mobile computing.“There is volume and value in the ecosystem, and the two are not directly proportional,” said Ms Milanesi, as more of the mobile market’s profits accrue to Apple and Samsung.Her forecasts do not include any new, cheaper iPhone that Apple is rumoured to be developing, which could only accelerate its success in the mobile market. Nonetheless, Apple investors are concerned about the iPhone’s slowing growth and that sales of the cheaper iPad mini are cannibalising its larger tablet.
93;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-03-26T23:18:50Z;Information services: Better accounting systems offer richer forecasting resources;The need to share data is one factor driving the use of more analytics, says Stephen Pritchard;When businesses first started to invest in information technology in the 1950s and 1960s, the finance director was usually in the driving seat. The early computer systems were installed to carry out tasks such as accounting or running the payroll. But the chief financial officer is no longer the main user, let alone the sole custodian, of business data.“When businesses first started putting in [manual] control systems 100 or so years ago, they measured the flow of goods, then cash, then information,” says Frank Buytendijk, a research vice-president at industry analysts Gartner.“Even over the past 20 years, the chief financial officer owned the management information systems. But now it’s marketing driving a lot of innovation.”The finance function, Mr Buytendijk suggests, is moving from its role as owner or controller of data to a consumer of information. But, he points out, finance and accounting systems now offer richer tools for forecasting, analysing and reporting data, with finance teams able to do more of their daily forecasting and planning without exiting their finance or enterprise resource planning [ERP] software.Companies such as Oracle and SAP have invested heavily in business intelligence applications, in part to boost those capabilities. And it is becoming easier to export data from financial systems, either to a cloud-based application, or even just to look at the numbers in Microsoft Excel.But for larger, and more complex businesses, most finance directors will need to bring data into a specialist business intelligence tool, either for their own use or so a business intelligence specialist can carry out the analysis. Larger firms continue to invest in these specialists, sometimes setting up a business intelligence competency centre, to meet the board’s need for more accurate and timely analysis and forecasting.“Chief financial officers had large amounts of information in ERP systems, but because of their complexity it wasn’t accessible to the business,” says Peter Lumley, a business intelligence expert at PA Consulting. “There is a need to visualise what the data are telling them.”The need to share more key business data with the wider business is one of the drivers for finance departments to make more use of analytics. The chief financial officer should be providing a “sanity check” for the wider business, according to Tony Baer, a principal analyst at Ovum.Often other business units’ forecasts or analysis are not cross checked against the company’s financial records, nor any decisions tested for their impact on the cash position.The subprime mortgage crisis in the US is an example of the risks of putting market share ahead of profitability. Using business intelligence to give more people in the business access to finance-based data can only help.Mr Baer says chief financial officers remain heavily involved in decisions about where a company should invest and finance teams need to look at wider ranges of data. He says: “Chief finance officers are widening their view point, looking at macro trends and looking for signals.”Investment decisions will be made in light of financial data, but also customer and supplier information, even third-party data sources or data from social networks.Fortunately, industry analysts point out that the range and quality of business intelligence and analytics tools is improving, with more sophisticated algorithms, more powerful computers and techniques such as in-memory databases speeding up analytics.Finance directors might not always need real-time information but quicker reporting and the ability to run multiple “what if” scenarios, without heavy investment in IT, is improving decision making. Analysis tools are also becoming easier to use, with the growth of visual analytics and applications designed for tablet computers in particular making it easier for senior managers to view reports and drill down into the data.But some barriers remain. Variable data quality, and the difficulties of creating a single master data record, can hamper the finance director’s ability to use a wider range of data. Finance analysts are trained to deal with highly accurate data from systems of records. Making use of new data sources and big data can mean dealing with incomplete or less accurate figures. This requires finance directors to change their approach.According to Leo Sadovy, a former vice-president of finance who runs the performance management division of SAS, an analytics software vendor, just about 15 per cent of companies are carrying out “transformational work” with business intelligence. In a large number of finance departments they are still trying to improve their ability to handle the basics, such as management reporting.Businesses, he says, are also held back by a lack of statistical knowledge, as well as by issues of data integrity. Paul Dennis, an adviser at the Corporate Executive Board (CEB), a member-based body, says the question of skills becomes even more acute as finance teams start to use more powerful tools to draw on a wider range of data. Improved analysis tools and better visualisation are important, he says, but so are the people.“If you are going to invest to make more of data, it makes sense to have the expertise in place,” he says.
94;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-03-26T23:18:49Z;Trend for personal IT devices is a challenge for finance chiefs;Companies taking the bring-your-own-mobile route need strong policies in place to protect data, reports Paul Taylor;Finance directors in many companies will play a pivotal role in dealing with the two biggest trends sweeping through the business IT world: consumerisation – the use of products designed for the consumer market in corporate IT systems – and bring your own device (BYOD).A Gartner survey last December found 33 per cent of respondents’ organisations already had policies for mobile devices, while 70 per cent plan to have BYOD policies in the next 12 months to allow employees to use personal mobile devices to connect to corporate (known as enterprise) applications.Dionisio Zumerle, principal research analyst at Gartner, says: “Shifting from an enterprise-owned mobile device fleet to having employees bringing their own devices has a big impact on ways of thinking and acting about mobile security.“Policies and tools initially put in place to deal with mobile devices offering consumer-grade security must be revised to deal with these devices being under the ultimate control of a private user, rather than the organisation.”Ben Fried, Google’s chief information officer, agrees. “The consumerisation of IT is an unstoppable force sweeping through businesses and can drive considerable cost savings and innovation,” he says. “Enterprise users can’t be kept as a captive audience of the IT department, because alternatives to their in-house offerings are already running on their home computer, or are a click away in their web browser.“Successful chief information officers will have to give serious thought to the questions ‘is my service better than what my users already use at home? Is it good enough that my users would want to pay for it themselves?’”Mr Fried says his company “believes staff should find the technology they use at work inspiring and enable them to do their jobs without technical restrictions”. He adds that a BYOD approach can make sense provided the user is willing to allow their employer manage the device and apply corporate policies to it.For many companies, the BYOD trend began when senior executives brought mobile devices from home to the office and asked IT departments to link them to corporate networks. Chief financial officers in particular recognised the advantages of being able to access financial data and metrics from anywhere using mobile devices and secure web-based dashboards or dedicated apps.Vincent Geake, director of secure mobility at BAE Systems Detica, an information security company, says: “Businesses must acknowledge they cannot and should not prevent their chief financial officer from accessing key business metrics on his or her smartphone and tablet.“Instead, they need to assess the risk to the information on the device as they would with any other highly valuable asset, and implement the necessary security controls, since it will likely include some companies’ most sensitive information.”Google’s Mr Fried adds: “If organisations choose to go down the BYOD route, they need strong policies in place, from enforcing pin or screen locks, to putting the right diagnostics in place to know the identity of the device and who is using it.”Fernando Alvarez, head of mobile solutions at Capgemini, the IT services provider, says question a chief financial office should be asking include: “What assets are in use? What do we need to do to protect our company data? Is our intellectual property sufficiently protected? How do we manage the complexity of multiple mobile platforms in a single environment? How do we manage the bigger issue around governance and the wall between company and personal data?”And he warns: “Many of these questions have been overlooked because companies have not yet properly assessed the risk that BYOD brings.”Mr Geake says: “To be effective, BYOD policies must meet senior executive needs in a flexible and non-intrusive way, while giving full consideration to how to best manage the associated security risks.“In the days of the PC, the enterprise was able to mitigate this risk by implementing industry standard security across each desktop computer, providing a known level of protection using proven products on devices which they controlled and locked down.”Now, he says, employees work on a range of personal devices, so a company must assess the risk from devices that hold the most important information and consider whether they have invested in the necessary security measures to protect that information. Measures should include a combination of technology, usage policies and training.For Andy Travers, in charge of UK, Ireland and sub-Saharan Africa sales at F5 Networks, the appeal of BYOD is obvious: “Allowing employees to access their data on personal devices, from any location at any time, provides a number of benefits. They are likely to work more flexibly and efficiently, as well as gleaning more satisfaction from their jobs.“On the flipside – and the concern that’s held many businesses back – is the numerous security issues it raises as employees demand access to sensitive corporate data on unmanaged and potentially unsecured devices.”But he cautions that chief financial officers expecting to save money may be disappointed. “The concerns chief financial officers should have around BYOD should focus on the potential reputational damage a data breach or data loss could result in. It’s not simply a question of whether BYOD saves money, but the potential for lost revenue if they don’t have the right policies in place to protect their organisation. “Benjamin Alleau, vice-president of Capgemini Consulting, agrees. “A BYOD initiative need not always be cost effective, especially since additional investments are needed to support the use of personal devices in a business environment such as virtualisation or security reinforcement.“The business benefits, instead, appear to lie elsewhere [such as] employee satisfaction, employee mobility and productivity.”Mr Alvarez says that, while BYOD can increase worker flexibility and cut costs, the additional risk and operational burden on organisations needs to be considered. Overall, though, he believes the model “should be considered for creating business value that goes beyond cost savings”.
95;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-03-15T07:51:30Z;RCom / Batelco: deal or no deal?;;"Shares in Reliance Communications are swinging around a fair bit at the moment. The stock dropped 2.5 per cent on Friday to reach Rs66.50 by 12.30pm, partially correcting a 5.6 per cent gain in the previous session.One big reason: reports that Batelco, the Bahrain telecoms group, is planning to buy a stake in Reliance Globalcom. The deal makes sense – but investors can’t seem to work out if it will happen or not.Reliance Communications said as much in a statement (our emphasis):We note recent reports in the press and confirm that we are in discussions with Batelco Group with respect to Reliance Globalcom, our global communications services business unit. At this point, there can be no certainty that this will lead to a transaction. A further announcement will be made in due course if appropriate.Reliance Globalcom is the communications services unit of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications. It serves more than 2,100 enterprises, 200 carriers and 2.5m retail customers in 163 countries and owns 65,000km of undersea cables, the largest private system in the world. The possible sell-off makes sense at the moment, as Reliance Communications is struggling under a heavy burden of debt. On December 31, the company reported net debt of Rs373.61bn ($6.9bn).“Reliance Globalcom has been looking for a viable strategy for the business for a very long time, including taking it public and maybe listing it in other markets”, Kamlesh Bhatia, at analyst at Gartner, told beyondbrics. “Clearly, that hasn’t happened and there is a significant pressure to start reducing the overall debt, which is largely a result of the India operations.”On Batelco’s side, this deal would be just one part of a wider acquisition drive. The company earned 39 per cent of its $270m of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and ammortisation from operations outside Bahrain in 2012 and is aiming to increase its focus on international expansion. With cash and bank balances of $252m at the year end, Batelco does have the funds needed; just months ago it acquired a large part of Cable and Wireless’ Monaco and Islands division for $680m.An investment in Reliance Globalcom would be a return to the Indian market for the Bahrain-based group, which sold its stake in STel India, the mobile operator, last year in the midst of India’s messy 2G probe. Even at the time, Batelco’s chief executive, Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa Al Khalifa, had commented:As Batelco continues to grow and diversify its operations, we remain interested in other investment opportunities for the Batelco Group that will enable us to participate in the Indian telecom market. We are actively exploring all options in this respect over the coming months.Bhatia adds: “In line with other operators for that region, India is a growth market. And given the overall focus of Batelco on enterprise connectivity, especially long distance connectivity, Reliance would be beneficial given its spread in network presence and the alliances they have with operators in other market.”Sounds like a win-win deal. If it happens, of course.Related reading:

One story in the Indian Express said:United States-based Liberty Global Inc and a couple of private equity investors are among companies Bharti Airtel is in talks with for a potential stake sale, said [a] source, declining to elaborate.Bharti Airtel’s DTH business has 7.9 mn customers across 632 districts, according to a company presentation this February. And in the three months ending in December, the unit made earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of Rs147m on Rs4.3m of revenues.The company hasn’t confirmed the deal, telling the FT it made “no comments on speculations”. But if the rumours are true, analysts say the move isn’t a reflection of Bharti’s outlook for the DTH sector.“It is a market that is fairly nascent compared to the cable market”, Kamlesh Bhatia, research director at Gartner told beyondbrics. “The DTH market continues to grow as laying cable is expensive in certain markets, so DTH is the viable alternative.”He continued: “This isn’t a statement of their own belief around the future of the business. The telecoms industry is evolving to grow outside traditional services. It is increasingly linking to entertainment and DTH is part of that strategy of providing entertainment to the consumer.”A report from Research and Markets underlines the potential for growth in the sector. It forecasts that the number of DTH subscribers in India will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 23 per cent between 2011 and 2014 to reach 69m. But the market research company adds in its report:The entry of new players in the Indian DTH industry is intensifying competition. Due to this intensified competition, installation prices are declining and subscribers now have a wide range of options.This leads to the reason why Bharti may want to pull back from its DTH unit. The company is moving away from businesses in which it doesn’t have leadership positions to free up capital to service its debts – it reported net debts of $11.7bn for the quarter ended in December.“There is a need to bring down that debt, which is creating a sizeable outflow in terms of trying to service that debt”, Bhatia said.Other recent reports say that the company is looking to sell a stake in Comviva, its mobile software development unit, to Mahindra Satyam and/or hive off its Sri Lankan operations. But, with Bharti Airtel declining to comment on Friday, there is nothing concrete to relate.Related reading:

A Queen cover band may have launched the event with a blasting rendition of “We are the Champions”, but the triumphalism was otherwise in short supply.Recent headlines suggest that even the best-defended computer networks resemble Swiss cheese. But, if the old approaches to security have been discredited, there’s no shortage of new companies springing up with promises of better ways to plug the gaps – or at least make a lot of money trying.The IT security market, worth some $65bn this year, is set to grow at 9 per cent annually for the foreseeable future, according to Gartner – which is a lot faster than the IT industry as a whole. Since large parts of the security market are barely growing, that leaves plenty of opportunity to cash in on new approaches.The dirty secret that the security professionals can no longer keep to themselves is that their old defences – which were aimed at protecting PCs and other devices that comprise the endpoints of computer networks – no longer work.Anti-virus software has proven ineffective against the most sophisticated attacks – and therefore the ones likely to cost most in terms of damage inflicted or intellectual property lost.Hopes for a fightback are now pinned on two very different approaches.One involves spotting so-called malware long before it reaches its intended targets. Companies such as Palo Alto Networks, one of last year’s hottest tech IPOs, and FireEye, tipped to follow it, specialise in appliances that sit at the gateway to corporate or government networks, looking out for such threats.Pulling suspicious-looking email attachments and testing them in ringfenced “sand boxes” before allowing them to be delivered offers the promise of filtering out many of these malware threats, almost in real time, according to Asheem Chandna, a former security industry executive and now venture capital investor at Greylock.This may sound like a natural market for networking companies such as Cisco and Juniper. But, as so often in technology, it is start-ups that have set the pace so far. With Palo Alto trading at 10 times revenues, some high-priced acquisitions seem likely as the industry giants add to their arsenal of defences.The second approach begins with an acceptance that even the best-secured networks will be penetrated. If the attackers are assumed to be already on the inside, then the focus shifts to identifying their tracks as they move around – while making sure a company’s most important digital assets are harder for the intruders to locate and extract.Latching on to another of the tech industry’s big promises, the security purveyors have discovered big data. Pattern-recognition – using reams of data to identify normal types of behaviour on a network, in order to spot the anomalies – is becoming the order of the day.The result is what Francis deSouza, president of products and services at Symantec, calls “big intelligence” – in which a stronger situational awareness and a better sense of behavioural norms are the main lines of defence.Yet the big data promise can only go so far. The extent of the architectural shift in computing, as the client-server age gives way to the cloud, raises profound challenges to the old methods of securing data. The number and variety of computing endpoints is multiplying almost exponentially, as mobile devices and, increasingly, machine-to-machine communications proliferate. A tide of data is starting to flow out of corporate networks to tap services that live in the cloud, turning the old defensive barriers into virtual Maginot Lines.At least the security industry, accused alternately of alarmism and complacency, now has a more realistic way to talk to its customers. The big data promise is that, although the enemy is wily and will find ways to break in, the defenders have smarts of their own. They may sometimes lose this cat-and-mouse game, but at least there is a chance of minimising the damage.And, besides the improved rhetoric, there’s another benefit to these new approaches: some of them might even work.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast managing editorrichard.waters@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
98;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-02-25T19:12:26Z;Samsung teases Galaxy S4 launch event in March;;Samsung’s latest flagship Galaxy smartphone looks set to be unveiled on March 14, according to the company’s postings on Twitter and Facebook, as the Korean giant prepares its latest volley against Apple’s iPhone.A flyer for the launch event, held in New York and livestreamed on YouTube, invites fans to “come and meet the next Galaxy”, expected to be the S4. The device will be the follow-up to its best-selling Galaxy S3 and is rumoured to include a larger, 5-inch display with full-HD, 1080p resolution.Backed by a huge marketing campaign and substantial subsidies to operators, Samsung’s Android-based Galaxy S3 has been the most significant challenger to Apple’s iPhone since it launched last May.The Galaxy S3 took the lead in the global smartphone market in the third quarter of 2012 with 18m units shipped, according to researcher Strategy Analytics, only to be overtaken by Apple again in the run-up to Christmas, when its 15.4m units were outpaced by both the iPhone 4S and 5, shipping 17.4m and 27.4m respectively.The S3 has also helped to give Samsung a commanding position in the Android market, with its devices together accounting for 42.5 per cent of sales of smartphones using Google’s operating system last year, according to Gartner.“The Android brand is being overshadowed by Samsung’s brand with the Galaxy name nearly a synonym for Android phones in consumers’ mind share,” said Gartner analyst Anshul Gupta in a note last week, noting that Samsung increased its share of the global handset market to 22 per cent last year, overtaking Nokia to become the world’s largest mobile vendor.Samsung’s March event is billed as “Episode 1″ of Samsung’s “Unpacked 2013″ events, but its mobile launches for this year have already begun at Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress, where Samsung showcased its iPad mini competitor, the Galaxy Note 8.Samsung is also working on several devices based on Tizen, a Linux-based OS backed by Samsung and Intel, according to reports out of Barcelona.Likely to remain Android-based, the S4 may well offer new pay-by-touch technology, after Samsung and Visa announced a new partnership to pre-install Visa’s PayWave application onto Samsung’s NFC-equipped devices.Many have speculated Apple could use iTunes’ bank of 450m credit card details to create a mobile payment service, even if its Passbook mobile ticketing and loyalty card app remains somewhat limited.Another area where the S4 could look to compete with the iPhone is around enterprise capabilities. After BlackBerry’s decline left a vacuum in IT departments’ go-to choice for smartphones, Apple’s iPhone has been making strong headway. In an attempt to address Android’s weaker security controls, Samsung has been advertising the virtues of its “Safe” (Samsung For Enterprise) capabilities, running a series of ads during Sunday’s Oscar ceremony broadcast in the US, for instance.Monday saw the announcement of “Knox”, an additional suite of security functions aimed at companies who let employees “bring your own device” to work.Another invisible challenge to the S4 may also be lurking: its name. Telecoms industry gossips had been wondering whether Samsung might skip straight to S5 to avoid the number 4, which is considered unlucky in some parts of east Asia, including China and, to a lesser extent, Korea.However, it seems Samsung doesn’t seem to be so superstitious, with the online flyer inviting customers to get “ready 4 the show” next month.
99;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-02-22T02:18:43Z;When it comes to mobile, IBM gets religion;;IBM has a tried and trusted method for turbo-charging its growth in promising new IT markets: rebrand its existing efforts in the field in question, boast about all the investments it’s already made – and then promise to double them.Analytics, security and ecommerce have all come in for this kind of treatment, making them bright spots in an otherwise low-growth company. Now it’s the turn of mobile computing.Most of IBM’s big customers have approached mobile the way they did the Web in the late 1990s, says Mike Riegel, vice president of mobile enterprise. They throw out mobile apps the way they once threw up corporate web sites, reaching out to customers through a new medium but not integrating their efforts into their wider business strategies or IT systems.Under the banner “MobileFirst”, Big Blue now thinks it has the wherewithal to turn mobile into a more serious part of the IT arsenal. The range of tools and technologies it has up its sleeve include software for app development, management, security and analytics, along with services ranging from strategy-setting to IT integration.These have been assembled partly through a series of small acquisitions, like the purchase of mobile analytics company Tealeaf and mobile application platform Worklight. IBM also claims 160 researchers working exclusively in mobile technologies. And, with typical bravado, it says it plans to double its investment in mobile this year – though Mr Riegel won’t say how much that actually amounts to.IBM’s move looks well timed, says Ken Parmelee, an analyst at Gartner, who puts the market for mobile technologies and services like this at around $3-4bn a year.“This market is extremely frothy at the moment, but there aren’t many well-established companies in it,” he says. SAP grabbed one of the few big players when it bought Sybase: otherwise, most of the software companies pushing mobile for enterprise customers are much smaller.IBM has long had a broader set of capabilities to attack hot new IT markets like this than most of its rivals: as always, the question is whether it can harness those to effectively provide the kind of unified solutions that its customers need. The approach honed in areas like analytics and security – and now mobile – suggests that it is at least on the right track.
100;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-02-19T21:19:12Z;Mobile payments on the front burner;;Next week in Barcelona, handset manufacturers, mobile operators and mobile content providers will congregate for the GSMA’s annual Mobile World Congress, and mobile payment systems are expected to be a hot discussion topic.“Mobile payments will again be a major theme at MWC 2013 and we expect mobile wallets in particular to come under scrutiny,” says Eden Zoller, an analyst with Ovum, the telecoms consultancy.“Mobile wallets stand at the intersection of payments, retail, and advertising, and the opportunities this presents is creating a lot of excitement,’ he says, “there is clearly a lot up for grabs and the last year has seen online players, network operators, financial institutions, and retailers battle for position.’Like other analysts and industry insiders, Ovum is expecting both new product announcements and partnerships to be announced during the show. But Mr Zoller also cautions, “what we would like to see most of all is for mobile wallets to be given a serious sanity check.“As we explained in the report ‘Mobile Wallets Unwrapped’, the excitement is also creating hype that is blinding many to the fact that mobile wallets are challenging propositions that are difficult to get right.”Eric Openshaw and Brian Shniderman of Deloitte also believe that the subject of mobile payments demands closer scrutiny. In the guest column below, they examine how trust could potentially shape new relationships in the mobile payments ecosystem.…By Eric Openshaw and Brian ShnidermanWe’ve all been there: Standing in line behind a grandmother as she slowly writes out a check for her groceries. While we might smile at the circumstances, we’re probably wondering why we got stuck behind one of the dwindling few who still partake in this quaint ritual of payment. Yet with the growth in mobile commerce and consequent development of mobile payments options, pulling out a credit card at your favourite coffee shop may soon seem as archaic.In fact, Gartner predicts mobile payments will grow to more than $600bn worldwide by 2016 (six times the estimated $100bn in 2011), in large part following the penetration of smartphones in the consumer market. Its use skews heavily toward the young: millennials dominate, and approximately 70 per cent of users are under the age of 40, according to the findings from Deloitte’s 2012 Future of Mobile Payment survey.Yet, with its well-established and extensive financial infrastructures, mobile payments have yet to hit their stride in the US When the average consumer, particularly the non-millennial, has at least three options – be it cash, multiple credit cards or a debit card – for nearly any brick-and-mortar retail purchase, and sometimes even others for online purchases, what will it take for mobile payments to become more than a novelty?It may be that the mobile payments ecosystem in the US has the difficult task of offering enough value to consumers and merchants to gain an economically viable scale and overcome the perceived risks against an incumbent that is widely regarded as “satisfactory.”With no standard yet dominant, and seemingly a deluge of daily announcements that swing the outlook for this area, companies are making a variety of bets on technologies, on business models and on partners. Some are even participating in big industry consortiums, and others are gobbling up start-ups.The mobile payment ecosystem will probably remain fragmented until mutually beneficial business models emerge, spanning the divergent interests of merchants and carriers, banks and device makers.There may be two plausible models for how the US ecosystem will evolve, and one may well be the stepping stone to the next:First: the Buddy System: A mobile carrier and a financial institution provide a payment solution based on a credit or debit card being embedded as an application in the mobile device. This type of partnership could have the advantage of requiring less investment and a broader customer base that already knows and trusts the entities while allowing mobile carriers and financial institutions to gain experience working together and testing out revenue - and data-sharing models.Second: an Open Federation Alliance: Mobile carriers, financial institutions, merchants, handset makers, chipmakers, application providers and others would come together on a standardised platform to provide a portfolio of financial services on mobile devices. A trusted third-party manager plays the pivotal role of co-ordinator and integrator, managing both the technical aspects and the governance.As these models shake out, the question of trust becomes paramount: What platform does the merchant trust to facilitate transactions? Who do consumers and regulators trust to control consumers’ secure financial data? What uses of the consumers’ non-secure data begin to violate trust? Who do regulators and partners trust to control access to the payments area? Who do partners in the value chain trust to manage the alliance? The most important question: who does the consumer trust?The open federation model could have the best potential for standardising a platform that enhances the customer experience and drives mass adoption. Co-operating with mobile carriers and device manufacturers may entail short-term pain for financial institutions but reduce long-term risk from disruption and accrue gains from innovations on the mobile platform. In addition, an innovative platform that truly offers a unique value proposition to the customer and the merchant could expand the size of the non-cash payment option, potentially driving increased revenue and offering additional revenue opportunities for mobile marketing and merchant services.With an open federation model, a critical question is who will be the trusted third-party manager? It’s a tall order. That entity will control access to the payments area and the secure financial data of the customer. It should have the organisational maturity and established credibility to manage alliances and facilitate co-operation. And it should also have credibility with regulators and consumers. On the last point, this is an area where the company chosen cannot afford to make mistakes, lest the customer deem the privacy and security risks too great for the marginal benefit mobile payment offers— one high-profile failure could put a damper on adoption by merchants and consumers.When it comes to consumer trust in retail payments, it typically comes down to three things: tolerated vulnerability, financial protection and impact management. The need to establish, manage and maintain consumer trust should apply to any entity entering the mobile payments space, especially those that the consumer interacts with directly. Although many banks and card providers understand the importance of trust, the greatest room for improvement for many institutions may lie in implementing processes, policies, and tools to help manage the impact of an event that might damage consumer trust.One problem with the current plethora of mobile payments-related efforts may be the inability for the user to assess the security or risk associated. Simply, the consumer doesn’t know which to trust. Many of the small start-up apps trying to forge a place in the current ecosystem appear to lack sufficient security. Consumers enter the same banking credentials they would at their financial institution, erroneously believing that a five-star rating means that the app is secure rather than that some user loves its functionality. One would hope to see new tools, similar to those used to denote safe websites, allowing users to more effectively assess the security of a payment option.Ultimately all of the players in the value chain should treat consumer trust as their highest priority because it truly is the linchpin for the entire mobile payments ecosystem. Nobody needs to make payments from their mobile device, but many will want to, as long as the risks of fraud and other data compromises don’t exceed the value that such services provide.Eric Openshaw is a vice-chairman and the US Technology, Media & Telecommunications leader for Deloitte and Brian Shniderman is a principal with Deloitte Consulting and the leader of Deloitte’s US payments practice.
101;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-02-19T15:53:05Z;HTC aims to relaunch brand with One phone;;HTC, the smartphone maker known for its “quietly brilliant” tagline, is hoping to raise the volume of its marketing alongside the launch of its new flagship device, as it struggles with shrinking market share.HTC, whose net income fell by more than 90 per cent last quarter, plans to double its media budget as it aims to become one of the top three brands in the smartphone market this spring, in support of its latest HTC One, which boasts an aluminium unibody design, external stereo speakers and Zoe, a new camera app that automatically creates photo and video montages from the phone’s image library.“We always create great products and we just need to let the world know about it,” Peter Chou, HTC’s chief executive, tells the Financial Times.HTC One will be available towards the end of March through 185 mobile operators in 80 countries, the company’s biggest-ever launch.While HTC said last year it would improve its marketing efforts, including the use of high-profile influential users, the company’s previous range of One phones was still undermined by the big budget launch of Samsung’s best-selling Galaxy 3.According to Gartner, HTC’s share of the global mobile phone market fell from 2.4 per cent in 2011 to 1.8 per cent last year.Analysts say that even an improved marketing budget could struggle to cut through the fierce competition posed by the large number of phone launches just this month, with BlackBerry only just starting on support of its long awaited smartphone relaunch, while other manufacturers plan to unveil new devices at next week’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.Backing the company up, says its new chief marketing officer, are mobile operators who want to be able to offer consumers more than just market leaders Samsung and Apple.Operators are “pretty dominated by Samsung and Apple, each telling them what to do” in terms of unit volumes and handset subsidies, and so “reducing the mobile operators to a dumb pipe”, says Benjamin Ho, who joined the company in January from Far EasTone, a Taiwanese mobile and telecoms operator.“Mobile operators around the world have told us they need a third brand of choice,” he says.The launch of [One] is not just the launch of another awesome product, it’s the relaunch of our brandFor the latest One smartphone, HTC itself will double its media buy, and increase its digital marketing budget by 250 per cent, in addition to the funds operators will contribute for marketing, says Mr Ho.That, he says, will by this spring rank HTC the second- or third-largest advertiser in its category in terms of ad dollars spent.“Let’s not make the operators do too much of the work for us – let’s do it more for ourselves,” Mr Ho says. “We will be spending a lot more money on devices, and digital, and take our devices to stores to do our roadshows there, before we even put it on to the shelves. In short we want to take on the responsibility for driving the demand and connecting with consumers.”“The launch of [One] is not just the launch of another awesome product, it’s the relaunch of our brand,” he says.HTC’s ad campaign will focus more on the device itself than last year’s skydiving spot, and stress HTC’s “authenticity” and “innovation” – a contrast with what Mr Ho suggests is the “copycat” approach taken by some rivals.“We do not talk enough about our features and our innovations,” Mr Ho says. “When we put something out, we talk about it superficially . . . The competition comes in, copies us and makes a big deal out of it. It makes it seem that they are innovating, not us. This is why we have started to take things a little bit more into our own hands.”However, amid the renewed branding push, the “quietly brilliant” tagline will remain.“ ‘Quietly brilliant’ doesn’t mean quiet, it means you are smart and you really understand what you are doing,” Mr Chou says. “Humble and dynamic and innovative and quick – that is the company’s DNA.”Additional reporting by Sarah Mishkin in Taipei and Dan Thomas in London
102;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-02-05T22:10:30Z;Trends that drive corporate IT spending;;"With widespread uncertainty keeping expectations for a global recovery low in 2013, we might assume the sky is falling on enterprise IT spending. Yet Gartner predicts 4.2 per cent growth in global IT spending for 2013 compared to only 1.2 per cent growth in 2012. Why does IT spending appear to be picking up despite the uneven economic outlook?First, IT spend is shifting. What constitutes IT spend in 2013? Cloud-based solutions, connectivity, maintenance contracts and tools, security solutions and application licensing, in addition to actual hardware and software.Second, the demands on any given piece of equipment keep increasing with bandwidth availability and processing power. These trends are exogenous to the company. So companies have to adjust their tools to continue to be productive within the ever-changing parameters of new technology.Third, IT spend doesn’t flow directly from the economic outlook. Technology is often a response to the need to be more productive or to drive growth so it runs out of synch, and sometimes counter-cyclical to, the overall economy. In 2009, for example, the economy was battered, but it was a good year for technology.The following trends will contribute to continued IT spending in the next 18 months:Proliferation of Devices. Whether issued by the employer or brought in, the typical worker no longer has just a desktop or laptop. Enterprise workers now may have a PC, a smartphone, a tablet (or two), and possibly another specialised device, each with some subset of enterprise applications running on it. Many types of work are being transformed; workers who previously wouldn’t have, now carry a tablet or other mobile device. For example, a doctor might use a tablet to enter data into electronic patient records, write prescriptions, or research protocols while conducting the examination.With each new device that needs to access part of the enterprise technology comes additional demand for software licenses and maintenance contracts. And if the devices are used for mission critical tasks, the IT department can expect to devote more resources to fix and maintain them.Device proliferation brings other issues. More, and more specialised, devices executing mission critical tasks will require frequent synchronisation of large data tranches and complex applications among multiple devices. Devices must talk to other devices in the enterprise but also not talk to the wrong devices outside the enterprise. Enterprise IT will need the capabilities and software to manage synchronisation and security.Use of Multiple Screens. The use of multiple screens of information so workers can more easily access and use information for enterprise tasks will expand beyond traditional settings, such as the trading floor. Where workers have typically used a monitor and paper, you’ll see paper being replaced by some form of screen. What was once on one screen will be spread across multiple screens. Use of multiple screens may become a signifier of importance or status. This trend will drive additional purchase of monitors and other screen types as well as associated need for more connectivity and maintenance. Equally important may be a training component so that workers are using screens to work more effectively and efficiently rather than less.BYO-Computer (BYOC) Not Manifesting. While the bring your own device (BYOD) trend continues to grow, BYOC is less common. From the enterprise perspective, tablets are similar to smartphones, most often used to host a mirror of enterprise email and a select number of other applications, so the latitude is wider. Computers are more complicated and typically mission critical. Machines brought in may not be suitable for the required activity and won’t have been purchased with the type of rapid-turnaround maintenance contracts needed to support enterprise activities. If a smartphone stops working, the employee can still use a desk phone. If the computer stops working, they may be unable to complete a piece of work.When BYOC does happen, it isn’t necessarily because people want to express personality or status but because they can no longer do the job using the enterprise tools and technology they are assigned. For example, one large multinational examined why employees brought their own computers and found that some laptops or desktops, provided through outsourcing contracts, were 7-10 years old and lacked the processing speed and memory to cope with current requirements. Rather than BYOD, this is a reaction to the way the company provides technology. When firms re-evaluate how they provide technology relative to what workers actually need, BYOC goes away. More frequent device refreshes may be required to address the capability gap, reversing the trend toward longer refresh cycles.Digital Collaboration as a Driver of Growth. Even in down economies and austerity, corporations need growth; the CIO has to support and enable it. In order to generate revenue growth, employees need the right tools to communicate as well as to do the job effectively. Often the cost analysis has to go deeper than cost or cost-of-ownership to encompass how the technology drives growth or collaboration and how it enables a different way of doing business. For example, the use of smartphones equipped with conference call software may reduce travel costs, and the argument for investing in smartphones might depend on that projected cost savings.Emergence of Multiple Profiles. IT departments will increasingly differentiate among workers, recognising differing needs for mobility, speed, processing power, and prestige among different types of users. These user profiles - high productivity worker, medium productivity worker, an so forth - will dictate policies around all aspects of enterprise IT, from device usage to computer-refresh cycles. The goal of technology will be to make employees as effective as possible and, in some cases, to present the right image; for example, client-facing professionals may need tablets to be more prepared and effective in face-to-face meetings.Connectivity and LTE/4G. Just as connectivity is part of the cost-of-ownership for devices, both 4G/LTE and managed WiFi will be an important part of IT spending. Incremental usage and spend will increase as greater LTE/4G availability drives more data-intensive and real-time uses. As LTE and WiFi mature, new waves of applications to communicate and collaborate will build on and replace each other in much the way IM, artificial networks, text messaging, and email have evolved.IT budgets are under scrutiny. Yet the demands on technology increase all the time. Companies that look at the bigger picture of technology-enabled workers will continue to invest where the imperatives for growth and productivity make the case.Eric Openshaw is a vice chairman and the US Technology, Media & Telecommunications leader for Deloitte and Paul Lee is Head of Research, Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications group for Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu."
103;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-02-05T14:38:54Z;Dell likely to reshape business as private group;;Now that Dell has agreed to a $24.4bn buyout, the personal computer maker is expected to intensify its focus on its more profitable enterprise customers, something many of the PC old guard are attempting as they fall out of favour with consumers.Dell and its rivals face many challenges. More consumers are buying tablets and smartphones rather than PCs. Microsoft’s Windows 8 has so far failed to stop the rot. And Intel’s promotion of thin-and-light Ultrabook notebooks and convertible tablets-cum-notebooks has been stymied by their high cost.But in the workplace and in data centres, the demand for more powerful servers, storage systems, software and services is considered a big opportunity by Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and Microsoft.Intel suffered a 3 per cent decline in its PC chip revenues in 2012 and expects little growth this year. Yet it predicts double-digit percentage increases in sales of chips for data centres, where demand is being driven by consumer devices accessing the web and cloud services. Microsoft expects similar growth for its server software and its other programs for businesses.HP clung on to its spot as the world’s number one PC maker last year, with a 16 per cent market share. But it has become focused on becoming the leader in three strategic areas: cloud computing, security and information management.China’s Lenovo, a close second with a 15 per cent market share, has said it plans to expand in smartphones, tablets and TVs as its PC growth slows. Dell, third with 11 per cent, shipped 20 per cent fewer PCs year on year in the fourth quarter – a result of it choosing not to compete in lower-margin value-priced PCs.“Lenovo can play strongly with that kind of a business model – it can live with a 2 per cent margin, whereas I don’t think HP and Dell can,” says Mikako Kitagawa, analyst at the Gartner research company.Lenovo said on Tuesday that its strategy was clear and its business strong. “We are focused on our products, customers and overall execution rather than distracting financial manoeuvres and major strategic shifts,” said a spokesman.By contrast, Dell has made more than two dozen acquisitions, mainly in software and services, since Michael Dell returned as chief executive in 2007. It is hoping these will help it diversify and reduce its dependence on the PC business. In 2012, it bought eight such companies, including the $2.4bn acquisition of Quest, which provides IT management software.But investors have shown little patience with the strategy, driving Dell’s shares down as its PC revenues have declined and prompting Mr Dell’s drastic action.“We recognize that it will still take more time, investment and patience, and I believe our efforts will be better supported by partnering with Silver Lake,” he said on Tuesday.Dave Johnson, an infrastructure analyst with Forrester Research, predicts Dell’s investments and Microsoft’s software expertise could be blended to create more powerful and efficient offerings for storage and networking infrastructures.“Microsoft and Dell working on that together could be a pretty powerful combination and a potential game-changer,” he says.However, Mr Forrester is more pessimistic about the chances of Windows and its PC ecosystem retaining its share of workers’ desktops as IT departments becoming increasingly comfortable with tablets, in particular Apple’s iPad.Forrester estimates IT departments spend $1,763 supporting each new PC, in addition to the initial purchase costs .“They’ve got to do patching of software, personalisation, manage deployment, compliance and the inventory – a whole range of things in managing a Windows device, and that’s a significant delta,” Mr Johnson says. “We think the cost of managing a tablet would be much lower.”PC makers’ response to the iPad was inhibited by the lack of a touch-optimised Windows operating system until the launch launch of Windows 8 last October .Dell is offering Windows tablets for enterprise, but it could also look at Android – another reason for Microsoft to invest in the buyout, according to Al Hilwa, IDC software analyst. “This is often how Microsoft thinks about these things – in terms of the threat from other ecosystems. It has to ensure Windows lives on and it has the cash to do this,” he says.Microsoft has sold more than 60m Windows 8 licences to date, which it says is comparable with its Windows 7 launch. But the figures do not match up with the results of PC makers, who say the new operating system has failed to increase sales of notebooks and desktops. In contrast, Taiwan’s Acer has reported strong sales of its Google Chromebook notebook (which runs on an alternative operating system made by Google) and HP introduced its first Chromebook this month.As a private company, away from the glare of investors and Wall Street analysts, Dell’s PC options include running down or spinning off the business, doubling down on investments in ultrabooks and other convertible designs, or expanding more into tablets and even smartphones.But, like its PC contemporaries, it needs to be jolted out of a complacency that has ceded much of the research and development work for the category to Microsoft and Intel during the past two decades, according to Mario Morales, electronics manufacturing analyst at IDC.“The market has been very sluggish because the ecosystem is just not ready – most of these companies are just trying to figure out how to survive right now and not really thinking about what they really need to do,” he says.Mr Morales sees a possible turnround next year, with an updated version of Windows, thinner notebooks and convertibles with all-day battery life and voice and gesture recognition being added to touch.“The PC makers have to reinvent themselves and I think 2014 is when you’re going to see the realisation of that promise.”
104;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-01-25T23:00:27Z;Deloitte study asserts PC era is not dead;;"While Apple’s results tlast week were underpinned by continued strong sales of both iPhones and iPads, the numbers also revealed Mac sales fell to 4.1m units in the latest quarter compared with 5.2m units a year earlier.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, gave several reasons for the Mac sales decline, noting that new iMacs began shipping only in December, and the quarter was a week shorter than the same period a year earlier.Nevertheless, he also conceded that, while “the market for PCs is weak,” even with 23m iPads sold during the quarter, “we could not build enough iPad minis to come into a demand balance …I’m sure there was some cannibalisation of Macs there”.Mr Cook’s comments, and those of Windows-based PC-makers including Dell – now the target of a potential leveraged buyout– appear to support the arguments of Gartner and others that the PC era may be on the wane.But not everyone agrees with this interpretation. Last week Deloitte published its technology predictions for 2013, including a strong assertion from Eric Openshaw, vice-chairman and US technology, media and telecommunications leader, that the PC is not dead.“We believe the PC remains the dominant device for activity on the internet,” he said, suggesting instead that the debate should focus on usage rather than units sold.To support his argument Mr Openshaw pointed out that more than 80 per cent of internet traffic measured in bits will continue to come from traditional personal computers (desktops and laptops) this year.“In addition, more than 70 per cent of the hours we spend on computing devices [PCs, smartphones and tablets] will be on a PC. We are not in a ‘post-PC era.’ We are in the era of ‘PC Plus’,” he said.I asked Mr Openshaw to highlight some of the other trends he is seeing and to comment on Deloitte’s technology predictions for 2013. Here is an edited version of his answers.What are the main trends you see?One of the most common topics of conversation among IT professionals today is BYOD, or bring your own device. Deloitte predicts that this year, more than half of Fortune 500 companies will allow employees to use their own device in the office. At the same time, however, we believe that the trend of bring your own computer (BYOC) will not really manifest itself.How do these two data points reconcile each other? Certain factors are contributing to both the growth of BYOD and less focus on across-the-board formalisation of a BYOC policy. Employees are already bringing multiple devices such as smartphones, one or two tablets to the workplace and are running enterprise applications on them. In fact a lot of everyday business tasks are being transitioned to these devices.In contrast, PCs at the workplace are used for mission critical tasks – a home computer in the workplace simply will not have the maintenance contracts that are needed to support these critical, very specific activities.How will this impact companies in 2013?To address the BYOD trend, companies need to address the increased demand for additional software licenses and maintenance. People will look to their IT department to help with fixing and maintaining these devices.In addition, companies need to pay special attention to data synchronisation and security.In order to manage any BYOC requests, companies need to offer freshly upgraded computers, in other words they will need to shorten the refresh life cycle.What should companies be doing to prepare?Employees need the right digital tools to do the job effectively. Often the cost analysis has to go deeper than cost or cost of ownership to include how the technology drives growth or productivity gains and how it enables a different way of doing business.How will the BYOD trend affect the role of the company IT leader?Successful chief information officers are already acting more like strategic drivers for entire organisations. It’s not just managing the IT infrastructure and services any longer. Now, it’s about executing on broad technology strategies that create differentiation.What other trends do you expect to have the biggest impact this year?I would highlight three others: First; the end of password-only (single factor) security. More than 90 per cent of user-generated passwords, even those considered strong, are or soon will be vulnerable to hacking in seconds. Additional forms of authentication including token devices, additional passwords sent through SMS to your phone, fingerprints and other biometrics, or even ‘tap and go’ credit cards are required.Second, enterprise social networks will become another important company tool, but are not yet a panacea: By the end of 2013 more than 90 per cent of Fortune 500 companies will have partially or fully implemented an ESN, a 70 per cent increase over 2011. Interestingly, our research shows that 40- to 49-year-olds were more than 40 per cent more likely to have registered and more than 100 per cent more likely to post more than 4 times per month than 20- to 29-year-olds.Third, crowdfunding portals are growing quickly. Crowdfunding portals will raise $3bn in 2013, double the amount they raised in 2011. This reward-based market is expected to have the greatest impact on technology and media developers."
105;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-01-25T19:26:58Z;Smartphone industry set for slower growth;;Six years to the month after Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, the smartphone industry’s go-go years are officially over.Cautious comments from Samsung Electronics on Friday underlined the message conveyed by the latest quarterly results from Apple earlier in the week: even as it scales new heights, the smartphone market is entering a phase in which vaulting growth rates – and high profit margins – will be much harder to come by.In the developed world, “the people who don’t have a smartphone are either making a choice not to have one, or can’t afford one”, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner.The developing world, meanwhile, is riding a wave of cut-price devices, many of them closer in nature to feature phones than the high-end smartphones that have put Apple and Samsung at the top.Announcing details of its full-year results on Friday, Samsung warned that its smartphone business would be hit in 2013 by growing price competition and slowing demand in developed markets, even as it confirmed record earnings for 2012.“The furious growth spurt seen in the global smartphone market last year is expected to be pacified by intensifying price competition compounded by a slew of new products,” Samsung said. “In the first quarter, demand for smartphones in developed countries is expected to decelerate.”The company highlighted its uncertain outlook by breaking from its usual practice of giving a target figure for capital expenditure in the current financial year. It said only that it would “respond to the market’s ebb and flow with a capex plan that is flexible in manner”, and that capital investment would be similar to last year’s $21.5bn.Apple’s shares continued to slip following its announcement of weaker than expected iPhone sales in the final quarter of 2012, with Exxon taking its crown as the world’s most valuable company.Despite selling 47.8m iPhones – 29 per cent more than in its previous record quarter a year before – Apple failed to live up to Wall Street’s high hopes, leading some analysts to predict the years of super-charged growth that began with the iPod were behind it.Samsung’s latest figures confirmed the outsized impact that smartphones had on the broader technology world in 2012. Its handset business accounted for well over half the group’s operating profit for the year, with sales up 58 per cent in the final quarter thanks to demand for new high-end devices such as the Galaxy SIII and Galaxy Note II.However, its more downbeat comments point to a quarter-on-quarter drop in total operating profit in the first three months of this year, which would be the first such decline for two years, said Daniel Kim, an analyst at Macquarie.This would be in part a result of a fall in orders of smartphone components from Apple, which has posted disappointing sales of its new iPhone 5, he added.
106;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-01-22T09:18:22Z;LG: ready to give Apple and Samsung a run for their money?;;"Over the past two years, LG Electronics has watched its South Korean rival Samsung Electronics storm ahead in the mobile phone sector as its own market share dwindled.This week has brought a couple of upbeat developments that suggest the company is making some headway at the top end of the smartphone sector. But has it really turned the corner?The first bit of good news came on Monday, when LG said its flagship Optimus G handset, launched in September, had sold more than 1m units. Then, on Tuesday, came reports that the Optimus G had helped LG leapfrog Apple to claim second place in the US mobile phone market, with market share of 13 per cent in December, according to Hong Kong-based analysis firm Counterpoint Research.But the champagne should be kept on ice. For one thing, the decent US market share should not distract from the much worse performance elsewhere: LG “has had the least success [in smartphones] in Asia Pacific, which is the biggest and fastest growing market worldwide”, notes Mark Newman, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein.LG’s global market share in mobile phones was just 3.3 per cent in the third quarter of last year, exactly half the level of two years before, according to the research group Gartner. Moreover, while LG’s handset business stopped making losses in the same period, its operating profit of Won21bn ($19.8m) looks weak next to a figure of more than Won5tn for Samsung’s mobile arm.The problem does not lie with LG’s powers of design or technology. “Their capability to design a good high-end smartphone has improved so much,” says Marcello Ahn, an analyst at Nomura. He is more concerned about the company’s ability to keep up with demand. While Samsung’s internal sourcing of components is seen as a strength, LG has been undermined by insufficient scale at its sister company LG Innotek, its sole supplier of touch screen panels, Ahn says. This may explain why the Optimus G is still only available in four countries, four months after its launch.LG’s supposed production limitations prompted a mild war of words with Google, with whom it has collaborated to build the Nexus 4 smartphone. After supply shortages in Europe, Google’s UK managing director blamed LG’s “scarce and erratic” supply of the phone, prompting a claim by LG’s head in France that it was Google who had underestimated demand. Moreover, the low retail price of the Nexus 4 (£279 in the UK, compared with £400 for Samsung’s Galaxy SIII) is bad news for LG’s margins, suggesting that closer co-operation with Google may not be the way to sustainable profitability in handsets.But as Newman notes, “there is motivation… for [telecoms operators] to have a solid number three to reduce reliance on Apple and Samsung”. And the decent response to the Optimus G – to be joined in the first quarter of this year with the higher-spec Optimus G Pro – shows that LG can produce high-end smartphones to give the rest of the market a run for its money.The company has a huge amount of lost ground to make up, but it should not be written off just yet.[UPDATE]LG Electronics did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but a spokesman made contact after this article was published. He said that sales of the Optimus G passed the 1m mark before the end of 2012, not after it as the article originally stated, although the achievement was reported only last week.Related reading:

107;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-01-18T22:25:02Z;Corporate IT falling short of potential;;"A global survey of more than 2,000 company IT leaders published this week by Gartner, the IT market research firm, shows that, on average, enterprises are realising only 43 per cent of technology’s business potential.I asked Mark McDonald, group vice-president and Gartner Fellow, what chief information officers can do to address this issue and make better use of IT in 2013.Q. The CIO Agenda 2013 survey reveals that chief information officers believe that their enterprises have realised less than half of technology’s potential. How has this come about?There are two reasons behind this: the past and the future.For the past 10 years, IT has endured a decade of CIO IT budget devaluation because tending to current concerns and costs have limited IT’s strategic relevance, resources and skills. This led many CIOs to believe that surviving meant keeping IT focused on muddling through with current operations and responsibilities. That approach in turn reduces the good business reasons for investing in technology.This approach worked so long because there were no really new technologies to invest in. During these same 10 years there was something of a desert of technology and business innovation on the horizon, providing another reason why technology has been underused in the enterprise. But all of that has changed now.The economic, competitive and customer context have all reduced the potential of existing technologies, particularly when a context change is not accompanied by a technology change. The digital future further accelerates these changes, as CIOs see mobile, information and cloud as reversing this trend. So now we have a new context, new technologies that reduce the potential of current technology operations and investment.If executives, including the CIO, want to raise this number, then they will need to change the strategic relevance, resources and skills assigned to technology. This number cannot increase by repeating a past of ‘doing more with less’ if they expect to create value in the future.Q. Can IT realise its full potential and support the enterprise going forward?The answer is yes, but to fill such a big gap, CIOs cannot merely work harder, especially when they consider the factors that have changed the enterprise. Over the last 18 months, digital technologies have reached a tipping point with business executives. CIOs have little choice but to increase technology’s potential in the enterprise, and this means evolving IT’s strategies, priorities and plans beyond tending to the usual concerns.This means finding answers to a new central question: “how will technology support growth?” This question replaces the prior one of “how to control IT cost?”Q. Will IT budgets be boosted in 2013 to allow CIOs to do this?Without a change in context, this is unlikely. The survey showed that CIO IT budgets have been flat to negative ever since the dotcom bust of 2002. For 2013, IT budgets are projected to be slightly down, with a weighted global average decline of 0.5 per cent.However, it is not appropriate to think that CIO’s have to re-slice the IT budget pie to make room for digital technology investments. That is a ‘more with less’ view that is ultimately self-defeating.The bottom line is that the CIO cannot expect to secure additional funding without assuming new responsibilities or producing new results. CIOs can get money to do new things; they just can’t get more money to do the same old things.Q. What are the top CIO priorities in 2013?Digital technologies dominate CIO technology priorities for 2013. The top 10 global technology priorities revealed by the survey reflect a greater emphasis on externally oriented digital technologies, as opposed to traditional IT/operationally oriented systems.Data and analytics were ranked as the key priority for CIOs in 2013, followed by mobile computing, cloud computing and collaboration technologies. CIOs see these technologies as disrupting business fundamentally over the next 10 years.When asked which digital technologies would be most disruptive, 70 per cent of CIOs cited mobile technologies, followed by big data/analytics at 55 per cent, social media at 54 per cent and public cloud at 51 per cent. The disruptiveness of each of these technologies is real, but CIOs see their greatest disruptive power coming in combination, rather than in isolation.Q. So what will corporate IT leaders be doing differently in 2013?Digital technologies will certainly provide a platform to achieve results, but only if CIOs adopt new roles and behaviours to find digital value. CIOs require a new agenda that incorporates hunting for new digital innovations and opportunities, and harvesting value from products, services and operations.However, IT needs new tools in order to find technology-intensive innovation and harvest raised business performance from transformed IT infrastructure, operations and applications. Without change, CIOs and IT will consign themselves to tending a garden of legacy assets and responsibilities.Q. Will the CIO’s role change as a result?It should and for many it has. Sixty seven per cent of CIOs today have significant leadership responsibilities outside of traditional IT, ranging from chief process officer to business strategy to customer care.Almost a fifth of CIOs now act as their enterprise’s chief digital officer, leading digital commerce and channels. Though this nascent role varies in scope and style, it normally includes championing the digital vision for the business – that is ensuring that the business is evolving optimally in the new digital context.The 2013 CIO Agenda focused on recognising these challenges and developing plans to win in a digital world. CIOs who merely stick to their current job in this quiet crisis are setting themselves up to lose that job in the future.IT is not going away; it just needs to change – not because it is wrong, but because the world has changed and enterprises are realising only a fraction of technology’s potential. That is why we have titled the 2013 CIO agenda “Hunting and Harvesting in a Digital World.”Table 1Top 10 CIO Business and Technology Priorities in 2013SaaS = software as a service; IaaS = infrastructure as a service; PaaS = platform as a serviceSource: Gartner Executive Programs (January 2013)Mark McDonald is a group vice-president and Gartner Fellow.

108;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-01-17T22:10:00Z;Intel hit by downturn in core PC market;;Intel’s profits fell 15 per cent as revenues and margins declined in 2012, with the world’s biggest chipmaker by sales suffering from the downturn in its core PC market.The Silicon Valley company blamed weak PC sales on poor macroeconomic conditions and the popularity of tablets. Fourth-quarter revenues of $13.5bn were in line with Wall Street expectations, but down 3 per cent on a year earlier. Earnings of 48 cents a share beat analyst forecasts of 45 cents.Paul Otellini, chief executive, told an analyst conference call that the company was fighting back with next-generation processors for thinner “ultrabook” laptops, hybrid convertible devices and tablets.“We see the industry in a period of transition and hyper-innovation. We are well positioned to take advantage of these trends …from the lowest-powered portable devices to the most powerful data centre servers,” he said.PC shipments declined between 4.9 and 6.4 per cent in the fourth quarter year on year, according to differing statistics from the Gartner and IDC research companies this month. They cited the failure of the new Windows 8 operating system to ignite the market when it was released at the end of October, as well as consumers’ preference for lower-cost tablets.Intel currently has its processors in only 10 tablets and seven smartphones, compared to 140 ultrabooks. But Mr Otellini was enthusiastic about all-day battery life, thinner laptops and new designs for convertibles that would drive growth over the next two years.“I’ve seen the prototypes of the industrial designs and they’re really exciting products,” he said.However, for the near term, the Silicon Valley group forecast revenues of $12.7bn for the first quarter, below an analyst consensus of $12.9bn.Intel shares fell 5 per cent to $21.55 on the news in after-hours trading in New York, having risen 2.6 per cent during the day.For the full year, Intel reported revenues fell 1.2 per cent to $53.3bn, gross margins dipped slightly to 62.1 per cent from 62.5 per cent, net income was down 15 per cent at $11bn, and earnings per share were down 11 per cent at $2.13.Earlier in the day, Taiwan’s TSMC, the largest contract chipmaker, reported a 32 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profits as its factories made chips based on the designs of the UK’s Arm for the booming smartphone and tablet markets.Intel has been dabbling in contract manufacturing with three small companies and the Bloomberg news agency reported on Thursday that it had signed up Cisco Systems as its biggest customer to date.Mr Otellini said Intel’s single greatest asset was its cutting-edge manufacturing, with chips of circuit widths of 22 billionths of a metre representing half its volume in the fourth quarter, while the rest of the industry was yet to ship at this smaller size.Intel also announced an extra $2bn in capital spending in 2013 to begin moving up from 300mm to 450mm-diameter silicon wafers, which allow chips to be cut from them at much lower cost.
109;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-01-16T09:00:38Z;Apple rolls out China credit facility;;Apple is to allow Chinese consumers to buy its gadgets on credit – a move that could help boost sales in the world’s largest smartphone market by unit shipments, where it has lost share to cheaper brands.Customers in China buying any product that costs more than Rmb300 ($48) from Apple’s online store may now apply to pay in up to 12 monthly instalments interest-free, the company said on its Chinese website.The service, which is offered to holders of China Merchants Bank credit cards, also allows payment in up to 24 instalments. Payment in 18 instalments carries a 6.5 per cent interest rate, while for 24 instalments an 8.5 per cent interest rate will be charged. The offer applies to purchases of up to Rmb30,000.Apple has similar arrangements in other markets but the Chinese version offers a lower applicable price and allows for longer repayment schedules than its US equivalent, which is offered in co-operation with Barclays.The new service will make Apple’s devices more affordable as smartphone demand in China becomes increasingly driven by first-time buyers with lower incomes.That trend cost Apple some of its growth in the Chinese market last year and has enabled domestic brands that offer lower-priced handsets to grab market share from multinational rivals.Chinese brands, led by Lenovo and including the likes of Huawei, ZTE, Coolpad and Gionee, accounted for more than half of smartphone sales in China last year for the first time, according to Gartner.Apple dropped to sixth place by unit sales in the third quarter, a fall that analysts have blamed on the fact that the company, unlike peers such as Samsung, offers no mid-priced or low-end devices.Despite media reports that the group might launch a cheaper iPhone this year priced as low as $100, executives have said Apple’s future is not in low-priced devices. But the new credit facility could attract some Chinese buyers who would otherwise not purchase Apple’s devices.The credit facility is being offered just in time for the local launch on Friday of the 3G version of the iPad mini.Since Tim Cook took over as chief executive, Apple has put more emphasis on China. Last week, Mr Cook told Chinese media that he expected the country to “soon” overtake the US as Apple’s largest market, and said the company would expand its presence on the mainland by adding many more to the eight stores it has there now.Apple’s revenue in Greater China – which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan – increased 83 per cent to $22.8bn in the fiscal year that ended in September 2012, a slower rate of growth than the previous year but still faster than the 46 per cent growth registered in the US market.
110;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
111;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-01-14T22:50:36Z;Gartner signals end of PC era;;Slumping sales of PCs in the fourth quarter last year are further evidence of a structural shift in the PC market rather than simply a weak economy, say Gartner analysts.Worldwide PC shipments totalled 90.3m units in the fourth quarter of 2012, a 4.9 per cent decline from the fourth quarter of 2011 while PC shipments in Europe, the Middle East and Africa fell by 9.6 per cent, according to preliminary results from Gartner.The latest figures by the industry research group represent further confirmation that the “PC era” is waning, and have important implications for both PC manufacturers and software developers like Microsoft.But they also highlight an important change in the way industry analysts view a corresponding surge in sales of tablet devices for use at home and at work.“Tablets have dramatically changed the device landscape for PCs, not so much by ‘cannibalising’ PC sales, but by causing PC users to shift consumption to tablets rather than replacing older PCs,” said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner.“Whereas as once we imagined a world in which individual users would have both a PC and a tablet as personal devices, we increasingly suspect that most individuals will shift consumption activity to a personal tablet, and perform creative and administrative tasks on a shared PC.”While Ms Kitagawa believes that there will be some individuals who retain both PCs and tablets, she adds, “we believe they will be exception and not the norm”. Instead she suggests that buyers will not replace secondary PCs in the household.“This transformation was triggered by the availability of compelling low-cost tablets in 2012, and will continue until the installed base of PCs declines to accommodate tablets as the primary consumption device,” Ms Kitagawa said.Significantly, Gartner suggests that during the recent holiday season, consumers no longer viewed PCs as the number one gift item, and notes that the launch of Microsoft’s Windows 8 did not have a significant impact on PC shipments in the fourth quarter.“The PC market continues to face many headwinds. The launch of Windows 8 had no impact on PC demand, especially as ultramobile products were both limited in supply, as well as being priced too high,” said Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner. “The holiday season mostly saw retailers clearing Windows 7 notebook inventory or driving volume of low-end notebooks. Furthermore, the increasing choice of tablets at decreasing price points no doubt became a favourite Christmas present ahead of PCs.”“In the fourth quarter of 2012, mobile PC shipments decreased 11 per cent while desktop PC shipments declined 6 per cent year-on-year,” said Isabelle Durand, principal research analyst at Gartner. “However, all-in-one form factor models from Asus, Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard look like a promising platform for the future.”Among PC makers, HP regained the top position in worldwide PC shipments in the fourth quarter of 2012, however the company’s shipments did not grow compared to a year ago. Analysts said HP most likely gave up a certain margin level to gain market shares. HP was successful in managing large retail deals targeting Microsoft’s Windows 8 launch and holiday sales in selected regions.Meanwhile, Lenovo dropped to the number two position in the fourth quarter of 2012, but it experienced the best growth rate – 8.2 per cent – among the top five PC vendors worldwide.Lenovo’s growth exceeded regional growth rates in North America, Emea and Asia/Pacific, but lower than the industry average in Latin America and Japan. In North America, Lenovo performed well by expanding in the retail market and protecting professional market.Meanwhile, in a separate report, Fitch Ratings warned that revenues in the US technology sector will decline modestly this year, reflecting a confluence of factors ranging from the US debt ceiling, Europe’s debt crisis, and China’s government changes.“2013 marks an important year for the industry with the launch of several high-profile products, such as Windows 8, Ultrabooks, and hybrid PC-tablets,” says Fitch. “This is especially critical for Microsoft, Dell, HP, and Intel, all of which have been limited participants in faster growing products over the last two years.”Fitch expects a successful uptake of Windows 8 because of consumer reliance on the Microsoft platform and its extensive enterprise installed base, but wans that, given the relatively slow uptake of Windows 8, “the timing will not be immediate”.
112;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-01-06T17:32:07Z;Big displays of ambition in China handsets;;Chinese handset makers elbowed their way into the limelight a little over a month ago, by snatching smartphone leadership in their home market from global brands.In the third quarter, sales of Lenovo smartphones in China surpassed those of Apple, while Gionee, a brand few outside China had ever heard of, squeezed past HTC, according to Gartner, the research firm.The rise of homegrown handsets is unlikely to stop there. After having rolled up the mature smartphone market, Chinese manufacturers are now following the global brands into the new, supposedly higher-margin segment of “phablets” – devices with displays larger than 5 inches that seek to combine phone and tablet features.This category, bolstered by devices launched in 2012 such as Samsung’s Galaxy Note II and Apple’s iPad Mini, barely existed a year ago. According to IDC, the research firm, worldwide shipments of smartphones with 5-inch displays soared from just 1.2m units in 2011 to 16.6m last year.IDC expects this trend to continue. As long as the iPad mini and low-cost large-screen smartphones continue to sell well this year, annual growth in the phablet segment will exceed 50 per cent, says Dickie Chang, senior market analyst at IDC.Others are even more bullish. According to Barclays, shipments of smartphones with display sizes of 5 inches and above jumped from 4.5m in 2011 to 27.4m in 2012. The bank expects shipments to grow more than fivefold to 142.6m this year and hit 228.5m in 2015.“Vendors are targeting this segment [because it promises a] better profit rate,” says Mr Chang of IDC. “Consumers are somehow willing to pay more for a bigger device.”But that could turn out to be a miscalculation as the fast followers from China, the world’s largest smartphone market by shipments, have kicked off a price war, with some offering 5-inch smartphones for less than half of what a Samsung Note costs.At least 10 large-screen smartphone models have either been launched already or will be launched soon by Chinese companies.Dale Gai, an analyst with Barclays, says the push into phablets is boosting the smartphone upgrade cycle in China. According to Barclays figures, Chinese handset companies accounted for only 5.5 per cent of the total large smartphone market last year but will expand their share to 15.8 per cent by 2015.“Large-display smartphones provide differentiation opportunities for mobile brands such as Oppo,” says Pete Lau, Oppo vice-president. The company has launched the Find5, a 5-inch smartphone that sells at about Rmb3,000 ($480), and says it might release more 5-inch devices.But many of the new Chinese-made large smartphones carry price tags of less than Rmb2,000. This includes two models by Lenovo, the country’s leading smartphone brand, a model by Gionee, but also phones offered by new entrants.Zopo, a company that only sold its first smartphone in March last year, launched a 5.3-inch phone in October which sells for only Rmb1,699. It plans to launch a 5.7-inch device later this month and a 5-inch phone with a high-resolution screen soon, both for under Rmb2,000.Though Chinese companies are offering cheaper devices – Samsung’s Note starts at Rmb4,199, for example – analysts say domestic brands may struggle to turn a profit.“We are, again, seeing a price war in the Chinese market,” says Sandy Shen, head of consumer research at the IT research firm Gartner in China. She sees young white-collar workers who want to show off, but whose incomes do not allow them to buy a Galaxy Note, as the main customer group for the homegrown phablets.“The main driver behind this is second-tier Chinese smartphone brands – they achieve a cost-down by localising components, mainly the display, and then offer a larger device at the same price,” says Mr Gai.Additional reporting by Zhao Tianqi
113;IT;Gartner Inc;2013-01-03T17:31:41Z;Global IT spending expected to grow by 4%;;Global IT spending is predicted to grow by 4.2 per cent this year, outpacing expectations of flat growth in the world economy but slowing from an already tepid 2012.Spending in the sector is tipped to hit $3,700bn in 2013, up from $3,600bn in 2012, according to data released on Thursday by Gartner, the research consultancy.The predictions come amid an uncertain business climate. The OECD recently slashed its growth forecast for 2013, predicting average growth of 1.4 per cent for its 34 member economies.However, Richard Gordon, managing vice-president at Gartner, said the figure was still low for the IT sector. “Three to four per cent is a really low rate historically, and actually it signifies the sector maturing a bit.”Mr Gordon also said key areas of uncertainty in 2012 had improved. These included the China leadership transition, US election, and the eurozone crisis.“A year or two ago there was a sense of ‘we don’t know how bad this is’, but now we understand the magnitude and the challenges,” he said of the eurozone.Fears about slowing growth in emerging markets had also calmed. “There was some concern there would be a hard landing in China and India, but it appears the governments in those countries are handling things well.”Spending growth in 2012 was just 1.2 per cent. However, much of the difference comes from currency movements against the US dollar. On a constant currency basis, spending grew 4.1 per cent in 2012 and is forecast to grow 3.9 per cent this year.Spending on devices, which includes PCs, tablets, phones and printers, is forecast to increase 6.3 per cent to $666bn. However, this is a reduction on Gartner’s previous forecast of 7.9 per cent.Mr Gordon said the tablet market in particular had been hit by price competition from devices running Google’s Android software and a shift towards cheaper devices in emerging markets. PC sales continued to be affected by a shift to tablets in the workplace.Spending on enterprise software is forecast to grow by 6.4 per cent, driven by security, storage management and customer tracking software.The biggest IT spending market continues to be telecoms services, where growth is expected to be flat as increased spending on mobile data replaces cuts in voice services used by businesses. Mobile data will make up 33 per cent of the telecoms services market by 2016, up from 22 per cent last year, according to Gartner.Mr Gordon said the sector was unlikely to return to previous growth rates of 5-10 per cent.“I think overall the growth will remain in the 0-5 per cent range. There are some hot tech markets that will do better, such as cloud computing, but we are playing with the same pie.”
114;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-12-21T16:23:16Z;Yota, the 2-faced Russian smartphone;;"Calling someone two-faced isn’t exactly flattering – but for a new Russian smartphone, it’s the key feature.Yota, the company mostly known for offering mobile broadband services in places like Russia and Nicaragua, has come up with a very innovative concept for its first own mobile phone handset.The phone will have a dual screen – a typical LCD on one side and an e-paper display on the other side for prolonged reading without draining the battery.That characteristic should help the phone stand out from the army of Android phones currently available on the market. But will it be enough to get traction at home and abroad?“There is no doubt the Yota phone is highly innovative in a world of homogeneous smartphones so the company should be applauded for that,” says Ben Wood of CCS Insight, a research company following the mobile industry.He says the company was smart to add use-cases beyond just being an e-reader, “particularly the ability to do a screen grab of an important email, map or contact card before the battery goes flat and still have that information available on the e-lnk screen.” (check out the feature in this YouTube video.)But Wood and other industry watchers expect it will be hard for the phone to get any traction beyond its home market because of a lack of brand power – not surprising for a company which has a website only in Russian.“The brand will resonate in Russia and neighbouring countries but not in other European markets,” says Carolina Milanesi of Gartner, an IT research company. She advises Yota to team up with operators and present its phone as an operator-branded device, priced attractively to overcome its lack in brand prestige.Wood points to another reason why teaming up with operators will be critical to the phone’s success. “Without operator deals you end up relying on deals with distributors or direct-to large specialist retailers like MediaMarkt and Carphone Warehouse, who have a much smaller proportion of the mobile market.”So far, Yota has not announced any deals for its smartphone in any market. There will be further news at the giant industry jamboree, Mobile World Congress, which takes place in February in Barcelona.But it should not underestimate conquering the mobile phone market, says Ben Wood. “The mobile phone market is all about brand and marketing firepower now. For a small player like this to get heard above the noise made by Apple and Samsung is almost impossible – even well known players like HTC, Nokia and Sony Mobile find it tough.”Further reading:

115;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-12-17T17:34:59Z;Record China sales for Apple’s iPhone 5;;Apple sold over 2m units of its new iPhone 5 in its first weekend on sale in China, a record for the company’s smartphone in potentially its biggest market.The news could provide a much-needed boost for shares in Apple, which are hovering around the $500 level after coming under recent pressure. The stock has fallen more than 25 per cent in the past three months partly because of concerns that growth in iPhone and iPad sales will not be sustained.The iPhone 5 went on sale on Friday in China, online and at Apple’s retail store, with the carriers China Unicom and China Telecom also selling the handset.“Customer response to iPhone 5 in China has been incredible, setting a new record with the best first weekend sales ever in China,” said Tim Cook, Apple CEO, in a statement.Apple did not release comparable three-day sales figures for the iPhone 4S, the 5’s predecessor, which went on sale in January. The iPhone 4 went on sale in China in September 2010, before its online store opened that October and China Telecom began supporting the iPhone in the first quarter of this year.China Mobile, the largest carrier in China with nearly 700m subscribers and a 65 per cent market share, does not support the iPhone, but analysts expect Apple to strike a deal with the carrier by late 2013.Analysts at UBS had said that some of their Chinese sources did not expect the iPhone 5 to do as well as the 4S. There was no queue outside Apple’s Shanghai store when it opened on Friday.But China Unicom reported more than 300,000 online reservations for the phone earlier this month, with the city of Beijing along with Guangdong and Shandong provinces leading demand, ahead of Shanghai.Apple shipped around 3.3m iPhones into China in the third quarter, according to Gartner, a technology research company, down from 5.7m in the first quarter.Analysts at Stifel Nicolaus expect Apple to ship 49m iPhones globally this quarter. Apple says the iPhone 5, launched on September 21, will be available in more than 100 countries by the end of December – its fastest ever rollout.Apple shares fell to below $500 for the first time since February in pre-market trading on Monday, while shares in Hon Hai Precision, the world’s biggest electronics contract manufacturer better known as Foxconn, dropped 4.7 per cent to T$87.2.
116;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-12-12T19:51:06Z;‘Gamification’ looks to make work fun;;“Gamification” may sound like a new way to waste time, but proponents of the technique, which involves using strategies pioneered in popular games to drive customer and employee behaviour, claim it also delivers serious results.In particular, they claim that it can help companies and other organisations accelerate digital transformation projects by engaging, rewarding and motivating employees and customers.“Gamification techniques blend psychology and technology to help businesses reach key objectives such as increased collaboration, workforce efficiency and customer loyalty,” explains Kris Duggan, chief executive of Badgeville, a leader in the emerging market for gamification and behaviour management technology.“It turns out that people generally respond well to games and rewards,” says Mr Duggan, a serial entrepreneur who co-founded Badgeville as a “Platform as a Service” (PaaS) company in 2010.While game mechanics, such as points and badges, are the hallmarks of gamification, the real challenge, say analysts, is to design player-centric applications that focus on the motivations and rewards that engage players more fully. Game mechanics, like points, badges and leader boards, are simply the tools that implement the underlying engagement models.Just last week Badgeville announced a partnership with Capgemini Consulting, the global strategy and consulting group, that aims to use gamification techniques to help companies revitalise and digitise their business operations.“Large and complex digitally-enabled business transformations are often dependent on a significant cultural and behavioural shift, and the use of smartly-applied game mechanics as part of a behavioural change program can tackle that need in an innovative, engaging and meaningful way,” said Maggie Buggie, vice president of Digital Transformation at Capgemini Consulting.“Gamification offers a creative and innovative way to foster collaboration and secure engagement around strategic priorities,” says Capgemini.In less than two years, Badgeville itself has built a roster of more than 200 customers including big name clients such as Samsung, Deloitte, EMC, Barnes & Noble and Universal Music.Some are already using Badgeville’s software to integrate gamification techniques in their customer-relationship management systems to encourage sales staff to close sales or make follow-up calls to customers.Badgeville’s gamification and reputation software also enables businesses to easily track user behaviour across their websites and mobile applications enabling them to improve customer loyalty and customer “stickiness.”Badgeville’s behavioural analytics software – called the Behaviour Platform – promises “to save the world from boring user experiences, one website and app at a time”. The software works by leveraging the same techniques inherent in today’s most successful social games and sites, enabling companies to measure, influence and reward valuable user behaviours.Others are using Badgeville’s gamification software to reduce the incidence of “shelfware” – software purchased by companies that remains unused. Mr Duggan points out that about half of all software applications fail to get adopted by end-users, resulting in nearly $500bn in unused software investments globally.Overall, the market for gamification software is growing rapidly. By 2014, more than 70 per cent of Global 2000 organisations will have at least one “gamified” application, according to Gartner, the IT market research firm. While Gartner also warns that much of the current buzz around gamification is driven by novelty and hype, it also argues that gamification is positioned “to become a highly significant trend over the next five years”.“Gamification could become as important as Facebook, eBay or Amazon,” said Mr. Burke in a report published late last year. “Understanding how to apply game mechanics to motivate positive behavioural change is critical to success.”Gamification aims to inspire deeper, more engaged relationships and to change behaviour, but Mr Burke argues that it needs to be implemented thoughtfully. “Most attempts at gamification currently miss the mark, but successful and sustainable gamification can convert customers into fans, turn work into fun, or make learning a joy. The potential is enormous.”
117;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-12-10T18:36:07Z;Bharti Infratel IPO: big test for market sentiment;;"Tuesday will see one of India’s largest IPOs for years, as Bharti Infratel, the telecoms tower arm of Bharti Airtel, seeks to raise $715m.With regulatory flip-flop reducing confidence in a debt-mired telecoms industry and the Indian government relaunching its privatisation programme to reduce the budget deficit, all eyes are on tomorrow’s IPO as a measure of market sentiment.The sale, which closes on December 14, will price 189m shares in a range between Rs210 and Rs240; at the top end, this values the company at over Rs45bn. Of this equity, just over 146m shares will be issued afresh and 42m an offer for sale from existing shareholders, including Nomura and GS Strategic.The prospectus says some of the new funds will be used to install 4,813 new towers and upgrade existing towers.Bharti Infratel is one of the country’s biggest telecoms tower businesses. It has over 34,000 towers across 18 states, plus a 42 per cent stake in Indus Towers, a joint venture between Bharti Infratel, Vodafone and Aditya Birla Telecom which constitutes more than 46,000 additional towers. Compare this with Reliance Infratel’s 50,000 towers.Financially, the company has seen strong growth. The company saw year-end revenues to March 2012 climb 11 per cent to Rs94.5bn, and net income rise to Rs7.5bn from Rs5.5bn in year-end 2011, after even higher levels of growth in previous years. Diluted earnings per share have grown from Rs1.52 in 2010 to Rs4.30 in 2012.Kamlesh Bhatia, research director at Gartner, told beyondbrics: “I’d say this IPO is long overdue… The company is looking to unlock some value from its fixed assets [valued at Rs167.8bn in September]. They’re in debt due to acquisitions in Africa, so they need to get some cash back into the business.”Among the 53 risks investors should be aware of, the prospectus mentions how “active” the Indian government has been in the regulation of the sector. This affects the tower business both directly and via its clients. There is a chance Bharti Infratel won’t be able to collect termination fees from service providers whose 2G licences were cancelled by the Supreme Court, plus:Licences and permits required in the tower business are varied and may be difficult to obtain, and once obtained, may be amended or revoked or may not be renewed.Yet, CRISIL Research has rated the shares “four on five”, which is “above average” relative to the other listed equity securities in India:The company stands to gain from the increase in penetration of voice and data services, which is expected to drive the telecom companies’ demand for base transceiver stations and additional towers… Large-scale operations, first-mover advantage and pool sharing arrangement among the top three telcos have resulted in better-than-industry tenancy ratio for Bharti Infratel.India’s telecoms sector has been suffering under heavy debts and an unpredictable regulatory environment. Shares in Bharti Airtel have lost 11.6 per cent in the year to Rs317.90, while Reliance Communications stock is down 0.1 per cent to Rs76, moving against the market as the Nifty Index gained 21.4 per cent in the same period to 5,908.9.Related reading:

118;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-12-04T21:28:39Z;Benchmarking: Cost comparison with peers might reduce procurement bills;A range of tools can aid the search for best value, reports Jessica Twentyman;When companies are cutting costs, many are paying “exorbitant” margins on hardware and software. So says Al Nagar, head of benchmarking at Mercato Solutions, a company in Birmingham, UK, that helps IT buyers strike better deals with resellers and component suppliers.Socitm, the UK association for public sector information and communications professionals, suggests that 3 per cent is the average margin on IT products that organisations should pay resellers. But research by Mercato indicates average margins paid for IT products stand at 26 per cent in the retail sector, 27.5 per cent for pharmaceuticals companies and 44 per cent for fast-moving consumer goods’ businesses.The trouble is not just that customers have no knowledge of the prices resellers pay their own suppliers, but also that these prices are volatile, often changing daily according to supply and demand.Dramatic constraints in the supply chain can have dramatic consequences. In the aftermath of the Japanese tsunami in 2011, the price of hard disc drives quadrupled, says Mr Nagar.“Buyers have the issue of finding and validating trade prices on every product, every day,” he says. “And while suppliers are quick to pass on price increases, they’re not so quick to reduce them when the supply chain’s flowing again.”These are not the only problems with IT benchmarking – comparing an organisation’s IT costs with those of its peers.Whether a company buys through resellers or direct from vendors, benchmarking remains an imprecise discipline.Steve Watmough, partner in the chief information officer advisory practice at KPMG, the professional services firm, says benchmarks are only a “starting point” on the road to optimising IT spending.He says any data available “has to be understood by users as something that may be misleading as, depending on an individual’s approach to issues such as depreciation, it could be made to look too high or too low”.Such complexity deters many IT departments, but at a time of continued economic austerity, those that have not started on a formal benchmarking process are increasingly finding it being imposed on them from above, often with dire consequences, according to Kurt Potter, an analyst at IT research firm Gartner.“When non-IT [company] leaders feel they have to stage an intervention and call in external benchmarking consultants, the internal IT team loses respect and this can lead to reorganisation and outsourcing,” he says. “Where IT teams do make a last-minute internal attempt to provide benchmarking, their results are almost always questioned or rejected by the business.”It is hardly surprising that there is a huge range of tools and services that promise to take the problem off IT’s hands, for a price.Most of the large management consultancy firms offer IT benchmarking services, as do smaller specialist consultancies. Some of the independent IT market research companies, such as Gartner and IDC, also offer them. At the heart of these products typically lies a huge database of companies, products and prices paid. An example is a new entrant, virtualisation specialist VMware, which launched its own IT benchmarking tool this year. Customers can measure their expenditure against their peers on metrics such as cost per server, average cost per staff member or total facilities cost.“We can do this, because we have 400,000 companies worldwide using core technology inside their enterprise data centres,” says Paul Strong, the company’s chief technology officer for global field and customer initiatives. “It’s an unrivalled opportunity for us to provide a great sample that will allow customers to see where they sit on the spectrum of IT efficiency, within their specific industries and geographies.”Mercato, too, provides IT buyers with access to a database that contains trade guide prices and stock levels on more than 150,000 products from over 2,500 manufacturers. The Mercato ITelligence tool is fed by automated feeds of prices from 37 suppliers that, in turn, provide IT resellers with stock.Mr Nagar says this means customers can get true transparency about the real cost of IT.In turn, IT buyers can import their list of required products into the online tool – or simply perform spot checks – to see what particular products might cost resellers, as well as analyse trends in price and stock levels. For example, photographic retailer Jessops has recently started using the service.Before Neil Stokes, the company’s group service delivery manager, signed up for Mercato ITelligence, he ran a demo on the tool, to compare the prices Jessops pays for Lexmark printer ink with prices found on the tool. He discovered he could be saving £30,000 per year on that product alone.Mr Stokes says: “Whenever I’m approached by a supplier now, I go straight to the tool. I can now openly ask the supplier if they can deliver on a best practice cost, plus 3 per cent margin. When they hear that, there is usually a sharp intake of breath, but it’s a quick conversation that delivers value.”
119;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-11-29T23:54:26Z;Customers and productivity drive IT demands;;"Global enterprises will need to address five business technology trends in order to meet changing customer demands and increase productivity next year, argues Verizon Communications’ enterprise solutions business unit.In its annual technology forecast, the Verizon unit, which provides a range of advanced communications and cloud-based services to its corporate clients, identifies the cloud, connected machines, mobility, intelligent networks and security as key opportunities.Distributed data centers and the intelligent wired and mobile networks that connect them now represent a viable alternative to traditional virtual private network (VPN) methods that long have formed the backbone of distributed enterprise communications for a generation, Verizon says.Next year, there will be a significant shift from VPNs to public, private and, importantly, hybrid clouds. “By 2013, more than 60 per cent of all enterprises will have adopted some form of cloud computing,” a Gartner report said.“To keep up with the changing demands of today’s enterprise, the ideal platform needs to be secure and easy to use and configure,” said David Small, a senior executive for Verizon’s enterprise business unit. “In 2013, if you can’t switch workloads between public and private clouds, you won’t be competitive. This next year will require a bold approach to embracing change and re-engineering networks in support of cloud-based applications.”An equally dramatic change is taking place in terms of mobility, Verizon says. Two-thirds of employees now use two or more mobile devices for work, according to Forrester, the US market research firm, and that, says Verizon, has far-reaching implications.“Employees – and the customers they serve – have less and less separation between their work and private lives,” says Mr Small. They have no appetite for choices restricted by lagging information technology departments, and they have no patience for systems that require them to maintain multiple identities across multiple networks, he said.“Enterprises in 2013 must accommodate and prioritise this new demand for efficiency and productivity, and information technology departments will play a key role in meeting the growing appetite for professional mobility on a personal level.”As a result, companies will increasingly adopt cloud-based enterprise mobility strategies – creating “personal clouds” where employees can use enterprise applications to do their jobs more effectively and deliver seamless services with access anytime, anywhere, on any device.Meanwhile, Verizon believes that connected machines will drive new insights for companies. The “internet of things” has arrived and it will continue to grow to meet specific industry requirements.According to a Gartner report, the number of permanently connected devices on the web will double to more than 30bn by 2020 while the number of devices with intermittent connections will grow from 50bn to more than 200bn.“Machine-to-machine (M2M) connections now cover much more than smart energy delivery and smart cars,” said the Verizon report. “For example, elaborate networks of sensors with direct machine-to-machine connections now underpin connected healthcare and the first consumer-ready wave of automotive telematics.”The ability to collect, store and analyse overwhelming volumes of data will define which enterprises extract the best insights and make the most agile decisions, to their competitive advantage, Verizon said.Underscoring this, Verizon predicts communications networks will evolve into “an intelligent fabric that connects everything and everyone will render underlying networks invisible to end users”. This will happen as overall IP traffic grows at a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent through 2016, according to figures from Cisco, the network equipment market leader.“Improvements in network reliability and resiliency, coupled with intelligent end points, serve as the foundation for connecting smart machines and smarter people,” Mr Small says. “We will see a shift in 2013 to more dynamic networks, pervasive IP connections, and purpose-built networks that serve businesses, consumers and society.Finally, Verizon predicts that security will move out of the specialist realm and become a mainstream IT “must-have”.“Security breaches span access, infrastructure and apps. They happen on fixed and mobile networks. They impact physical, intellectual and financial capital. And the scope is global,” said the Verizon 2012 Data Breach Investigations Report.“We expect identity security to be a much more prevalent issue in 2013,” Mr Small said. “Two-factor authentication is already gaining adherents, but it won’t be enough to counteract the increasing amount and intensity of criminal activity pursuing both intellectual property and financial gain.”“The race is on to protect every endpoint, every device and everything connected to the Internet. While the Internet affords us countless opportunity it also comes with a price. No longer is strong security an option; it’s a mandatory requirement for all organisations to protect their intellectual and physical capital, customer identities and society at large,” he said."
120;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-11-28T08:08:56Z;Chinese smartphones upset the Apple cart;;Han Jiaojiao’s breath forms a white cloud over her head as she inspects the smartphones under the glass counter. But the young insurance agent is not troubled by the lack of heating in the handset shop in Gaoliying, a rural town just outside Beijing, on this freezing night.She decides to ignore the international brands in favour of a sleek white smartphone from Gionee, a Chinese group.Millions of Chinese consumers are doing the same. They are opting for local brands over international counterparts, robbing Samsung, Apple and other global names of their dominance just as Chinese smartphone sales are soaring and the country is set to surpass the US as the world’s largest smartphone market.According to Strategy Analytics, 23.9m smartphones were shipped in China in the third quarter last year, putting the country ahead of the US – with 23.3m units – for the first time. In the third quarter of this year 38.5m smartphones were shipped in China, versus 26.7m in the US.“Chinese brands have taken more than half the Chinese smartphone market this year, and they will take much more,” says Sandy Shen, head of consumer research at Gartner, the research group, in Shanghai.Although smartphones now account for about half of handset shipments for the Chinese market, less than 30 per cent of all models in use are smartphones. “The people who can afford high-end smartphones, the segment foreign brands are focused on, have all bought one and now the market is mainly driven by demand for medium to low-end smartphones,” says Ms Shen.That demand comes from people like Ms Han – people from smaller towns or the countryside who look for smartphones costing Rmb1,500 ($240) or less.This changing consumer behaviour shows.Lenovo, the world’s second-largest PC vendor, saw its share of China’s smartphone market by unit sales jump from just 1.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2011, to 14.8 per cent in the September quarter this year – surpassing Apple and breathing down Samsung’s neck.Gartner estimates that Lenovo will take the number one spot next year. Gionee expanded its smartphone market share from just 1.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2012 to 4.7 per cent in the third quarter, surpassing HTC, the Taiwanese group that has struggled globally to compete with Samsung and Apple but did well in China.Samsung Electronics has already been under pressure in China as its semiconductor business was hit last year by weak PC demand. While revenue from the company’s external customers – those outside Samsung Electronics – in every other region increased from the previous year, in China it fell 5 per cent to Won23.1tn ($21.3bn).Samsung’s share of the Chinese smartphone market declined to 16.7 per cent in the third quarter of this year, from 24.3 per cent in the last three months of last year, according to Gartner.Mark Newman, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein who used to work for Samsung, says a smaller market share at the low end in China need not be a devastating blow for Samsung given its strength in the higher-end. But Lee Jae-hyuk, an analyst at Daiwa Securities in Seoul, says Samsung’s market share in China has further to fall.“Samsung cannot compete effectively in the country’s low-end market because its lowest-priced smartphones are still above $100,” he says. Chinese companies are now offering smartphones for as little as Rmb400.Analysts say this could become a problem for Samsung’s profitability if consumers in other emerging markets start to favour lower-priced smartphones. Apple faces a bigger dilemma in China given its total lack of low-end models. The US company’s Chinese smartphone market share fell from 12.3 per cent in the second quarter of this year to 7 per cent in the third quarter, according to Gartner.So far, ZTE, Huawei, Coolpad and Lenovo are the local brands with the largest unit shipments. While Huawei, ZTE and Coolpad rely mostly on subsidised operator sales, Lenovo is in the best position to expand, analysts say. “Its product portfolio is well balanced throughout the high-, medium and low-end segments, its brand is very strong and it has far-reaching nationwide distribution channels, partly helped by its PC business,” says Ms Shen.But a whole breed of other, smaller brands such as Gionee is growing fast, helped by MediaTek, a Taiwanese low-cost chipmaker. “Local guys, they are moving up their price segment very quickly by using MediaTek’s solutions,” says one Taipei-based analyst. “The easy time is over, and the next six months are more challenging.”Additional reporting by Song Jung-a in Seoul
121;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-11-20T22:42:51Z;Q&A: digitising businesses;;"Information technology, in all its forms, is transforming business through a process that has become known as ‘digitisation.’I asked Mark McDonald, a Gartner research fellow and co-author of a recently published book called ‘The Digital Edge, Exploiting Information and Technology for Business Advantage,” to explain how this works. Below is an edited version of our conversation.How exactly can digital technology change a business?Digital technology allows business leaders to create new sources of customer value and new ways to turn that value into revenue.How do business leaders do that?They create new digital capabilities based on combining digital and physical resources in ways that amplify the performance of each. In other words, they make both more powerful without distorting each other.Why a combination? Why not simply replace the physical resources with digital ones? After all, isn’t that what digital giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon are doing?There are a few reasons why digital substitution is a limited strategy.First, many companies have pursued a substitution strategy since the dawn of e-commerce. They have created digital copies of analogue concepts such as replacing stores with e-stores, books with e-books, or sales channels with e-channels and so forth. This makes them feel digital since digital technologies dominate 58 per cent of business processes. However, substitution is not a strategy; it’s simply doing what is possible without considering whether it will be profitable.Second, feeling digital is not the same as being digital. When you look at digitisation from a revenue perspective, a different picture emerges. On average, only 27 per cent of company revenues are attributed to digital resources. This means that there is a tremendous opportunity if companies can create an edge that better connects digital resources with revenue. Those who have done this have realised a performance edge as they grow faster, make more money and generate more return for shareholders.Third, only a few companies can make money via digital substitution. They make money based on the scale of their operations (Amazon), generating advertising revenue (Google/Facebook) or offering a “freemium” service (LinkedIn). They are among the few companies that have the millions of users or products, or the ability to support eight free customers for every one who’s paying for their service.Rather than holding these companies out as examples to imitate, we believe they should be the exception rather than the rule.Think of it this way: business leaders can pursue a strategy of substitution, mimicking current operations with digital copies that will create near-term efficiency that can be easily copied and replaced. Or they can pursue a strategy based on creating a digital edge - formed by combining the two sides of business (analog and digital) to give an organisation a new way to compete with something that is unique and a basis for future innovation.What are the key decisions business leaders need to make to develop a digital strategy?First, how will digital technology create value for customers in ways that lead to increased revenues for the company? The answer to that question requires reimagining notions of customer value and revenue models, because both of these change in the face of digital technology.Companies including Royal Caribbean Cruises, United Stationers, and Rabobank have used pervasive digital connections to create new revenue streams and/or business models that are hard for their competitors to copy.Second, what are the combinations of physical and digital resources needed to realise that value and generate that revenue? This requires understanding the various models for digitisation that reflect different combinations and relationships between physical and digital resources.So how can a company gain a digital edge?The answer to that involves understanding how you bring physical and digital resources together by working from the outside-in with a defined business outcome, realising how that changes management and project teams, and leveraging the digital platform to continuously innovate and generate new revenues.Mark McDonald is a Gartner research fellow and co-author of The Digital Edge, Exploiting Information and Technology for Business Advantage, available on amazon.com and on the iBooks store."
122;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-10-23T20:33:13Z;Apple iPad mini pricing worries investors;;The idea that Apple would launch a new iPad mini this autumn has been a near-certainty since July. Until this week, the big unknown has been how much it would cost.Investors winced at the $329 price tag (£269 in the UK) when it was announced at Apple’s marketing event in San Jose on Tuesday. The Apple share price took a sharp swing lower when the iPad mini’s price was announced towards the end of the presentation.Most analysts had predicted an entry price of around $249, closer to Apple’s nearest competitors.Faced with cheaper alternatives in Amazon’s $159 Kindle Fire and Google’s $199 Nexus 7, in an era of so-called austerity, investors are unsure whether consumers will be ready to dig deeper in their wallets for Apple.Apple is betting that production quality will give it an edge. While most rival tablets are made of plastic, the iPad range offers glass and aluminium.During the event in the ornate California Theatre, Sir Jonathan Ive, Apple’s chief designer, highlighted the iPad mini’s “diamond-cut chamfer” edge between the screen and casing, and the “unibody” manufacturing.“There is inherent loss in just reducing a product in size,” he said. “What we did was we went back to the very beginning and we took the time to design a product that was a concentration of, not a reduction of, the original.”Given Apple’s larger array of apps and media content – a total of 35bn downloaded from the app store, although Google Play for Android is catching up at 25bn – many customers may be prepared to pay more.“iPad mini commands a premium through brand and ecosystem. Consumers will pay to have a richer experience,” Carolina Milanesi, mobile analyst at Gartner, a technology research and advisory group, said on Twitter.“The [original] iPad created the market at a price point that forced everyone to go to seven-inch and cheap. iPad mini comes in to be the premium offering of that.”Gartner colleague Michael Gartenberg added: “Apple never races to the bottom.”The iPad and iPhone have sealed Apple’s standing as the world’s most valuable tech company, but the group’s leadership will be challenged to live up to the vision of Steve JobsThe higher pricing will certainly help to preserve Apple’s sky-high margins. But how many of them will buy both the 10-inch and eight-inch iPads?Apple risks eating into its own sales with the iPad mini. Mr Cook’s calculation may be that it is better for Apple to cannibalise itself than to risk letting Amazon or others do it.But Apple investors have another concern ahead of this Thursday’s earnings release. Mr Cook’s announcement that Apple had sold 100m iPads implies 16m units shifted in the quarter ending in September, according to BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk, against Wall Street consensus estimates at 17.5m.In the week of Microsoft’s Surface launch, the iPad now faces improving and cheaper competitors in ever-greater numbers. Even loyal Apple customers appear to have been holding off their iPad purchases in anticipation of the mini version. Analysts were already worried that iPhone 5 sales were constrained by the manufacturer Foxconn’s ability to produce the new smartphones fast enough.With few Apple products left without an update, Mr Cook was right when he said on Tuesday that 2012 had been a “truly prolific year of innovation”. Nonetheless, with its shares down 12.6 per cent from September’s highs, investors appear to expect Apple to deliver its third successive earnings disappointment of the last 12 months.
123;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-10-22T23:14:06Z;Companies turn to social computing;;Within the next three years, the dominant consumer social networks including Facebook and Twitter “will hit the limits of their growth”, predicts Gartner, the IT research firm.But Gartner also expects the use of social networking technologies by companies to surge. “Social computing is moving from being just on the outside of the organisation to being at the core of business operations,” said Peter Sondergaard, Gartner’s head of research.“It is changing the fundamentals of management, how you establish a sense of purpose and motivate people to act,” he told an audience of technology leaders attending Gartner’s annual IT Symposium in Orlando, Florida.Social computing will move organisations from hierarchical structures and defined teams to communities that can cross any organisational boundary and enable much greater co-operation between employees.Companies are now beginning to establish social media as a discipline, and within three years Gartner predicts that as many as 10 organisations will each spend over $1bn a year on social media.But along with this boom, Mr Sondergaard warns that “deceptive practices will emerge”. Among these, Gartner is forecasting that paid reviews and ratings will make up 15 per cent of all social media reviews by 2015, and that up to 30 per cent of posts to social media will be automated posts, some generated entirely by machines.Even within organisations, the switch to “social computing” will have dramatic repercussions. “Social capabilities will become embedded in established business applications, or exposed for developers to pursue,” says Gartner.As a result, internal software applications will exploit external social environments. “You could ask, ‘Will LinkedIn be more accurate than most of your current HR data?’” he added.Meanwhile, companies and other organisations will also need to redesign their businesses around mobile devices, processes and applications.In 2016, more than 1.6bn smart mobile devices will be purchased globally, two-thirds of the workforce will own a smartphone and 40 per cent of the workforce will be mobile.“You need to design your business around mobile,” Mr Sondergaard told his audience, which included chief information officers and their teams from many large organisations. “Your customers and employees are leading you there.”Mobile will enable marketing departments to spend more time with customers employees to become more productive, and process flows will be dramatically cut.“You must plan with mobile-changing application delivery,” he said. “In four years, more than 300bn app downloads will occur each year.”Gartner predicts that the major vendors of monolithic business suites will struggle to make mobile applications that are usable, affordable and secure, and that tablets will continue to shake up the business world.“In less than two years, iPads will be more common in business than BlackBerrys,” said Mr Sondergaard, who noted that some CIOs are now placing orders for tens of thousands of iPads at a time.“Productivity is the driver,” he said. “Twenty per cent of sales organisations will use tablets as the primary mobile platform for their field sales force two years from now.As a result, by 2018 70 per cent of mobile workers will use a tablet or a hybrid device that has tablet-like characteristics.”At the same time, Gartner believes that the bring your own device (BYOD) trend will continue to drive a change in asset ownership. Gartner analysts believe that in 2016 half of all non-PC devices used in business will be purchased by employees. And by the end of the decade half of all devices in business will be purchased by employees.Corporate IT departments will “need to be in the business of delivering applications and data securely to devices they don’t own,” said Mr Sondergaard.
124;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-10-22T16:09:23Z;‘Big data’ to drive IT spending;;"The huge volumes of data generated by today’s digital businesses, known as “big data”, will drive $28bn of worldwide IT spending this year and $34bn next year, according to a forecast from Gartner, the IT research firm.At the same time, Gartner predicted that by 2015, 4.4m IT jobs will be created to support big data, including 1.9m in the US, but warned that there will be a scramble for the limited number of IT professionals qualified to fill these jobs.Big data emerged as one of the key themes– and one of four “nexus of forces” – cloud, social collaboration, mobile and information – identified by Peter Sondergaard, Gartner’s research director during his keynote speech launching the company’s four-day annual Symposium in Orlando, Florida.Mr Sondergaard told the 8,000 company IT professionals including 2,000 chief information officers attending the symposium: “By tapping a continual stream of information from internal and external sources, businesses today have an endless array of new opportunities for transforming decision-making, discovering new insights, optimising the business and innovating their industries.”He added: “Longer term, we see big data as a complete shift – a shift from today’s ways of accumulating, managing and deploying information as merely a resource to valuing it as any corporate asset.”Mr Sondergaard noted that companies that develop big data strategies are already being rewarded by Wall Street. “Companies that are serious about collecting, managing and deploying information are now being rewarded by financial markets. Info-centric companies have double the average market-to-book value.”For example, innovators in areas such as medical devices are turning the data collected by their equipment into information that can be sold online, turning a product into a service.“So data, information, can become revenue,” he said, but noted that because many companies do not have the skills and time they need internally, they will increasingly turn to external providers. For example, Gartner estimates that 85 per cent of marketing organisations will outsource the analysis of big data.“Big data is about looking ahead beyond what everybody else sees,” said Mr Sondergaard. “You need to understand how to deal with hybrid data, meaning the combination of structured and unstructured data, and how you shine a light on ‘dark data’ which is the data being collected but going unused despite its value.”So far, most of the current spending on big data is for adapting traditional IT systems to the big data demands – machine data, social data and widely varied data that comes in bursts. Only about $4.3bn in software sales will be driven directly by demands for new big data functionality in 2012.“Despite the hype, big data is not a distinct, standalone market; it but represents an industry-wide market force,” said Mark Beyer, research vice president at Gartner. “In 2011, big data formed a new driver in almost every category of IT spending.”However, the Gartner analysts warn that the window of opportunity for companies to use big data and data analytics to create competitive advantage is a short one.“Through 2018, big data requirements will gradually evolve from differentiation to ‘table stakes’ in information management practices and technology,” said Mr Beyer. “By 2020, big data features and functionality will be non-differentiating and routinely expected from traditional enterprise vendors and part of their product offerings.”“Because big data’s effects are pervasive, big data will evolve to become a standardised requirement in leading information architectural practices, forcing older practices and technology into early obsolescence,” he said.“As a result, big data will once again become ‘just data’ by 2020 and architectural approaches, infrastructure and hardware/software that does not adapt to this ‘new normal’ will be retired. Organisations resisting this change will suffer severe economic impacts.”"
125;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-10-12T15:59:51Z;Lenovo reflects rise of Asian PC makers;;Hewlett-Packard this week gave up its crown as the world’s number one PC maker to Lenovo of China, according to third-quarter shipments reported by the Gartner research firm.While global PC shipments fell more than 8 per cent to 87.5m units, compared to the year-earlier quarter, HP’s shrank more than 16 per cent, while Lenovo’s grew 10 per cent.HP stayed just ahead of Lenovo in a third-quarter survey by the rival research firm IDC. HP asserted IDC’s report was more comprehensive as it included the workstation segment, where the Silicon Valley company is a big player.However, the swing in market share to Asian manufacturers is undeniable. While Dell occupies third place in the global rankings, its shipments fell 14 per cent and Acer and Asus of Taiwan are hot on its heels.Both HP and Dell see the PC business as being too commoditised and they are expanding their software and services offerings for business as they seek higher margins. They have found they cannot compete with the lower cost base of their Asian counterparts and are being beaten on price in PCs.There is a larger problem for the industry, with shipments falling in advance of the release of Windows 8 later this month. Inventory has been cleared out ahead of the new operating system, but there is uncertainty about demand in the current economic climate and with consumers showing their preference for smartphones and tablets.The PC industry could contract for the first time in 11 years, with the IHS iSuppli research firm predicting this week that shipments will fall to 349m in 2012, down from 353m last year.

128;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-10-10T23:01:54Z;Lenovo knocks HP off computer top spot;;Lenovo has toppled Hewlett-Packard to become the number one PC maker for the first time in its history, according to third-quarter figures from the Gartner research firm.The Chinese company had a 15.7 per cent share of worldwide shipments of units, compared with 15.5 per cent for HP, Gartner said on Wednesday. However, third-quarter numbers from IDC, a rival research firm, showed HP still had a slight lead, with 15.9 per cent against Lenovo’s 15.7 per cent.The bigger picture for the PC industry is one of decline. IDC reported an 8.6 per cent decline in shipments compared with a year earlier. Gartner’s total of 87m units shipped was down 8.3 per cent.Gartner said Lenovo had made significant market share gains over the past two years because “in addition to acquiring other vendors, Lenovo has also taken an aggressive position on pricing, especially in the professional market”.Meg Whitman, HP chief executive, has admitted that the Silicon Valley company cannot compete with its Asian rivals on price and she is reducing the company’s cost base as part of a five-year restructuring plan.Dell, which vied with HP for the top spot for many years, was third in worldwide PC rankings, according to IDC and Gartner, with 10.8 and 10.5 per cent shares respectively. It has said it has chosen not to compete on price at the lower end of the PC market. Margins are thin for PC makers and both HP and Dell have been focusing on more profitable hardware, software and services for businesses.Acer Group and Asus of Taiwan fill out the top five with shares of 9.9 per cent and 7.3 per cent, Gartner said.Analysts had expected a decline in industry sales as PC makers cleared out inventory ahead of the launch of Microsoft’s touch-optimised Windows 8 operating system on October 26. But consumers also failed to respond to the usual back-to-school promotions as they waited for Windows 8, regarding the latest thin and light ultrabooks as still too pricey and preferring to buy tablets and smartphones instead.“PCs are going through a severe slump,” said Jay Chou, IDC senior research analyst. “A weak global economy as well as questions about PC market saturation and delayed replacement cycles are certainly a factor, but the hard question of what is the ‘it’ product for PCs remains unanswered.”Also on Wednesday, the IHS iSuppli research firm predicted global PC shipments for the year would decline for the first time since 2001. It sees a contraction of about 1 per cent to 349m units from 353m last year.“Optimism has vanished and turned to doubt,” said IHS, referring to scepticism that Windows 8 can provide an immediate lift. “The industry is now training its sights on 2013 to deliver the hoped-for rebound.”
129;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-09-25T21:18:20Z;Networking sites: Pay attention to who is using social media;Weight of numbers – and the influence such services have – make it impossible to ignore them, says Stephen Pritchard;Facebook claimed 995m active users, as of June 2012. Twitter has about 500m users, and YouTube, owned by Google, says it has 800m visitors each month, watching 4bn hours of video. Renren, a Chinese social media site, claims 157m active accounts.For marketing purposes alone, social media sites – designed for consumers to stay in touch with friends, publish photographs or share information about hobbies and interests – are an attractive platform.And they are also economical: a standard Facebook page is free, even to the largest businesses.Companies are also finding that social media services can provide more than just an alternative to a static webpage. Social media, through services such as Twitter’s firehose – its full data feed – provide a rich source of information to companies about how their brands or products are perceived.Handled correctly, social media can serve a valuable customer services function, and also a way to create and follow groups of customers, suppliers or “influencers” who might be useful to the business.LinkedIn, which styles itself as a business social network, is also a useful recruiting tool.But it is the way in which social media services allow businesses to interact with their customers, and especially harder to reach groups such as young adults, that appeals to marketers.Mark McDonald, head of executive programmes research at Gartner, the research company, says: “The economy we are now in places a higher value on participation, and consumers want to connect with each other and demonstrate their knowledge. That changes their association with the product, or the brand.”Used in the right way, Mr McDonald says, social media can persuade customers to become unpaid advocates for a brand.And research shows that consumers trust and value recommendations on social media more than they do conventional advertising.At the same time, simply spending money on social media does not always deliver the right results.Ford, for example, has run successful social media campaigns around car launches such as the latest model Fiesta. Its rival General Motors, though, very publicly pulled advertising worth $10m from Facebook, saying they had not seen a sufficient return on their investment.Other smaller-scale projects sometimes work better. British Airways, for example, began its recent “Aviators” brand advertising campaign, not in the cinemas, but on Facebook. Sony’s broadcast division has also run a series of online chats for film-makers about its latest video cameras on the same site.One advantage of social media over conventional advertising is flexibility. However, Nathan Sage, a social intelligence expert at PA Consulting Group suggests that very flexibility can also be social media’s weakness.“You can spend quite a lot of time having a conversation about whether social media is internally or externally focused, whether it is PR or marketing or customer service.He adds: “There is a disconnect between brands and their understanding of what social is.”There have been faux pas, such as interns tweeting office gossip to thousands of followers, or companies seriously misjudging the mood of their customers.McLaren Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton is just one celebrity to have fallen foul of Twitter’s ease of use, for sharing a telemetry sheet showing data of car set-up information that could have been useful to rival teams.Businesses also have to pay more attention to who uses their social media tools, especially in regulated industries such as financial services or legal services.“We’ve used social media a lot,” says Paul Caris, chief information officer at Eversheds, the law firm. “We’ve used Twitter for some of our vertical specialisms, such as in our food practice, and our partners in those areas have created small but very active communities.“Obviously, Twitter is not a brilliant area for collaboration, as it is basically a broadcast medium. But we’ve introduced policies to ensure that the way we communicate over social media platforms is consistent and that we all understand that what you put on there is public facing.“And we do also take activity that starts on Twitter offline, either to LinkedIn, or to a private collaboration area, owned by Eversheds.”David Hodgkinson, an adviser on customer and channel management at KPMG, the professional services firm, agrees that even tightly controlled industries such as retail banking can use Twitter, if they do so with care.“It is a way of capturing customer dissatisfaction that might not be picked up through person-to-person contact,” Mr Hodgkinson says.PA Consulting’s Mr Sage says dealing with complaints has to be done correctly: social media users wield enormous collective power.“Organisations have to have the ability to deal with that. If they don’t react, it can damage the brand.”But there is a further, important element to how organisations use social media. Jason Breed, social media practice lead at Accenture, the management consultants, argues that although business-specific tools such as Yammer – which provides internal social networks – businesses will do themselves few favours if they cut staff off from consumer tools such as Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn.“Used correctly, social media will help companies to recruit and retain the best employees,” says Mr Breed. “For some time, that’s given the best companies an edge over those that ask candidates to fax a résumé. No cool kid at college wants to do that.”
130;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-09-24T18:20:56Z;Cloud uncertainty is the enemy of investment;;"Neelie Kroes is selling certainty. The EU’s cloud computing strategy, due to be published this week, will attempt to provide European businesses with much-needed clarity over the rules that govern the use of data in the cloud.If businesses store their information with a European cloud provider, who owns that information, and who has the right to access it? What rules apply to the use of that information and how it is shared? Due to fragmented data laws, regulatory confusion and an arguably false perception of risk, the economic benefits of the cloud aren’t being fully realised.For Ms Kroes, the biggest barrier to a new, cloud-fuelled era of innovation is uncertainty.Reducing uncertainty is all the more critical as Europe struggles to identify growth. As research firm Gartner recently concluded, European businesses are two years behind their US counterparts in terms of cloud adoption.The inevitable sluggishness of pan-European policy-making, combined with complex and ever-changing data protection laws (which vary from country to country) is stifling investment in European cloud infrastructure. More often than not, when businesses make a decision to move to the cloud, uncertainty over compliance causes chief information officers to plump for the relative safety of a US provider.The cloud is not a new technology phenomenon, but it does signify a fundamental shift in behaviour. In a knowledge economy, this behaviour change represents nothing less than an industrial revolution.By changing the way in which they consume IT, companies can dramatically accelerate the creation of new products and services, and collaborate much more effectively. They can be more reactive to changing customer needs through the use of more powerful and accurate data analytics. And because companies only pay for the computing power they really need, the playing field between smaller and larger companies is effectively levelled, allowing start-ups to scale in a way previously unimaginable.But there’s another reason why Neelie Kroes is so keen to see her cloud strategy succeed. The very essence of the cloud is its elimination of boundaries. It allows businesses to access useful services without having to move to the same physical location, or even to invest in the same IT infrastructure, as the provider.Much like the EU’s own Common Market, the cloud is about removing barriers to doing business. And like the Common Market, it’s about leveraging economies of scale to create not only greater efficiencies but to increase competition. So for a Dutch logistics firm, the cloud might enable the provision of IT-powered services to customers throughout multiple regions, not only those in its own neighbourhood.For Ms Kroes and her colleagues, the cloud is the embodiment of the European Economic Community, eliminating obstacles, stimulating competition and opening up the market to new possibilities.It’s partly this realisation that’s encouraging the EU to reassess its strategy. But there’s an additional driver: the cloud can also help to leverage one of Europe’s greatest assets, its diversity.If our Dutch logistics company wishes to diversify and grow, in an ideal world it would want to take full advantage of the region’s best skills. So it might turn to a UK firm for procurement, or marketing expertise; to German or French companies for R&D and Scandinavian companies for design. Access to services supplied by the best and most specialist suppliers would be beneficial to any growing company.The cloud unlocks this diversity of European talent, making it possible to outsource the most applicable skills to the best possible providers. It’s a vision of perfect synergy, which the EU hopes will allow European firms to not only catch their competitors, but overtake them.The business model of the cloud is simple: the potential benefits increase as the cloud infrastructure gets bigger. In effect, the more companies that sign up to a single cloud provider, the greater the economies of scale and the value to all. In this way, a public cloud, shared by many different companies, across many different countries, can be a powerful vehicle for growth and innovation.But we can’t realise these benefits until companies become comfortable with the concept of housing their data and applications alongside those of their competitors, or locate it in countries in which the rules and regulation differ to their own. We can’t expect the cloud to support greater collaboration, or spark innovation, if businesses don’t fully understand the laws that govern their data.Once these uncertainties are removed, the development of pan-regional clouds becomes self-propelling. Large public clouds, with multiple stakeholders, not only allow huge economies of scale, but are also much better equipped to provide robust, high quality solutions, which are even more compliant with rules and regulations, because the bigger the scale, the more experienced the provider, and the better people they can afford to hire.Businesses crave transparency. At a fundamental level, they need to be able to judge a service not only on its merits but also on its potential downfalls. That’s why the EU must press for greater openness among cloud providers and ensure customers don’t require a lawyer to decode service level agreements. There should be template contracts and clear expectations relating to uptime, support response times and reliability to make cloud computing a much more attractive proposition.But the biggest enemy of investment is uncertainty. Without greater clarity and a clear intention to rationalise fragmented European IT laws, we can’t liberate ourselves from the legislative ambiguity that threatens to stifle the growth Europe so desperately needs. Neelie Kroes would do well to create directives and guidelines that are easy to understand and even easier to implement. After all, in the era of the cloud everything moves just a little bit faster.Ron Tolido is Senior Vice President and CTO Applications Continental Europe, Capgemini"
131;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-09-07T20:07:22Z;Q&A: where to now? The future of the internet;;"On August 6, 1991 Sir Tim Berners-Lee posted short summary of the World Wide Web project on the alt.hypertext newsgroup. This date also marked the debut of the web as a publicly available service on the internet.Now almost one in three people on the planet use the web, around 2.3bn individuals, and the centrality of the web as infrastructure for the digital world including digital business, is no longer in doubt.Now that the web has celebrated its 21st birthday, what does the future look like? I asked Steve Prentice, vice president & research fellow, at Gartner.Q: The web continues to grow, so what’s the problem?Actually the growth is part of the problem. With more users, accessing ever more information, increasing use of the underlying internet infrastructure to support cloud services, over-the-top streamed entertainment, video calls, search and a myriad other services, the demand for bandwidth is rising explosively.Estimates from Cisco indicate global IP traffic will quadruple between 2011 and 2016 and more than 19bn connections. The investment required to support that bandwidth and rolling out access to support 24x7 mobile access (mobile is now the dominant form of access to the internet worldwide) is substantial and it is challenging the financial resources of the global communications service providers.We take internet access for granted and expect it to be very affordable. In fact, the UN is under pressure to declare internet access a “human right”. But someone has to pay.Combined with that infrastructure pressure, there is also the issue of content. With increasing criminal and cyber terrorism activities, and a wealth of content which many individuals find objectionable, there are increasing pressures on governments to clamp down and legislate. Intellectual property theft, pornography, racism to name but a few, all combine to cause problems for legitimate uses.Taken together, it is difficult to believe that the internet in 5 years, let alone 10 or 15, will simply be a bigger, faster, more universal and ubiquitous version of what we have today – there are too many conflicting issues driving change.Q: What are the main forces driving the evolution of the web?There are three forces – the demand for control (usually by governments for ideological, financial (read taxation) or political reasons, or to legislate against anti-social, criminal or terrorist activity; the desire for freedom, usually by individuals who believe that the internet should be freely accessible and self regulating to create a global community to encourage innovation, collaboration and the improvement of human-kind; and the drive for profit, usually by corporations who use the internet as a resource to support commercial activities.These three forces are driving development in different directions, creating a number of possible future scenarios where one or more forces dominate. To make matters more complex, the forces are not consistent throughout the world. Despite it’s global nature, the net is actually a network of interconnected national networks where local legislation and cultures influence usage. Hence, globally, multiple scenarios will be in effect at any point in time, making the problems for global business even more challengingQ: So who controls the web today?As the significance of the web as a global infrastructure supporting a myriad of business and personal uses, the answer to this question is becoming more important every day. There are various levels of control; independent bodies like ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) manage things like addressing and domain names, but the previous dominance of the US Government in this area is being challenged by China and others at this time.Then there are local political influences which may further limit usage, like monitoring and filtering content for example. While everyone has heard of the “Great Firewall of China”, most people are shocked when they discover the extent of legislation in other countries (including the UK, US, France and elsewhere) that allows the authorities to intervene. And then there is local legislation which controls what services are permissible (IP telephony for example) or what content is deemed acceptable. So the simple answer is there is no single controlling body, and whilst many individuals believe that self-regulation is the answer, this cannot equate to no-regulation. Someone has to decide what is acceptable and what is not.Q: What are the implications for the web as global digital infrastructure?That really depends on how the forces balance out. Strong control will make it more difficult to use the web as a consistent global infrastructure. If governments weaken regulation, then commercial interests will probably overwhelm individual desires for freedom and that might result in a return to the “walled gardens” of the 1990’s where powerful alignment of service providers and content owners create barriers to exit in an attempt to retain and better exploit their customer base.If the power of the community triumphs then the explosion of usage, combined with a challenging investment environment (people expect the web to be free!), will likely impact bandwidth availability and quality of service. This would pose problems for businesses seeking a reliable global infrastructure.As the web has become more and more critical, whatever the future development path (and it will likely be different in different regions depending on local conditions and political/cultural influence), there will be challenges for both business and individual users. Given the increasingly central role of the web in modern life, it is hard to imagine a business that would not be impacted in some way whatever scenario unfolds, and for multi-national businesses operating globally the overall situation will be complex, uncertain and potentially volatile.Q: What should business leaders and chief information officers do about this?Individual business leaders and CIOs are not in a position to control the way things develop (although large corporations and powerful communities of interest will have the power to influence government actions in some regions, whether through lobbying or protest), but most organisations will have to accommodate change. Most important is that business leaders and CIOs take the fundamental step to actually start considering the issues.Most users, businesses and individuals, see the web as just infrastructure; it is effectively invisible until it goes wrong and is increasingly taken for granted. Most users also believe the future development of the web will be linear, benign and beneficial towards them. With situations as complex and uncertain as we have outlined, we recommend scenario planning as a means to expose the issues, explore the possibilities and how they will impact your own activities.Once you start asking the questions then you can start building strategies to adapt as circumstances change. The early signs are all around if you look closely - legislation, charging structures, usage trends, frequent outages, etc. They all point to underlying trends which, when taken together, indicate how the balance between the three forces - demand for control, desire for freedom and drive for profit - is changing in any specific location.The organisations that monitor the trends, consider the options and starting building this into their longer term planning will be the ones who will be best able to manage change as and when it happens. Those that ignore the trends, or simply take the future of the internet for granted, will find themselves seriously challenged.Q: When is all this going to happen?It is already happening, and has been for several years as the usage of the web grew rapidly since the millennium. But we are generally talking about changes that will take time to implement.The web, even on just a national level, is a huge and complex system and, like a supertanker, takes time to change direction. Of course there are some instances where change happens very quickly and can be unpredictable, such as the event in the Middle East in 2011 where internet access was effectively suspended for periods of time, or outages caused by damage to one of the major submarine cables.Nevertheless, we believe that the extent of change over the next 3 years will be significant enough in some regions for businesses to have to react by amending their strategic plans and those changes will amplify and expand over the following decade such that the web in 2020 will be a noticeably different environment to that with which we are familiar today.Steve Prentice is a vice president & research fellow at Gartner."

Still, after a week in which various egotistical men rolled out shiny bits of metal (and plastic) to impress the masses, there is a whiff of battle in the air. Motorola/Google and Nokia/Microsoft released new phones. Amazon showed off a new ereader and a tablet computer. An iPhone 5 announcement is imminent.What will all the drums and trumpets lead to, financially? Remember the peculiar structure of the industry. Two competitors, Apple and Samsung, make most of the devices and virtually all of the profit. In the second quarter they accounted for half the smartphones sold, according to Gartner. No one else managed a 10 per cent share.Next are three mega-rich competitors – Google/Motorola, Microsoft/Nokia and Amazon – which have reasons not to sell devices at a profit, and do not. Of course, Nokia wants to sell devices profitably, but its partner, like Google/Motorola, is more interested in propagating its operating system; Amazon also uses devices to sell other things. At the bottom sit share-losing also-rans, such as Research In Motion and HTC.If a member of the second or third tiers manages to use an innovative new device to win significant share from Apple and Samsung, will the result be a redistribution of the same profit pool, or reinvigorated price competition that makes the profit pool smaller? Greater parity equates to a destructive free-for-all.

133;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-08-29T18:27:58Z;Emerging tech: what is hot in IT;;It may not be quite as prescriptive as ‘Moore’s Law’, but virtually every new technology or innovation in IT follows a common pattern of over-enthusiasm, disillusionment and eventual realism.The Gartner Hype Cycle has been used by business leaders for more than 20 years to help distinguish between the stages in this pattern, to cut through the hype surrounding emerging technologies in various markets, and understand the potential for those technologies to change the shape or direction of their industry.In this edited Q&A with Jackie Fenn, author of the recent Gartner Hype Cycle on Emerging Technologies, I asked what business leaders should be aware of and what it means for their organisations.Q. Based on Gartner’s research, what is the most hyped emerging technology?We don’t think it will come as much of a surprise to business leaders that cloud computing, media tablets and big data are still getting a lot of attention and moving rapidly along the hype cycle.Other fast-moving technologies identified in the Gartner 2012 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies include 3D printing, activity streams, Internet TV and Near Field Communication (NFC) payments. Bring your own device (BYOD) and social analytics are just a couple of the technologies identified this year at the ‘Peak of Inflated Espectations. ‘But even though the technologies are familiar, we believe we’re at an interesting inflection point, a time when many of the scenarios we’ve been talking about for a long time are almost becoming reality.The smarter smartphone is a case in point. It’s now possible to look at a smartphone and unlock it via facial recognition, and then talk to it to ask it to find the nearest bank ATM. At the same time, however, we see that the technology is not quite there yet. We might have to remove our sunglasses for the facial recognition to work, our smartphones don’t always understand us when we speak, and the location-sensing technology sometimes has trouble finding us indoors.Q. What should corporate chief informations officers and business leaders take away from this year’s emerging technology Hype Cycle?Although the Hype Cycle presents technologies individually, CIOs and business leaders should consider the technologies in sets or groupings, because so many new capabilities and trends involve multiple technologies working together. Often, one or two technologies that are not quite ready can limit the true potential of what is possible. We refer to these technologies as “tipping point technologies” because, once they mature, whole new opportunities can appear.Q. Can you give me some examples?The technology industry has long talked about scenarios in which any service or function is available on any device, at anytime and anywhere. This is being fueled by the consumerisation trend that is making it acceptable for employees to bring their own personal devices into work.The technologies and trends featured on this Hype Cycle that are part of this scenario include BYOD, hosted virtual desktops, HTML5, the various forms of cloud computing, silicon anode batteries and media tablets.Although all these technologies and trends need to mature for the scenario to become the norm, HTML 5, hosted virtual networks and silicon anode batteries are particularly strong tipping point candidates to make this a reality.Similarly, a world in which things are smart and connected to the Internet has been in the works for more than a decade. Once connected and made smart, things will help people in every facet of their consumer, citisen and employee lives.For the 2012 Hype Cycle, Gartner has included autonomous vehicles, mobile robots, Internet of Things, big data, wireless power, complex-event processing, Internet TV, activity streams, machine-to-machine communication services, sensor mesh networks, home health monitoring and consumer telematics.The technologies and trends that are the tipping points to success include machine-to-machine communication services, sensor mesh networks, big data, complex-event processing and activity streams.Another example is a scenario of a cashless world in which every transaction is an electronic one. This will provide organisations with efficiency and traceability, and consumers with convenience and security.The technologies on the 2012 Hype Cycle that will enable parts of this scenario include NFC payment, mobile over the air (OTA) payment and biometric authentication methods. Related technologies will also impact the payment landscape, albeit more indirectly.These include the Internet of Things, mobile application stores and automatic content recognition. The tipping point will be surpassed when NFC payment and mobile OTA payment technologies mature.A final example would be that we’re heading towards a scenario where 3D printing allows consumers to print physical objects, such as toys or housewares, at home, just as they print digital photos today. Combined with 3D scanning, it may be possible to scan certain objects with a smartphone and print a near-duplicate. We are excited about the transformational potential of 3D printing, although it will take more than five years to hit mainstream businesses and consumers.Q. Should CIOs and business leaders ignore those emerging technologies that are in the ‘trough of disillusionment’?Absolutely not. This can be an opportunity to quietly take advantage of a technology while it is out of fashion. For example, companies may be able to buy the technology cheaply, hire staff who have gained some early experience and explore opportunities without the intense market pressure of the peak.With this approach, business leaders are more likely to catch a technology as it starts its journey up the slope of enlightenment and add value to their organisation before the technology is adopted by the mainstream.Additional information is available here. Ms Fenn will discuss emerging technologies at Gartner Symposium/ITxpo in Orlando, Florida and Sao Paulo, Brazil, in October.
134;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-08-24T02:37:28Z;PC makers – at the margins;The death of the personal computer has been much exaggerated;Who’d be a PC maker? Not Dell or HP, clearly. Investors could be forgiven for thinking the market was dying based on their slumping sales. It is not, but it is changing. If the two US makers are not careful, their hoped-for graceful exit of this former cash cow could sour quickly.Both US companies this week blamed weakening economies. Dell sniffily dismissed its sliding market share as the result of not wanting to play in aggressively competitive “low value” markets. But overall PC sales – desktop and laptop – have in fact been flat year-on-year, according to Gartner, leaving the biggest Asians – Lenovo, Acer and Asustek – to gain share. When Dell talked about low value, it had a point in that the wafer-thin operating margins earned by Lenovo and Acer (2 and 0.4 per cent respectively) do not match US thinking about what is a good business. HP’s 4.7 per cent – down a percentage point in the past year – looks positively plump. Small wonder both are hoping for improved markets for their high-end products. The danger is, however, that even a better economic mood does not do as much as they hope.There are two reasons to think that a serious risk. Emerging markets, where entry-level products are more popular, are where the growth is. PC penetration in the emerging world is about a quarter, according to Bernstein, versus 90 per cent in developed countries. There is also far lower penetration in emerging market companies, at about half of PC-involved jobs against 90 per cent again in more mature markets. The other risk is that high-end customers are exactly those most likely to delay laptop replacements in favour of tablets.The industry’s great hope is Windows 8, Microsoft’s new PC and tablet-friendly system. New touchscreen laptops are on their way to a store near you. But margins are unlikely to improve much, leaving this a cut-throat volume game – a speciality of Asian tech groups. Dell and HP could have to give up more margin than they would like to milk this business all the way to the exit.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
135;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-08-17T15:35:15Z;Mobile payments – wallet wars;US retailers enter the ruthless winner-takes-all market;"Retail is a ruthless business. So if staunch competitors such as Walmart and Target are banding together, it is worth noting. Along with more than a dozen other merchants, they have teamed up on a mobile wallet service. This is the latest move in the global shift towards paying for purchases with mobile devices instead of plastic cards or cash. Mobile transactions will rise to $600bn by 2016 from $172bn now, Gartner estimates.The land grab has already attracted Google, which offers a service called “Wallet,” as well as mobile providers AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, which back a venture called Isis. Last week, Starbucks announced a partnership with Square, a mobile payments start-up, and this week Dunkin’ Donuts launched its own mobile pay app.Walmart and the like claim they are in the best position to get a wallet service going. They know better than anyone else what their customers already buy – and they want to keep that advantage. No merchant wants to lose control of information about its customers’ spending patterns. Google, for example, plans to use Wallet as a platform for special offers and coupons – that is, advertising. The retailers like that idea, but would rather not share the proceeds.Then there are costs. Might having their own application help merchants dodge some of the tolls embedded in payment processing?It is hard to predict which service will dominate; the battle lines are not yet fully drawn. But it has all the markings of a winner-take-all market. The simplest, safest, most widely accepted application will attract the lion’s share of users. Apple’s proposed acquisition of AuthenTec, which makes fingerprint sensors, potentially paves the way to using iPhones as mobile wallets. Even in its infancy, mobile payments are looking ruthlessly competitive.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
136;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-08-17T14:13:15Z;Acer sits tight for Windows 8 launch;;Acer said it did not expect to see a rebound in consumer sentiment until the launch of Windows 8 in October as the Taiwanese computer maker reported slightly lower than expected second-quarter sales.The company expects sales next quarter to be flat but then to pick up to 5 to 10 per cent quarterly growth by the end of the year once the US group’s operating system is released.“Originally we were expecting very high growth [in the] second half, but I think because of the global economic situation and the uncertainty of the Windows ecosystem, the big growth expectations may turn out to medium growth only,” said JT Wang, chairman and chief executive.Acer has been working to turn itself round in the past year after a period under former chief executive Gianfranco Lanci focused on market share growth at the expense of margins.With operating margins up to 0.4 per cent from the first quarter’s 0.1 per cent, that recovery, said Mr Wang, is still on track.“We would not call this the total return of Acer but at least . . . our operations after the efforts of one year are becoming more stable than before,” he said.The company’s market share has also improved. Acer is now the leading notebook PC seller globally, with 15.4 per cent of the market as of the second quarter, according to Gartner, the research company. Tied for second place are Lenovo and HP, each on 15.3 per cent.Barclays analyst Kirk Yang wrote in a note after the results that Acer’s turnround “continues and is happening, but slower than what we would have liked”.The company has struggled particularly to develop tablets and other mobile devices that can compete with market leaders Apple and Samsung.Apple alone controls 70 per cent of the tablet market, as its shipments of iPads rose 44 per cent between the first and second quarters, according to recent figures from IHS iSuppli, the research firm.Acer, which has criticised Microsoft for introducing its own Windows-based tablet, said it is preparing two Windows 8 tablets to be available at its launch.Executives also said Acer is working on a smartphone, which it already has one leading European carrier lined up to support.But Christine Wang, a technology analyst with Daiwa, said market expectations for the Acer phone were low. Other companies, including Taiwan’s HTC, have struggled to break Apple and Samsung’s hold on that market.“I don’t have any expectations on its smartphone . . . it takes a lot of effort on the software side and they don’t have these kind of R&D capabilities,” said Ms Wang.Acer’s revenue for the second quarter was T$110.6bn ($3.7bn), up 8.3 per cent year on year but down 2.2 per cent on a quarterly basis. Analysts had expected sales closer to T$115m, according to Bloomberg.Acer’s post-tax profit was T$56m, up from a loss of T$6.79bn the same quarter last year, when it had faced substantial charges related to its restructuring and the departure of Mr Lanci and other senior managers.
137;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-08-16T13:22:19Z;Lenovo close to passing HP in PCs;;Lenovo is close to surpassing Hewlett-Packard as the world’s leading manufacturer of personal computers following a strong quarterly rise in sales.The Chinese company now has a 14.9 per cent share of the global market, compared with 15.5 per cent for HP, according to figures from IDC, the research company.Lenovo beat estimates on Thursday with a 30 per cent rise in quarterly profits as it benefited from sustained appetite for PCs by Chinese consumers and businesses.However, even Chinese sales are showing some signs of cooling as the country’s economic boom slows. It was Lenovo’s slowest profit growth for a year and a half.But Yang Yuanqing, chairman and chief executive, said he was not concerned over the country’s long-term economic strength.“China’s macroeconomy has shown some uncertainty because of real-estate bubble controls and weak exports. But from a long-term point of view, I’m still very optimistic,” he said.Lenovo saw sales rise 35 per cent to $8bn in the quarter to the end of June, while net profit rose 30 per cent to $141m. Basic earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter were 1.37 cents.The rises come at a time when the PC market overall has stopped growing, with consumers more interested in spending money on smartphones and tablets.Figures from Gartner, the research company, last month showed a 0.1 per cent decline in overall global sales.Lenovo, which makes ThinkPad computers, is gaining market share thanks to aggressive pricing and overseas acquisitions as well as strong sales in China. The company bought Germany’s Medion Computers last year to bolster its European market position.However, profit margins have become very thin within the industry. Most computer manufacturers are trying to enter the market for tablet computers, but it has so far proved difficult to compete with Apple’s popular iPad products.The computer hardware manufacturers now also face a new threat from Microsoft, which is planning to launch its own tablet, called Surface, later this year.However, Mr Yang dismissed the threat from Microsoft. “Although we don’t like Microsoft providing hardware, for us it just adds one more competitor. [They’re] just one of our many competitors. They are strong in software but [we] don’t believe they can provide the best hardware in the world. Lenovo can,” he said.This is in contrast to comments earlier this month from JT Wang, Acer’s chief executive, who said that Microsoft’s move would have a negative impact on the worldwide computing ecosystem.Shares in Lenovo, which have more than trebled in value since the beginning of 2009, were up a further 6.2 per cent at HK$6.60 on Thursday.
138;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Large US retailers to create mobile wallet;;A group of the largest US retailers, including Walmart, Target and Best Buy, on Wednesday announced plans to create a joint mobile wallet service, adding yet another competitor to the already crowded market for mobile phone payment services.Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), the joint company formed by more than a dozen retailers, will compete with initiatives such as Google Wallet and Isis, which is backed by mobile operators AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. Last week Starbucks also announced a partnership with mobile payment start-up Square.Mobile phone operators, retailers, banks and technology companies are all competing to run mobile phone payment services, which each group keen to be the one to control the direct relationship to the customer. Retailers are also concerned they will be stung by hefty transaction fees if another group, such as banks or mobile operators, controls the payment network.“MCX will leverage mobile technology to give consumers a faster and more convenient shopping experience while eliminating unnecessary costs for all stakeholders,” said Mike Cook, corporate vice-president at Walmart.Gartner, the research company expects the number of mobile transactions to increase to $600bn by 2016, up from $172bn this year. Yet the multiple different wallet services risk leaving consumers confused.The Merchant Customer Exchange is a rare collaboration between the Walmart, Target and Best Buy. No launch date was given for the service and the company has yet to hire a chief executive, but development of the mobile application is under way. The application will be available to virtually any smartphone. There was no detail on what payment technology the system would use.Like many of its competitors, MCX will combine payment services with customised offers delivered to users through their smartphone.
139;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-08-15T09:41:38Z;Mobile phone sales dip amid wait for iPhone 5;;The love affair with the mobile phone appears to have faltered a little, with worldwide mobile phone sales down for the second quarter in a row, according to new figures from Gartner. But is this just a small hiatus as consumers wait for the next round of handsets from Apple and Samsung to hit the shelves later this year, or a sign of something deeper?Gartner is clearly a little worried, as it is paring back its earlier estimates for 2012 handset sales by between 25m and 40m units. Its not a huge drop, only about 2 per cent of the estimated 1.9bn unit sales this year, but Anshul Gupta, analyst at Gartner says he has been a little surprised by the fall. Smartphone sales are still growing strongly, with around 660m expected to be sold by the end of the year, a nearly 40 per cent rise year on year. But sales of feature phones are dropping faster than expected, even in emerging economies where the market was expected to hold steady for a while longer.“The decline of feature phone sales in the emerging markets was very surprising. People are holding onto their feature phones for longer, waiting until they can upgrade to a smartphone,” Mr Gupta said. No point in upgrading to a new feature phone when it is seen as a bygone technology, even by the world’s poor.At the same time, in mature markets, consumers are holding off buying anything until Apple brings out the iPhone 5 later this year. Apple’s sales have been a little more subdued this year as people save up for this latest model, whose launch date is rumoured to be mid-September.Ben Wood, analyst at CCS Insight, is expecting a huge scramble when the device does come out, and says it will be a risky time for mobile operators keen to hold onto their best customers. An unprecedented number of mobile phone users in the UK are no longer tied into a fixed-period contract with an operator, and will be able to go with whichever company offers the best iPhone deal.“We are hearing back from operators that they are extremely nervous about this. They will have to invest heavily in their iPhone offers to keep the customers they have got,” said Mr Wood.
140;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-08-14T13:43:47Z;Acer – some good news at last;;Some good news for Acer — the PC-maker narrowly edged out Lenovo and HP as the largest notebook PC seller globally last quarter, writes Sarah Mishkin in Taipei.Narrow here means narrow. Acer now has 15.4 per cent of the market. Tied for second place are Lenovo and HP, which each have 15.3 per cent, according to new research from Gartner. But Acer’s growth, and in particular its strong performance in Europe, is a welcome sign for a company that reported a 26 per cent year-on- year drop in sales for July.Most strikingly, Acer’s notebook sales grew 22 per cent year-on-year in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to Gartner.Europe is a region that Acer has been fighting to grow in. It faces stiff competition, in no small part because its ex-CEO now heads Lenovo’s European business. The company told the FT earlier this year that it would double its marketing budget for the region, and it has been trying to build its brand cachet by emphasizing its high-end and slim ultrabooks.Acer has apparently had some success with that approach to Europe, going by Gartner’s figures.Challenges remain. As the company’s low sales figures (which it cautions do not represent consolidated sales—those have not been released) suggest, PC demand is still struggling because of the weak global economy and the lull in purchases in advance of the launch of Windows 8.When the company issued guidance a month ago, they said PC annual sales growth could could fall to as low as zero this year because of low demand.But more recently they have seemed increasingly optimistic that Windows 8 can revive demand. Although the company has said it feels pressured by Microsoft’s decision to launch its own Surface tablet, it is also racing to launch its own slew of new products to catch consumers interested in how Windows 8 will integrate the experience of a traditional notebook and a new touchscreen tablet.The outspoken company is holding its next analyst call this Friday. We’ll wait and see whether they think their glass is now half full or half empty.
141;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-08-08T00:14:51Z;Facebook pushes more ads into newsfeed;;Facebook launched a new mobile advertising product for app developers that pushes more marketing content into users’ home pages amid investor pressure on the company to expand revenue channels.The new ads will appear in people’s mobile newsfeeds, and, if clicked, will direct users to the Apple or Google Play app store to download the promoted mobile app. Facebook gets paid every time a user clicks on an ad.“[This is] a new way for mobile app developers to grow their business with an ad unit that helps them reach and reengage their users,” Facebook wrote in a blog post.The move pushes a delicate boundary for Facebook. Until now, Facebook only allowed ads in the newsfeed that had some kind of social connection to the user – either the user or a user’s friend had expressed interest in the company sponsoring the ad, by “liking” the company’s Facebook page or posting a comment there. Facebook defended these ads by calling them “organic content” that had merely been “amplified.”The new ads will target users based on its traditional advertising criteria, demographic and interest data. Users can also be targeted based on apps they have downloaded in the past. So a person who has downloaded a fitness app could see an ad for the same company’s new diet tracking app. Or a gamer who has played FarmVille could see an ad for another mobile Zynga game.“Facebook is trying to crack the codes of monetising mobile platforms,” said Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner. “It’s taken years of experimentation with desktop ads, going down blind alleys and backtracking a bit and recalibrating. I think the same process is happening on mobile.”Facebook’s share price has been declining steadily since the company reported a sharp slowdown in revenue growth for the last quarter.

142;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-07-31T20:51:13Z;Crowdsourcing as catalyst for change;;"Crowdsourcing has changed from a buzzword to a business model. In simple terms, it means taking a job traditionally done by one person and outsourcing it to a large, undefined group. Think Threadless, where consumers vote on T-shirt designs to be produced. Mob4Hire has a global crowd 45,000 strong that beta tests mobile products. It’s easy to see how crowdsourcing helps solve problems and drive profits in digital and high-tech companies.But I would argue crowdsourcing’s next frontier should be a less obvious one - the complex, rapidly changing American healthcare system.According to a 2011 Gartner study, healthcare lags behind other industries in using crowdsourcing. But in this industry the power is moving to the people - consumers are stepping out of employers’ shadows and becoming more mobile, direct customers of healthcare services.Many stakeholders, insurance companies in particular, are mired in outdated structures and struggling to adapt to this shifting landscape. Crowdsourcing (and the technology that fuels it) could help drive the complete transformation these companies need - and offer lessons for other traditional, complex industries that aren’t yet closely tied to the digital revolution.Crowdsourcing represents a radical departure from the status quo, but that’s exactly why the healthcare industry should consider it for its toughest problems. For example, insurers are scrambling to learn how to run virtual operations with an entrepreneurial mind-set.Consider that Facebook manages 845m users with 3,200 staff, while large health plans serve about 60m customers with 30,000 to 90,000 staff – that’s one Facebook staffer for every 264,000 users, while each health plan staffer serves on average only 1,500 customers. Insurance companies will increasingly compete against companies that are already skilled at using digital platforms to form new alliances and that can reconfigure their value chains in response to market needs.Where could crowdsourcing have the greatest impact in healthcare?Big Data: gamification (using games to make messages more engaging and informative) could aid in solving complex medical problems. For example, citizen scientists helped unlock the structure of a protein molecule via a video game developed at the University of Washington, and the JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) and InnoCentive announced a $100,000 challenge “to the crowd” in order to fuel the discovery of a glucose-responsive insulin drug.The most compelling insights about therapeutic treatment effectiveness have yet to be mined, because private insurer data has been proprietary and trapped in data silos. This may soon change: the nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute has pooled 5bn claims from 34m commercial members to discover the drivers of rising healthcare costs.Crowdsourcing this analysis may be the fastest means of linking medical practices to outcomes. This data could be used to proactively identify patients who are likely to be admitted to a hospital within the next year - a preventive analysis that could save $30bn in unnecessary hospital admissions.New Care Models: Facebook is already being employed by some users to reach the crowd for help in “diagnosing” rare medical conditions, while Webicina.com aggregates social media-driven healthcare resources.Payors could also collaborate with self-monitoring consumers who collect data such as heart rate, blood pressure, weight, and glucose levels over smartphones and other devices. This ‘field’ data could be continuously and wirelessly uploaded to a care team’s dashboard. The team and the empowered consumer could co-develop new models of care for both chronically ill and healthier populations. Open source infrastructure, protocols, and applications are available for sharing data between devices and with providers to improve the health of individuals and communities.Organisational Alignment: internal crowdsourcing may aid in postmerger integration by engaging acquired business units in developing their own alignment plans. Look at some of the recent acquisitions by large health plans which now require major product and portfolio integrations.Instead of a top-down integration effort, management could issue a framework for a desired portfolio (specifying key attributes) to business units and acquired entities. In response, the internal crowd could be empowered to submit product plans and re-engineering ideas for consideration, and the final solution could be made available to all via cloud computing.Healthcare organisations will however need to take three critical steps in order to use crowdsourcing to catalyse change.1. Integrate with digital technologies: crowdsourcing will gain the most traction in companies that already have a strong digital foundation. Health providers and payors are experimenting with social media, telemedicine, virtual offices, and online or mobile intervention. Crowdsourcing becomes a seamless application over a platform that already emphasises engagement across the organisation.2. Establish an information-sharing infrastructure: an infrastructure that allows for effortless internal communication, knowledge sharing, and empowerment is essential for collaborating with consumers and partners. Real change will be stymied by closed architecture, data silos, and the lack of a way to get “real” feedback from consumers and employees.3. Change culture and roles: as crowdsourcing shifts the business model toward co-creation, social networking is everyone’s responsibility; it becomes a way to influence product development, improve operations, and chart strategy.Crowdsourcing can help transform healthcare only if organisations are willing to trade control for innovation and let go of the old way of doing things. And as health consumers gain more power and demand more control, those who go boldly into the crowd will be positioned to win in terms of loyalty, growth, and revenue.Carl Dumont is a partner at Booz & Company, where he specialises in IT for healthcare and life sciences"
143;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-07-15T15:56:23Z;PC makers hope Windows 8 will revive sales;;PC makers, jilted of late by consumers attracted to tablets and smartphones, are pinning their hopes for a change in fortunes on the October launch of the Windows 8 operating system, announced last week.But industry executives and analysts warn that the chill of a slowing global economy could quash those hopes. Unlike in previous downturns, such as in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, consumer demand for new electronic gadgets appears to no longer be decoupled from the state of the broader economy.Worldwide PC shipments fell to 87.5m units in the second quarter, according to preliminary figures released by the research firm Gartner last week. The 0.1 per cent decline on a year earlier represented the seventh consecutive quarter of virtually flat to single-digit growth.Acer, the world’s third-largest computer vendor by unit shipments, had previously forecast 10 per cent annual growth in the number of computers it ships. That has now been trimmed to zero to 5 per cent growth, according to a company source.“Uncertainties in the economy in various regions, as well as consumer’s low interest in PC purchases, were some of the key influences, said Mikako Kitagawa, analyst at Gartner.During the key holiday sales seasons in the second half, PC makers such as HP, Dell and Lenovo will also see competition from Microsoft and Google, both of which have recently launched their own tablet PCs. Apple is also expected to unveil the iPhone 5 in October.Kirk Yang, head of Asia ex-Japan tech hardware research at Barclays, says PC makers’ ability to excite consumers will be key to their success at a time when cutbacks in corporate and government budgets have also been hurting PC sales.Consumers “don’t have to buy – I’m sure everybody’s PC still works today, everybody’s mobile phone still works today – but they rush out to buy an iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy because it’s something exciting,” said Mr Yang.So far, it appears that the supply chain is not betting on that happening. For the third quarter, the Taiwanese companies that manufacture more than 90 per cent of the world’s notebook PCs are forecasting an average of 7 per cent quarter-on-quarter unit growth, far below their historic average of 21 per cent growth, says Jenny Lai, an analyst with HSBC.Economists with HSBC expect overall Asian electronics production will grow just 1.5 per cent in August, below the three-year average of 3.7 per cent growth.Asian PC brands are still faring better than their US counterparts. HP lost two percentage points of global market share on a year earlier, falling to 14.9 per cent in the second quarter, while China’s Lenovo gained two to become a close second with 14.7 per cent. Dell dropped to fourth as it was overtaken by Taiwan’s Acer, whose compatriot Asus closed in fifth with near-40 per cent growth in market share.HP has been restructuring after reversing a plan to spin off its PC business, while Dell has been focusing more on software and services, but both are responding to long-term, low-margin problems and the eastward shift of the PC business, according to Ms Kitagawa.“It’s very difficult for HP and Dell to compete with Asian companies now, Lenovo can live with much lower margins than they can,” she told the Financial Times.Nevertheless, the entire market needs catalysts for growth and the news from Microsoft that PCs featuring Windows 8 would be able to go on sale in October could provide a boost in the fourth quarter, although some analysts remain pessimistic.“People are not bracing for a strong second half,” says William Dong, head of Taiwan securities for UBS. “There’s a chance only if we start to look to the 2013 outlook, and there’s a lot of ifs and buts about that.”HSBC’s Ms Lai points out that sales data from prior launches of new Windows versions show no evidence that buyers had postponed their purchases until after the launches. Christine Wang, an analyst with Daiwa, points out that Windows 8 is designed mostly for tablets and might have a limited impact on PC notebook sales.Most PC makers are now competing in the tablet market – Asus makes the Nexus 7, a first tablet from Google going on sale this month. They are also investing in Ultrabooks – thin and light laptops being given a huge marketing push by Intel.But analysts say Ultrabooks are still priced too high, at around $800, to become of mass consumer interest and only a handful of models of a new hybrid category, which combines a laptop with a tablet, has so far appeared.Suppliers to PC makers are also suffering. The microprocessor maker AMD warned on Monday that its second-quarter revenues would be down about 11 per cent on the first quarter, after previously predicting a 3 per cent rise. It blamed softer sales late in the quarter in China and Europe, along with a weaker consumer buying environment for PC makers.The one certain spot for now in the changing tech landscape remains Apple. Robert Lea, a semiconductor analyst with Jefferies, says that orders for chips for assembling Apple products are the only “bright spot” in an otherwise weak second half.“With Apple, there's more confidence on the sales. PC, no one knows. It’s a big question,” one Taipei-based analyst said.
144;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-07-13T09:58:20Z;Acer: PC sales growth could fall to zero;;PC-maker Acer had said that it could post as low as zero per cent annual growth in the number of computers it ships this year.The announcement sent its shares tumbling 3 per cent, even though news that PC sales are freezing should hardly be surprising given the global economic slow down.Acer, the world’s third-largest computer vendor, had previously forecast 10 per cent annual growth in the number of computers it ships. That has now been trimmed to zero to 5 per cent growth, according to a company source.The company has made the news in the past year for its management troubles—its CEO resigned last March after a profit warning—and the group has been trying to turn itself around. Acer has been trailing the pack in smartphones and tablets and pushing hard on sales of so-called “ultrabooks,” notebooks that are very slim and relatively pricey.Analysts are split on whether the company is got on top of its problems. According to data from research house Gartner released this week, Acer sales growth beat the over computer market in the second quarter, and it overtook Dell to become the third-largest vendor. But, says analysts at Nomura (which earlier this week forecast that the company would miss its original guidance), the company’s margins are not improving as quickly as hoped.Acer faces the same global headwinds as other manufacturers with sales of electronics slowing with the decline in global economic growth.“For the most part, forecasts over the last month or so have been slowly coming back a little bit, and a lot of it for more macro reasons,” said Tom Dinges, an analyst with IHS iSuppli.For Taiwan, exposed heavily to exports by hi-tech companies like Acer, the impact of that slowdown has already been pronounced. Its exports and PMI have fallen recently, and its government has been trimming its own GDP forecasts. Not just for Acer but for Taipei the company’s renewed pessimism does not bode well.
145;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-07-09T20:10:54Z;Corporations continue to spend on IT;;In spite of economic and other uncertainties, global corporate IT spending is expected to reach $3.6tn this year, a modest 3 per cent increase from 2011 spending of $3.5tn, according to Gartner, the IT research and consultancy firm.“While the challenges facing global economic growth persist – the eurozone crisis, weaker US recovery, a slowdown in China – the outlook has at least stabilised,” said Richard Gordon, research vice president at Gartner.“There has been little change in either business confidence or consumer sentiment in the past quarter, so the short-term outlook is for continued caution in IT spending.”The revised IT spending forecast for 2012 represents a small increase from the 2.5 per cent projection last quarter, but the figures also confirm an accelerating shift toward cloud computing.In contrast to the rather lacklustre outlook for overall IT spending, Gartner expects enterprise spending on public cloud services to grow from $91bn worldwide in 2011 to $109bn in 2012. By 2016, Gartner suggests that corporate spending on public cloud services spending will reach $207bn.“Business process as a service (BPaaS) still accounts for the vast majority of cloud spending by enterprises, but other areas such as platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) are growing faster,” said Richard Gordon, research vice president at Gartner.Companies from a wide range of sectors are adopting cloud computing not only because of the possible cost savings it can provide over in-house IT services provisions, but also because of the added flexibility that it offers. As a result, IT hardware, software and service providers have all been racing to add or extend their cloud-based offerings.Gartner expects worldwide IT services spending to reach $864bn in 2012, a 2.3 per cent increase from 2011. Demand for consulting services is expected to remain high due to the complexity of environments for global business and technology leaders. Gartner analysts said consulting itself is becoming increasingly technology-based with the rise of analytics and big data, having deep implications on the future of consulting services.The global telecom services market continues to be the largest IT spending market. Telecom services growth is expected to come not only from net connections, especially in emerging markets, but also in mature markets from the uptake of multiple connected devices, such as media tablets, gaming and other consumer electronics devices.
146;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-07-02T18:12:13Z;Dell pushes into software with $2.4bn deal;;Dell has laid the foundation for a broader move into software with a $2.4bn all-cash acquisition that will accelerate the US company’s push beyond its core personal computer business.The purchase of Quest Software, revealed on Monday, was intended to bring Dell a presence in key software areas such as systems management and security and serve as the platform for future deals, according to John Swainson, president of software at Dell.A long-time IBM executive and former chief executive of software maker CA, Mr Swainson was brought in by Dell last year to help its expansion beyond hardware, which still accounts for about 87 per cent of its revenues, while also bringing a larger base of repeat revenues and reducing the volatility in Dell’s business during periods of economic weakness.The push into software is also designed to take Dell into higher-margin markets, Mr Swainson said, though he added that the Quest deal was motivated by strategic goals rather than being a case of Dell “randomly looking at software profit pools”.Will Cappelli, an analyst at Gartner, an IT research firm, said buying Quest was the “single best deal Dell could have done” to kick-start its push into software. While Quest is a smaller player in the systems management business than rivals such as BMC, CA and IBM’s Tivoli division, Mr Cappelli said the company still brought most of the capabilities that Dell needed to become a significant player in the market.The deal follows a bidding war triggered by Quest’s acceptance of a $22-a-share offer earlier this year from private equity firm Insight Venture Partners. Dell’s winning bid, at $28 a share, values the company’s equity at about 17 times this year’s expected earnings, compared with the multiples of 11-12 times earnings for rivals CA and BMC.The purchase of Quest, which Wall Street expects to generate revenues of about $935m this year, will leave Dell with total annual software revenues of $1.2bn, the company said. At about 2 per cent of company-wide sales, the business remains only a small part of its overall business.Mr Swainson said that Dell’s aim was to build a “meaningful” software business with sales in the “billions of dollars”, though he did not set a target for the division.Mr Cappelli said making a large acquisition such as Quest, rather than buying a series of smaller players to assemble the same of capabilities, would accelerate Dell’s ambitions.By selling the software that companies need to manage and secure their IT systems, Dell also hopes to get a foot in the door to sell a broader range of hardware and services.
147;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-06-10T19:12:56Z;Apple and Microsoft to push rival visions;;Apple and Microsoft will be exhorting developers to support their rival visions of computing with more urgency than usual at sold-out conferences on opposite coasts of the US starting on Monday.Apple is providing final details at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in San Francisco on its summer release of Mountain Lion – the next iteration of its operating system for Mac computers, while lifting the lid on the new iOS 6, the interface and apps for the iPhone and iPad.Microsoft’s TechEd in Orlando, Florida will evangelise Windows 8 – the forthcoming dual operating system for PCs and tablets that uses the same style of tiled interface already introduced on Windows smartphones and Xbox 360 games consoles.But they face completely different problems in trying to galvanise developers to support their software ecosystems – Apple’s App Store is suffering from a surfeit of apps, with downloads falling and user attention waning, while Microsoft must persuade developers to produce apps for tablets that have yet to record any sales.“There isn’t an installed base of users for Windows 8 and developers want that more than anything else in order to sell their applications,” says Van Baker, an analyst with the Gartner research firm.He is among the many doubters that Microsoft has got it right with Windows 8, which ambitiously has two different interfaces – a regular Windows desktop hidden behind the “Metro” tiled interface optimised for touchscreens, which was first seen on Windows smartphones.“It feels like two very different environments stuck together in an unnatural fashion,” he says.Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, has described efforts to create hybrid laptop-tablet combinations that can take full advantage of Windows 8 as being as unsatisfactory as combining a toaster with a refrigerator.The iPad and iPhone have sealed Apple’s standing as the world’s most valuable tech company, but the group’s leadership will be challenged to live up to the vision of Steve JobsApple has insisted on maintaining two different operating systems, one for mouse-based Macs and one for touchscreen devices, although Mountain Lion is inspired by the iPad’s interface, with items such as a messages app, notifications feature and game centre moving over to the Mac.Apple App Store daily downloads of the top 200 free apps continued to fall in April – down 5 per cent month-on-month to 4.23m, according to the Fiksu app ranking company. They had fallen 30 per cent in March to 4.45m.The cost for brands to acquire a loyal user rose 12 per cent in April and analysts are talking about a “throwaway mentality” emerging as 65 per cent of consumers stop using a downloaded app within 30 days.Nevertheless, Apple is likely to release updated App Store figures on Monday that show its overall popularity is still growing. With more than 600,000 apps, including around 200,000 for the iPad at last count, Apple retains a big lead over competitors and its annual developer events tend to galvanise its community.Other rumoured announcements that would create excitement include a new non-Google map app, improvements to and wider availability of Siri voice recognition software, Facebook integration, the opening up of Apple TV to app developers and a new line of MacBooks with higher resolution screens.
148;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-06-04T18:58:39Z;Managing complexity and app explosion;Apps have added complexity to IT systems management;"The growth in enterprise applications mirrors the apps explosion associated with consumer devices such as smartphones and PC tablets. Coupled with other key trends including rising user expectations, this had added enormous complexity to the management of corporate IT systems.As Marc Hurd, Oracle’s president, noted during a presentation at Oracle’s Industry Analyst World event, chief information officers face a “Rubik’s cube of complexity.” Old applications, storage, mobility and social media are all making life more difficult than ever for corporate IT, Mr Hurd said.A major impact of this is poor application performance. As a result, Gartner, the IT research firm, estimates that 20 per cent of the Global 2000 are shifting the emphasis of their IT operations to monitor and manage applications, rather than infrastructure.According to Gartner, about $2bn was spent worldwide last year on application performance monitoring (APM) licenses and first-year maintenance contracts. This was a 15 per cent increase over the $1.7bn spent in 2010, which in turn represented about a 10 per cent increase over the previous year.Although APM has been an implicit part of IT operations since the mid-1990s, it is only in the past seven years or so that it has emerged as a distinct IT discipline. It enables organisations to optimise the performance and value of their business-critical applications. This includes managing the speed and availability of applications.Significantly, Gartner suggests that the factor most responsible for the increased attention now being paid to the APM process and the tools and services supporting it does not come from IT, but from the business side of the enterprise which has, during the past decade, fundamentally changed its attitude toward IT in general.“Line of business and ‘c-level’ executives now generally recognise that IT is not just infrastructure that supports background workflows, but is also, and more fundamentally, a direct generator of revenue and a key enabler of strategy,” Gartner noted it its ‘Magic Quadrant’ analysis of APM market leaders published in September.“For the typical executive, what’s important is the application portfolio that directly enables him or her to accomplish business goals. Unfortunately,” noted Gartner, “at just the moment when executives have become keen about imposing an application-centric view of the world on IT operations, applications have become far more difficult to monitor; in general, architectures have become more modular, redundant, distributed and dynamic, often laying down the particular twists and turns that a code execution path could take at the latest possible moment.”I asked John Van Siclen of Compuware, one of the leaders in the market segment, to help me understand why the market for application performance management software is growing so quickly. Here is an edited Q&A with him:Why are slow, or poorly performing, applications more of a problem now than they were five or 10 years ago?There are two main reasons: first, end users are getting increasingly impatient and want their applications to perform with lightning speed. This not only applies to consumers but to business users where faster time-to-value is critical.Second, modern application delivery is very complex, making the management of application performance much more difficult. By the time an application residing in a data centre interacts with an end user, it must traverse this very complex application delivery chain, which consists of many dynamic variables that impact the end user experience.These can include things like web 2.0 code, mobile native applications, streaming applications, third-party and cloud services, smartphones, tablets, browsers, operating systems, internet service providers, mobile carriers and more. Many enterprises struggle with this new level of complexity, especially when they must deliver applications with more functionality, more quickly, and with fewer resources.Why are line of business executives getting involved in what was previously seen as an IT concern?In most enterprises, there’s a growing realisation that applications are the business. Applications are what your end users interact with, so executives see the direct impact that poorly performing applications have on the business.A new generation of application performance management systems are required to give executives real-time performance visibility with dashboards that show the actual business impact. In order to address the ever growing IT complexity, companies need to move away from a piecemeal, tools-based approach to a more integrated approach that offers a complete view of performance across the entire application delivery chain.A more integrated APM approach enabled organisations to optimise the performance and value of their business-critical applications. This is why investments in APM are growing at five times the rate of overall IT spending.How fast do end users expect their applications to download? What is the real dollar impact of slow performance?There have been many studies that indicate end users expect applications to be fast, available, and reliable. In fact, often faster than most organisations can currently deliver them. We call this the Google effect – we’re trained to have a search request fulfilled almost in real-time, and we expect the same from a web page, internal business application or mobile app.A decade ago, we were content to wait 10 seconds or more for an application or web page to load. The industry standard is now under two seconds, and for every second of wait time beyond that, the business is being impacted and revenue is lost. While the dollar impact varies from business to business, The Aberdeen Group estimates that an e-commerce website can lose 7 per cent of sales conversions for every added second of wait time.The challenge for business is to maintain end user service levels and to proactively detect and remediate problems before they impact the business. On the positive side, we’re seeing many leading organisations use performance management to get ahead of the competition by constantly improving their end users’ experience.What’s the impact of the cloud on the performance of online assets?For organisations using public or private clouds, several performance issues come into play; the first being the impact of geography. We created a free web community called CloudSleuth where we constantly monitor the speed (response time) of the major cloud providers. The results show that a service that might be fast on the US east coast can lag on the west coast or in Europe.Another overriding issue is lack of transparency. When you outsource that level of highly dynamic, scalable infrastructure – placing it in the cloud – your ability to manage and configure performance is limited, and most cloud providers do not offer service level agreements guaranteeing performance levels.Not only do you lose the ability to manage that infrastructure as you would an in-house server, you also lose the ability to monitor the end user’s experience. APM puts you back in control by providing the kind of visibility and management options that cloud installations require to achieve needed performance levels.It’s true that there’s no escaping the cloud, really. Most enterprises are already dependent on third-party cloud-based web services. Our internal data shows that the average web transaction depends on as many as a dozen hosts, and many of those are in the cloud. So even if your core infrastructure is within your own data centre, you probably depend on the cloud and therefore need to manage those resources effectively.How can APM assist with the leveraging of ‘Big Data?’‘Big Data’ takes the complexity we talked about earlier to a new level, as companies seek to effectively leverage massive amounts of information to gain competitive advantage or to improve the experience of their customers. However, these benefits can only be realised if the data can be processed intelligently, efficiently, and results delivered in a timely manner.Big Data applications suffer from many of the performance challenges and bottlenecks that plague current distributed applications, though the volume of performance data are often much larger. To facilitate speed and real-time results, APM must support massively scalable architectures and dynamic, elastic resource allocation.Helping businesses get to that data quickly is where APM comes in. The bigger the data, the deeper the dive. What I mean is that Big Data, by its very nature, requires special tools to help organisations manage and optimise its effective use. The companies that do this well will have an enormous advantage.What’s the impact of streaming video on online assets?One of our streaming executives attended the NAB (broadcasters) show recently and spoke about how to provide hiccup-free streaming video. At the end of the presentation, she asked if there were any questions, but no one took her up on it. But as she walked offstage, she was approached by a number of attendees all with multiple questions, each not wanting to publicly reveal their own streaming performance problems. This incident is telling; if professional broadcasters are challenged by streaming, just imagine how other companies are faring.Right now streaming video is mainly used by entertainment and media companies, but is moving steadily to a ‘must have’ in other industries as more people get accustomed to having it as an option for product descriptions, training, demos and so forth. Video requires a lot of storage and bandwidth and there are several formats of video used, so this is adding to the complexity of the application delivery chain and requires new APM approaches to manage.How is the ‘app revolution’ on mobile devices impacting businesses?The world is clearly going mobile and every organisation is dealing with these modern applications that are dynamically assembled at the edge of the internet in the user’s browser or mobile application. This complexity at the edge is daunting and is another factor driving the need for APM.Getting applications to perform well on a mobile device is particularly tricky given the multitude of available devices, operating systems, native and web apps, browser types etc. Add to this the inherent inconsistencies of wireless carriers and there’s much that can go wrong.Unfortunately, your customers are as unforgiving about poor mobile performance as they are with desktop or laptop PCs. The rate at which an end user will abandon a slow loading mobile website is very close to abandonment rate for all devices.What are the core best practices an organisation should implement to ensure fast and reliable performance of their applications?Everything we’ve talked about previously really speaks to one overriding best practice: focus on the end user. It’s the lens through which companies need to manage and look at application performance management. Your application is what the end user interacts with, not what leaves your data centre, so companies need to monitor the entire path of an application – from the edge of the internet through the cloud to your datacentre. A unified APM strategy may sound daunting, but it is the only way to ensure your applications are performing optimally amid this growing complexity.Executive and IT leaders alike are challenged to maintain customer service levels and proactively detect and remediate performance problems before they impact the business. But for every dollar lost to poor performance, know there’s an opportunity for gains that come at the expense of your slower competition.John Van Siclen is Senior Vice President and General Manager of Compuware’s APM business unit"
149;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-05-31T19:10:29Z;Oracle and HP;One delightfully nasty business dispute goes to court;Sayre’s law states that in any dispute, intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the amount of value at stake. In business, the intensity ramps up as growth subsides and a fight for share begins.One delightfully nasty business dispute goes to court this week. Oracle announced a year ago that it would no longer update its software for servers running on Intel’s Itanium chips, arguing that the processors were becoming obsolete. The main buyer for the chips was Hewlett-Packard, which uses them in its Integrity servers. Oracle had recently got into the server business, so it looked a bit like it was unfairly crippling a competitor. HP alleges that Oracle is contractually obliged to keep the updates coming. Each company has trumpeted documents making the other look disingenuous.Why all the heat? It’s a big market. Some $53bn in servers were sold in 2011, a 7 per cent increase from the year before, according to Gartner. But in the first quarter, sales shrank. The question is whether this industry will come to resemble personal computers: slowing growth, falling margins and share gains by low-cost competitors. The results of the biggest competitors do not paint a pretty picture. HP’s high-end server business shrank by a tenth in 2011 and by 23 per cent in the past quarter. Dell’s server business is still growing, but the pace has slowed. Oracle’s hardware business has been steadily shrinking (the company says it is intentionally giving up unprofitable business). IBM, which leads in higher-end servers, describes its business as very profitable but a modest grower.In PCs, most of the value has accrued to software designers (and one very skilled hardware-software integrator, Apple). There is nothing to suggest the server business will not follow suit, generating a lot of fierce arguments along the way.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
150;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-05-25T18:32:11Z;Bain attacks on Romney miss target;;In their quest to portray Mitt Romney as a heartless “Richie Rich” character, Democrats have been combing through scores of deals the Republican presidential hopeful did during his time running Bain Capital.The latest attack is on Gartner Group, a market research company which made a fortune for Bain in the early 1990s – $55m, or 16 times its initial investment. Democrats say it provided outsourcing advice to companies, in sharp contrast with the Republican’s tough talk on trade with China.“Romney’s phony rhetoric on trade is just a reminder that his record and policies have not, and will not, benefit the middle class in this country,” says Bill Burton, head of Priorities USA Action, an outside group established to help re-elect President Barack Obama.The attacks echo a refrain that has shadowed Mr Romney throughout his political career but is being revived by an Obama campaign eager to undermine the Republican’s economic credentials in a year when a slow recovery is the dominant issue on voters’ minds.While Mr Romney and his campaign have argued that his 25 years at Bain Capital, which he founded in 1984, gave him credentials as a “turnround” specialist who can fix the economy, the Obama team has sought to portray him as a ruthless corporate “vampire”.The attacks have reached fever pitch in recent weeks as the Obama re-election campaign has launched ad campaigns in important swing states showing companies that went under after Bain invested in them, sparking strong objections from Democrats as well as Republicans.President Barack Obama:“When you’re president, as opposed to the head of a private equity firm, then your job is not simply to maximise profits. Your job is to figure out how everybody in the country has a fair shot.”Obama campaign:“Why is Mitt Romney running from the record he based his candidacy on?”Mitt Romney: “I happen to believe that having been in the private sector for 25 years gives me a perspective on how jobs are created – that someone who’s never spent a day in the private sector, like President Obama, simply doesn’t understand.”Romney campaign:“Despite President Obama’s attempts to distract from his failed record, the American people remember.”But there are signs the message may not be resonating in the American heartland. An ABC/Washington Post poll published this week found that as many respondents said Mr Romney’s business record was a main reason to vote for him as against him.Mr Romney’s support has strengthened in some national polls this month, although Mr Obama still holds the edge, according to the latest RealClearPolitics average of polls, which gives the president a 1.6 point lead with 45.4 per cent support.The private equity industry has argued that the attacks are empty and unfair. “There is a lot of rhetoric in a political campaign and a lot of hyperbole,” says Steve Judge, president of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council. “It’s something that happens in political campaigns. People get a bit carried away sometimes.”Steven Davis, a University of Chicago expert on private equity buyouts and their impact on job creation, calls the whole line of attack “pretty worrisome”.With Mitt Romney on the verge of clinching the Republican presidential nomination, attention turns to the race for the White House“It’s not that private equity guys are angels who are always doing good, but they are an important part of a market economy,” he says. “I’m concerned these attacks will translate into policies that retard the creative destruction process. If that slows down, it will help slow down productivity growth.”The choice of Gartner underlines the difficulties Democrats have in finding real dirt to throw at the presumptive Republican nominee.Although Gartner has run annual outsourcing conferences and has analysts looking at the trend, this comprises a small fraction of its business.“It is really not anywhere near Gartner’s core research services, and wasn’t a significant business back in the early 1990s,” says Steve Pagliuca, a managing director at Bain Capital who was involved in the original deal and has served on Gartner’s board for 21 years. “Even today it is one of 1,000 questions that come in.”It is “way far afield” to use Gartner as an example of a bad investment, says Mr Pagliuca, a Democrat, because it has grown from a flailing company with 300 employees in 1990 to a global brand with more than 5,000 on its payroll.The other company that Democrats have seized on is Modus Media International, a software and documentation company that employed 4,000 people when Bain bought it in 1997. By 2004, its global headcount had fallen to 3,500, even as it opened facilities in Asia and Mexico.Mr Romney’s detractors say this is evidence of his “hypocrisy” because he financially benefits from the same trade trends he now criticises, since most of his income is “carried interest” – profits earned by investors in Bain funds.But almost all of Modus’ global expansion happened after 1999, when Mr Romney left Bain to run the Utah Winter Olympics, as the company branched out into new markets, say people close to Bain.They conceded that jobs were cut in the US, notably at plants in California and Washington state, but attributed this to the bursting of the tech bubble.Mr Romney’s campaign says the candidate understood how an unfair playing field could press businesses to move jobs overseas.“It doesn’t make sense to blame businesses for the failure of the Obama administration to get tough on China’s trade practices,” says a spokeswoman. “When Mitt Romney is president, he intends to fix that problem so that American businesses can create jobs here at home.”
151;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-05-24T18:38:58Z;HP seeks return to its R&D roots;;For Hewlett-Packard, buying a future has not worked. Now it has to do the hard work of building one for itself. That was the message this week from Meg Whitman, the former eBay chief executive who has taken on one of the most difficult jobs in tech.Though a faded version of the innovative engineering concern that helped to shape the modern Silicon Valley, HP is still one of the region’s biggest employers. It also represents an important part of the Valley’s sense of itself: started in a garage and a pioneer in new entrepreneurial management techniques, its problems still reverberate even as Facebook, a former close neighbour, has become the centre of attention.Ms Whitman has a long way to go to reclaim some of that heritage. As she delivered the latest dire news from the company on Wednesday – that 27,000 employees are to lose their jobs– HP’s stock market value stood at just $42bn. By coincidence, that is almost exactly what it has spent on acquisitions over the past five years in an attempt to do what a succession of chief executives have failed at: to give it a leading position in some of the hottest new markets in tech.That the deals have not worked was underlined by the abrupt departure this week of Mike Lynch, head of UK software company Autonomy, whose acquisition for $10bn capped the string of deals.As the latest earnings report from HP this week suggested, Ms Whitman has at least begun to sort through some of the wreckage she inherited. However, she has yet to get to grips with – or even, in some cases, define – the deeper strategic problems that beset HP’s businesses.“Since Meg took over and started to make some changes, it’s been all about the tactical,” said Mark Fabbi, a research analyst at Gartner. “It doesn’t change the trajectory of the company.”At least the tactical moves are showing some initial signs of success. Ms Whitman herself claimed “some positive, early signs of stabilising performance” – no small feat, given the deep economic uncertainties that have left a dark cloud over rivals such as Dell and Cisco in recent days. With HP’s shares perking up by nearly 5 per cent early on Wednesday, some Wall Street analysts started to revisit their forecasts for the company and revise some of their most negative views.To get to this point, Ms Whitman has been forced to continue a cycle of restructurings and downsizings that have seemingly become part of business as usual at HP. The $1.7bn restructuring charge announced this week is the latest in an annual string of such charges that now dates back 11 years, with the figure topping $1bn in four of those years.“Their costs were more bloated than others and [they] had to address lower revenue levels – what else are you going to do?” said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee.Other changes she has pushed through include merging the company’s printing and PC divisions– a step that had also once been taken by former chief Carly Fiorina, only to be undone by her successor, Mark Hurd – and centralising the handling of its largest global customers.The harder job that lies ahead will be to reverse an erosion in competitiveness that has become evident in each of HP’s four main businesses.While the PC industry faces the threat from tablets and other new mobile devices, the hardware division that sells to large customers has suffered from the shift from high-priced “mission-critical systems” to more standardised forms of hardware. At the same time, HP’s big services division, built largely from the acquisition of EDS, has struggled to overhaul its business to keep pace with better-placed rivals such as IBM and Accenture.Ms Whitman’s predecessors at least had one star business to fall back on: the imaging and printing division that was built around the laser jet printer, one of HP’s most successful inventions. Not any more. Consumers are creating fewer prints at home as they move their pictures into online services. At the same time, HP has been slow to catch the latest trends in printing by its corporate customers.Ms Whitman’s plan now involves slashing costs to free up the money to invest in these businesses. Calling HP “a fantastic engineering culture”, she said: “The best payback I can see here is to put money into R&D.” That would lead to the budget being increased “pretty substantially”.That message has found sympathetic listeners on Wall Street – though the challenges of turning HP back into an industry leader and rekindling growth are significant.Meanwhile, for workers who are now under the threat of job losses, there seems little else to hope for. “Without revenue growth, next year it will be another 30,000,” said Mr Fabbi.
152;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-05-22T17:35:24Z;Financial officers influence IT spending;Economic uncertainties fail to dampen investment;Corporate financial chiefs are playing an increasingly important role in IT investment decisions, according to a joint study published by Gartner and the Financial Executives Research Foundation.The Top 10 Findings from 2012 Gartner FEI CFO Technology Study, based on the responses of 255 chief financial officers, confirms anecdotal evidence that it is the CFO rather than the chief information officer in many companies that makes key decisions about IT investments.Forty-four per cent of the CFOs surveyed said that their influence over IT investment has increased since 2010, while 47 per cent say that it has remained the same, and just 9 per cent of those surveyed believe that their influence has decreased.“The CFO and chief information officer are well-positioned to work together at generating business value from enterprise IT investments,” said John Van Decker, research vice-president at Gartner.However he cautioned, “this performance is often not achieved because of poor perceptions of IT, a parochial CFO or CIO perspective, or simply a failure to invest in the CFO-CIO relationship”.The survey results showed that there are many ways that CFOs are involved in making IT investment decisions. Forty one per cent said that they were the actual leader of a group responsible for IT investment, and another 41 per cent were part of a group responsible for IT decision making. Sixteen per cent said they provide advice and one per cent said they were the sole decision maker.Since the large majority was involved in group decision-making about IT, the study’s authors conclude that engaging the CFO is clearly a critical issue. ”CFOs need to explain to CIOs the IT capabilities needed by the finance function,” said Bill Sinnett, director of research at FERF, the research arm of Financial Executives International.One reason CFOs are important stakeholders is that they control IT funding. Although CFOs do not strictly decide who receives the money, they are powerful influencers and strict enforcers of policies and decisions. CFOs often have greater access to, and involvement with, senior business governance groups, and usually have strong influence and credibility with the CEO and board.The study also revealed that despite economic uncertainties, corporate IT spending is currently very healthy and if there is a business improvement that can be made from increasing investments in IT spending, many CFOs will consider approval.From an IT operating expense perspective, 39 per cent of CFOs expect the IT budget to be similar this year to 2010, while 44 per cent forecast an increase. For IT capital appropriations, 32 per cent expect no change in spending, while 48 per cent are expecting an increase.When asked how their companies view spending in 2013 compared to this year 2012, 51 per cent see the same IT operating expense levels, and 41 per cent forecast similar IT capital spending, while 44 per cent see an increase in capital spending in 2013 over 2012.Top IT investment priorities include business intelligence, analytics and performance management. CFOs clearly recognise the need for improved technology support for these key business processes and identified the top business process area that needs technology investment as the ability to facilitate analysis and decision making (57 per cent), closely followed by collaboration and knowledge management (52 per cent).In addition, the analysts identified four major technology trends that are on the CFO’s radar and will drive technology planning, investment and usage in 2012 and beyond. These are the nexus of social, mobile, cloud and information.Companies are being challenged to adapt as these technologies, and the data that result from their adoption and deployment, expands exponentially. With the exception of social media, which scored low in terms of technology initiatives, mobile, cloud (including software as a service [SaaS]) and information are top priorities with CFOs.“While CFOs certainly appreciate reduced cost through the more efficient delivery of IT, organisations need to understand that CFOs want technology investment that they can see business value from in the form of improved business processes. Therefore, their priorities are largely focused on analytics and business applications,” said Mr Sinnett.“CFOs are beginning to look at technologies that can span BI and applications and deliver applications through mobile access and via SaaS,” said Mr Van Decker. “While these nexus capabilities are a concern more in 2013, IT organisations must communicate how more effective business platforms can be leveraged to deliver better architectures for business applications that are top of mind to the CFO.”
153;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;India pharma goes gradually global;;"How do you build India’s first truly global pharmaceuticals group? One bit at a time – at least that seems to be how Ajay Piramal is going about it.Having bought a molecular imaging business from Germany’s Bayer last month, the billionaire head of Piramal Healthcare on Wednesday unveiled the results of his latest trip to the shops: Decision Resources Group, a US health information provider that it bought from Providence Equity Partners for $635m.The Massachusetts-based group provides “web-enabled research, predictive analytics via proprietary databases and consulting services” which, roughly translated, means it deals in the same species of expensive commercial research as a Gartner or Forrester, selling it mostly to big pharma or medical manufacturing groups.Of more interest, however, is just how this fits into Piramal’s overall plans to become India’s first true developer of global pharmaceuticals products, a mark he has pledged to meet by launching his country’s first domestically developed drug at some point next year.The purchase of DRG – which will come half in cash and half in equity – adds to his group’s debt but given the $3.7bn Piramal made by selling off his original generics business in 2010, money isn’t a major issue. However, there is a more obvious question: if your aim is to develop drugs, why bother with bolting on a basically unrelated business in the first place?Speaking to beyondbrics, Piramal explained the move as part of broader plan to rebalance the financials of his new group, as it moved upmarket and persevered with the expensive, uncertain and time-consuming business of developing new drugs.“My thrust is, we should get into businesses which are intellectual property intensive and where there is long-term global growth,” he said, citing his recent purchases as examples. “But our development businesses are more in the investment phase, and so we wanted a business that could balance that, or how else can I satisfy my shareholders?”Stressing that DRG had grown at a compound annual rate of 20 per cent over the last 5 years and would earn revenues of $160m this year, he added: “If you have businesses that take up cash, you also want one which is throwing off cash.”This purchase is close to the final piece in the puzzle in the development of what, it must be said, remains a slightly peculiar looking group, with a healthcare information business now combined with divisions focussing on drug discovery, pharmaceuticals, over the counter medicines and so on.This being India – the land of the sprawling conglomerate – there is also a financial services arm (which owns around 10 per cent of Vodafone India, although Piramal plans to cash this out in the next few years), various retail projects and even a new, as-yet unspecified, move into defence.Piramal enjoys deal-making and strikes most of them on his own; he pointedly noted at Wednesday’s press conference that while Barclays had acted for DRG during the purchase, his side didn’t employ any bankers. But while he says he is still in the hunt for smaller DRG-like groups to bolster his new purchase, he says no more big acquisitions are likely for a while.So, peculiar though it might look on paper, this is the melange of businesses with which he plans to fabricate an Indian rival to Glaxo or AstraZeneca. But before anything close to that ambition can be reached, of course, Piramal has a more immediate concern: that first, blockbuster product.Related reading:

154;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-05-11T20:27:10Z;For productivity apps, PCs still rule (for now);;Is the PC era really over? The success portable computing devices including smartphones and PC tablets has some speculating that the dominance of the desktop PC, and even the laptop, may be coming to an end.Gartner research analyst Nick Ingelbrecht and Mikako Kitagawa recently conducted a series of focus groups in the US, UK, China, Taiwan and Japan to explore consumers’ device usage and their research provides an insight into the growing importance of mobile devices and their impact on PC usage.I asked Nick Ingelbrecht to highlight some of the most interesting findings of his reasearch.Q. What did your focus groups with consumers tell you about smartphone, tablet, and PC usage inside companies?We found that smartphone use is pervasive, especially among early adopter segments, but not necessarily for work purposes.Mobile phones are personal devices that allow people to pursue social interactions throughout the day, regardless what enterprise policies are in force regarding PC usage or for Facebook access at work, for example. People don’t expect to switch off their personal lives when they go into work and people use their smartphones to continue their social interactions throughout the day, wherever they are.That doesn’t mean these interactions are trivial. In the Shanghai focus groups, for example, we got a strong sense that keeping up to date with the latest news and information via microblogs borders on a Darwinian imperative for some consumers, because of the competitive pressures. We also found that the use of mobile phones for work and personal use is seamless, especially where people are bringing their own devices into work.The focus groups also highlighted the degree to which smartphones and tablets are “sucking in” increasing amounts of PC functionality. At work, the desktop PC or laptop remains the prevalent device today, but device portability around the campus and off site mean that people’s expectations and behaviour are changing.Rather than lugging the work laptop around like they used to, people are finding they can do 80 per cent of what they need to get done using a tablet or smartphone, so the laptop stays in the bag or the PC gets marooned on the desk until the time that you absolutely need to go into the office or haul it out, boot it up and wait for an Internet connection.Q. Are smartphones and tablets being purchased as direct replacements for PCs?Some consumers told us that when their PC dies, they are considering getting a tablet instead, but the reality is most consumers don’t want a direct replacement for the PC. Instead, people want portable devices they can take into the lounge or bedroom or on the train or bus and use these devices in a more comfortable setting or while they are out and about, rather than sitting chained to a desk staring at a PC screen.There is an element of generational change driving this lifestyle shift and in general terms, we are seeing many Gen Y-type behaviours becoming more mainstream. In our focus groups the “next device” people overwhelmingly planned to buy was a smartphone if they didn’t already own one. Many of those that already own a smartphone said a tablet would be their next technology purchase. But some are not satisfied.For instance, one Japanese lady complained the iPad was too big to fit in her handbag, so it wasn’t much use to her. There is an inverse correlation between portable devices and PC usage, so that once you buy a tablet, your PC use goes down the most, followed by your laptop use and then, to a lesser extent, your smartphone use.Some consumers prefer PCs because of their familiarity with the device and they are comfortable using the physical keyboard for text input. However, consumers often associate PCs with “work” and like to use media tablets and smartphones to relax.Q. What are the main uses for smartphones and tablets in the enterprise?Smartphones and tablets are used throughout the day along with notebooks and PCs but at a higher and more persistent level. Tablets tend to be used either for media consumption or for checking things - for example checking the e-mail, the news, checking the weather, the football results, reading books in your lunch hour or playing games.PCs are still predominantly used for e-mail responses, work-related research, for detailed product comparisons, banking applications and putting reports and presentations together. However, once people have a choice of devices, the PC tends to get marooned in the study or home office. Elsewhere in the house, people use their smartphones, tablets, or laptop if they don’t have a tablet.On the other hand, we found in China that a lot of people are hooking up their PCs to the TV so they can watch soaps and TV dramas downloaded over the internet for free. So there are all kinds of trade-offs going on here in different parts of the world.For employed people, our research shows that people continue to use their phones for private purposes throughout the working day, even though laptops or PCs are available. One interpretation of this is that people prefer to have their private activities running discretely on their mobiles because that way they tend to interfere less with the work activities they are doing on the PC or laptop.But it also shows that users are nowadays making less of a distinction between private time and work time.Q. Are there specific tasks that still require the use of a PC?PCs are often preferred for specific tasks around content creation and video intensive applications like 3D computer graphics and video editing. These run better on a PC or laptop where you don’t have to compromise on power, display and processing speed.Manipulating complex spreadsheets or finance applications where you need multiple screens still run best on a PC for now. But even so, big data and mission critical applications have begun migrating to tablets. This migration is also being driven by cloud services. For highly secure enterprise applications or those involving sensitive customer data, then the company may only permit access through a locked down laptop or PC, which supports the required level of encryption and security controls.Q. What does the future hold for the PC industry and consumer behaviour generally?PC makers have been placing big bets on mobilising their products including tablets, smartphones and ultra-books along with the cloud services and ecosystems to support them.Although consumers are not initially purchasing tablets as PC replacements, once they acquire tablets and smartphones, they tend to integrate these devices into their lives, and that reshapes their consumption habits in the process.Consumers’ dependency on the desktop PC diminishes as more functionality migrates to portable devices. Consumers prefer the convenience of mobile devices for many reasons: In one portable package you have a high resolution camera, music player, access to Facebook and Google, and - by the way - a phone. Then there are other improvements such as “instant-on,” as well as the more intuitive interfaces like touch-screens and the context aware applications and the cloud-based ecosystems that support these devices.But it is important to remember that while the technology is changing very quickly, this does not entail a massive overnight change in mainstream consumer behaviour. The reality is there are different consumer segments and each is quite distinct from the “average” consumer.Roughly two-thirds of the technology market is comprised of “later adopter” segments and many of these only adopt technologies when they think it is no longer “safe” for them not to do so.The most intriguing aspect of this is the way that over time, consumer behaviour is fundamentally changing as our cognitive frameworks are changing and that means in ten years time, the technology market will look very different from what it is today.
155;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-05-02T16:00:16Z;Lenovo arm unveils China’s first ‘console’;;A Lenovo subsidiary has launched its first home entertainment console, skirting a Chinese ban on gaming equipment by marketing it as a family exercise device.The move puts Lenovo in direct competition with Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft to capture market share in the unofficial Chinese console market. The device, developed by a Lenovo subsidiary called Eedoo, has been plagued by delays but went on sale in China this week for Rmb3799 ($604), nearly twice as much as the going rate for Microsoft’s Xbox Kinect.China has more gamers than any other country in the world, but a decade-old ban on gaming consoles has meant that the most popular machines, like Microsoft’s Xbox, have never been launched officially in China. They are readily available for sale on the grey market but must first be smuggled in.“In China this machine is the first of its kind – one that sells a gaming console through official channels,” said Sun Mengzi, gaming analyst with Analysys International. “It is hard to tell how successful it will be, but at least it will test the water and may encourage more gaming hardware producers to come in.”The $17bn global market for gaming consoles and handheld gaming machines is heavily dominated by Microsoft’s Xbox, Nintendo’s Wii and Sony’s PlayStation, according to Gartner.Eedoo’s product, called the CT510, operates with motion-sensing cameras and comes with fitness games including kung fu and “family gym” titles.“National policy bans the selling of gaming consoles, but the CT510 is a sports machine,” said Jack Luo, chief executive of Eedoo. “We don’t define it as a gaming console. The CT510 doesn’t have fighting, or the cruel and bloody games that are common in a normal gaming console.”Mr Luo added that the console can only be loaded with programmes from Eedoo’s app store, which contains wholesome family games such as English teaching programmes for children, Karaoke and films. The target customers for the new console are wealthy families, professional women, children and older users.The console went on sale in China on Sunday and Eedoo hopes to sell “hundreds of thousands” of the machines in the current fiscal year. The initial reaction from customers in China seems to be tepid, however, with Chinese tech blogs filled with complaints over the price of the machine.A poll on Sina Weibo, China’s largest microblog service, found only 6 per cent of respondents voted to buy the new console, compared with 31 per cent who said they would not buy it because of poor value.Lewis Ward, lead gaming analyst at IDC, said it was significant that Eedoo had appeared to have successfully managed to circumvent Beijing’s ban on gaming consoles. However, he added: “I’m just not convinced that this particular device is going to sell very well.”Additional reporting by Gwen Chen in Beijing
156;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-04-24T14:15:18Z;India 2G: a rough few days;;"The day after India’s telecoms regulator threw the industry into turmoil by announcing sky-high prices for 2G spectrum – at $687m per MHz, 13 times higher than 2008 prices – it was the Supreme Court’s turn.On Tuesday, the justices ordered the government to hold the 2G auction by August 31 – far sooner than the early-2013 Delhi had requested.The silver lining may be that those telecoms companies which had been affected by the court’s decision, in February, to revoke 122 licenses allocated by disgraced former telecoms minister A Raja in 2008 – a process that is alleged to have cost the exchequer $39bn – will get to keep their licenses for an extra few months, instead of being revoked in June.That’s likely to provide little solace to Tata Teleservices, Idea and Loop Telecom, companies that would already have had trouble competing with the likes of market leaders Bharti Airtel and Vodafone in a new 2G auction. Now, analysts said, even the top dogs will find it difficult to justify the cost – especially considering the uncertainty surrounding the sector.“There’s going to be some resistance to the [starting] price, which will be difficult for the incumbents as well as… those that lost their licenses to digest,” said Kamlesh Bhatia, director research for telecoms at Gartner. “This will mean a lot more capital outlay compared to what they must have planned for.”JS Sharma, chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, defended the high prices to the Economic Times as reasonable considering the versatility of the 1800 MHz spectrum to be auctioned (which can support 2G, 3G and 4G services), and the one-third upfront / 10-year pay period the government is offering.Meanwhile, R Chandrashekhar, telecoms secretary, told ET NOW, a news channel, that the breakdown over the 20-year life of the license justified the price, as well as a decrease in spectrum usage charges companies paid to the government which will go from 3-8 per cent to 1 per cent (though only for those who purchase new spectrum at the higher prices).For its part, Trai, in its report, notes that 1800 MHz spectrum was auctioned in recent years in Europe for an average €0.21 per MHz per person, while its recommendation is that India sells at a final, post-auction cost of €0.25.Still, if the government takes up all of Trai’s recommendations, incumbents like Bharti and Vodafone will not only have to pay billions of dollars for new 2G spectrum, but will actually have to pay billions simply to maintain the spectrum the companies had been allocated years before the controversial 2008 auction.Bharti shares fell as much as 4.3 per cent yesterday on the news because of the estimated billions of dollars it will need to reconfigure its existing infrastructure around the new spectrum.Despite widespread industry backlash, the government is unlikely to back down from Trai’s recommendations, lest it invite accusations of the same sort of behaviour that led to the 2G corruption scam in the first place, said Ashish Basil, of Ernst & Young. The best outcome for all parties may simply be that that the auction fails.“New operators will not bid because this price doesn’t make sense, [and] the old operators may also not bid because it will establish a benchmark for when [license] renewals come in in 2014,” he said. “[If neither group] bids, then the auction fails. If it fails, then the government will have a defence for itself, to say that let’s have another auction at a lower price.”“But if they go for a first auction with a price lower than Trai’s they run the risk of creating challenges for themselves.”In the end, Bhatia said, the government needs to change its approach to the telecoms industry, which, at Trai’s recommended prices, could generate the government over $132bn in revenues over the next ten years.“In the long term, treating this sector as a cash cow should stop because… you have to treat this as something that is fundamental to the larger growth story,” he said.Related reading:

157;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-04-23T19:42:37Z;Corporate business units must own their own IT security risk;;The topic of IT security or cybersecurity, is front and center for most IT professionals and of growing importance to the boardroom and business managers.But many companies struggle with knowing how much is the ‘right amount’ to spend on IT security and how to avoid becoming the latest victim of a security breach.In the edited Q&A below, I discuss these and other issues with Jay Heiser, an IT security expert and research vice president at Gartner.Why do so many IT security efforts fail and whose fault is it when they do?There is no simple answer to this question, but consider this. Recently, a French life sciences company asked me how they could find the optimal balance between the money spent on IT security, the loss of flexibility entailed by security processes and technologies, and the seemingly insatiable legal demands to accommodate an open-ended set of regulations and data protection expectations.It turned out to be a classic case of the ‘hot potato of IT risk’. Nobody wants to deal with arcane risks involving information security, or privacy - they just want to dump unfunded responsibility into IT’s lap.The chief information officer in turn is stuck between the ‘rock’ of budget and the ‘hard place’ of being the security scapegoat, motivating a reduction in service and an increase in costs. No wonder then that business units are frustrated that IT is asking them to spend so much money, while reducing their flexibility.I have struggled to come up with a more apt word to describe what the missing link is, and I keep falling back on the somewhat hackneyed term ‘alignment’. IT, the line of business, corporate counsel, and other internal functions, are all motivated to seek different goals.Imagine an orchestra with no common music, or an American Football team without organised plays. Without agreement on pitch and tempo, harmony is unlikely. Without coordinated practice sessions, blocking and tackling will be ineffective. Unless all the members of an organisation are both motivated towards and directed to the same goal, they will be working at cross purposes.If one part of the enterprise is playing football, and the other part is playing a symphony, obscure needs like IT security are going to be early casualties.Does it really make sense for business units to make decisions about IT security?I don’t know that any child anywhere in the world actually plays a game called ‘hot potato,’ but the underlying concept is widely understood, not just in the English speaking world, but throughout Europe.It represents the avoidance of responsibility, and long term corporate and government employees can become masters at lobbing hot potatoes of risk into the laps of other departments, without being very obvious about it. For whatever reason, the CIO often feels obligated to catch and hold this burning risk. While this is understandable in cultural terms, in business terms, it is non-optimal.If someone who benefits from an activity can push the risks off onto someone else, they will always choose to accept more risk than is appropriate for the organisation as a whole. The technical term for such a heads I win, tails you lose approach is ‘moral hazard,’ and it usually leads to unwanted failures and it can lead to endless rounds of blame.It’s the job of the coach, the conductor, or the chief executive in the business world to ensure that the entire team is playing in tune, which means aligning risks and benefits, and explicitly avoiding their separation into different parts of the organisation.Obviously, business managers are usually not experts in information technology, let alone on the arcana of security vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and protective technology.However, it is more than reasonable to expect anyone with profit and loss responsibility to be able to explain how important their department’s information, and information-based processes, are to the overall success of the business.Business managers cannot be expected to determine the likelihood of extended downtime, database integrity failure, or sophisticated security attacks. They can be expected to estimate the impact if a failure did occur, and to state their relative needs for protection, control, or reliability.Ultimately, it shouldn’t be up to a security manager to decide whether or not to undertake a business activity - that’s a business decision. With a practical level of understanding of the security ramifications, the business manager should be making the decisions on what risks to accept, and avoid.What practical steps are necessary to change a company’s IT security culture?Gartner is observing a steady increase in the number of organisations, including commercial entities and national government bureaus, that have instituted a policy in which business managers formally accept some or all of the risks related to their department’s use of information. Two major success factors are common in every case.First is a top down mandate, from the CEO and ideally the board of directors, setting this as an organisational policy that all business managers are expected to follow. Without this executive level support, it is very difficult for the CIO to ask business managers to formally sign up to acceptance of IT-related risks, and to expect those managers to take the risks seriously.This idea is usually not difficult to sell to the executive suite - they recognise it as a mechanism to improve business decisions.Second, organisations need a simple framework that the business manager can practically apply to state their specific business requirements for the maintenance of data confidentiality, data integrity, and service availability.While it has always been common computer security wisdom that data must be classified, most historical schemes have been based on military practice, resulting in impractically complex schemes characterised by 4 or 5 confusing and arbitrarily named levels.A growing number of organisations are using a simplified 3-level approach of low, moderate, and high sensitivity. The CIO, the chief information security officer (CISO), and representatives from the lines of business must work together to create a framework that makes it easy for the business manager to state whether a security incident would result in a low, medium, or high impact on that business area.When these two ingredients are in place, it becomes practical for the line of business to start accepting accountability for their own digital activities.When business leaders are routinely asked to use a standardised scale to estimate the protective requirements of their data and applications, and they are asked to formally sign risk acceptance agreements before their employees can use new services, it begins to change the way they think about IT risks.Over a period of several years, it results in a cultural change in which the lines of business and IT are all working in something that looks increasingly like synchronisation, optimising IT security decisions instead of avoiding them.Is this sychronised approach to IT security something that most organisations can achieve in the short-term?Although some enterprises have been working on this concept for a decade, some of the best practices are still evolving, and it is likely a transition that no organisation ever truly completes. From the business’ point of view, buying a level of security protection will remain a somewhat abstract exercise until the IT community comes up with more concrete ideas on what constitutes security levels of service (SLA).But progress is being made in simplifying classification schemes and in presenting levels of security benefit. Asking the business manager to undertake some responsibility for the implications of their digital business activities turns out to be a less abstract, and far less contentious, exercise than just assuming that the CISO or an auditor can second guess the business impact of an IT vulnerability.Organisations that reorient themselves around business risk ownership stop fighting over the security budget, and they start making more precise risk benefit tradeoffs. They avoid moral hazard scenarios, and they avoid the opportunity cost of unnecessarily conservative IT risk decisions. It may not be perfect harmony, but it represents a practical approach that is being used by a growing number of organisations.Jay Heiser is a research vice president at Gartner. He will present on this topic at the Gartner Security & Risk Management Summit near Washington, D.C., 11-14 June 2012.
158;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-04-23T14:22:14Z;Ambanis: telco reconciliation on hold;;"Reports of a reconciliation – or even a business deal – between the Ambani brothers may have been premature.It was only six months ago that reports circulated that Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani might lease telecoms tower space from the struggling company owned by his estranged younger brother, Anil. The news was greeted as evidence that tensions were cooling between India’s most powerful siblings. But perhaps not.The Economic Times reported on Monday that Mukesh Ambani’s Infotel Broadband Services – through which he plans to launch a 4G data network – plans to spend $8bn – $9bn on the launch, including the construction of over 100,000 carbon fibre towers in the next three years. Which would scrap the need for any deal with Anil’s Reliance Communications.A Reliance spokesman could not comment in time for publication.The report isn’t good news for Anil, who has been struggling to shore up RCom’s roughly $7bn in debt by any means necessary.In November, it seemed as if the elder brother was on the brink of leasing 26,000 towers from the younger’s Reliance Infratel. If Mukesh goes ahead with plans to build his own nationwide tower infrastructure, that seems like a distant possibility indeed.But there is hope yet for Anil. Kamlesh Bhatia, research director for telecoms at Gartner, said it would make little business sense for Mukesh to build his own tower infrastructure when there was already so much out there waiting to be leased.“I can’t think why anyone would build a tower asset at this point in time when there is a lot of capacity up for sale in the form of tenancy with existing companies,” he said. “It would take a lot of time and it would also mean that there will be a significant capital outflow; I think it is a difficult thing to imagine at this point.”Which, perhaps, makes an Ambani reconciliation a bit easier to imagine. But just a bit.Related reading:

159;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-04-20T15:00:47Z;Microsoft and Intel beat expectations;;After a tough 2011 of tablet competition and Thai floods, the PC industry is showing signs of life again, judging by this week’s earnings reports from leading tech companies.Microsoft said on Thursday that PC sales grew in the three months to the end of March – a big turnround from early in the year, when Gartner, the research firm, had expected a 1.2 per cent decline for the quarter.Intel, the dominant PC microprocessor maker, reported on Tuesday there was “softness” in the consumer PC segment in mature markets, but this was being offset by enterprise sales and strong demand in emerging markets.China passed the US last year as the world’s biggest PC market and the IHS iSuppli research firm predicted on Wednesday that it would grow 13 per cent in 2012.That should be helped by the Intel’s introduction of third-generation Core processors on Monday, which will be combined later this year with Windows 8, a new version of Microsoft’s operating system.Both Intel and Microsoft beat Wall Street expectations with their earnings and appeared more optimistic about the rest of the year. Intel said it was no longer feeling the effects of the Thai floods, which inundated factories making hard drives and hit PC production.One hard drive maker benefited the most from the shortages the disaster created. Seagate Technology saw prices of hard drives rise sharply as it was left unscathed while its main competitor Western Digital suffered factory closures due to flooding. Seagate reported this week it shipped 30 per cent more drives in the March quarter and its gross margins almost doubled to 37 per cent, compared with a year earlier.
160;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
161;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-04-18T09:04:11Z;ASML upbeat despite fall in profits;;ASML, the world’s largest maker by sales of equipment for manufacturing chips, suffered a 28 per cent fall in first-quarter profits as the chip industry returned to more normal levels after two exceptional years of growth.However, the Dutch company gave an upbeat outlook saying that demand for logic chips used in smartphones, tablets and lightweight computers would continue to drive strong demand for its machinery.“Logic chips go straight into the things that are currently very hot and that is everything that has to do with mobile, media and the internet, so you have to think about smartphones, tablets. That is driving this market, that is very visible,” said Peter Wennink, chief financial officer.Eric Meurice, chief executive, said mobile devices would continue to drive demand for the next six to nine months.“We see sales stability at current first-quarter levels for the next two quarters with clear indications that the logic segment will continue its strong demand trend for the remainder of the year,” he said.ASML produces the lithography machines that are used to make silicon chips, and is seen as a bellwether for the technology sector. Foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor, and integrated device manufacturers, such as Intel and Apple, are some of the company’s key customers.In 2010 and 2011 the company produced record results as the technology industry scrambled to increase production following a slump in 2009. The 2012 performance reflects a more subdued market for technology overall. This month Gartner said it expected global IT spending to grow just 2.5 per cent to $3.7tn this year, down from previous forecasts of 3.7 per cent as public spending cuts, the eurozone crisis and a strong dollar take their toll.On Tuesday Intel reported flat revenues and slower demand from consumers in mature markets, sending its shares 2.1 per cent lower in morning trading in the US.Sales at ASML for the three months to the beginning of April were €1.25bn, down nearly 14 per cent from the same period last year, and net profit fell to €282m from €395m. However, the figures came in ahead of analysts’ estimates and the company reiterated forecasts for sales of about €2.4bn in the first half.A number of companies in the semiconductor sector are indicating that the second half will be strong. Intel is expecting a pick-up in sales as it brings out a PC processor for a crop of very thin laptop computers known as ultrabooks. TSMC, Samsung and Hynix have all also signalled that they will increase investments this year as they compete for a slice of the market for mobile phone chips.Shares in ASML, which are at their highest level for twelve years, fell 2.7 per cent to €36.89 as some investors took profits on the back of the results.
162;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-04-17T06:13:07Z;Notion to raise $150m cloud-focused fund;;Notion Capital of the UK is close to raising $150m for a new fund to invest in cloud-based technology companies, one of very few European technology-focused venture capital firms to have been able to attract investment in the last year.The fund will be worth $100m at its first close on Tuesday and the company expects it to total $150m at the final close in a few month’s time.The investment fund is three times the size of Notion’s first fund, which was set up in 2009, mainly with the money the venture capital company’s two founders had received from the sale of their online email security company, MessageLabs, for $700m in 2008.This time, a number of rich individuals and investment offices for wealthy families have been keen to put some of their money under the management of Notion, which specialises in investing in companies that are using the internet to deliver software to business users.Cloud computing is seen as a fast-growing market as businesses shift from buying and installing software on their own servers to renting it over the internet. By 2014, Gartner estimates that the cloud computing marketplace will reach $148bn while Cisco Analytics predicts that more than 50 per cent of all business workloads will be processed over the internet.“People really get the tremendous opportunity in cloud computing and we have specialist knowledge in that area,” said Jos White, co-founder of Notion Capital. “All IT-focused VCs are looking at cloud as one of their key themes but the edge we have is that we built a large software-as-a-service company and took it to a profitable exit in Europe.”He added that investors were attracted by the fact that the Notion founders would once again invest their own money, with 10 per cent of the fund coming from their own pockets.European venture capital companies have, in general, found it hard to raise funds in recent times. Since 2000, European VC fundraising has fallen around 90 per cent, with just €811m raised in 2010, compared with €8.6bn in 2000, according to the European Venture Capital Association. In uncertain times investors are reluctant to tie up their cash in venture capital investments which can take a decade or more to provide a return. European technology funds are also widely seen as producing poor returns.Index Ventures recently raised a €150m life sciences fund with GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson, but there have been very few funds focused purely on technology.Notion’s first fund invested in companies such as Brightpearl, eSellerPro, NewVoiceMedia, Star and Tradeshift. There have been no big exits yet, but Star, for example, now has revenues of $80m and is profitable, while two-year-old Tradeshift was valued at $137m in a recent fundraising round.The first investments from the second fund are expected to be made next month.
163;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-04-16T18:40:52Z;Executives plan to increase IT investment;;"More than two-thirds of the chief executives in charge of large companies with $500m or more in annual revenues plan to increase their IT investments this year to drive growth, despite their concerns about the uncertain economic outlook, according to survey results published Monday by Gartner, the IT research and consultancy firm.The research findings also highlight the gap between what chief executives expect from their IT investments and the relatively low expectations they have for their company IT chiefs, who are rarely viewed as important strategic advisers and are generally not expected to become business leaders.That disconnection prompts a warning from Jorge Lopez, vice-president and distinguished analyst at Gartner. “CEOs should re-examine the role the CIO plays today in business innovation and strategy,” said Mr Lopez. “As the information age progresses, the risk of being blindsided by new forms of digital competition is rising.”The report, CEO Survey 2012: The Year of Living Hesitantly, is based on the responses of more than 220 CEOs and was conducted in November and December last year. It reveals that although concerns are less severe in Asia-Pacific and North America than in Europe and Africa, there is a strong belief among CEOs in all three geographic regions that an economic downturn will impact their companies in 2012.“Costs are now the second biggest priority area, the highest ranking in our surveys since 2009,” said Mark Raskino, vice-president and fellow at Gartner. “Yet CEOs seem determined to maintain a growth posture as the number one priority for now, and geographic expansion is the primary growth approach.”To help achieve their aims, chief executives are turning to new technologies while continuing to invest in older staples like customer relationship management (CRM). “The intention to invest in technology is comparatively healthy,” said Mr Lopez.“The newer trends, such as mobile and cloud, are rising to the foreground of CEOs’ attention. However, customer relationship management remains CEOs’ favourite IT capability, because marketing is a never-ending competitive quest for customer retention.”Gartner analysts caution however that, as many business leaders learnt the hard way in the 1990s and 2000s, simply buying and installing technology does not guarantee results unless it is carefully directed and delivered in conjunction with co-ordinated changes to policies, processes, organisation, roles and culture.“More purposeful, structured innovation management could be one way to make technology investments pay off,” Mr Raskino said. “We see strong CEO intention toward improving it in most sectors, but not in financial services – where, perhaps, regulatory compliance is simply overwhelming all other strategic change thinking.”Among the other survey findings, 90 per cent of business leaders can name a company they admire for its use of IT to help gain a competitive advantage, but when restricted to their own industry, a quarter cannot. Apple easily eclipsed rivals as the most admired company for its use of IT accounting for 39 per cent of the votes. Google was second with 11 per cent share, followed by Amazon at 5.8 per cent.The survey results show that CEOs are advancing innovation management, but many face a digital business strategy gap. This year, Gartner probed investment attitudes toward innovation management and leadership attribution. Overall, innovation management is advancing, with few CEOs cutting innovation, and approximately half the CEOs saying they are investing more. However, a quarter indicated that they still don’t address it as an explicit discipline.When Gartner asked who leads innovation in their firms, approximately one-third of the CEOs selected themselves. After that, a wide variety of executive and senior management leaders were named; however, chief information officers were rarely identified, and chief financial officers were never identified.“Any CEO who believes that he or she is the innovation leader of the firm must retain a close direct working relationship with the CIO in this age of rapid business digitisation, or risk being blindsided,” Mr Lopez said. “CIOs must improve IT-related competitor intelligence, and use that information to build a productive relationship with the person the CEO sees as the leader of innovation.”Most chief executives know what new information they need now and in the future, so their chief information officers must keep pace, say the Gartner analysts. In the survey, Gartner asked the question: “If there was one additional piece of information you could use, what would it be?” Most respondents cited customer and sales information or competitor information.Gartner also asked CEOs what new kinds of information will disrupt their industries during the next five years. About half the CEOs could not give a good answer; however, the other half provided a wide range of ideas, demonstrating that thinking about the new kinds of information that technology will make available is a potential source of competitive advantage between firms.“CIOs and CEOs should discuss with each other what new information would help them manage the business better through uncertain economic times,” Mr. Raskino said. “We know most companies have weak management formalism over information strategy and governance; however, information variety, complexity and volume are rising exponentially.“Muddling through without discipline will soon start to leave major companies vulnerable to new entrant competition. CIOs should spearhead the development of an information strategy for their firms, concentrating, in particular, on new kinds of information that might lead to industry disruptions and transformations.”The survey results also showed most chief executives still regard their CIOs as”itinerant specialists” rather than valuable strategic advisers. The role needs development attention, says Gartner. The chief financial officer was cited most often as the most important strategy adviser to the CEO, while CIOs were rarely mentioned.In an age of such digital disruption to business, and while six of the world’s 10 most powerful brands are technology firms, many CIO roles remain underinvested. Most CEOs thought the best next step for their CIOs would be to do the same job in the same industry or in another industry. Few thought they would move on to a business leadership role."
164;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-04-10T22:38:02Z;Tablets bigger than expected – Gartner, Toshiba;;Gartner upped its 2012 worldwide tablet sales forecast on Tuesday to 119m units, from the 103m it predicted last September and almost double its final figures for 2011 of 60m units.The research firm predicted Apple would still dominate with a 61 per cent market share, with Android taking 32 per cent. Toshiba will hope to have some of the latter share, with three new Excite tablets announced on Tuesday, including a supersized 13.3in version.The Excite is becoming Toshiba’s mainstream tablet brand – its earlier Thrive tablet won fans among an older, heavily male niche audience that liked its abundance of full-sized ports.The Excite LE was billed as the world’s thinnest 10in tablet when released last month – it is 0.3 in (7.7mm) thin and weighs just 1.18lbs (535g), costing $530 for a 16Gb version.The LE is a luxury edition and the slightly thicker and heavier Excite 10, just announced and going on sale in May, is a more reasonable $450 in the US for a 16Gb version. It weighs just 1.32lbs and features a more powerful Tegra 3 quad-core processor, Android 4.0, an HD front camera and 5Mp rear camera. There are USB and HDMI ports as well as an SD memory card slot.The striking feature of the Excite 7.7 is the use of a vivid AMOLED display technology for its 7.7in screen and, combined with the Tegra 3, Toshiba is pitching this as an ultimate gaming tablet, as well as being great for watching movies. The screen makes it a little pricier at $500 for a 16Gb model from June.I was most impressed, during a demo of all three, with the Excite 13 (pictured) and its huge-by-tablet-standards 13.3in screen, with a 16:9 aspect ratio. This will come with a stand included and seems aimed more at home use – I can imagine it on a kitchen counter or a coffee table for watching videos or playing two-player games. Web browsing will be aided by the 1600×900 resolution, more emails will be viewable on a page and magazines and newspapers will look much better at this size. Toshiba execs said apps they tested looked fine at this larger size. The screen size does carry something of a premium – at $650 for a 32Gb model and $750 for a 64Gb one – available from June.Toshiba says its research shows one size does not fit all when it comes to tablets. It is not quite offering the range of screen sizes that Samsung currently provides, but the largest of its new models will be the first among the major manufacturers to crack the 13in barrier.
165;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-03-29T09:23:19Z;Skilled IT leaders still in demand;Changes in how companies do business are creating a new breed of ‘CIO’;IT spending might have softened, but skilled IT leaders are still in demand. According to Gartner, the research company, global spending is below its peak but still finished last year higher than in 2010.Spending on technology is being bolstered in various ways. There is pent up demand, following cuts to IT budgets in 2008 and 2009. Companies are embracing new technologies, from advanced data analysis tools, to iPads. And businesses are looking to technology to help them cut costs – for example by using videoconferencing instead of air travel.As a result, the most able IT leaders are in demand. According to David Elton, an IT sourcing specialist at PA Consulting, there is a “cadre of people who are in demand, and who move relatively seamlessly from company to company, perhaps as often as every two to three years”.These chief information officers, and the chief technology officers and IT directors who report to them, are playing an increasingly critical role in business strategy, even where the CIO is not a full board member. “The reason these CIOs are in demand is they have the right mix of experience,” suggests Mr Elton.Demand is also being spurred on by longer-term changes in the way companies do business. More are selling goods online and social media is of growing importance when it comes to dealing with customers. Some CIOs are finding their jobs upgraded to that of chief operating officer, but senior managers with strong IT skills are also finding roles in fields such as marketing and distribution.“Technology is aligned to changes in consumer behaviour and boards realise that technology is about making sure the company engages with customers,” says James Hallahan, at executive recruiter, Harvey Nash.“There has been a massive change in what clients are looking for in technology leaders over the past five years.” The focus, he says, is now as much on “emotional intelligence” as a deep knowledge of IT.At the highest levels, good CIOs with these skills command basic salaries of £200,000 and more in a multinational company.Further down the ladder, however, the outlook is mixed. IT organisations in particular have seen a “hollowing out” of their structures, with layers of middle management removed. And at the more junior levels, IT jobs have either been outsourced to vendors and consultants, moved to off-shore providers, or simply replaced by simpler technology and automation.“We’ve seen a consolidation, not only of hardware and technical functions, but of jobs around all of this, and so a decrease in numbers of workers,” says Clive Longbottom, service director of IT analysts Quocirca.“And there is a split between those who can advise on what technology is best for a business, and those who have a deep understanding of technology itself.” The latter group, he says, are now more likely to find employment in the IT industry, or in consulting and systems integration firms.This trend, though, has not yet affected the earnings and prospects of the most senior IT managers. But it is affecting the skills they need to demonstrate. In some areas – such as information security and information analytics – advanced technical skills are required. But for other IT managers, employers are now looking more for skills in communication, project management, and handling an ever more diverse range of IT suppliers.“We sometimes struggle to find people who have an understanding of the business, and how to apply their technical skills in the business world,” says Julie Berry, CIO at Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, a London-based law firm. Her team uses psychometric testing and examination of candidates’ CVs to find the right recruits – with a focus on the manager’s track record in delivering IT projects.This shift reflects the trend both for boards to look for a quicker return on investment from IT, and from a greater use of outsourcing.Evidence of the pace of change comes both from recruiters and the IT industry itself. Harvey Nash’s research shows that five years ago, three of the four “hard to find” skills among senior IT executives were classed as technical. Now, they are business and strategic, with high-level business analysis skills in the shortest supply of all.The situation is likely to worsen, suggests Harvey Koeppel, executive director of the Center for CIO Leadership, an independent industry body. “There is a growing gap between the demand for IT professionals at all levels and the supply of new talent coming into the industry,” he warns. “The gap is being fuelled by the numbers of baby boomers who are retiring versus the number of entry level personnel entering the profession.” Enrolment in computer science courses is down in both the US and Europe.In the short term, some organisations are plugging the gap by relying more heavily on consultants and contractors. But this can be expensive, and does not always provide the hands-on technology leadership businesses need to improve operations.Whether the CIO is on the board, or reporting to the chief operating officer or chief finance officer, senior IT staff are increasingly involved with developing new products and services and bringing them to market – and not just for digital channels.“Senior IT staff are helping the business to be more agile. But they also have to be the ‘trusted adviser’ to the business on technology,” says James Hallahan at Harvey Nash.But finding the combination of “visionary CIO” with the need to maintain day-to-day operations and control costs means drawing from an even smaller talent pool. Some businesses are responding by bringing non-IT managers into senior IT posts, and encouraging more movement between business and IT, for example through multi-disciplined project teams. Companies are also drawing senior IT staff from consulting firms, because of their broader experience.Another trend, says IBM’s Mr Koeppel, is for companies to hire or promote more female executives in what is often still a male preserve – despite the fact that the leaders of both IBM and Hewlett-Packard are now women.“We are seeing more women in key management and executive leadership positions within IT and across the C-suite,” he says. “Trends in this area for women appear positive, but slow moving.”
166;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-03-26T15:54:45Z;Beware the threat within;;Speaking in Springfield, Illinois in January 1838, Abraham Lincoln told his audience that the greatest threat to America came not from overseas, but from the enemy within.“At what point, then, is the approach of danger to be expected?” asked the President. “I answer, if it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher.”The same might be said to be true about IT security. While most companies pay close attention to the external threats posed by hackers, cybercriminals and the like, they sometimes overlook that often the most dangerous threats come from inside their own firewalls.I asked Andrew Walls, research director at Gartner, about the challenges posed to organisations by the threat of internal breaches of security by employees. Below is an edited version of his comments.We often think of IT security teams preventing external sources from gaining unauthorised access into an organisation, but are there potential internal threats too?Absolutely, and it’s really difficult for IT security teams to anticipate, detect, prevent and contain “friendly fire” by employees that could damage the organisation. This problem exists because employees need access to corporate information, systems and facilities to do their jobs. But this level of access also means they could potentially harm the organisation as they go about their daily tasks. As a result, it can be really difficult for your IT security team to detect inappropriate behavior. To make matters worse, business processes and computer systems are becoming more complex, so it is increasingly difficult to determine if an employee’s activity is good or bad. Put simply, complexity is the enemy of security.IT systems are also myopic. They only control what they can see and only if they are told how to control an activity. Not so long ago, the only way most employees could get access to networked communication was through corporate infrastructure. Now, most employees have at least two Internet-capable devices of their own (e.g. smartphone and home computer) that access the Internet without corporate oversight. The migration of work processes into the cloud and other environments accessed anytime/anywhere means that the shortcuts and breaches can take place “out there” rather than on internal systems.What can organisations do to decrease the probability of an insider attacks and decrease the impact of those attacks if and when they occur?There’s no quick fix or simple security strategy because it requires both technical and nontechnical controls. Technical controls focus on data and computer activities, while nontechnical controls focus on human motivations and behavior. Nontechnical controls are critical because many insider attacks do not depend on technology. Theft of documents, photocopying confidential data and voice communications can all be used to damage an organisation. Some nontechnical controls are very effective, however.Security awareness programs raise the overall level of employee security consciousness, and help to create a culture in which everyone is aware of security threats and the risks they represent. For greatest impact, organisations need to operate their awareness program as an advertising campaign that integrates traditional training with just-in-time guidance delivered over a variety of media, including social media.Social psychology is also very useful. Humans unconsciously and consciously behave in a more secure fashion when the right stimuli are provided. Overt monitoring of activities and creating work environments that are designed to promote transparency stimulate greater compliance with the expectations of the organisation.What specific actions should managers take regarding security?Managers should force transparency within their organisations. Job rotation, segregation of duties, mandatory vacations, regular audits/reviews, periodic employee background checks, and prohibitions against personnel who are working on sensitive applications or in sensitive areas from carrying portable storage and other devices can all inhibit and expose illicit behavior.A corporate culture that values self-policing and mutual oversight with clear rewards for detection of inappropriate practices integrates security control directly into the employee population. Keep in mind that a single illicit action by an executive that goes unpunished will destroy employee support for security.What about technical controls?Technical controls can be extremely effective at detecting and preventing illicit behavior as long as the controls know what to look for. New data loss protection (DLP) systems are content and context-aware and perform deep content inspection using sophisticated detection techniques that extend beyond simple keyword matching. As more business data moves to the cloud, DLP as a service has emerged.Fraud detection tools identify illicit behavior by comparing user actions to a baseline of acceptable behavior. This technology is widely used in the financial services industry, with credit-issuing companies often employing neural networks to analyse an individual’s transactions.Security information and event management (SIEM) solutions collect, collate and analyse information from sources throughout the enterprise to develop an accurate picture of activities and detect malfeasance. Monitoring solutions track user behavior inside and outside — such as on Facebook — to identify issues.What else should organisations do to improve security from internal threats?It’s critical that managers control access. Providing the right access to the right person at the right time is a critical capability for all IT environments.But nothing is 100 per cent guaranteed to safeguard all of your assets. Preventing ‘friendly fire’ requires constant vigilance and a dynamic approach to technical and nontechnical tools. Humans are both the source of the problem and the solution. As a result, business and technology managers must work together to maintain an effective, integrated approach to motivating correct behavior and catching people when they break the rules.Andrew Walls is a research director at Gartner. He will discuss IT security at the Gartner Security and Risk Management Summit in Washington, DC June 11-14.
167;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-03-25T15:22:40Z;China’s low-end phone makers squeezed;Smartphone increase leads to shake-out;In a factory compound called “Silicon Valley Power” in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, one of the white-tiled buildings is locked. Until last year, it was home to a mobile phone assembly line. “They closed down and sent the workers home,” says a guard.In Shenzhen, the epicentre of the global handset industry, such closures are quite common these days. Chinese consumers’ love affair with smartphones, with their internet access and superior functionality, is wreaking havoc with white-label makers, the thousands of small companies that have been providing less affluent Chinese consumers with low-end phones.Some churn out cheap copies of the latest branded phones but others create new products tailor-made for the needs and tastes of Chinese migrant workers, small town merchants and peasants, such as phones studded with fake crystals and handsets with extra strong speakers and long battery life that allow workers to listen to the radio on a noisy construction site. Their products come unbranded or under little known brands and at a fraction of the price of a Nokia phone.Companies producing these mobile phones accounted for about half of the Chinese handset market in 2010, but now they are struggling. Gartner, the research firm, estimates that white-label handset sales dropped 7 per cent in 2011 to 186m units, or 42 per cent of all mobile phones sold in China, and will plummet another 30 per cent this year.One reason is the rollout of 3G mobile services in China, which means consumers want to use their phones to access the internet. Operators are also subsidising smartphones and marketing them in small town China, where white-label handsets used to rule.“Consumers are becoming more sophisticated – they are learning to demand quality, and they are becoming brand conscious,” says Sandy Shen, head of consumer research at Gartner in Shanghai.Hundreds of white-label handset manufacturers have closed down as a result. But for some, the shakeout is an opportunity.Next door to the shuttered factory at Silicon Valley Power, SOP Group, a mid-size Chinese handset maker, is expanding. “We are investing big in quality control,” says Mei Saichun, the company’s general manager, pointing to machines that bake, steam, smash and scratch his phones to test resilience. SOP manufactures about 300,000 handsets a month, and about half of them are now smartphones.Companies such as K-Touch, Gionee, Coolpad, Meizu, Oppo and Bubugao are also quietly building their brands, forming a new breed still unnoticed in developed markets where Huawei, the telecom equipment maker, is making a splash by pushing into the consumer market.Life for the second-tier handset makers is not easy. The price gap between them and the global brands in smartphones is much smaller than it was between a global brand phone and a low-end feature phone in the past due to operator subsidies.The phone companies also find it harder to differentiate themselves. “Smartphones look much more similar to one another – a big touch screen, a small size range, few keys, few colours,” says Su Feng, vice-president at Coolpad.The companies respond with different strategies. Some target niche markets. Oppo and Bubugao, two companies in the industrial town of Dongguan not far from Shenzhen, have successfully positioned themselves as phone brands for women. Coolpad, meanwhile, cooperates closely with mobile operators.Meizu, a home-grown answer to Apple in Zhuhai, across the Pearl River from Shenzhen, runs its own app store. “What makes us different in the eyes of our customers are applications, not hardware features,” says Hua Hailiang, the company’s sales head. Meizu’s app store hit 100m downloads last week – just a fraction of Apple’s 25bn worldwide, but a source of pride for the Chinese firm.Another area for growth are overseas markets less developed than China. SOP now exports about one-third of its handsets through offices in Indonesia, India and Ghana.“The fact that some markets in South Asia and Africa still lack 3G, many consumers there cannot read and they just can’t afford smartphones means their demand will remain focused on feature phones for another two or three years,” says Adam Chen, head of the group’s export unit.Despite the challenges, the fast-growing smartphone market should offer room for Chinese second-tier brands. IDC forecast last week that China will overtake the US as the world’s largest smartphone market this year, and that India and Brazil will rise into the top five markets by 2016. The research firm added: “To realise the full potential of emerging markets, smartphone vendors need to develop low-cost smartphones that provide a full, robust experience.”
168;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-03-23T23:41:51Z;Spotify seeks funds using $4bn valuation;;Spotify is seeking to raise money from private investors in a deal that would put a valuation of as much as $4bn on the fast-growing online music service, according to people familiar with its plans.The ambitious goal would mark a big leap from the $1.1bn valuation it was accorded last summer, when it raised money to back its long-awaited launch in the US.If the company hits its target, it would exceed the $3.3bn that Warner Music was sold for last year and mark the strongest validation to date that investors believe a digital “streaming” business can top the music industry’s traditional revenue models.Most users listen to a free, advertising-supported version of Spotify, although some 3m pay a subscription for a premium service with extra features, for instance allowing them to listen on mobile devices.The rapid adoption of the service on Facebook, which made a feature of Spotify when introducing an upgrade to its own site last September, has boosted the confidence of the company in gaining a much higher valuation, according to one person familiar with the fundraising plan.According to one investor not involved with the company, Spotify is looking for “hundreds of millions of dollars” to build a financial war chest in preparation for future licensing negotiations with the music industry. The proposed deal would value the company in the range of $3.5bn-$4bn, according to two people. Spotify refused to comment on its plans.If the company is looking for money to pay licence fees rather than to back expansion in markets, it would mark “a troubling sign” for investors, said Mike McGuire, an analyst at Gartner. The lossmaking company has yet to prove that it can make profits from its existing business, he added.Music industry executives, some of whom were initially wary of Spotify, have been pleased with its success at converting consumers who try its service for free into paying subscribers. Several have also credited Spotify and other legal streaming services with halting the rise of file-sharing and other forms of piracy.Paul Smernicki, a Universal Music UK executive, this week told a conference it had found no evidence to suggest that Spotify cannibalised music sales. Before stepping down as chairman of Warner Music in January, Edgar Bronfman Jr said Spotify was “incrementally positive” to artists’ revenues. However, some artists including Adele and Coldplay, have limited the music they supply to Spotify out of concern about possible cannibalisation.Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson in New York
169;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-03-23T19:12:43Z;CFOs should partner with IT leaders in this post digital world;;Chief financial officers face a strategic choice today that could affect their career and their company. Digital technologies are rapidly evolving, converging and becoming C-suite friendly. Will CFOs view them as IT costs to manage or tools requiring a steep learning curve that’s best attempted in close partnership with their chief information officer?Two companies, FedEx and American Airlines, have benefitted because their CEOs famously learned that lesson. Fred Smith, FedEx chief executive, recognising that continuously improving logistics was essential, forged strategic partnerships with a series of IT leaders in his company, keeping digital innovation central to his business model.Robert Crandall, his counterpart at American Airlines, worked closely with his IT guru, Max Hooper, supporting him in the creation of their revolutionary reservation system, Sabre. The fact that reservations-only digital forms continue to try to challenge Sabre’s competitive edge is an early lesson in the importance of understanding the speed of digital disruption to an enterprise.“More IT organisations report to the CFO than to any other executive function or role,” noted Sara Peters, Enterprise Efficiency editor in chief, citing the 2011 Gartner FEI Technology Study. That’s unfortunate for many CIOs because, as Ms Peters reports, “Gartner found that CEOs generally have a higher opinion of the IT organisation than do CFOs, and top executives see IT as potentially having a bigger strategic impact on the business than do CFOs.”Worse yet: according to the Gartner study, “only 32 per cent of CFOs see the CIO as a strategic partner.”Yet CFOs who choose to work strategically with their IT leadership can secure faster adoption of four key post-digital tools that can make measurable business improvement. They are enhanced social collaboration ecosystems, analytics, mobility and the cloud.Core Logic, an early adopter of an enhanced social collaboration ecosystem, has already achieved greater efficiencies. Historically, when finance closed the books,the process involved sequential review and coordination between accounting, tax, business finance and other departments. Communication was traditionally by email and nobody had all the information at one time.CoreLogic implemented and adopted an enhanced collaboration site where involved parties could see and respond, in real time, to the same information. What used to take two to three days can now be completed in hours. Similarly, exception-based incidents and processes such as those arising out of an accounts payable or receivable issue can be resolved sooner and often better. Again, that’s because all internal departments can work simultaneously rather than giving input in a linear chain of events where no one can see all the relevant factors at once.To achieve an effective design of such collaborative systems, it is importantfor the CFO and the CIO to collaborate on creating it, rather than the CFO viewing them simply as expenditures to approve or deny. Such an approach requires deep learning and listening, yet the performance improvements can be significant. They include the capacity for collaborative forecasting, swifter issue resolution, more rapid and customer-centered innovation, and advance fraud tracking.A close alliance between the CFO and the CIO can also sidestep a main reason for many of the failures experienced by some of the early adopters of social tools for enterprise. That’s the lack of clear goals. Having the big picture of the firm’s needs, the CFO can set the objectives that become the criteria for the CIO to design the post-digital systems. In this way, each partner iteratively learns more about the constraints and opportunities they face as they co-create a strategic path of adoption.In addition to the enhanced collaboration capacity of the ecosystem we described earlier, other complementary, post-digital technologies are emerging. They, too, can generate performance improvements for the enterprise. They are location-based services, listening and signal capturing, and mobile content creation and delivery.For example, companies can now automatically tag and track people, products and even activities to create location-based efficiencies and innovation. Such tracking can lift much of the burden off globe trotting employees for recording taxes on travel expenditures. Location-based tracking can also support streamlining many operational, finance and promotional processes. It can also support real time analytics to predict how much to make and to deliver how, when and where.The CFO can be in the coveted place to make strategic recommendations that transcend “finance” when he or she can couple that location-based capacity with the ability to sense and respond to what customers, suppliers and employers are doing. Complex as the creation of such post-digital systems can be, the upside competitive opportunity makes it alluring to attempt to design, in partnership with an equally savvy IT leader.And we haven’t even suggested the further benefits of overlaying a mobile capacity to location-based listening and responding. With that full mobile capacity in place, firms could capture and share relevant data between customers, employers, suppliers and other participants in its post-digital ecosystem, optimally making that information available anywhere, any time, and on any device.The risk of not understanding the capacity of these digital tools is at least as great as the opportunities of knowing enough, in partnership with a strong CIO, to make smarter decisions for their best use.That leads to two key questions. Will it be the CEO or the CFO in your firm that takes the lead in closely planning digital tool usage with the CIO? Or, will someone on the top leadership team of a competing firm figure out first that a key to achieving their objectives is cultivating a close, mutual learning and planning relationship with the IT leader?Eric Openshaw is the vice chairman and US Technology, Media & Telecommunications leader at Deloitte.Rich Rorem is a principal with Deloitte Consulting and the US Finance Transformation leader.
170;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-03-11T16:05:38Z;NTT Data plans more European M&A;;NTT Data, Japan’s largest IT services company, is planning a series of acquisitions in Europe as it seeks to triple the size of its overseas business in the next two years.The company, which has 57,000 employees around the world, has acquired Cirquent in Germany, Value Team in Italy, and Keane and Intelligroup in the US over the past four years in order to create an overseas unit.“At the moment, we are number seven in the Gartner rankings of IT services companies but we have a clear ambition to be among the top five,” said Thomas Balgheim, chief executive of the NTT Data overseas business.“We are looking for a string of pearls of acquisitions of small and medium-sized companies to grow our geographic coverage.”NTT Data made just over Y100bn (£774.6m) from its overseas business last year but wants to increase this threefold to Y300bn by 2013.Acquisitions will make up a large part of the growth and Mr Balgheim said the company would be in a position to do deals by the end of the year.Overall, the company had revenues of Y1.139tn yen in 2011 with the vast majority coming from Japan.However, Japanese IT spending has stagnant for a number of years and the company has seen a gradual decline in its Japanese revenues.The company is hoping a revamped overseas business, which competes against companies such as Logica and Capgemini and which will be staffed by 6,500 employees, will help reignite growth.Investment bankers said a number of other Japanese technology companies, such as KDDI, NEC and Hitachi, were also looking at targets in Europe.NTT Data bought Munich-based Cirquent in 2008 and Value Team last April and is still working to consolidate all these acquisitions together.Mr Balgheim said the financial crisis in Europe, which has caused many customers to stop cut spending on IT services, would provide NTT Data with an opportunity to buy companies at lower prices.“If you have a long-term strategy, a crisis provides an opportunity rather than a threat,” Mr Balgheim said.He added that he was not worried about the faltering European economy affecting business.“At the end of the day, you don’t sell to geographies, you sell to customers,” Mr Balgheim said.NTT Data has a particular strength in the automotive sector, where it works with companies like BMW, Volkswagen and McLaren.With these companies, although some parts of the manufacturing process were carried out in Asia, theme headquarters were still in Europe – so it made sense for IT services providers to be in Europe to be close to their customers.The company has also won some pilot projects in new areas, such as a scheme for charging electric cars in Vienna.
171;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-03-08T19:54:46Z;To tweet, or not to tweet?;;When the web was first commercialised in the early 1990s, many companies struggled with the issue of whether or not to allow employees to access web content while at work. Most eventually concluded that it was both futile and counterproductive to limit access, although many also introduced company guidelines on the subject.Today companies face a similar dilemna over social media including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Foursquare. Simply writing a policy that stipulates how employees should or should not use social media is arguably not enough. Deciding what to cover in a social media policy involves a series of important decisions that should be driven by business considerations of risk and value, according to Carol Rozwell, vice president and distinguished analyst at Gartner.Below is an edited Q&A where I asked Ms Rozwell about some of the issues companies face when implementing and managing a social media program.Q. How does a vompany or organisation know when it needs a social media policy?Whether the organisation wants to hear it or not, employees are already using social media. That means every organisation needs an unambiguous, reasonable, defensible policy for social media that clearly articulates employees’ responsibilities and guides their actions.Q. How should a company go about constructing a meaningful social media policy?Most organisations have a code of conduct that specifies employees’ responsibilities in a variety of circumstances. The social media policy should be an extension of that code and should build on the rules describing how employees should conduct themselves in offline situations and in other online situations.It’s also important to be positive in the policy. I reviewed a social media policy recently that was written by people with good intentions but who were focused on reducing risk. Hence, the policy was quite clear on what the company’s employees should not do, but left many unanswered questions about what they should do.A well-written policy should:• Explain what actions employees should take on social media and why.• Be comprehensive in scope but concise enough to fit on one or two pages.• Remain consistent with the organisation’s culture and values.• Include references and links to other relevant policies, guidelines and educational materials.The social media policy defines the standards employees must adhere to while participating on the social Web. The policy should be supplemented by guidelines which explain recommended practices but which allow for some discretion in their interpretation and implementation. Using a combination of policy - which explains the “must do” - and guidelines - which explain the “nice to do” - allows the organisation to keep the policy concise but explore nuance and specific situations in a more lengthy companion guideline document.Q. So by writing a policy, is an organisation is effectively protecting itself against social risk?Just writing a policy does not protect the organisation. The policy needs to be augmented with an effective communication plan and well-design training. It’s also important to monitor adherence to the policy. This may be more important in some organizations than others. The policy is a living document which will need revision as the organisation learns about social media. It will also need revision as the organisation’s social media program evolves.Q. Is it neccesary to monitor whether the social media policy is being adhered to?Even with a well written policy and well educated employees, organisations need to monitor how social media are being used. In most cases, only an occasional spot check will be necessary. In other cases, industry regulations will demand a regular and more circumspect appraisal. The goal should be to guide proper usage, not dampen enthusiasm or personal expression, as long as it is consistent with the organisation’s established policies and guidelines. Social media is still evolving as a business communication channel so information on what works and what doesn’t changes rapidly.Employees should be encouraged to take action if they see postings that could create problems for the organisation. But that means they need to know who to notify when they spot something untoward and how to reach them. Social self-management and peer pressure are more effective in eliciting the desired behavior than any number of rules. Nonetheless, it is advisable to ask legal counsel what notifications employees must receive if their social media activities are monitored, since regulations vary from country to country.Q. What happens if the organisation finds that the social media policy has been contravened?Should significant activity be detected, the organisation must act fast. But first, the organisation needs to decide what of kind of action makes sense. That means someone, or a team, must be chartered with the responsibility to make the decision about what to do. Depending on the organisation, it might be the employee’s manager, a social media leader or the social media steering committee.Not all misuses of social media have the same impact, so it is important to keep the response in proportion to the action. For example, an individual who has a temporary lapse of judgment may only need a word from their manager. However, more damaging actions, such as the unauthorised discussion of client information or intellectual property, demand a stricter response. The key is to identify which response is appropriate for which actions, and to apply the rules consistently to all employees.It is also important to monitor social media looking for the upside. Social media program leaders need to make sure their organisation’s activities are having the desired impact and they should be scanning for best practices. Social media provides a marvelous opportunity to connect and converse. We are all still learning exactly what that means and how to derive the most value from these social interactions.Ms Rozwell will be discussing the best practices for addressing social media risk at the upcoming Gartner Portals, Content & Collaboration Summit in Orlando, Florida.
172;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-03-01T23:26:40Z;Spirent benefits from rise in Asian handsets;;Spirent had a nearly 10 per cent rise in profits in 2011, as an increasing number of Chinese and Korean handset manufacturers bought the company’s testing equipment to ensure that their new smartphone models worked properly.“We had very strong demand from Asia,” said Eric Hutchinson, chief financial officer. “Companies like Huawei, Samsung and LG are all big customers for us.”The UK-based company’s mobile-phone testing kits sell for about $1m a piece, and large handset manufacturers will order seven or eight as they rush to bring new models on to the market.“As things get more and more complicated, with moves to new generation phones and new feature sets, testing becomes a bigger requirement,” Mr Hutchinson said.Total smartphone sales in 2011 reached 472m units and accounted for 31 per cent of all mobile device sales, up 58 per cent on 2010, according to recent research from Gartner.These trends led Spirent’s pre-tax profits to rise to $123.3m from $112.2m the previous year, on revenues that rose 10 per cent to $528.2m.Spirent shares, which have gained nearly 20 per cent in value over the past six months, rose 7.7 per cent to 151.8p on Thursday.The growth was led by Crawley-based Spirent’s smartphone and GPS testing business, which accounts for a majority of revenues. However, the assurance testing business, which helps fixed-line telecoms operators such as AT&T and Verizon monitor their networks, is in decline. Sales in this division were down 5 per cent.“For parts of our business that are more exposed to prevailing consumer behaviour and government expenditure, such as systems and service assurance, there may be some impact on near-term growth rates,” Spirent warned.While the company is winning new work from fixed-line telecoms companies testing the networks in the data centres many of them are building for cloud computing, the transition from one business to the other is dragging revenues.Basic earnings per share rose 20 per cent to 14.18 US cents, and Spirent increased its total dividend for the year by 17 per cent to 2.93 cents.● FT CommentAs a leader in smartphone testing, Spirent is in a good position in a growing industry, and relationships with the likes of Samsung and LG, which flood the market with dozens of different phone models each year, are bound to be lucrative. The only drag on performance is the wireline business, which is likely to keep declining as struggling fixed-line telecoms operators put the brake on spending. There is some speculation that Spirent could sell off this slower division, although there have been no explicit comments on this from the company. Trading at around 17 times earnings estimates for 2012, the shares are at the higher end of the spectrum for the sector, but given Spirent’s exposure to a growing industry, this looks justified.
173;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-02-29T15:45:24Z;India’s 4G auction: people or profit?;;"Compared with the embarrassment of the 2008 Indian 2G spectrum auction – which resulted in a scam that is alleged to have deprived the government of $39bn – 2010’s 3G spectrum auction was a wild, lucrative success for the government and, notably, cleanly run.With his announcement on Wednesday that the government is intent on launching an auction of 4G spectrum sometime this year, telecoms minister Kapil Sibal seems to be hoping to for something along the lines of the latter, rather than the former.Sibal said that the government will also auction some of the spectrum it recovered after the Supreme Court revoked 122 licenses of 11 companies allocated during the ill-fated 2G auction. “[But] we don’t think that we are going to put all the spectrum for auction… The idea being that we should come up with enough spectrum to get reasonable price for ourselves,” he said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.But analysts told beyondbrics that if the government focuses solely on making money from the auction – as it did with 3G, which garnered the government around $15bn – it will squander a great opportunity to bridge India’s massive digital divide.“The challenge essentially with 3G is that the spectrum that was auctioned was extremely limited,” said Kalmesh Bhatia, research director for telecoms at Gartner. “The price [operators] paid for 3G pretty much killed the business case for providing affordable 3G services.”The UK’s Vodafone and Indian rivals Bharti Airtel and Reliance Communications paid between $1.8bn and $2.6bn for 3G spectrum.As the FT reported, Bharti criticised the auction process at the time. “The auction format and severe spectrum shortage along with ensuing policy uncertainty drove the prices beyond reasonable levels,” said Bharti. “As a result, we could not achieve our objective of a pan-India 3G footprint in this round.”Based on Sibal’s comments, the 4G price is likely to be quite high, which means India’s two largest carriers, Airtel and Vodafone, may be the only two companies with enough money to bid.But that doesn’t mean they will be the only telecoms providers with 4G facility: Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries acquired its own 4G spectrum through its purchase of the company Infotel in 2010, and has been making concrete moves toward a rollout, including striking a content-sharing deal with Disney’s Indian business. US chipmaker Qualcomm paid $1bn for broadband wireless licenses in four areas in 2010, while state-owned companies MTNL and BSNL were allocated spectrum.Such data services, and Internet access in general, remain the preserve of the urban rich in India. The country has only 5.1 internet users for every 100 people, compared with 39.2 for Brazil and 28.5 for China, according to 2009 data published by the World Economic Forum. Only a small minority of the country’s 900m mobile phone subscribers use data services.“Once 4G comes up for auction, I think the government needs to evaluate what they want out of 4G and need to make sure that the objective is not solely around getting the most returns from the auction,” Bhatia said.“Instead they should leave enough on the table for the operators to use 4G to enable the bigger change which is essentially around bridging the digital divide in India and making sure that there is higher broadband penetration,” he added.But Bhuvnesh Singh, head of equities research in India for Barclays Capital, said that if the government decided against maximising its returns, it would open itself up to accusations similar to those that led to the 2G scandal – that it was offering up the country’s resources at cut-rate prices.“I understand the concept, but then we go back to the same problems with the way that 2g spectrum was given away in 2007, which most believe was given quite cheaply – wouldn’t the same problems come up? How do you decide at what price is reasonable for 3 or 4g?” he said. “And why should government subsidise private industry?”“Let the market find its own feet, design the auction in a correct fashion,” he added, “and let the Bhartis and Reliances of the world fight it out to see who can give the best returns to the government and best returns to the consumer.”Related reading:

174;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-02-28T21:12:00Z;The future of unwired business;;There is a lot of excitement surrounding the next generation of mobile devices on display at this year’s Mobile World Congress, currently being held in Barcelona. Smartphones are getting smarter and more powerful every day, and their popularity is changing the way we work.Today, employees bring their own mobile devices to the workplace and expect to use them for office applications. Similarly, they expect to use social media applications like Twitter and Facebook. This is driving business to adapt. The so-called “consumerisation of IT” is borne out by the adoption of social media by businesses and the plethora of mobile devices (tablets/ iPhones/Androids/etc.) seen today in the enterprise. This is a stark contrast to previous times when corporate information technology departments determines what technologies – such as the PC – became popular.This consumerisation will only increase in the future. According to Gartner, 75 per cent of new business applications will use social media capabilities by 2013. And a lot of it will be through mobile devices.Few technologies have unleashed the remarkable global change that mobile telephones have in such a short time.Today there are almost 6bn mobile devices on the planet, more than one per adult across the globe, according to the International Telecommunications Union. Mobile broadband subscriptions have grown by 45 per cent annually over the last four years. Global penetration of mobile devices is a whopping 87 per cent (with 79 per cent for the developing world).It is not uncommon to see slum dwellers in India – or, for that matter, poor people anywhere – sporting mobile phones. Why? Mobile phones have become a cornerstone of global economic development. Studies have shown that introducing 10 new mobile telephones per 100 people in the developing world can add between one half to one percent to a country’s GDP growth rate.For instance, fishermen in remote villages in Bangladesh can find better prices for their catch by calling around on $20 mobile phones rather than having to travel to the nearest market and hoping for the best.In the UK, a new breed of small businesses has been nicknamed “the TOTs” (Twelve-months-old, Optimistic, and Technologically-minded). These businesses are growing faster than average start-ups and are increasing their revenues speedily. One of the TOTs’ not-so-secret weapons is a heavy reliance on mobile technology.Similar stories abound, but I believe the real impact of mobile communications is yet to come. Today, the majority of mobile telephones are still basically talking devices—although the spread of smartphones globally is giving us a sense of what is possible.And that’s where the excitement is, that’s where the next wave of business opportunities will arise.As more services are getting added through software, new worlds are opening up. Think of Apple’s iPhone. While still called a phone, it’s a mobile software machine, enabling people to customize it through apps, and gather information and connect to others at any time.Software will transform mobile communications just as it transformed the PC and the computer industry. For the latter, software streamlined processes, improved efficiency, and enabled completely new business models. This led to remarkable prosperity, not only in the developed world but all across the globe.Fueled by the continual drop in semiconductor prices and displays, more people everywhere will have access to smart phones. Just as the $20 mobile device was inconceivable 10 years ago, we will soon see smart phones at price points we cannot envisage now.Within a few years mobile devices will take the place occupied by desktops. Already smartphones are outselling PCs.In the coming 2-4 years, managing enterprises through smartphones or tablets will become standard.We will see an explosion of applications in areas like mobile banking and healthcare. Take the case of Standard Bank in South Africa, which is bringing banking to tens of thousands of customers who previously had no access to banking. People in rural areas, where bank branches are few and far between, no longer have to travel to the branches but can do their banking through mobile phones. Standard Bank representatives can even open bank accounts for the unbanked through mobile phones by innovatively using a smart-phone’s capabilities such as its camera to capture images of identity documents.Across the world, more and more banks will replicate what Standard Bank is doing. Just as the automatic teller machine revolutionized the way people withdraw money from banks, mobile banking will revolutionize banking itself.Healthcare is another area where mobile technology can make a huge impact. Mobile sensors can monitor patient health and trigger intervention in case of problems, such as high blood pressure or high blood sugar. For doctors, tablets offer the possibility of pulling together various sources of healthcare data in real-time to make a proper diagnosis or prescribe the right medicine. Oncologists at the Charite hospital in Berlin are already making use of this capability to prescribe personal treatment plans with the best chance of success for cancer patients.Personally, the thing that I like most about mobile technology is that it removes barriers, promotes inclusiveness and opens opportunities for those who would otherwise not participate in the digital economy. It makes the world “flatter” through availability of information in real-time. It promotes democracy. Would last year’s Arab Spring have been possible without mobile phones connecting people and spreading the news rapidly?Mobile technology enables transparency, which in turn prevents risk, fosters accountability, spurs growth, unlocks creativity and empowers the individual. In developing countries, often the only way to participate in the digital economy is through mobile handsets.Mobile technology connects consumers and businesses in a way never experienced before, opening markets and creating better access in the emerging world.Most of the initial reviews surrounding the latest smartphones will focus on their streaming video capability and additional functionalities. However, it is worth remembering that our world will not get more productive or improve because we can watch videos on mobile phones. On the other hand, if we leverage mobile technology for things like better banking and healthcare, we can make a real difference.Jim Hagemann Snabe is co-CEO of business software maker SAP.
175;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-02-24T15:18:18Z;Software distribution: Have you checked the app store for your work tools?;Jessica Twentyman considers the prospects for corporate versions of Android Market;"For smartphone owners who want to learn Portuguese, count calories, look up train times or play Angry Birds in their leisure time, it is easy to download the software they need from an online app store.At work, however, it is a different story. While employees are increasingly encouraged to bring in their own smartphones or tablet computers, IT departments struggle to distribute the work-related tools they need, especially because the workforce inevitably has a variety of devices running different mobile operating systems.A self-service approach, based on the Apple or Google app store model, is the obvious answer, says Bob Tinker, chief executive of MobileIron, a specialist in mobile device management (MDM) software.The company’s portfolio of software to make mobile devices secure and help manage them includes the Enterprise App Storefront, which employees can visit to download both company-developed and third-party applications.This platform performs three main functions: it provides a “library” of apps for employees to select the tool they need; it applies rules governing who has access to specific applications; and it gives the IT team an inventory of apps in use by the workforce, enabling them to gauge the popularity of particular apps and identify “rogue” ones.“The same explosion of apps we saw in the consumer world is now happening in companies,” says Mr Tinker.Smart companies, he says, “treat users like adults and learn from the consumer world”, by giving them easy ways to find and download mobile apps, at the same time ensuring company rules on security and access are observed.MobileIron is not the only company promoting this concept.A recent survey of the market, by Michael King of Gartner, the IT research company, lists a number of others that offer enterprise app store platforms: AppCentral, Nukona and Partnerpedia are all specialists in this area.But, he adds, “vendors in this market are relatively small, with few employees or customers. Enterprises looking to make investments here should keep that in mind and insulate themselves against probable turmoil in the market, with one- to two-year contracts and contingency plans.”At KPMG CIO Advisory, part of the management consultancy firm, Mac Scott, an associate director is not convinced the investment and effort needed to set up an enterprise app store will be justified by demand at many companies.To succeed, he says, the stores will need to fulfil various criteria. “They’ll need to offer sufficient volume and diversity of applications – enough to interest all of the relevant communities in an organisation.The user experience – of both the store itself and of the apps on offer – will need to be of high quality. The organisation will need to empower users to select and use what they think they need,” he says.But above all, he says, the volume of traffic and the number of apps downloaded will need to offer the organisation true economies of scale in light of the investment required.These factors have not been obstacles for MobileIron customers such as Barclays and Mercedes-Benz, says Mr Tinker.Some customers already have more than 100 apps in their corporate stores; many have dozens. And in mature installations, users rate and recommend tools to their colleagues, in the same way consumers do on Android Market.At Thames River Capital, an asset management company, IT director Robert Cockerill is giving the idea serious consideration.“More and more employees are bringing in their own devices and it makes sense to me to offer them tools from a single place,” he says.This might be via remote access – the applications would run on Thames River Capital’s servers – or as downloadable apps, he says, but it is most likely to be a combination of the two through a storefront plat­form where their release can be managed and controlled.“We’re still some way off making any decision, but I’m pretty clear on our ultimate goal: it’s to be able to offer any employee, using any device, exactly the tool they need, when they need it,” he says."
176;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-02-24T15:18:18Z;Policies to protect: Persuading your employees you need control;A ‘device management’ strategy is, all-important, writes Alan Cane;Smart phones and tablet computers are already in widespread use in business. For example, some 14,000 employees of SAP, the software group, are using Apple iPads resulting in, the company says, improved efficiency.Often, the devices are the employee’s own. While the BlackBerry is still popular with IT departments because it is inherently secure, many employees are turning to Apple- and Android-powered phones.Research by Gartner, an IT market research company, suggests that in two years, nine out of 10 organisations will support corporate applications on personal devices.The arrival of intelligent mobile devices on this grand scale splits the business community.On one side are companies with good mobile device policies. On the other, all the rest are trying to work out the best thing to do.The advantages of mobile computing are clear, but there are serious and well founded anxieties about how to manage this plethora of new devices and what to do if they are lost or stolen.A “device management” strategy is, therefore, all-important. But what does the term imply?Neil Campbell, general manager of security, for Dimension Data, an IT services group says: “We mean control. We mean control of how and when mobile devices connect to the corporate network and what they are able to do when connected, typically based on who is using them at the time.”He says organisations cannot afford to ignore device management. Equally, they cannot afford to ignore the potential benefits of a mobile workforce with intelligent devices – those who do so will surely be left behind, both in business performance and in staff satisfaction levels.Device management software includes Afaria from Sybase, IronPort from Cisco and Good Technology. However, many companies may find it more economical to use a services company to provide security via the Cloud.Dan Rossner of PA Consulting suggests six principles for IT directors anxious to establish a device management programme.First: be proactive in putting forward a policy but listen to your staff. Second, look at actual rather than imagined risks. Third, develop a mobile policy as part of your IT strategy and ensure it is aligned with business strategy.Fourth, accept that decisions must be based on a sound business case.Fifth, consider establishing an enterprise app store – people are familiar with downloading apps for their personal use and IT departments could encourage staff to do so for business use. Six, establish a clear policy for employees who bring their own phones or tablets to work.This last point is crucial. Tim Patrick-Smith, chief technology officer at Getronics, an IT group, points out that employees have to agree to the company having the right, in circumstances such as loss or theft, to wipe data.“The two key [points] are registration and encryption” he says, pointing out that technology can easily automate the business of establishing what devices can connect to the network and security measures.Why must the procedure be automated? “You would need to create a whole new IT department if you had to check everybody’s device, and what software version was installed, manually,” Mr Patrick-Smith says.While the ability to wipe devices remotely can help address the dangers of data going astray if an employee and their device part company, Mr Patrick-Smith insists that all data on a device, or sent to and from it, must be encrypted.Many agree that smart devices in business are in their infancy and that IT departments should take a lead in promoting innovative uses. Today, most are being used for email.Andrés Kohn, vice-president for technology at Proofpoint, an IT security company, emphasises the importance of ensuring incoming data are clean and that outgoing information does not inadvertently leak confidential information: “Certainly focus on the security of your physical devices. But also focus on the security of your email infrastructure” he urges.
177;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-02-24T15:18:18Z;Intelligence: iPad tips the balance in favour of giving more data to workers;Greater access to information on the move could help employees do a better job, says Jessica Twentyman;For more than a decade, suppliers of business intelligence (BI) have been trying to sell their corporate customers a vision of “BI for the masses”, where tools for analysing data are widely used across the workforce.But their efforts have had a limited success, with BI tools largely confined to a few skilled “power users”, mostly business analysts.Often, it falls to them to run queries and prepare reports for senior executives and colleagues who lack the skills to do so themselves.Mobile BI could change that situation, making it much easier for employees who need the information in order to do their jobs to access data about sales, products, customers or logistics – via a smartphone or tablet computer.In fact, it is the tablet computer – and in particular the Apple iPad – that is starting to tip the balance in favour of company-wide BI, according to Joao Tapadinhas, an analyst at Gartner, an IT market research company.“From my experience, when chief executives see a BI dashboard on the iPad for the first time, they want it, and they want all their executive team to have it, too. It’s a very rich, compelling experience,” he says.“From there, they start to see the potential of mobile BI for line-of-business managers and team leaders, and soon, they are experimenting with mobile BI for other staff: field engineers, sales executives, and retail staff interacting with shoppers, for example.”In a recent Gartner survey of 1,364 companies that already use BI tools, only 8 per cent said their company had mobile BI today, but one-third planned to implement it in 2012 and a further 13 per cent would run pilot projects.“BI is all about unlocking information and the iPad is all about consuming information. The two are a natural fit,” says Dan Kerzner, senior vice-president of mobile at Micro­strategy, a BI company.“We did not realise how quickly companies would embrace that combination,” he says.Among the businesses already using Microstrategy’s products are Guess, a fashion retailer, MetLife, an insurance company and the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain.There are, however, limitations that prospective customers should consider.For a start, explains Mr Tapadinhas, most products available today give users the ability to view, but not to manipulate, data.“Mobile BI is about consumption. To call this ‘analytics’ would be an exaggeration,” he says.At best, some software allows the user to “drill down”, so that they can see revenues by region, for example, or by product. In general, however, interactive, capabilities are less common than a simple ability to look at information.Another potential hurdle is the fact that most companies have more than one BI platform.Since mobile intelligence is typically sold as an add-on module to a specific platform, some customers will find they need to buy and implement a module for each of the platforms they have – a costly undertaking with huge potential to confuse users.To try to tackle this problem, a company called Roambi has developed mobile data “visualisation” tools. These connect to a range of BI platforms, including those from SAS, Microsoft, IBM, SAP and Sybase, to present data in visual formats on iPhones and iPads.In this way, customers can build graphs and charts built on data from different platforms, says Santiago Becerra, the chief executive of Roambi. The main focus for his company, he says, is to make data understandable for people that have not used business intelligence before.“It’s not our goal to reinvent BI. The technology to extract and organise data is widely available and largely commoditised,” he says. “What we think companies need if they’re going to make BI available to everyone is a better way of presenting information.”But perhaps the biggest challenge for organisations will be integrating mobile BI with their other “bring your own device” policies for employees.The iPad – with its 9.7 inch screen – has fast emerged as the “device of choice” for mobile BI, says Stephen Gallagher, a BI specialist at PA Consulting.At the recent Gartner BI Summit in London, he observes, almost every stand in the exhibition area had an iPad.But not every employee will want or need an iPad, and while BI is available for iPhones, Android handsets and BlackBerrys, these tools lag behind the iPad in their maturity and usability, says Mr Tapadinhas.More effort and investment is needed from BI suppliers, so their mobile products can take advantage of the touchscreen and geo-positioning capabilities smartphones offer.But the fact remains that smaller screen sizes, which allow just two or three “key performance indicators” to be displayed to the viewer at a time, may also be a significant barrier to the dream of delivering BI to all employees that could make good use of it.
178;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-02-24T15:18:18Z;Devices at work: People, not technology, are the weakest link;Charles Batchelor weighs up the benefits and risks for employers that come with IT ‘consumerisation’;"Time was when advanced technologies were developed first for business use and only later trickled down to the consumer.But recent years have seen the “consumerisation” of IT, with sophisticated software applications available to the mobile and smart phone user as soon as – if not sooner than – they are available for business.Research In Motion’s BlackBerry was long the preferred device for corporate IT departments but the Apple iPhone and iPad, and Google’s Android operating system have put considerable power to access sophisticated applications in the hands of the consumer.“The technology has been around for many years, but over the past 18 months we have seen the true consumerisation of mobiles,” says Carolina Milanesi, research vice-president for consumer devices at Gartner, an IT market research company.She adds: “A few years ago, innovation was in the workplace because it was expensive, but these products have become commoditised and the consumer has been at the forefront.”Some companies promote their willingness to allow employees to use their personal smart phone for business use when they recruit staff. Modern devices are easy to use, offer a wealth of features and allow users to access social media sites such a Facebook and Twitter.The barriers between work and leisure have also been blurred by the fact that mobile devices that are constantly on. Employers gain from having staff who may be willing to check work emails or interrogate a database while standing in the supermarket queue or commuting to the office.At a time of constrained corporate budgets, employers can also see the advantage of staff being willing to pay as much as £400 for a personal smart phone that is then also put to business use – though some companies reimburse employees in part or in full for the device and network charges.But there are also huge potential downsides which make it crucial that companies think through their approach to the world of “bring your own device” – BYOD.“You find the business is dependent on a whole tier of shadow IT,” says Chris Rixon, a manager at BMC, a business software vendor.“Can your IT infrastructure support these mobile devices when things go wrong? What you don’t want is for your IT department to become aware only when there is some kind of failure or your software vendor says you are out of capacity.“You don’t want to depend on an application that has become critical in terms of a department’s ability to operate but which the IT professionals don’t know anything about. It is absolutely vital that the IT department maintains control of devices that are a business asset but at the same time a business risk.”The security of corporate data and networks is a prime concern of managers. With BYOD, members of staff could connect to the company network, view and download corporate data, accidentally introduce a virus; or even hack into the system.So companies need rules of engagement, setting out minimum security standards or even requiring the use of company-sanctioned security software as a condition of allowing personal devices that connect to company systems.IBM, for example, makes employees use eight-digit alphanumeric passwords. Possible developments include tools that recognise facial features, fingerprints or voice.There are devices that allow users to view information on a corporate network, but prevent its downloading, says Martin Lunt, principal adviser in the mobile special interest group at KPMG, the consultancy.Companies can also insist that employees install a tool that splits personal and business applications on their mobile, with no provision for the movement of data between the two.Features that reduce flexibility tend to be unpopular with users, however.Businesses may insist that mobile devices conform to their standards and are designed so the company can clean and encrypt them. They can install a facility to wipe data from the device if it is lost.Unless corporate and personal data have been kept apart, wiping a device can lead to the loss of personal information such as telephone numbers and photographs.The popularity of the cloud, the outsourcing of computer services to third-party providers, can also compromise the security of data on a mobile. Blogs and tweeting can lure users into revealing sensitive corporate information. People who would think twice about revealing company secrets over the phone often do not realise how much they have given away in an online message.According to David Elton, an IT expert at PA Consulting, “The question is: How do you get value from these trends rather than just cracking down? Managements should realise that it not the devices that are a security problem, it is the people. It is usually people, not the technology that are the weakest link.”"
179;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-02-24T15:18:18Z;Tablets: Corporate market still up for grabs;Companies more cautious in their commitments, writes Chris Nuttall;"The iPad may have carried all before it in the consumer tablet market, but the corporate market seems still to be up for grabs, with companies more cautious in their commitments.Apple has first-mover advantage. On its quarterly earnings call in January, the Silicon Valley company said nearly all the US top companies were using the iPad to some degree “to improve work flows, business processes and customer engagements”.“Generally, our clients are telling us: ‘We are deploying the iPad or allowing the iPad into the workplace as a bring-your-own-device [BYOD]; we are looking at Android, but are not ready yet to commit to it; and we are waiting for Microsoft’,” says Carolina Milanesi, consumer technologies and markets analyst at Gartner, the research company.Google’s Android operating system leads Apple’s iOS and the iPhone in smartphones, but has not had the same success in tablets, while Microsoft surrendered an early lead with Windows-based tablets, as businesses take a wait-and-see approach. The more touch- and app-friendly Windows 8 is due this year.Ms Milanesi says Android tablets’ problems are related to the Android market, where a lack of control over apps is raising security concerns.“You can’t count on users not downloading apps, because that’s what they want the tablet for. So, for enterprises, it means they have to deploy something on top of Android from a security and device management perspective and that entails higher costs.”For Android tablet manufacturers, of which Lenovo and Samsung are favoured by companies, says Gartner, concerns about security represent an opportunity.“When we designed our Thinkpad tablets, we thought about the challenges for the IT department in securing devices that are instant-on, portable and easily forgotten – people just leave them lying around,” says Stephen Miller, Lenovo product ambassador.Lenovo’s security features include “geostamping” devices, so that they are locked and become unusable if taken out of the office or a defined area. They can also be wiped of all data remotely.Another feature is custom imaging – allowing a standard set-up for company-issued tablets, with defined and approved apps on specified screens. Additional apps can be delivered over the air and Lenovo offers control over custom app stores.Research In Motion is offering a more flexible approach by introducing BlackBerry Balance with its PlayBook tablet – a safe “sandboxing” of part of the tablet for personal use.“This allows users to have their own space on the device, so they can load games, browse, play music – do what they want, rather than the old days of locking it down,” says David Heit, director of product strategy for RIM.BlackBerry Balance is part of a 2.0 version of the Playbook’s software being introduced. The tablet has been a disappointment for RIM – in December 2011, it announced a $485m charge for unsold PlayBooks.The device originally relied on bridging software for email and calendar to be accessed on the tablet through a companion BlackBerry smartphone – a criticised modus operandi no longer needed with 2.0.“The idea of the bridge was that this leveraged the security already on the BlackBerry smartphone, the big benefit being it allowed a lot of organisations a bit more time to figure out their strategy for tablets,” explains Mr Heit.Non-iPad tablet makers have also sought an advantage in a feature Apple turned its back on many years ago with the failure of its Newton personal digital assistant – pen-based input, with a number of manufacturers integrating a stylus and pen-specific software in their devices.The digital paper company Anoto is working on the concept of a folder with a tablet and special writing pad next to it. Using the digital pen on the pad streams the writing in real time to the screen of the tablet.“More than 80 per cent of all daily capture in the enterprise is with paper still,” says Stein Revelsby, Anoto chief executive.“Unless it wants to lose market share to Samsung [whose new Galaxy Note tablet features a pen], I think Apple needs to do something with pens as well.”While a recent NPD In-Stat survey found 68 per cent of tablets provided by companies to staff were iPads, Frank Dickson, its vice-president of mobile research, says there is still not the same brand loyalty as in the consumer world. “People are not wedded to a platform or device; they are trying to figure out what they can do with a tablet,” he says.“Email is by far the number one thing people want to use an iPad or tablet for, but there are many niche apps that are popular as well, such as IT monitoring, and it’s really about how whichever tablet can solve such unique problems.”"
180;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-02-23T20:13:21Z;Hewlett-Packard: time to rebuild;Bargain hunters should note how tough it has been for Dell investors;"Meg Whitman has to roll up her sleeves and get to work. In fact, she may want to do the trouser legs as well, given the depth of the mess she’s stepped into. In Hewlett-Packard’s just-reported quarter, four of the company’s five-biggest segments – personal computers, services, printing and datacentre hardware – had operating earnings declining by a third or more. Mrs Whitman puts her problems into three categories: poor execution, under-investment in existing businesses, and adopting to a changing technological environment.The execution problem is obvious: during the past year HP has lost significant market share in PCs, servers and printing, according to research houses Gartner and IDC. This issue should be the easiest one to start on – HP simply has to do the basic things right, which should be simpler now that the leadership transition is over.HP spent an average of 2.5 per cent of revenues on research and development in the past three years, half of IBM’s level. Spending more on innovation (and on marketing) will help goose sales long-term, but only if HP can protect enough short-term profits to fund it.The third issue is the trickiest. IBM famously transformed itself, but had big software and services businesses before it bet everything on those segments, and won. It is less clear what kernel HP should rebuild itself around. The company’s transformation is likely to look more like the one at Dell, where gross margins have ground upward by six percentage points over five years as it has slowly shifted from PC’s to corporate computing and services. Bargain hunters tempted by HP should note how tough it has been for Dell investors: while Dell’s shares have more than doubled since bottoming three years ago, they remain 60 per cent below their highs of late 2004.

181;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-02-15T13:39:09Z;Apple overtakes Samsung on smartphone sales;;Apple has overtaken Samsung as the world’s largest smartphone maker on the back of soaring sales of the latest iPhone that was launched in the fourth quarter of 2011.Apple, which also supplanted LG as the third-largest overall mobile phone supplier by the end of last year, helped boost global sales of smartphones by 47 per cent to 149m units in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in the previous year, according to Gartner, the research group. Total smartphone sales in 2011 reached 472m units and accounted for 31 per cent of all mobile devices sales, up 58 per cent on 2010.Apple’s success, which took its share of the smartphone market to almost a quarter, and the continued growth of Samsung came at the expense of traditional mobile phone vendors such as Nokia, Research In Motion, LG, Sony Ericsson and Motorola.Gartner said that these vendors were also exposed to a much stronger threat in the lower end of the smartphone market from ZTE and Huawei, the Chinese handset makers, which were the fastest-growing vendors in the fourth quarter of 2011 after Apple.ZTE moved into fourth place in the global handset market in the quarter, bolstered by a 71 per cent increase in smartphone sales as low-cost internet-enabled devices gained in popularity thanks to consumers trading up from lower-tech “feature” phones.RIM dropped back three places to become the seventh-largest phone maker in the fourth quarter of 2011 after experiencing a 10.7 per cent sales decline. Gartner said that RIM’s delay with its BlackBerry 10 platform will further impair its ability to retain customers.Nokia introduced its first Windows-based smartphone in several markets in the fourth quarter but Gartner said that sales were not enough to prevent a fall in Microsoft’s smartphone operating-system market share to 1.9 per cent, from 3.4 per cent a year earlier.Strong iPhone sales also impacted Google’s Android market share in spite of Samsung’s success, which posted a slight decline on the quarter. Apple sold 35.5m smartphones in 2011, a 121.4 per cent increase year-on-year. Apple’s smartphone market share reached 23.8 per cent in the fourth quarter, and was the largest smartphone vendor for 2011 as a whole with a 19 per cent market share. Apple more than doubled its share of overall handset sales in the fourth quarter to 7.4 per cent.Nokia’s share of smartphone sales fell to 12 per cent, from about 30 per cent a year, owing to a steep drop in shipments of its older Symbian operating system that is being gradually phased out.Nokia’s overall mobile phone sales dropped 8.7 per cent to 111.7m units for the quarter, although it retained its spot as the largest overall vendor with a fourth-quarter market share of 23.4 per cent, down from 27.1 per cent.In contrast, Samsung came closer to its promise to take the top spot in the market after the second-placed handset maker increased its market share to 19.4 per cent, from 17.5 per cent last year.Roberta Cozza, principal research analyst at Gartner, said: “Western Europe and North America led most of the smartphone growth for Apple during the fourth quarter of 2011. In Western Europe the spike in iPhone sales in the fourth quarter saved the overall smartphone market after two consecutive quarters of slow sales.”Global mobile device sales rose to 476.5m units in the fourth quarter of 2011, a 5.4 per cent increase from the same period in 2010. In 2011 as a whole, there were 1.8bn units sold, an 11.1 per cent increase from 2010. Gartner forecast the overall market to grow by about 7 per cent in 2012, and smartphone growth of about 39 per cent.
182;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-02-12T15:28:38Z;Acer seeks makeover in Europe;;Acer is doubling its marketing budget in Europe in an attempt to revitalise its cheap-and-cheerful image and increase sales in a region that has been a trouble spot for the world’s fourth-largest personal computer vendor.The Taiwanese company is understood to have hired Mother, the London-based advertising agency known for breakthrough campaigns for Coca-Cola, Boots and Ikea, to help change perceptions of the Acer brand.“Our past communications have been old-fashioned. Our new campaign will be more modern, we want to do something different and something with a twinkle in the eye,” said Oliver Ahrens, who took over as president of Acer’s Europe, Middle East and Africa operations last October.Acer’s more traditional PC products are being squeezed by more popular tablet devices such as Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy Tab. Although it has launched its own range of Iconia tablet computers, these have so far seen slow take-up in sales.The company last year fell from number two in terms of global volumes of PC shipments to number four, behind Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Dell, according to technology research group Gartner. Sales in Europe, which account for more than a third of the company’s revenues, fell more than 46 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter of 2011.Walter Deppeler, Acer’s global head of marketing, said the company was doubling marketing spend in key countries such as Germany, France and the UK, as it tries to win back market share.Mr Ahrens is also committed to returning the European business to profitability this year. The company made losses in the second and third quarters of last year, mainly due to the poor performance in Europe.Acer has made substantial changes to its business in Europe in the past year, including cutting 300 jobs after sales slumped and writing off $150m worth of excess inventory, particularly in Spain.Gianfranco Lanci, Acer’s former chief executive and global president, resigned last March following a profits warning. Mr Lanci subsequently moved to Lenovo to head up the Chinese group’s European business.“We had non-strop growth from 2002 to 2009 and we had the perfect business model for that environment. But Acer reacted a bit late to the change in the market,” Mr Ahrens said. “Our strategy is now adjusted to the new circumstances. We have changed the way we trace market growth and keep track of our inventory.”Acer is also introducing more high-priced items, such as the S5 ultrabook, which it claims is the world’s thinnest notebook computer, at just 15mm. The ultrabook is expected to retail at more than $1,000, and Mr Ahrens believes such high-end products will make the brand seem more aspirational.“It is like the strategy for Volkswagen or Audi. We have to have everything from the A1 to the R8,” he said, referring to Audi’s luxury sports car. “People will come in to admire the $1,000 ultrabooks. Ultimately they may buy a cheaper notebook, but the following year they might upgrade,” he said.
183;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-02-09T21:48:57Z;Latest deal highlights cloud agenda;;Oracle’s proposed acquisition of Taleo for $1.9bn is the latest in an aggressive and competitive wave of market consolidation in the emerging cloud-based Human Capital Management (HCM) software field, which has also seen SAP acquire Success Factors, and Salesforce.com acquire Rypple.It also underscores the growing importance of cloud-based business software and the scramble among traditional enterprise planning software companies including Oracle and SAP to bolster their cloud offerings.“These acquisitions indicate the increasing enterprise acceptance of the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, with HCM following in the footsteps of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) as the next SaaS battleground,” said Tim Jennings, chief analyst at Ovum, the technology market research firm.“It also emphasises the urgency that the major enterprise application vendors attach to establishing a strong position in cloud-based software,” he said. “Both Oracle and SAP have existing on-premise HCM solutions, but both have been prepared to pay out large sums on cloud-based equivalents, rather than simply transitioning their existing solutions to the cloud.”Taleo will also further advance Oracle’s public cloud strategy, joining the recently closed acquisition of RightNow for customer service management, Oracle’s Social Network for collaboration, and Oracle’s own Fusion applications.Like SAP’s pending $3.4bn acquisition of San Mateo, California-based Success Factors which was announced in December, Oracle’s proposed acquisition reflects the increasing demand from customers for more flexible cloud-based enterprise software that can be accessed on demand.With cloud-based start-ups like Taleo, Success Factors and Rypple making inroads in the human resources area, the giants of the software industry have had to respond, said Paul Hammerman, an analyst at Forrester Research.This trend also reflects easing concerns among major companies about the availability and security of cloud-based software and a growing appreciation that on-demand cloud-based services can provide additional flexibility and agility.“The cloud offers new delivery styles and options that are industrialised in a value chain that renders on-premises IT systems and expertise as only part of the overall delivery of IT capabilities to the company,” noted Darryl Plummer of Gartner in the IT research group’s predictions for this year.Among business users, customer relationship management and human resource management have emerged as some of the first major corporate functions to switch from in-house software packages running on corporate servers to cloud-based services that run over the internet.As a result, tools that allow companies to track and measure employees performance – often called “talent management” suites – have become one of the high-growth areas in the software industry. IDC has estimated that the sector grew by 41 per cent between 2009 and 2010, and both Taleo and Success Factors are considered leaders in the field.This switch also underscores the rapid changes under way in corporate HR departments which once relied heavily on internal systems and costly external agencies, especially for recruitment. “Human resource information systems have altered how HR services are delivered and managed by organisations,” says the Washington-based Society for Human Resources Management.So why has talent management software as a whole fared so well in recent years? In an interview last year Michael Gregoire, chief executive of Taleo, explained that the functions it provides are in tune with board-level concerns in times of economic uncertainty.“When chief executives find themselves unable to invest in hard assets such as new warehouses or manufacturing lines, their attention tends to be drawn to the workforce as a source of competitive advantage,” he said.“That focus often triggers the realisation that they simply don’t have the transparency they need to identify the ‘stars’ in their organisation, the high-performers who make a measurable contribution to business results and who need to be nurtured, motivated and rewarded for their achievements.”
184;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-02-06T22:03:27Z;Don’t go chasing ghosts in the cloud;;When is a positive return on investment (ROI) the wrong measure of success? When cloud computing is involved.That was the statement I made in a room filled with chief information officers and some of their chief financial officers bosses in Africa a few months back. The gist of my argument was that ROI is usually a measure of hard monetary return on the use of products or services. The soft side of ROI is almost always underplayed or ignored entirely.Unfortunately, with cloud computing, starting with the perspective that a hard-money ROI in the form of savings will be achieved is likely to net you more heartache than cost break. Put another way, the outcomes and value generated from public cloud computing are not always connected to a positive ROI statement.But if ROI isn’t the best measure for cloud computing success, then it is reasonable to ask, “What is?” The hard answer is the age-old consultant’s response: “It depends.” But for the purpose of simplicity, let’s generalise and say the answer is “value.” Yes, value is the most appropriate measure for cloud computing success.Wait now - before you give up on me, keep reading. Value is a commonly used way to measure the outcomes of using a service of any kind. And cloud computing is ultimately about whether or not service consumers achieve certain outcomes by using cloud services. Yes, I know that one such outcome might be the desire to save money, but if you use hard-money savings as the only, or even the most significant, outcome, then you are likely to be disappointed. Just do a Google search and you will find countless examples of CIOs and IT managers who have yet to find a fairly done and positive ROI for cloud computing. Certainly, there are those who have found savings, but the laments of those who haven’t are consistent. They go something like this:What do you mean there’s no write-off for long-term use of cloud services? What do you mean large-scale deployments are expensive because $50 per user per month multiplied by 30,000 employees adds up fast? What do you mean I have to hire more people to manage service providers?So, no matter the reason, ROI doesn’t always come out looking so good for cloud projects. This has to change. You have to start recognizing that value comes in many forms. In fact, trying to measure the ROI of using a service is a lot harder than it is for some piece of hardware or software. Why? Because the only way you can tell if a service is successful is to examine how satisfied the consumers of the service are. And the only way to do that is to ask them—all of them.But what do you ask?An associate of mine, Richard Hunter, has often said the easy way to measure value is to examine price versus performance. This means, are you paying a reasonable price for the level of outcomes that the service provides? If the service is an application that does collaboration, are your people more effective at working together by using it?Price is determined by what the market will bear. Performance is tracked based on any number of metrics that are related to what you want to get out of the service. Think about it. If you went to a high-priced steakhouse, do you think about an ROI on eating dinner? When you get your clothes dry cleaned, do you ask what the ROI was of dry cleaning versus doing it yourself? No. You focus on how good the meal was, or the price, reliability, and result given to you by the dry cleaner. That’s because a world of services is a world focused on outcomes.So, what you must first ask is, “What am I expecting to get out of using this service?” If you don’t establish that upfront, then you’re just chasing ghosts in the cloud. And, believe me, ghosts hide well in “clouds.”You could be looking for more effective collaboration for your people, or for more transparency in pricing connected to employee performance (for example, cost per invoice generated). You might be seeking rapid change, or more agility in provisioning application development platforms, or even a reduction in energy use in your company, even at a slightly higher price. Whatever it is, once you establish the outcomes, a lot of things become easier to decide.The contracts must have clauses not just for performance, but for maintaining the continuity of your business needs so that you can keep working. The providers you use must be the ones that show an interest in helping you achieve your outcomes, not just subscribing you to their service.We have to keep in mind that value is in the eye of the beholder. So many people see ROI as a statement of value in itself. But let’s not kid ourselves. ROI initiatives are mostly put in place to show money saved or money generated, not to show customer satisfaction with outcomes.The value of using cloud computing can be found in soft measures just as much as hard ones. Empowering your users to serve themselves with cloud-based applications and services can even lead to more efficient processes because the users have more choice. Changing the relationship between your business users and your IT department should also not be ignored. If cloud computing can make your IT department more effective in helping users get what they need sooner, it may be worth spending a bit more to accomplish it.Now that’s value. And the measure of that success may be worth all the ROI statements you’ve ever done.Daryl Plummer is a research fellow at Gartner.

The mobile industry has always been ultra-competitive and is getting even more so. The best that can be said for Sony’s impending purchase of the rest of its Sony Ericsson joint venture is that at least it is not buying at the top.Sony’s dream is to offer its huge content library seamlessly across TVs, phones, laptops and any other device consumers choose. It is a good plan, but one that is all about the execution. This will be tricky. Sir Howard Stringer, the company’s chief executive, has previously acknowledged the struggle to break down its corporate silos.Now Sony must continue its own turnround – a record fourth consecutive year of losses looms, including a Y33bn ($430m) charge from Sony Ericsson – and integrate the phonemaker as it continues its own radical shift into smartphones. Sony’s challenge is to build out the phone unit in order to give the business scale. After all, it does not matter how seamlessly content flows if customers do not like the handsets.There is some hope. Sales of its Xperia smartphones jumped two-thirds year-on-year. But it held just
5 per cent of the global smartphone market in the third quarter of last year, according to Gartner, the research group. That left it sixth, far behind Samsung (21 per cent) and Apple (15 per cent). Those two have managed the “intensifying competition” just fine.Investors are justifiably wary of Sony; it is trading at 3.3 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, down from nearly 5 times a year ago. Samsung’s ratio, by contrast, has grown by half to 7.6 times over the same period. Sony has a credible plan, but investors are right to wait for evidence that it can deliver it.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
186;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
187;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-01-18T22:40:48Z;Company IT priorities shift;;"The role of the company chief information officer is in transition as new technologies and computing models like cloud computing reshape business IT use and chief executives demand more value from flat or, in some cases, declining IT budgets.Gartner, the IT consultancy, recently conducted a survey of more than 2,300 CIOs worldwide to better understand their top priorities, challenges and opportunities for 2012. I spoke with Mark McDonald, group vice president at Gartner, who led the survey. Here is an edited version of our conversation.What are the top themes your survey of CIOs uncovered?One of the top themes is that business and IT executives are looking to use technology to do more than just operate their business in a more effective way in 2012. They expect CIOs and their IT organisations to create new customer experiences, drive revenue and realise cost reductions.Another major theme is the need for CIOs to strengthen their focus on driving revenue growth and improving the customer experience as a result of the current economic and financial uncertainty. Business leaders know that attracting and retaining new customers is more important than ever.Finally, the survey results told us that CIOs apply more focus on eliminating anything in the business that drives cost or complexity, or makes it harder to get things done.How does this compare to last year?Last year’s survey highlighted the promise of new technology, predominately cloud-based technologies. That led CIOs to think about how IT could be different, we call it ‘reimagining IT’. This year, mobility, analytics, collaboration, virtualisation and legacy modernisation are top of mind for CIOs. This shift reflects how the influence of the CIO now extends into the customer experience, product development, service delivery and innovation. As we kick off 2012, leading CIOs are focusing more on driving innovation within their organisations rather just cutting costs.What are the top business priorities for CIOs in 2012?Growth, customers and cost are the top business priorities for businesses in 2012. These three priorities are interrelated. A simple customer experience makes it easier to sell and for customers to buy and work with a product. That drives revenue. This simplified experience will also provide a guide for eliminating internal complexities that drive cost.The priorities for CIOs in 2012 reflect these business priorities. Analytics, mobility and cloud are the top three CIO technologies. CIOs envision using these and other technologies in combination, rather than isolation, in the year ahead. For example, analytics plus mobility accelerates customer sales and improves customer service; mobility plus cloud provides customers with more powerful solutions at their fingertips.CIOs expect mobility to be the focus of technology priorities in the year ahead, with 61 per cent of those surveyed indicating that they will improve their mobility capability over the next four years.How should CIOs prioritise their focus with all the uncertainty we’re seeing in 2012?Uncertainty has been a reality for CIOs for the past four years. In the past the focus was on reducing IT and business costs, with the idea that being cheaper is a substitute for being better. That led to dramatic cuts in IT investment.Today, however, we see CIOs prioritising a few critical business initiatives to drive the fundamentals of the business, such as supporting new products, new customer capabilities and more efficient operations, all focused on reducing the time to market.More information on the Gartner CIO Survey 2012 can be found here."
188;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-01-13T07:17:28Z;Apple halts iPhone 4S sales in its China shops;;Apple’s strategy of fanning Chinese consumers’ desire for its products backfired as a riot at its flagship store in Beijing prompted police action.The company stopped sales of the iPhone in its shops in China on Friday and the Apple store in the Sanlitun district in central Beijing stayed closed after a crowd waiting to buy the iPhone 4S on its launch in the country pelted the shop with eggs and started fighting with security guards.Many people had been queueing all night in freezing temperatures outside the shop in an upscale shopping mall. But at sunrise, a guard told them sales would not start after all.“Stores in China have already sold out,” said Apple spokeswoman Carolyn Wu, referring to the new model. “Unfortunately, we were unable to open our store at Sanlitun [in Beijing] due to the large crowd, and to ensure the safety of our customers and employees, iPhones will not be available in our retail stores in Beijing and Shanghai for the time being.”Customers can still order the devices from Apple’s online store and through China Unicom, the country’s second-largest mobile operator and the only official channel through which Chinese consumers can buy the iPhone 4S apart from Apple itself.Chinese consumers have proved as eager for Apple’s gadgets as their counterparts in most Western markets. Apple accounted for 10.4 per cent of China’s rapidly growing smartphone market with 5.6m iPhones sold in the first nine months of 2011, according to Gartner, the research firm.But sentiment against foreign brands can turn sour very quickly in China. Hundreds of protesters besieged a Porsche store in Shenzhen earlier this month after a customer said the foreign company had insulted him. Some internet users criticised Apple on Friday for making its Chinese customers “freeze and hunger”.Apple has moved much more slowly than other multinational brands to build a distribution and retail network in this market and launches most of its products in China several months after they go to market in the US. It has lost control over much of how iPhones, iPads and other popular gadgets are marketed here.Through a vast grey market, fed by parallel imports, the products are normally available in China immediately after their US launch. Upon the official China launch, most iPhones and iPads are snapped up by black marketeers, who resell them with a hefty mark-up.It was such people who turned violent on Friday morning, said witnesses. A middle-aged woman was still arguing with the guards at noon, saying she needed to “deliver the merchandise”.The launch of Apple’s iPad 2 tablet computer triggered similar violence in May last year. Back then, the same Sanlitun store saw a fight between queueing customers and security staff, which left four people injured and a glass pane smashed.Apple’s sales in China have grown at a rapid rate during the past few years, jumping more than fourfold to $12.5bn, including Hong Kong, in the year ended September 24.Despite the surge, China accounts for just 12 per cent of the company’s total sales, with the US making up 39 per cent.
189;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-01-11T19:44:04Z;Intel: smartphone chips are down;Even if the products roll out as promised, there is still a long way to go;"About time. Intel’s chips will finally to be found in smartphones this year. The company announced on Tuesday that Lenovo would release a phone with an Intel processor in China in the second quarter, and that Motorola would ship Intel phones in the second half. But the real hurdles are gaining significant market share and making money.Even if the products roll out as promised, Intel will have a long way to go in a market where chips based on Arm Holdings’ designs have 100 per cent market share. Why would handset makers rush to Intel when Arm licensees from Qualcomm to Nvidia to Texas Instruments are already competing for their business, and their software is already a proved fit with Arm designs?Intel has a history of paying up for a foothold in a new business. The company invested $1.6bn in Clearwire in the hope of cultivating WiMax wireless technology, aimed at breaking up the iron grip of Qualcomm’s CDMA. Intel may be protecting Motorola and Lenovo from any downside on the new products. But as the failure of WiMax highlights, even Intel is not rich enough to buy its way in to an established market.Smartphone sales grew by more than 40 per cent in the third quarter, when 115m units were sold, according to Gartner. But smartphone processors are much cheaper than PC processors, at
$10-$15 a pop. So even if Intel can take an impressive 25 per cent share in a year or two – and sell a lot of chips into tablets, too – it might sell $2bn in mobile chips. That is a respectable number, but it is hardly huge in the context of Intel’s $55bn in sales this year. It is no wonder that Intel wants to reignite PC sales with high-end “ultrabooks”.An aggressive entry by Intel could hurt the margins of Arm or its licensees. Near term, they may have more to fear than Intel has to gain.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
190;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-01-11T01:16:50Z;Facebook’s new ad label may confuse users;;Facebook began showing paid advertising to people in their news feeds today, and introduced a new label for the paid posts that could confuse users about their origins, rather than clarify that the message was placed by an advertiser.The FT wrote about Facebook’s plan to insert paid “sponsored stories” among social messages last December, when the company vowed it would move slowly, and clearly label the paid posts as “sponsored.”But in today’s roll out, the company changed that label: instead of “sponsored,” the posts will be marked “featured” in the bottom right of the post.Facebook defends the new terminology in the name of its users, saying sponsored stories can only be seen by people who have already Liked the company delivering the ad or by friends of people whose comments are featured in the ad.“We are using the term ‘featured’ because we want to make it clear to people that they’re seeing content from a Page or person they have chosen to connect to,” Facebook said.But the term could mislead Facebook users into thinking the post was featured for relevancy, rather than because an advertiser paid to place it there, said Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner.“Sponsored seems to be more transparent than featured,” he said. “It is a departure from user expectations and from industry convention.”
191;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-01-05T19:11:07Z;Tablet contenders vie for iPad’s crown;iPad is leader of the tablet pack as challengers muster;A year after they charged into the annual Consumer Electronics Show with more than 100 devices, tablet makers are returning to Las Vegas next week as a ragged and battle-scarred army that has failed to dent the success of Apple’s iPad.Despite the deep war wounds – most notably HP’s abandonment of its TouchPad and Research in Motion’s $485m writedown as it was forced to discount deeply its PlayBook device– the iPad rivals are banking on a new Android operating system, the arrival of Windows 8 and improved content offerings to help them cut into Apple’s two-thirds share of the market.They should be helped by consumers’ enduring appetite for tablets as overall market growth continues, according to NPD DisplaySearch forecasts. The research firm this week estimated 250 per cent growth year on year in 2011 to 73m units, as notebook PC shipments grew 12 per cent to 187.5m units.While companies such as Samsung, Sony and Toshiba have adopted Google’s Android operating system, it has not repeated its success in smartphones, where it had more than a 50 per cent share in the third quarter, according to Gartner research.Unlike smartphones, tablets do not generally attract subsidies from carriers and consumers seem unwilling to pay more than $250 for a non-iPad tablet, according to a survey by the consumer electronics site Retrevo last month. This has made life hard for Android hardware manufacturers wanting to pitch their devices at the $500 level of the iPad, says Andrew Eisner, Retrevo content director.“While Apple can command a premium price for the iPad with its apps and content, the likes of Samsung and Toshiba are only able to sell the hardware – they don’t make any money from sales in the Android Market – so they are stuck with trying to make money by charging a higher price for the hardware,” he says.Makers of ereaders, specifically the retailers Amazon and Barnes & Noble, have squeezed the established manufacturers with tablet versions under $250, made possible by their own ability to sell content and services such as books and film-streaming. These have been relatively successful, with Amazon’s Fire tablet leading Kindle sales of more than 1m a week in December.Rhoda Alexander, senior manager of tablet research at the IHS iSuppli research firm, says that while the Kindle Fire’s hardware may be basic, Amazon’s ability to sell content and an “experience” has been key.“You can make the most beautiful device that you want but, if when you turn it on, it’s not something that opens your eyes to a whole other world of content and different way of doing things, the beauty of the device is somewhat lost at that point,” she says.FT tech writers will upload their views from this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las VegasJen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, whose Tegra chips have powered leading Android tablet models, says their progress has also been dogged by the immaturity of the operating system and a lack of apps – the release in 2011 of an Android 3.0 version, codenamed Honeycomb, specifically designed for tablets, did not get the developer support it needed.“It was such a different operating system, it split the Android platform into phones and tablets. There was a small installed base of Honeycomb tablets and, as a result, there weren’t that many applications developed for it,” he says.That should change this year with 4.0 or “Ice Cream Sandwich” – a unified operating system that first appeared on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus smartphone in November. Android developers will now be encouraged to develop for both smartphones and tablets at the same time, Mr Huang forecasts.Microsoft’s Windows 8, expected to launch in the second half, should also aid tablet developers with its touch-optimised “Metro” interface offered as an alternative to the traditional Windows desktop.“[Android tablets] have been an incremental business for us, they’ve been very solid and steady,” says Philip Osako, a Toshiba product marketing director. “But we’re very excited about Windows 8 and we think it will grow the market for tablets in 2012.”Although tablet makers can look forward to better touch interfaces and more compelling apps – as well as more comprehensive content offerings in the case of new entrants such as Sony – they still face stiffening competition from Apple and will have to fight to be the focus at next week’s key event for the industry.An iPad 3 is expected by the spring and Ultrabooks – thin instant-on laptops – are slated to be the story of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show.
192;IT;Gartner Inc;2012-01-03T19:22:14Z;Be aware when cutting IT spending;;"Against the backdrop of an uncertain economic outlook and lacklustre growth at best, many companies are seeking to cut back on their IT spending.As 2012 begins, I asked Mark McDonald, group vice president of research at Gartner, about the challenges corporate IT leaders - particlualrly chief information officers - face with cutting IT costs and how to ensure that IT is delivering real benefits.Many CIOs are being asked by their chief executives to cut costs this year. Will this only impact IT?Cutting the cost of IT is not the same as cutting other functions. IT spending is peculiar because it’s indirect. Properly managed, IT spending changes performance disproportionality more than it costs. This is not to say that IT budgets can not be cut, but blindly cutting IT saves pennies in the short term while locking in a future legacy of more expensive inefficiency.So how should CIOs discuss the cost of IT with their colleagues in the business?Maximising the value of IT requires CIOs to change their attitudes from simply administering an IT budget to actually applying IT to amplify business performance. By amplify, we mean CIOs need to concentrate on IT productivity’s numerator – value created by IT rather than just denominator cost.CIOs should also avoid the fantasy of ‘more for less’ by focusing on a shorter, prioritized set of projects. Nothing focuses managers like a crisis and focusing IT on fewer, more important business priorities creates results now, rather than spreading resources too thin to make a meaningful impact. Shortening planning, project and governance cycle times can also keep IT’s limited resources concentrated on the organization’s most important priorities and better prepare the management team to respond to change.Gartner also advises CIOs to measure IT value based on changes in business performance rather than just costs. IT has no value and no place in the budget if it does not improve performance or productivity.CIOs who take these steps will be able to use IT to amplify business performance. Sure, it’s easier to administer an IT budget, but all that gets you is fewer activities with even fewer meaningful results. It’s better to think small about IT in terms of how it can have short, sharp and focused impact, rather than merely cutting the cost of an already blunt IT organization.How can chief executives tell whether their CIO’s time is being spent purely on managing IT budgets or is actually adding value?Here is a simple test of whether your CIO is managing IT budgets or managing business results. The average IT organisation spends 70 per cent of its budget running the business, effectively keeping the IT lights on, and 30 per cent improving business performance. If your CIO could cut the ‘run’ component by 10 per cent, moving from 70 percent to 63 percent, what would they do with that money? Save it? Or re-invest it in innovation by increasing spend on improving business performance?This is not a test of the effectiveness of IT. Rather, it is a test of your confidence in IT management and its ability to realise business benefits. Organisations that don’t reinvest IT savings in innovation have no confidence in IT management.What’s the risk of cutting investment in IT?It is natural to reduce IT costs in the face of a downturn. That approach works best when costs are directly tied to business activity; sell less and you need to make less. But IT is connected to a whole lot more than just the cost structure of your operations. Treat it as another administrative expense and you degrade performance across the board. But focus your limited IT resources on projects that can drive specific results and you’ll significantly amplify business performance.Mark McDonald is a group vice president of research at Gartner, and co-author of The Social Organization, published in October 2011 by Harvard Business Review Press."
193;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-12-29T18:12:56Z;Apple in race to keep ahead in 2012;;Apple is facing mounting challenges in 2012 to refresh key product lines in the face of rising competition after a year marked by record profits but also the death of its founder Steve Jobs and less dramatic design innovation.A white iPhone, white iPad and white iPod touch were the most noticeable physical changes to Apple’s products this year, although it updated its devices' internal hardware and introduced new software and services to retain its edge.But industry analysts say Apple needs to do much more in 2012 if it intends to stay ahead of rivals and ensure employees are still inspired to work for the world’s leading technology company, following the death of co-founder and chief executive Steve Jobs in October.“Next year is going to be a pivotal year for the company,” says Rob Enderle of the Enderle Group. “Apple for the last decade has clearly led the market and now the market has proved to be very good at being a ‘fast follower’.”The tech analyst says Apple, with Tim Cook now chief executive, needs to explore new areas of technology to stay ahead.An Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Apple hit new heights financially in 2011, with $108bn in revenues in its fiscal year ending in September – up from $65bn in 2010 – as well as $26bn recorded in net income and nearly $82bn available in cash reserves.But Android phones now dominate the global smartphone market with a 52.5 per cent market share in the third quarter, more than double that of a year ago, according to the Gartner research firm. The iPhone’s share slipped to 15 per cent from 16.6 per cent and Samsung became the number one smartphone maker, shipping 24m units to the iPhone’s 17m.More than 6.8m Apple and Android devices were activated on Christmas day, Flurry, the mobile application research company, said on Thursday. This was more than twice the 2.8m activations seen on Christmas day a year ago. Google said 3.7m new Android devices were switched on for the first time on Christmas Eve and Christmas day.Apple also faces increasing competition for the iPad with the launch of a more touch-friendly Windows 8 from Microsoft in 2012, which should also boost the new Ultrabook PC category, a direct rival to the MacBook Air.There is a threat from cheaper tablets such as the Kindle Fire, which Amazon said on Thursday had led sales of more than 1m Kindles a week in December. However, Amazon’s shares dipped after a Goldman Sachs analyst suggested it could only achieve $17.9bn in fourth-quarter sales, falling short of consensus expectations of $18.2bn.Tim Bajarin, president of the Creative Strategies research firm and a longtime Apple watcher, says the company will have prepared a road map under Steve Jobs for the next several years and 2012 could be another big product year similar to 2010, when the iPad was first launched and there were major redesigns of the iPhone, MacBook Air and Apple TV.“2012 will be a highly innovative year for Apple and it will reinvent the iPhone – where a larger screen is in order – the iPad and the MacBook Air,” he says.There have also been multiple reports that Apple is preparing to launch a full assault on the television market.“The company is smart enough to know that, when the competition starts catching up, you just run faster and do something different and that’s what Apple has always done,” says Mr Bajarin.Additional reporting by Maija Palmer in London
194;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-12-23T18:54:49Z;IT changes herald a dissaggregated future;;"Banking and finance have always been at the leading - and sometimes ‘bleeding’ edge of technology change.Despite the regulatory and other pressures they face, there is no sign that the pace of change in banking will slow. Indeed some industry experts believe that the pace of change could actually accelerate.To explore these and other ideas about how banking may evolve in the future I spoke to David Furlonger, research fellow at Gartner. Below is an edited version of our conversation.Do you expect the rapid pace of change in IT within financial services to continue?Absolutely! Financial services in 2020 will be a dramatically different industry than in 2011. The ability to access financial products and services outside the traditional industry can be seen already in the myriad of Internet- and mobile-based, non-industry financial providers. Ironically, government attempts to safeguard and regulate the industry have only hastened its disaggregation with the separation of lines of business and the push for greater transparency.Is this unique to financial services?The financial services industry is not the first to suffer this fate. The postal system, until comparatively recently, was essential to the efficient functioning of financial services. Transmission of checks for the payment of bills, making deposits, refunds, shareholder documentation and so on relied on physical mail. However, postal usage has been dropping consistently, with the US Postmaster General warning of potential losses of $238bn in the decade to 2020 without drastic change.Then there is the electricity industry. Historically, banking empires, and particularly the IT operations that enable them, resembled the proliferation of windmills or steam engines early in the industrial revolution. Two hundred years ago, every firm or stately home generated its own power, just as now every bank has its own data centers and proprietary systems. Electricity generation moved to huge power stations and an electricity grid a long time ago; now banks will make the same move to IT grids and cloud computing over the Internet. This is a salutary warning for the financial services industry.So what is the underlying factor that is driving change in financial services?Financial services firms will look back on the invention of the Internet as a watershed moment that redefined its future, as happened with the postal service and electricity generation. The confluence of the consumerisation of IT and cloud computing is creating new scenarios that are redefining the future of financial services.This confluence of forces is causing a re-examination of the traditional view of an industry built on the concept of its form (organizational structures, working practices, business processes, etc.) following its functions - payment facilitation, pooling of capital, economic transfer (lending and investing), risk management and calculation of value. Business componentisation and velocity require an entirely new industry form to be reimagined and with it, the IT backbone that supports that form.Organisational forms need to address team-based orientations, as opposed to hierarchy. Virtual organisations must be created and managed; reward and governance models must be reassessed; product and service design should move across the firewall to be part of the social customer collective; and capital, skills, risk and return will become increasingly shared.From an IT perspective, these changes mean examining the way applications are designed, integrated and managed, as well as how IT will be structured in terms of shared utility functions and business-focused product design teams. Design thinking will come increasingly to the fore as technology usability and integration become more than just a bolt-on set of tools, but instead, a built-in way of life.What are the other forces shaping change for IT in financial services?We expects the fundamental changes taking place in the financial services industry will also partly be driven by the twin forces of greater participation and a more-liquid world, where non-traditional assets and stores of value become tradable (mobile phone minutes, bandwidth, loyalty points, and so on) - the future of money.Customers now expect (from their past interactions with retail and other industries) a service more tailored to their personal needs, where they can define the product features or the terms and conditions that they want, and pay a price that reflects the value of their relationship with the financial provider.Rather than being the passive recipients of a fixed set of products in a “push” product marketing and supply model, customers will become much more active participants in the relationship, directly negotiating with participants in the supply chain to find a provider that can help them meet their ultimate needs at the best price they can get. Similarly, they will expect a much greater degree of interoperability between the products and services that they procure. They will expect to “mix and match” from different suppliers, regardless of geography, in the more-liquid world.A prime example of where this could become apparent is the payment card, the most popular form of payment in the developed world. Customers use their cards with millions of merchants, but the card system itself is monolithic. Payment cards are currently tightly integrated credit and payment solutions. For each card, customers are locked into a single provider that includes the brand experience, the loyalty scheme, the assessment of credit, the interest rate and payment terms, and so on.In the future, this system will be disaggregated and reconfigured in the cloud, creating a more-open marketplace for credit processing. Customers may select an interest rate from one provider, a credit assessment and repayment period from another, a loyalty scheme from another, a branding experience from another, a connectivity capability from yet another, and so on - exploiting the power of open markets.Such levels of disaggregation will require all the various components to work together into a cohesive system. As a result, an intermediary - in essence, a cloud broker or an aggregator - will be required to compile all these components and deliver a customised real-time payment solution.So given this innovation within IT, what are some of the opportunities for the financial services industry?Banks may be able to do in the next five to 10 years what the electricity industry stumbled towards over the span of a century - not just a centralised model, but a smart grid, where users can also pump “power” back into the network. Computing power and the products and services it enables can then be not only consumed more like electricity, but also procured via marketplaces that can give future as well as spot prices for those products and services.Further into the future could be the development of call options on IT and financial services that offer monetary protection in the event of failed fulfillment by a particular supplier - again, this is similar to under/over generation in the electricity industry (as well as standard financial trading in the securities market).The implication is that a particular banking line of business will be charged absolute (real-time) costs for IT service/infrastructure, as opposed to average cost. Market rates will then be tied directly to the business’s cost of capital, thereby improving efficiency and performance. IT service/infrastructure provision could eventually cross boundaries like the Internet, leading to substantial change in the construction of financial products and how they are regulated. This will then enable the industry to compete.Regulators are trying to do to safeguard the industry via the firewalling of certain banking businesses and the implementation of tighter capital controls via Basel III. However, these efforts could well be overtaken by the speed of market forces and the exponential growth in technology enablement."
195;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-12-15T00:39:41Z;US chip tool makers in $3.3bn merger;;Chip tool makers Lam Research and Novellus Systems have announced a $3.3bn merger on the same day the Gartner research firm predicted a 20 per cent decline in spending on semiconductor equipment in 2012.The two Silicon Valley companies said the merger was driven by significant synergies between their areas of equipment expertise: Lam supplies fabrication equipment for the etching of silicon wafers and Novellus is a market leader in enabling surface preparation and thin-film depositions on the wafers.Gartner predicted on Wednesday that worldwide spending on chip equipment would fall the most in 2012 in the area of wafer fab equipment, falling 22.9 per cent to $26.8bn. It predicted spending would shrink 19.5 per cent overall due to a “slowing macro economy, high inventories and a sluggish PC industry”.Lam will acquire Novellus in an all-stock transaction valued at around $3.3bn and the Lam Research name will be retained. Cost savings of around $100m a year are expected by the end of 2013 and the deal is expected to be accretive to Lam’s earnings within one year of the transaction’s close.Lam said the combined company would be well-positioned as the chip industry moves to next-generation technologies – ones that will require considerable investment as chips adopt 3D structures and the size of the circular wafers they are cut from grows from 300mm in diameter to 450mm.Lam also announced a $1.6bn stock buy-back programme. Its shares were down 4 per cent at $37.90 in extended trading on the news, with Novellus shares up nearly 20 per cent at $41.42. The transaction valued Novellus at $44.42 a share, a 28 per cent premium on its closing price of $34.70.
196;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-12-14T22:04:39Z;IT leaders must act to limit eurozone damage;Company leaders face “extreme uncertainty”;Corporate IT leaders should “act immediately” to help protect their companies from “the extreme uncertainty plaguing all enterprises operating in the eurozone”, Gartner, the IT research firm and consultancy, has warned.In particular, company chief information officers need to help safeguard their enterprises from the risks of government or bank default, euro break-up, counterparty bankruptcy and employee or customer distress.“CIOs are uniquely positioned within their enterprises at the fulcrum of business and technology, and they are the only executives with sufficient visibility and potential capability to address the challenges posed by today’s eurozone crisis,” said David Furlonger, vice-president and Gartner Fellow.In a Gartner report titled ‘CIOs Should Address the Impacts of the Euro Crisis on Their Enterprises Now,’ he argues that the current generation of IT leaders “are at the nexus of information and information dissemination within companies” and that IT lies at the core of most corporate functions.”Business leaders are crying out for CIOs to demonstrate more effectively the capability of IT and, specifically, to add value to the business,” Mr Furlonger said. “Therefore, this crisis also presents CIOs with an opportunity to make substantial and bold steps to meet chief executives’ demands and demonstrate the importance and true value of IT.”The Gartner analysts argue that because the eurozone crisis affects all 27 countries and their interconnected economies in Europe, it has the chance to be far more disruptive than even the recent recession. “It has the potential to totally undermine the eurozone, the whole EU and beyond,” Mr Furlonger said.Andrea Di Maio, vice-president and distinguished analyst at Gartner, adds: “Spurred on by the pervasiveness of the internet, the crisis negatively affects every enterprise or individual doing business in or with the region. The CIO’s top responsibility is to guarantee business continuity.”Gartner analysts said there are four broad challenges that the euro crisis raises, and they examined how the CIO is best positioned to provide enterprise leadership on addressing those challenges. These challenges include:Market Volatility: Most enterprises and their IT departments are burdened with significant numbers of bureaucratic processes and latent decision-making mechanisms. Today’s market conditions require business and government executives to radically restructure their business practices.“Market conditions require CIOs to help develop a working environment that promotes speed, agility and adaptability – without sacrificing accountability,” Mr. Di Maio said. “Change management capabilities will be critical. The foundation to achieve effective change management will demand information, analytics, human resources flexibility and a more decentralised command-and-control management structure.”Capital Costs: ”The costs of and access to capital across Europe will probably continue to worsen until there is a significant redress in structural imbalances between countries and organisations. Unwillingness or inability to write off debt and restructure public and private-sector balance sheets is a substantial barrier to market efficiency. Lines of credit will probably become uncertain or removed, forcing corporations to reduce inventory.“In this situation, CIOs will face zero-growth budgeting at best, and substantial reductions in both the investment capital and the operational budget made available to run the business at worst,” Mr Furlonger said. “If a market meltdown occurs, then critical resources and supplies may be at risk. CIOs and other executives must develop contingency plans to ensure multiple backups.”Human Capital Management: Millions of people are out of work in Europe. Formal government austerity packages and informal corporate restrictions on salaries, benefits and working conditions, combined with high costs of living, are stressing workforces. This situation is compounded by retirement funding shortfalls, extensions in the working age and loss of benefits.“CIOs and business executives face significant human resources issues in terms of rewarding and motivating staff, securing funds to hire appropriate new talent, and dealing with the personnel hardships of individuals entering the work environment, which impair productivity,” Mr Di Maio said. “They must also plan for retention issues of foreign workers moving to better opportunities or the removal of non-EU work permits and visas in response to political backlash from rapidly rising unemployment, resulting in a ‘brain drain’.”Risk Management: The capital markets (and many corporations) believe that the risk of government and counterparty default is substantial. Receivables management is being stressed, and the likelihood of internal and external fraud rises. From an IT standpoint, operational risk is heightened via issues such as changes in contractual obligations and business continuity. Added to this is the continued increase in regulatory compliance initiatives across industries, which exacerbate the pressure on audit and risk management assessments and workflows.“Before the crisis, enterprises were already challenged to identify enterprise-wide risks in a holistic fashion to link those risks to the performance of the business and to manage risk in a time-effective manner,” Mr Furlonger said.“Now, the CIO – and corporate treasurer, head trader, chief financial officer and others – need to ask questions such as, ‘Can existing risk models accommodate alternatives to the lack of historical data (in many cases, as much as three years of back data are required) necessary for regression testing/yield curve analysis of hedges, and for stressing asset and liability portfolios in the event of a redenomination in all or part of their asset and liability portfolio?’.”
197;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-12-08T18:05:43Z;Rival devices weaken the BlackBerry addiction;;"Presidents, politicians and corporate titans once jostled to be photographed using them, traders and investment bankers did deals with them and rap artists sang about them. They were banned in some posh restaurants and yet it seemed everyone in business slept with them.For most of the past decade, the BlackBerry was much more than a phone or a wireless email device. It was cool and addictive – hence the moniker “crackberry”. But that was before Apple’s touchscreen-based iPhone made its debut in 2007 and stole the hearts of a generation.BlackBerrys are still popular in certain circles, particularly a younger generation weaned on texting and hooked on Facebook, Twitter and BlackBerry’s free messaging service which, if the reports are to be believed, helped usher in the Arab spring and London riots.Equally importantly, many business users still rely on BlackBerry’s wireless email service and the thumb-operated mini keyboard that helped define the once iconic devices. But in business, as elsewhere, defections are on the rise and many of those who do still carry a company issued BlackBerry, also tote an iPhone or Android-based smartphone for personal use.While the subscriber base outside North America continues to grow, in the key US market which accounts for about 40 per cent of sales, BlackBerrys and Research In Motion, the Canadian company that makes them, are in trouble.According to new figures released this week by ComScore, the market research firm, RIM’s share of the US smartphone market fell by 4.5 percentage points to 17.2 per cent in the three months ending October. Gartner, the IT research firm, estimates that’s RIM’s share of the worldwide smartphone market fell to 11 per cent in the third quarter from 15.4 per cent a year earlier.Meanwhile investors have watched as RIM stock has fallen from over $70-a-share in march to under $18-a-share this week as a succession of management missteps, product delays and profit warnings have taken their toll.Just last week RIM announced that it was taking a $485m pre-tax writedown on the value of unsold BlackBerry PlayBook tablets, which it said would mean it misses its already lowered fiscal 2012 profit targets. RIM had already been forced to discount the PlayBook, once touted as an iPad killer, from $499 to $199 in recent weeks.The inventory writedown is the latest in a series of setbacks for RIM. It has faced increased competition from rivals including Apple and makers of smartphones and tablets based on Google's Android software, and has struggled to update its own ageing product portfolio.Along with the PlayBook related charge, RIM also announced a $50m charge against revenues to cover the extended network outage it suffered earlier this autumn, which left millions of BlackBerry users unable to access the smartphone network for days.That debacle, coupled with other missteps including its delayed response to the iPhone and continuing delays in rolling out next generation products based on a new operating system, has some analysts warning that RIM’s beleaguered management has lost touch with its user base and lacks credibility with investors.A small group of dissident shareholders has already called on RIM’s management to consider all options for maximising shareholder value including perhaps selling off its patent portfolio or an outright sale of the company. Others have called on the co-chief executives of the company – Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie – to make way for a new management team, but have gained little support so far.Analysts point out that many of RIM’s problems stem from a difficult transition the company is attempting to make between products based on its old BlackBerry operating system and a new operating system dubbed BBX. Next generation devices, based on the new operating system, are due to appear in the first half next year.In the meantime, RIM is relying on a handful of handsets running its latest BlackBerry 7 operating system and strong sales in developing markets to help it through the next few quarters.RIM’s management insists it is not ready to give up, and will not allow the company to become a niche player in a fast expanding market. Rather they and company supporters point to initiatives like the announcement of new software last week that will make it easier for company IT departments to manage BlackBerry devices alongside rival devices, as evidence that the company is determined to remain relevant.Ultimately, however, RIM needs to make progress on several fronts at once to secure its future.As Mike Abramsky of Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets team, said on Friday, a recovery in RIM’s valuation depends on “improved competitiveness of pending BBX devices, ecosystem and uptake; improved marketing and launch execution; restored investor credibility and visibility; [and] improved governance”."
198;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-12-06T20:48:17Z;Android narrows the ‘app gap’ with Apple;;Google is beginning to bridge the “app gap” between its Android smartphones and Apple’s rival iPhone, as figures reveal users are downloading 1bn software applications a month on each of the two ­platforms.A vibrant ecosystem of apps – small, cheap downloads offering add-on features and internet services – is seen as vital to customers’ smartphone choices, as market leaders Apple and Google face renewed competition from Microsoft and Nokia.In a blog post on Tuesday, Google touted a milestone of 10bn apps downloaded from Android Market since it launched in 2008, up from 6bn in June, with the current growth rate at 1bn apps per month. Downloads of apps for Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7 trail by a considerable distance.Mobile developers say that Google still lags far behind Apple in generating revenue from apps, in spite of Android’s much larger user base. In October, Apple said that iOS customers had downloaded 18bn apps – a run-rate of 1bn a month – on iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches, over a longer period than Google’s total. Apple has more than 200m customers’ payment details, far ahead of its rivals, thanks to its longstanding iTunes music and film download service.Android-based phones overtook Apple’s iPhone in global smartphone market share in the first half of 2010. In the third quarter of 2011, Android was the operating system in 52.5 per cent of smartphones sold globally, compared with Apple’s 15 per cent, BlackBerry’s 11 per cent and Microsoft’s 1.5 per cent, according to Gartner, a research group.But analysts believe that, on average, Apple users download twice as many apps as Android owners.That suggests that iPhone buyers are more active and engaged users, while customers choose Android because its devices are less expensive.Google hopes to encourage more of its users to make a first app purchase with a 10-day ­promotion starting on Tuesday, selling selected apps for 10p, $0.10 and €0.10.Misha Lyalin, chief of Zeptolab, the developer behind best-selling mobile game Cut the Rope, said that his group made 10 to 20 times more revenue from iOS than from Android in a typical month.“We are not making very much money from Android even though we have been number one [app] for three months,” Mr Lyalin told the Financial Times. He said the smaller Apple platform was “really great about monetisation …There is a huge gap, a really big one.”Google said: “Many developers have found developing for Android to be profitable and we’re seeing more and more of them choose to launch apps and features on Android first.”
199;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-12-06T13:48:50Z;Data centres: To buy or to lease?;Outsourcing IT services can offer huge savings, but security can be a concern;Traditionally, corporations have either bought or leased heavy-duty equipment.Today, the decision is whether to build their own data centres or to lease space in a shared facility. The latter option, known as co-locating, is becoming more popular, as it can allow companies to avoid a large initial investment while still owning their IT assets, and to expand more rapidly.Buying remains the best choice for businesses that want to retain control over the facilities that handle and store their data.Whether to buy or lease – or do both – also depends on a company’s needs and IT capability. But for many, the risks of building their own data centre outweigh the advantages.The main risk lies in capacity planning, This can trip up even large retailers such as Target, whose website crashed in September when a multitude of shoppers sought access to an exclusive line of clothing, luggage and housewares from Missoni, an Italian designer.Companies that lease space can normally tap into a provider’s spare capacity to handle a surge in traffic or to expand quickly. Meanwhile, those that own may face a large bill for maintenance, equipment or revamping sites within a few years of their construction. One reason for this is that power needs tend to double every six to eight months as servers handle more.”There is no good way to predict what the technical footprint will be,” says analyst Rachel Dines of Forrester Research, an IT market analyst company. Leasing is “almost always less expensive once you factor in risk and other real-world scenarios, since people don’t think about all the things that can go wrong”.Ms Dines led a recent survey of 15 companies, which concluded that building a data centre was “uneconomical” in most cases. “Most wouldn´t admit to building something and it having run out of capacity,” she says.“But it happens quite a bit that a company builds a data centre and five to seven years later it needs to do a retrofit that costs as much as the initial build.”Few companies built their own data centres during the downturn of 2009-10, shying away from committing capital to construction projects, according to Ted Chamberlin, research director at Gartner, the IT research company.“It boils down to what your competency is, and few have competency in building, designing or running and maintaining [heating, ventilation and air conditioning.” Gartner estimates that co-location will increase by 13 per cent a year up to 2016.Financial services and technology are two of the industries with the greatest need – and expertise – to control their own facilities and their operations, and keep their data close to their IT staff. Technology businesses that leased space when they were small, such as Twitter, now have enormous data centres of their own.“We’re not at the stage where all the factors are pointing either toward renting or leasing,” says Alistair Maughan, a partner who focuses on outsourcing and technology projects at Morrison & Foerster, the law firm.“But the reason to have your own [centre] is security. You have no issues of sharing capacity with a potential competitor or giving someone else access to your clients’ data.”Of course, third-party providers are not perfect. A few years ago, a leased data centre in Dallas was closed by an electrical transformer that exploded. Providers have also been known to force companies from their space to make room for larger clients.But the industry has been around for some time now and has by and large learnt to avoid the growing pains of cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google.Companies need to write their leasing contracts carefully. The high switching costs mean providers often take advantage of captive customers to demand higher prices or cut services. Legal issues add another layer of complexity, as movement of clients data must comply with the regulations of each jurisdiction.The UK Data Protection Act, for example, mandates that European Union data can only be moved out of the EU under certain circumstances. Data stored in the US are subject to the Patriot Act, which gives the US government the right to access data for national security purposes.A common approach is to use a combination of leasing and ownership. This allows companies to control a primary data centre and outsource less strategic ones. This can also provide an emergency back-up. Some of the world’s largest companies, including banks, are starting to outsource certain functions such as email and order processing, while keeping their core financial applications in-house.The outsourcing of data centres is part of a trend towards outsourcing IT services, which is a boon for groups such as India’s Infosys. “Most companies are trying to get rid of the fixed costs of IT, or to keep them low, while bringing in the flexibility to add programs and products,” says BG Srinivas, Infosys’s global head of manufacturing, engineering services and enterprise mobility and head of Europe.“Today, if business picks up, companies can use partners to meet the increased demand. They don’t have to go to the trouble fo recruitiing extra staff – they just call us.”
200;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-12-06T13:48:50Z;Future proofing: Uncertainty is the only sure thing;So rapid is the pace of technological change that the more flexible upgrades can be, the better;As companies negotiate a stubbornly sluggish economy, decisions about investing in new technology are becoming increasingly critical.Businesses are thinking more carefully how about how to future-proof their upgrades, so they have the flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, say executives and analysts.At McDonald’s annual investor meeting in early November, analysts asked executives at the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues, when it would begin converting its analogue menu boards to digital. Jim Johannesen, chief operating officer of McDonald’s USA, said the company was waiting for the prices of digital boards to fall.“We are going to continue to migrate to a more contemporary menu board inside restaurants and at the drive-throughs,” Mr Johannesen said. “They are not digital, but they have been designed to be retrofitted to digital. It’s very important to our owner/operators that they only buy things once.”The flexibility Mr Johannesen discussed is being applied beyond menus, as companies of all kinds look for ways to ensure their investments do not become obsolete.“Too many fundamentally disruptive changes are happening in information technology, from the cloud to mobile to social to new analytics,” says Bo Parker, managing director of the centre for technology and innovation at PwC. “The future is just too hard to know. What is required more than anything is agility.”Technology experts argue that companies need to spend more time on long-term planning to account for technological change. Kimberly Harris-Ferrante, an analyst at Gartner, the IT research company, says insurers that lack long-term business strategies are at risk of building or buying “legacy” systems that quickly become outdated.“Insurers should start asking ‘What could the market look like in 10 years,’” Ms Harris-Ferrante wrote in a recent research note. “The speed of industry change is accelerating, and long-term vision is critical to insulate IT investments, to ensure that investments today meet current and future business demands and to keep up with market changes.”Gartner advises companies to find ways of lowering IT infrastructure maintenance and ownership costs, to get better at gathering feedback from users of new technology and to look for alternative and consolidated IT software systems.According to Mr Parker, companies need to be less internally focused when they think about their technology needs, as social media and cloud computing become increasingly relevant. “It creates more risk not to engage with the changes, from next-generation analytics to the cloud, because it has the potential to make competitors more effective,” he says.However, any adoption of new technology has inherent risks. Big pharmaceutical companies had been using Facebook pages to promote their drugs. But when Facebook said this year that the companies were no longer allowed to maintain corporate pages that were not open to comments, they had to shut their pages for fear that comments could mislead customers.The evolving risks and opportunities in the shifting IT landscape are creating a greater need for specialists who can spot trends and implement fixes quickly. A survey by Modis, an IT staffing group, found that cloud computing, software as a service, security and mobile solutions are the leading technology areas poised for growth.“When we talk to chief information officers and IT decision-makers, they regularly bring up these key areas as vital in their organisation,” says Jack Cullen, president of Modis. “Finding technologists with experience and skills in these areas is critical for their IT departments.”Meanwhile, one of the biggest steps to successful future proofing is undoing IT systems and software that never were future-proofed. Rick Kneipper, co-founder and chief strategy officer of Anthelio, a healthcare IT company, says hospitals are fearful of making initial investments that will require undoing their complex methods of tracking patient information.“The mentality has always been that hospitals will have a big tech budget, with IT being part of it,” Mr Kneipper says, explaining why hospitals have been slow to adopt technology such as cloud computing.Healthcare IT is a fast growing industry, because hospitals in the US are in the process of switching to electronic medical records. Mr Kneipper says the healthcare industry faces many of the same challenges as other sectors when investing in new technology, in particular deciding whom to trust when it comes to installing and maintaining the equipment.It is not always clear if a vendor will be around in five or 10 years and will still be a company one would wish to do business with, Mr Kneipper says.
201;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-12-06T13:48:50Z;Budgets: Business wants to keep a hand on the tap;Chief information officers are under greater scrutiny to ensure projects offer value and a sound business case;Information technology spending might have weathered the recent economic travails, but a recovery is far from certain.According to Gartner, the industry analysts, the rate of growth in global IT spending is slowing. Whereas enterprises are expected to spend 5.9 per cent more on technology in 2011 than in 2010, in 2012, the forecast is 3.9 per cent more than in 2011. This will represent an annual total of $2,700bn. Gartner expects growth up to 2015 to improve to an annual average of 5.4 per cent.Global figures can be misleading, and the spending picture varies widely depending on the region and industry. In 2011, for example, Gartner expects spending in Europe, the Middle East and Africa to fall 1.4 per cent, with a drop of 1.8 per cent in western Europe alone.Evidence of continuing pressure on budgets, especially in western Europe, is echoed by those on the ground. “We saw a softening of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2011, more so than expected,” says David Elton, of PA Consulting Group. “That is making people think about next year’s budgets a lot more carefully.”Businesses that had restarted investment programmes in 2009 or 2010 are not necessarily halting them, as they did in 2008, but they are placing projects under greater scrutiny, looking for ways to cut costs, especially, capital expenditure. In respect of the latter, they are trying to achieve a return on investment at an earlier stage.Mr Elton says: “People are still planning on investments in IT, but they are being challenged to do so with 10 per cent less, so they are having to prioritise.”Making budgets go further is the order of the day. So too is ensuring projects are tracked and measured, and that the IT purchased is more flexible.“Projects with a shorter pay-back tend to be authorised more quickly,” says Andy Horton, supply chain director of BDR Thermea, a manufacturer of heating equipment based in the Netherlands. “It is more difficult to approve a project with a three- to four-year pay-back.”The business recently developed a company-wide demand management system with Hughenden Consulting, a firm that focuses on supply chain, because the project would pay for itself in two years and, at €500,000, was relatively inexpensive in the context of the company’s €50m annual investment spending.In line with another trend in enterprise IT spending, funds for the project are coming from the company’s central supply chain budget, rather than from IT.For larger-scale IT investments, the decision to spend or not to spend is increasingly taken on an enterprise-wide basis. Smaller projects, and those that primarily affect IT’s internal systems, are more likely to be planned and funded by the chief information officer (CIO).“There is an appetite to invest, but the business wants to keep a hand on the tap,” explains Matt Peers, CIO of Deloitte, the professional services firm.“It wants a delivery model it can turn on or off as the economy allows. During this time of jitters about the economy, no one wants to over-invest.” For spending on IT systems themselves, he says, “it is largely down to trust”.Earning that trust, CIOs say, means ensuring IT continues to perform, in all economic conditions.“You have to keep in mind that IT is an overhead,” says Frank Modruson, CIO at Accenture, the consulting firm. “If you can do it for less, you should.”“We look at every invoice to see if there is a better or cheaper way of doing it. We are always looking at new ways of delivering technology,” agrees Paul Caris, CIO at Eversheds, an international law firm headquartered in London.“Like many organisations, we are interested in what the consumer technology landscape looks like, with cheap or free services.” Eversheds uses Skype both internally and with clients. The latter appreciate the free-to-use service, which they can access from their overseas offices without having to make a large upfront investment in teleconferencing equipment.There is an added benefit for Eversheds, Mr Caris says, in that lawyers are “starting to enjoy using the technology, rather than just tolerating it”.But enthusiasm in a business for consumer technology can lead to pressure on CIOs to support executives’ pet projects, whether in communications, mobility or, increasingly, the cloud.Although some consumer technology can and does save money, some can also bring hidden costs for IT, especially in security and management. Cloud and other IT services bought by business units, rather than through IT, can also give rise to uncoordinated and possibly higher spending.To counter this, and to handle other budgetary pressures, IT projects need a strong governance framework, and businesses need to make more effort to analyse the results of their investments.“IT should have a relationship management function to help understand people’s needs and to pull them through into the business case,” says Mr Peers. “There is a formal process for post-implementation evaluation. We do that badly – and so do a lot of companies.”But IT departments are becoming far more rigorous, both in building and in validating their business cases.“We have postmortems to establish the hard dollar benefits,” says Accenture’s Mr Modruson. “We ask internal audit to validate that the benefits are accurate. If you overstate the benefits, the board won’t believe you the next time.”
202;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-12-06T13:48:50Z;IT departments must deliver more for less;Outside the global big spenders, many face little or no growth in their budgets;"Companies will spend $2,700bn in 2012 on information technology products and services, a 3.9 per cent increase over the current year, according to Gartner, the IT research company.“The days when IT was the passive observer of the world are over,” says Peter Sondergaard, head of research at Gartner. “Global politics and the global economy are being shaped by IT,” he says. “It is a primary driver of business growth. This year, 350 companies will each invest more than $1bn in IT. They are doing this because IT impacts their business performance.”But outside the global big spenders, the uncertain economic outlook and spending constraints mean many IT departments face little or no growth in their budgets.That hard fact creates a classic dilemma for chief information officers (CIOs) and IT leaders who know that business executives increasingly look to IT to drive growth and competitive advantage.“In the current economic climate, companies are being asked to do more with less,” says Sanjiv Gossain, head of UK and Ireland operations at Cognizant, the Indian IT outsourcing company. “Existing spending is being scrutinised and reduced, and yet companies are expected to continue to innovate and grow,” he says.He points out that a recent study of Europe’s boardrooms by Cognizant and Warwick Business School showed that, while outsourcing is still a large part of expenses in the IT department, the majority do not measure the financial impact that outsourcing-generated innovation has.Nevertheless, two-thirds of chief executives still believe IT will make a greater contribution to their industry in the next 10 years than in any prior decade.“For chief information officers to thrive in this environment, they must lead from the front and reimagine IT,” Mr Sondergaard says. “IT leaders must embrace the post-modern business, a business driven by customer relationships, fuelled by the explosion in information, collaboration, and mobility.”More specifically, he and many industry CIOs believe they must seize the initiative and embrace new ways of doing things, such as cloud services and the consumerisation of IT, to meet the aspirations of their boardroom counterparts – while remaining within budget.Mark Brewer, the long-serving CIO at Seagate, the hard-drive manufacturer, agrees. But he cautions that moving IT processes to the cloud does not always save money. He suggests cloud-based outsourcing can free internal IT resources to used on project work, rather than the routine maintenance that typically consumes so much time.“I think all IT departments need to ask themselves: ‘Do we want to have lots of people that are servicing and supporting hardware and software that is not strategic to the company?’ I don’t think I do,” says Mr Brewer. “I would rather have those people working on core things that the company has a strategic interest in and need for.”From a budget perspective, another possible advantage of moving work that would typically require investment in hardware to the cloud or a third party provider, is that it can shift spending from the capital expenditure budget to operating expenses.“So maybe I can take pieces of the (IT) environment and outsource them, pay an ‘opex’ expense on it, but not have people working on it,” says Mr Brewer.Since cloud services are typically paid for on a per-user or “utility” basis, the move to cloud computing can help accommodate seasonal or unpredictable usage without requiring investment in infrastructure such as data centres, which might sit underused for much of the time.“Customers want choices as they consider cloud solutions, so they can respond quickly to changing demands in an uncertain business climate,” says Brett Caine, general manager of the online services division of Citrix, the US company specialised in remote working technologies.“Some will prefer to develop their own private clouds, while others will adopt secure, on-demand, pay-as-you-go services. By taking steps now, valuable insights and experience can be gained, enabling more confidence in making the right business decisions.”In many large companies that operate their own server-intensive infrastructure as well as among cloud-based service providers, data centres have become a focus of attention and possible cost savings.For example TelecityGroup, Europe’s largest data-centre operator, has invested $1m in improving the energy efficiency of its estate.The company’s initiatives include fitting 250,000 plastic “blanking panels” to fill the gaps between the servers in the racks and stop the hot and cold air mixing; replacing fixed-speed air conditioning fans with variable speed drive units (this paid for itself in six months); retrofitting free air cooling (which also paid for itself during the first winter); and raising temperatures in newer data centres in line with the latest guidelines, from about 21C to 26C, which can save up to 20 per cent on the total cooling bill.Other companies are making more effective use of their IT budgets by modernising and streamlining existing – often paper-based – processes to achieve significant savings.For example, Sanofi-Aventis, the French multinational pharmaceutical company, is using Microsoft’s SharePoint to revamp its R&D process. As at other pharma companies, R&D is critical to Sanofi’s success, and global drug trials are a huge part of the process.The old process was time-consuming and depended on paper-based processes to manage each trial, producing thousands of documents. Sanofi expects the new digitised process to save $9m over the next few years.Other experts argue that, since technology changes quickly, it is important for companies to analyse their requirements carefully before deciding how and where to spend the budget.“The question about making the right choices at the time of so much change in technology and indeed business is best answered by looking at the expected time span of the solution and degree of integration required,” says Andy Mulholland, chief technology officer at Capgemini, the consultancy.“Many technologies are evolutionary when applied to the existing IT environment and so decisions are based on relatively low-impact issues; that is, a minor improvement to operating existing servers with a strong cost pay-off.”“But it is in the relatively new areas of business analytics, social customer relationship management and mobility that it really matters.”"
203;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-12-02T20:55:49Z;Thomson Reuters: time pressures;With more changes on the way, the company embarks on another reorganisation;"It was only a matter of time before Tom Glocer ran out of – well, time. The departing chief executive of Thomson Reuters has two achievements to his credit. He saved Reuters from becoming history after taking the helm at the UK news group in 2001. And he sold it at the best possible moment (May 2007) for the best possible price ($17bn). But he failed to make the integration work. The Thomson family has now moved to replace him with chief operating officer Jim Smith; Mr Smith will have to prove that Thomson Reuters is not a permanent company-in-transition story.As well as changing the chief executive, Thomson Reuters is undertaking another reorganisation. It has already put its healthcare information unit up for sale; now it is forming five business units. That suggests that the restructuring of the group’s most troublesome bit – its markets information service – begun by Mr Glocer this summer, was not progressing. The unit, which delivers market information, accounts for 60 per cent of group revenues, but these are sluggish: growth was only 1 per cent in the third quarter, compared with 10 per cent for the professional information division. Part of the problem is Eikon, a trading platform launched into a severe downturn for traders and investors.The Thomson family, which owns 55 per cent of Thomson Reuters, is right to demand a better return on its investment. The problem is that the family set the bar very high at the outset by paying a multiple of more than 40 times 2006 earnings when it bought Reuters. Since then the group’s share price has fallen 47 per cent – including a 27 per cent slide to date this year. Its shares trade at about 13 times estimated 2011 earnings, a big and justified discount to rivals such as Gartner or IHS given the lack of visibility on its transition. Mr Smith needs to nail down an overdue integration.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
204;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-11-09T00:07:07Z;Apple introduces DIY check-out by mobile app;;Apple has simplified shopping at its bricks-and-mortar stores by introducing new ordering and payment methods that underscore its credentials as a pacesetter in retail innovation.The technology group, which is influencing retail after transforming computing, music and mobile phones, on Tuesday made it possible for customers to pick up online orders in a store and introduced a self-check out facility.The changes, which were made via updates to its online shopping app, will accelerate the way mobile communications technology is blurring the boundary between online and offline retail.“Just as Amazon set the tone online, Apple is starting to set the tone on in-store experience and other retailers will be inspired to follow,” said Cathy Halligan, a former chief marketing officer at Walmart.com.But Gale Daikoku, Gartner retail technology analyst, said Apple’s moves did not herald a dramatic change because of security concerns and customers’ general preference for dealing with other human beings.“This is a really cool thing,” she said. “Is it something we will see massively adopted? I don’t think anytime soon.”The self-check out facility, called EasyPay, lets customers buy accessories less valuable than computers and phones without any direct contact with an Apple employee, a process that some other retailers remain wary of due to worries about theft.Consumers who are logged into an Apple account on their smartphone can scan the bar code of a product in a store and buy it using the credit card linked to that account.Apple said store employees could ask to see the electronic receipts that will be loaded on to smartphones during the transactions.Self-check out facilities that take cash or credit cards were pioneered by grocery stores in order to speed up check out queues and reduce staffing costs.Mike Gatti, executive director of marketing at the National Retail Federation, said: “This is Apple taking it to the next level, using the mobile device with your payment information in the cloud. It’s going to be the mobile wallet.”The in-store pick up facility lets consumers use the Apple Store app to search the inventory of nearby stores for the item they want, order and pay for it online, then pick it up in person as soon as one hour later.“Consumers want convenience and they want to make sure there is no wasted trip to the stores,” said Ms Halligan, who is now senior vice-president of sales and marketing at PowerReviews, a social commerce company.Retailers that already allow in-store pick up, such as Walmart and Home Depot, say it is also popular with customers who do not want to wait for an online purchase to be delivered.Target and other big retailers also have apps that let consumers scan bar codes to find product information, but they do not enable purchases.Ebay, the online marketplace, has begun to sell retailers services similar to those unveiled by Apple through its new X.commerce business, which includes the PayPal payments system and RedLaser, a barcode scanner.
205;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-11-08T16:49:00Z;Corporate spending on IT security;Guest Column: Focus on IT security;"Business leaders increasingly want to know if what they are spending on information technology (IT) is equivalent to organisations within their industry, geography and size. It allows them to benchmark themselves against industry norms. Typically, spending is measured based on IT being a share of the company’s revenue or expenses, or in the case of financial institutions, assets under management. But true organisational spending may be difficult to determine because IT is found virtually everywhere in the enterprise and may be buried under other budget categories.And the numbers are huge. Gartner projects that worldwide enterprise IT spending is projected to total $2,700bn in 2012, a 3.9 per cent increase from 2011. While enterprise IT spending growth is slowing, it’s important to note that despite the global economic challenges, organisations will continue to invest in IT. In fact, this year 350 companies will each invest more than $1bn in IT.Looking deeper into the numbers, our research suggests that on, average, approximately 4 per cent of a company’s operational and capital expenses is allocated to IT. Of that, an average of 5.6 per cent of the overall IT budget is allocated to information security, but the range is fairly wide.Knowing how much is being spent on IT security is an indicator of whether organisations are practicing due diligence in security and related programs. But an accurate assessment of what makes up an IT budget, and particularly an IT security budget, is difficult given the cross-technology support of the security discipline and the variety of programs and projects that can be included. Understanding the “true” budget for IT, and for subsets of that budget such as IT security, is necessary to help evaluate whether the organisation is spending appropriately.Many business leaders do not know how much is being spent on IT, and in particular, on IT security. This is partly because few cost accounting systems break out security as a separate line item, and many security-relevant processes are carried out by staff who are not devoted full time to security, making it impossible to accurately account for security personnel.Any statistics on explicit security spending are inherently “soft” because they understate the true magnitude of investments in IT security, since security features are incorporated into hardware, software or initiatives not specifically dedicated to security. While such spending may be outside of the Chief Information Security Officer’s (CISO) budget, the security department should be an influencer or advisor on spending elsewhere, and thus should often have visibility into such spending.For example, networking equipment that has embedded security functions, such as supporting Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) or otherwise encrypting data in motion, may be charged to telecommunications or data communications budgets, and various types security as a service may be positioned as “staff augmentation”; that is, an extension of staff, and may be charged to the general salary or consulting portion of the IT budget. Also, security training and awareness programs are often funded by HR departments.Gartner believes that organisations should be spending between 3 per cent and 6 per cent of their IT budget on IT security; lower in the range if they have mature systems, higher if they are wide open and at risk. This represents the budget under the control and responsibility of the CISO, and not the “real” or total budget. However, there will not be a consistent percentage of IT spending, or IT security spending, found across industries, geographies or companies of similar sizes, in part because of market conditions, compliance issues, technology evolution, political considerations and other dynamics.We recommend that business and technology leaders gain an accurate understanding of their “real” IT security budget. Specifically, CISOs should track what the IT security budget supports to help determine whether the organization is demonstrating due care and commercially reasonable security. However, if the overall security budget appears out of proportion to other expenditures, then it may become a target for budget review. Finally, security managers should include estimates of measurable security improvement with every request for spending, and business units should be required to include security spending in all IT project requests.The author is a research vice president at Gartner and this is the first in a series of articles about IT and security."
206;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-11-08T14:49:53Z;E-discovery: Manage your data wisely – regulators now have teeth;Companies need to address demands that could arise from an investigation, says Jessica Twentyman;New rules on how businesses should behave are always good news for suppliers of e-discovery products – which search corporate information systems for evidence in a regulatory inquiry or legal case.The UK Bribery Act came into force on July 1 2011 and the first case tried under the law involved a 22-year old administrative clerk at a Magistrates’ Court in east London.He was found guilty, in October, of taking a £500 bribe not to enter details of a traffic summons on a court database.This case is unlikely to worry large companies, but there will be much more to come, warn lawyers and e-discovery vendors.And what could be a better showcase for e-discovery than a meaty, high-profile court case, where a large company is ordered to produce volumes of emails, electronic documents and transactional records to defend itself?Either way, business leaders need to sit up and take note of their e-discovery responsibilities, not just under the Bribery Act and its US equivalent, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but a range of other regulations.Mark Surguy, a partner at Eversheds, a law firm, says: “Regulatory investigations are on the increase. There are more organisations out there with the power to demand that companies produce evidence of their business dealings, both in the form of industry-specific regulators and law enforcement agencies,” he says.“It’s now widely recognised by these authorities that, in such cases, the bulk of evidence is likely to be found in digital formats.“Even if your organisation doesn’t know exactly what information it holds or how to identify relevant electronic evidence, you should be worried that the opposing side will know,” Mr Surguy says.What many companies at the receiving end of regulatory investigations fail to recognise, he says, is that hunting down that information (often to tight deadlines) can be both time-consuming and costly. As a result, the tendency is not to deal with the issue until an e-disclosure order arrives on the boss’s desk.Dean Gonsowski, e-discovery counsel in the information management group at Symantec, a security software company, believes the answer lies in making e-discovery a “repeatable business process”, rather than a one-off response to a request.That means establishing company-wide rules on electronic information, governing what should be deleted or retained, applying those rules and using e-discovery software to retrieve information quickly, he says.The market for e-discovery products, according to a May 2011 assessment by Gartner, an IT market research company, is “volatile and overcrowded”.However, Gartner analysts Debra Logan and John Bace expect that by 2014, one in four enterprise e-discovery vendors to have been eliminated through consolidation.That process is under way: Symantec bought Clearwell Systems in July 2011, while in August, Hewlett-Packard snapped up Autonomy, the e-discovery market leader.Looking ahead, technology decision-makers need to consider the range of information sources to be interrogated, says Mr Gonsowski.Many companies still believe email is the main target of e-discovery requests.In fact, he says, Symantec’s recent Information and E-discovery Survey 2011 of 2,000 companies worldwide shows email in third place (cited by 58 per cent as the most frequently requested information source), behind files/documents (67 per cent) and database/applications data (61 per cent).Investigators are increasingly asking for social media records from Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts, and corporate blogs, along with instant messages and mobile phone texts, says Mr Gonsowski.One provider, X1 Discovery, recently announced a specific product, X1 Social Discovery, aimed at social media content.Ms Logan has predicted that, by the end of 2013, half of all companies will have been asked to produce material from social media websites for e-discovery.If business leaders hope to answer inquiries effectively, their understanding of e-discovery must, at the very least, match that of the regulators, says Kelvin McGregor-Alcorn, director in the analytic and forensic technology practice at Deloitte, a consultancy.He says: “Regulators that once had strong gums now have strong teeth, too. They’re more active in pursuing their claims. Their requests for information are broader than ever.“And they’re more sophisticated in their understanding of what they’re looking for, even before a request is made.”
207;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-11-03T20:25:34Z;Hollywood’s biggest tech star;;A few months ago Hollywood actor Nolan North – shiny chestnut hair, porcelain teeth, gym-honed pecs – was flying out of Los Angeles International Airport. As he passed through security he turned to the guard and asked what to do with his laptop. The security man winked. “We’ll let it slide for Nathan Drake,” he said, beaming broadly: “I’m a huge fan.”This security guard had not identified Mr North by his looks, handsome though they are, but his voice. For he provides the voice and movement for Nathan Drake, the action hero of Uncharted, Sony’s massively successful PlayStation video game.The fictional protagonist is said to be a descendant of English explorer and buccaneer Sir Francis Drake. Reviewers have described Nathan Drake variously as “dreamy”, “handsome” and responsible for many a “man-crush” – a mix of Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis and the type of male leads you would find in pulp movies and fiction.Mr North’s recognition in LAX, via his avatar, is a mark of the game’s wide appeal and the gradual encroaching of the virtual into the real world. The series (parts one and two) has sold more than 7.2m copies in Europe alone, and the highly praised Uncharted 3, released this month, is also expected to sell well.The gaming market is growing rapidly. Gartner this year reported worldwide spending on gaming hardware, software and online was $67bn in 2010, rising to $74bn this year, and is projected to reach more than $100bn by 2015. This is fuelled by a demographic lurch into the mainstream – gamers are no longer antisocial teenage boys in darkened bedrooms.Until recently Mr North had relished the anonymity of a video game. “I won’t be in People magazine,” he muses. Though he admits he is a neurotic regular at the gym just in case fans do recognise him and look at him with “disappointment”.There is another reason for this exercise regime – his body is the building block for his character. Uncharted uses performance capture – a technique also used in blockbuster films such as Avatar and the Lord of the Rings trilogy – to record electronically the movements and facial expressions of actors before using that information to animate their digital characters.On a bright autumnal day in London, Mr North, in a white linen shirt and cargo pants, reflects on his entry into the gaming world. His early ambition was to be a broadcast reporter rather than an actor and he attended the University of North Carolina on a baseball scholarship, majoring in journalism.After a year of reporting he realised it was not for him, and he did a brief stint as a stand-up comic in New York before relocating to Hollywood. His big break came soon after, when he was cast as Dr Chris Ramsey in Port Charles, a daytime soap opera.Mr North auditioned for his first game in the late 1990s. It was for Interstate 82 – a vehicle combat game for the computer – developed by Activision and released in 1999. He laughs at the memory. “It was a weekend, there were no other cars in the parking lot and I worried I was going to get mugged,” he says. “I did a knock-off version of Christopher Walken. There was no agent involved or union.” He left with cash in hand.It was the start of a new career. Now he is the most prolific actor in this brave new world, having featured in more than 100 games including Batman, Call of Duty and Halo 3. “Games are what people know me for. It pays for my children’s education,” he says.He rebuffs any suggestion that acting in a video game is the lowest rung of his profession’s hierarchy. “The lowest rung of the ladder is bartending, and not acting,” he says. His mantra is “actors act”.The skill required, he adds, is very different to people’s preconceptions. “A lot of people think for video games you go into a video booth and yell,” he says.He points to Andy Serkis, perhaps the world’s leading performance capture actor, who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings as well as a primate in The Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Captain Haddock in Steven Spielberg’s The Adventures of Tintin. “Serkis said what we do is proper acting with digital make-up. Uncharted is like that.”Amy Henning, the creative director at Naughty Dog which makes Uncharted, says the key difference between films and gaming is that in the latter, actors “must check their ego at the door”.However, Mr North has been burnt by the involvement of big film actors. “As games become bigger, money makers, producers start to think they should get celebrities and pay them exorbitant sums,” he says. “It’s insulting. They won’t do as good a job. They make demands.”He recalls one job where he was offered $1,600 for the role only to be trounced by a big mainstream star who cost $100,000. “He was flown across the country and put up in a hotel. I was bumped out,” he grumbles.Nonetheless, Mr North is hopeful that as video games and film converge – sharing special effects, filming methods and storylines – the snobbery towards games will diminish. Indeed, Christina Hendricks, the actress best known for her portrayal of secretary Joan Holloway in HBO television series Mad Men, revealed in October that she would appear in Electronic Arts’ Need for Speed franchise, playing Sam Harper, “a woman with ambition, street smarts and a penchant for lightning fast cars”.A gaming enthusiast asked Mr North recently if, as a child, the 41-year-old had dreamed of becoming a star in this virtual world. Mr North cracks up at the idea. “When I was a kid, the only video­game was Pac-Man.”
208;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-10-30T12:45:53Z;Manufacturers ready to battle slowdown;;Most of the world’s big manufacturers are in better shape than three years ago to weather the looming economic storms and should steer through 2012 without serious damage to profits, according to industrial experts.Even so, an overdependence on China for creating demand growth has added to the risks for big manufacturers as they brace themselves for a difficult spell due to a slowing world economy.In the past two weeks, several large manufacturers such as the German chemicals group BASF and US industrial business Honeywell have warned of slowing orders, as company activity is hit by economic weakness in the US and Europe, as well as signs of a slowdown in China.More indications of nervousness may emerge this week, as large production companies including the Luxembourg-based steelmaker ArcelorMittal and French engineering group Alstom unveil quarterly results.However, companies’ cautious approach in the past two years over hiring new employees and expanding plants means many of them are “lean and battle-ready”, according to Kevin O’Marah, vice-president for supply chain research at the Gartner business consultancy.We’ll see a slowing in profits growth among manufacturing businesses, but it won’t be a disaster“In 2012 we’ll see a slowing in profits growth among manufacturing businesses, but it won’t be a disaster,” said Barry Misthal, head of global manufacturing at PwC, the consultancy.IHS Global Insight, an economics research group, has also expressed relative confidence. It says that global industrial output – mainly manufacturing but also covering energy – is likely to rise 4 per cent next year compared to 2011, as against a 2.7 per cent growth expected for total world gross domestic product.When the financial crisis hit in 2008, many big makers of goods from industrial materials to factory equipment experienced big cuts in orders, leading to markedly lower production during 2009 and serious shortfalls in profits, along with large employment reductions.As signs of economic fragility have become more evident in the past few weeks, only a few large manufacturers have so far announced a serious slowing in activity.An exception was French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroën, which last week said it would cut 6,000 jobs in Europe next year and reduced its earnings forecast. Other companies such as General Electric of the US and Switzerland’s ABB have been relatively upbeat.But Jay Swaminathan, a manufacturing and technology professor at the University of North Carolina, says a “flipside” to any general optimism is that too many companies have become dependent on emerging nations led by China – but also including India and Brazil – for demand expansion. Stephan Wagner, a manufacturing expert at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, said: “Around 2008, many industrial companies had two big growth markets: China and the US. Now, everything is focused on China.”PwC’s Mr Misthal said that if annual Chinese GDP growth fell from the levels of about 10 per cent in recent years to 6-7 per cent, this could cause “significant problems” for manufacturers.
209;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-10-28T16:23:19Z;Computer makers caught in wake of Thai floods;;Computer prices are set to rise following warnings by Acer and Samsung Electronics that severe flooding in Thailand would hit production and that they would pass resulting higher costs on to consumers.The comments are the most serious indication from technology groups that Thailand’s worst flooding in half a century , which has claimed hundreds of lives, will disrupt the global supply chain just ahead of the busy end-of-year season.Tens of thousands of people have fled Bangkok, which accounts for 40 per cent of the nation’s economic output for fear of further flooding this weekend.The biggest impact has been on the production of computer hard disc drives – key components whose prices have risen by up to 20 per cent since the floods began. But other industries have also been hit. Toyota, Honda and Nikon have all reported disruption in their operations and Sony said it would delay the launch of some of its new cameras due to the damage to production sites.Acer, the world’s fourth-biggest PC maker by volume, said it expected fourth-quarter sales to be 5-10 per cent lower than the previous quarter because of the floods. It had 10.6 per cent of the global PC market at the end of the third quarter, according to Gartner.Samsung, meanwhile, which has sizeable PC sales but is not in the top five, said that it expected supply shortages due to the floods, although it believed its own computer sales would not be hurt badly. Lenovo and Asustek have also warned that the PC industry generally would be hit by component supply shortages.Roughly a quarter of global hard drive assembly facilities are located in Thailand, according to industry tracker iSuppli, which estimates that supply would be constrained at least until the fourth quarter of 2012. Western Digital, the world’s biggest hard disc drive maker, has closed all its factories in Thailand.The impact on global hard disc drive production is severe not just because the biggest producers such as Western Digital are in Thailand, but also because a host of smaller component suppliers are clustered in nearby industrial parks.JT Wang, Acer chief executive, said “the whole PC production chain is stuck at a bottleneck” because of the constraints on hard disc supply.“This is not a problem that we can solve by ourselves and so we have started raising prices” to transfer the cost to customers, he said.Thai authorities have urged residents to evacuate flood-prone areas and called an emergency five-day holiday, as they warned the capital would soon be floodedSamsung said PC sales would be hurt generally, which would depress prices for D-Ram memory chips, which are a key PC component and a big revenue contributor for the South Korean company.“We expect PC sales to be lower than expected. As a result, we expect weakness in D-Ram prices,” a Samsung executive told a conference call on Thursday.The global tech supply chain has about two months’ worth of hard disc drive inventory available. Analysts and executives say that the full impact of the Thai floods on manufacturing will depend on how soon flood-hit areas can resume production.“If component suppliers are able to either recover Thailand factories or shift production to another location by the end of December, we believe the impact to PC companies will become more muted by the end of the March quarter,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note.Additional reporting by Song Jung-a in Seoul
210;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-10-28T15:40:17Z;Analytics: Numbers game is hard to play;Measuring the right data is crucial, says Rod Newing;Annual environmental reporting, especially the Global Reporting Initiative, has been a main driver for electronic environmental systems. However, the real need is for day-to-day analytical systems designed to produce improved environmental performance from a seemingly unmanageable mass of data.Most organisations have data warehouse and business intelligence systems that can manage the underlying data. But they need costly customisation to take account of the specific needs of environmental modelling and analysis, such as conversions of meter readings into carbon dioxide equivalent.They also need to include external data, such as the carbon efficiency of different sources of energy and transportation or carbon footprints of other companies in the supply chain. For this reason, most organisations use specialist software or cloud computing.Carbon reporting was the original trigger for environmental software development, but energy reduction now provides the business case. Simon Mingay, research vice-president at Gartner, says the big business software suite vendors have been very slow to move into the area, with SAP moving fastest and Oracle and Microsoft being very cautious.A whole range of specialists has emerged, including CA ecoSoftware, CarbonSystems, CloudApps, Greenstone Carbon Management and Hara. They join long established environmental health and safety vendors, such as Enablon, Enviance, IHS and SAP, and corporate social responsibility vendors, such as credit360, CSRware, ifu Hamburg and P-E International.Lifecycle assessment vendors that calculate the carbon footprint of a product, such as IFU Hamburg, P-E International and SAP are also popular.“Most enterprises are prepared to spend between £50,000 and £180,000, which is not a lot of money,” says Mr Mingay. “They have yet to recognise the additional value of the analytics.”When selecting an environmental analytical solution, Ed Kiernan, director at Deloitte Analytics, advises clients to ensure that it has pre-built environmental reporting intelligence, links to their enterprise resource planning and business intelligence systems and can support different regional regulations.A big issue is choosing the right data to gather. Salesforce.com collects 1,300 types of data from 100 sites around the world. It uses the CloudApps service, one of several sustainability services on its Force.com cloud platform.“Much of the sustainability conversation measures the wrong thing with great precision,” warns Peter Coffee, Salesforce.com’s head of platform research. “Don’t try to do the wrong thing better, do the better thing, by picking metrics that don’t obscure the most important opportunities.”Jyoti Banerjee, a partner in Fronesys, a specialist sustainability advisory service, says: “Most companies have not yet gone through the process of determining which environmental metrics are material to them.“Without that, you could end up tracking metrics which are fashionable in the marketplace, but not relevant to your business.”James Farrar, vice-president for sustainability at SAP, points out that while the corporate jet may be an easy target, its overall environmental impact compared with other outputs is usually minimal.Another problem with environmental systems is getting the attention of management. “You get buy-in from people around the business if you make the value clear to them,” says Andy Wales, head of sustainable development at SABMiller. The company’s system uses internal benchmarking and external reporting to compare with its peers.Similarly, Salesforce.com uses CloudApps’ Sustainability Momentum (SuMo) app to report to managers. “It turns what would otherwise be an eye-glazing business process into something with a little bit of spice and competition,” says Mr Coffee. “It is proving to be tremendously effective.”Peter Grant, chief executive of CloudApps, says the idea is to make environmental performance im­provement easy and fun by engaging some of the natural impulses of humans to experiment, compare results and compete.DHL Supply Chain, a contract logistics specialist, has a system covering thousands of locations in 220 countries and territories. Laura Bolton, its sustainability director, says the most important thing is not to have environmental data as a separate system, but part of the core business system.“We have an efficiency target – not an absolute one – that managers can compare with relevant key performance indicators to understand whether a given number is good,” she says.The biggest difficulty, concludes Mr Coffee, is “getting a corporate culture of looking at the numbers and sharing them in a way that prompts action”.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
212;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-10-26T17:52:50Z;Nokia’s future hinges on smartphone success;;For the first time in a long while, there was a real buzz at Nokia’s big annual event, Nokia World in London. Several thousand journalists, bloggers, developers and mobile phone industry executives crammed into the auditorium at the Excel centre to see two new handsets revealed that could help revitalise the flagging brand.Nokia may have come back from the edge with a stronger set of quarterly results last week, but it needs to make a success out of its Windows smartphones from its still shaky platform, if not the burning one so vividly portrayed by its chief executive, Stephen Elop, just seven months ago.On the Lumia Windows range rests Nokia’s future in the key high margin markets for the next few years, which means it needs to beat Apple’s iPhone 4S and the debuts of the Samsung Nexus and the Motorola Droid Razr into the pockets of the opinion formers this Christmas.The launch is not just key for Nokia. Microsoft, too, needs its Windows software to rise to the challenge against a duopoly of Apple and Google’s Android to become a third main mobile phone platform. Windows-based devices held just 1.6 per cent of the smartphone market in the second quarter, according to analysts at Gartner.One phone executive, who wished not to be named, said a third so-called phone “ecosystem” was crucialbut that the jury was still out whether the Nokia and Microsoft partnership would succeed.“Who will win the race for third? Neither have been a success in this space so far but never bet against Microsoft,” he said.Pierre Ferragu, analyst at Bernstein, said there was not much room left for a third operating system. “This product portfolio has only a limited chance of regaining ground against two operating systems that take 85 per cent of the high smartphone market, particularly as the price points appear uncompetitive at present.”“I now believe the company is unlikely to see a meaningful change in trends as it launches these products. Initial shipments may have only a limited impact on shipments and gross margins, but we would be surprised to see a lasting positive effect,” Mr Ferragu said.The devices do not appear overly innovative at first. The Lumia 800 flagship phone looks much like the N9 model that was launched by Nokia only a month ago, while the software that runs the applications is already in use in phones produced by HTC of Taiwan. Even so, the body of the N9 has received warm reviews for its sleek carbon-based design, and it boasts a screen larger than the iPhone.Nokia says the key to success will be the future product cycle, rather than the single new phone.“We are going through a transformation and those things take time. So it is one step at a time and we will learn from what we have done today: we will refine and we will keep going,” Mr Elop, told the Financial Times on Wednesday.In practice, this is likely to mean using its large bank of patents to build and protect innovative services as well as benefit from the early integration of Microsoft Windows updates.On Wednesday, a host of services were launched by Nokia to begin the process of creating a clear Nokia Windows brand, such as Nokia Drive location services, as well as music and social media applications. Exclusive content deals, such as one with ESPN, the sports broadcaster, will also be used to differentiate, said Jo Harlow, head of Nokia’s smart device division.Also it is a feat for Nokia to introduced a device in just eight months since the Microsoft partnership was formed. It is sign of transformation at a company much criticised for its 18-month product cycles.In addition, investors in Nokia may be encouraged that expectations in the company have fallen to such a low level that even modest success will result in a consensus-beating performance.Indeed, one investor even described Mr Elop’s “burning platform” memo as a work of a marketing skill in resetting expectations.
213;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-10-19T05:26:26Z;Samsung reveals response to Apple’s iPhone 4S;;Samsung and Google have unveiled their response to Apple’s iPhone 4S and its latest operating system in the shape of the Galaxy Nexus smartphone, using the new 4.0 version of Google’s Android software.The handset, debuted on Wednesday in Hong Kong, features 4G speeds, an improved camera and the biggest screen to be offered by Samsung on a phone, at 4.65 inches. It will be on sale in the US, Europe and Asia in November before being rolled out in other markets.Analysts said Samsung remained focused on advanced markets in Europe and the US rather than China.“We’re targeting the premium segment of the mobile handset market with this handset,” said Shin Jong-kyun, president of Samsung’s mobile communications business.Apple and Samsung, the leading maker of Android-based devices, have become bitter rivals in a battle for smartphone supremacy. Both have brought patent cases against one another around the world and each has tried to block sales of its rival’s smartphones in certain countries.Apple said it sold a record 4m units of the iPhone 4S in its first three days on sale. However, it disappointed Wall Street on Tuesday when it reported sales of 17m iPhones in its September quarter, 2m short of forecasts.Patent wars are raging in the smartphone industry. This interactive graphic shows the technology companies involved in patent lawsuits and licensing agreements.In contrast, Samsung told investors this month that the robust performance of its smartphone business has put its third-quarter profits on track to beat analysts’ expectations. The South Korean company is widely expected to have surpassed Apple in the third quarter as the biggest smartphone seller.The Galaxy Nexus and its operating system, codenamed Ice-cream Sandwich, match some of the features of the 4S and its iOS 5 operating system. Like the 4S, the camera allows pictures to be taken quickly without the usual lag and has full high-definition video recording. Android 4.0 has a new typeface for the highly detailed screen, similar to the Retina display features of the 4S.The Galaxy Nexus has a more curved design though and an almost edge-to-edge screen that does away with any physical buttons on its face. A near field communication (NFC) chip inside that can be used for mobile payments will also allow files to be transferred between devices.One new feature for a smartphone is Android 4.0’s ability to unlock the screen when the user stares at it, using facial recognition technology.Park Kang-ho, an analyst at Daishin Securities, said the latest device was meaningful in showing the strong relationship between Samsung and Google and to road-test Google’s upgraded operating system for the first time.Google’s Android, which is also used by other phone makers such as HTC and Motorola, is now by far the most widely used operating system for smartphones.Android handsets had a 43.4 per cent share of the smartphone market in the second quarter, compared to 18.2 per cent for the iPhone, according to Gartner, the research firm. Gartner analysts say Android is on track to command more than half of the market by the end of this year.While this latest phone is unlikely to be a game-changer, “Samsung’s strategy has never been about pushing one blockbuster but more about building a diverse product line-up to tackle various consumer segments,” said Mr Park.Samsung, the world’s second-biggest maker of mobile phones by volume, had planned to unveil its new device last week but delayed the launch in the wake of the death of Steve Jobs.Additional reporting by Robin Kwong in Taipei
214;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-10-18T09:45:07Z;It’s about information, not technology;Chief executives and chief financial officers are becoming more involved in IT decision-making, says Paul Taylor;How much do company chief executives need to know about IT? Traditionally, many business leaders outside the technology sector have had only a limited understanding, preferring to rely on their IT departments and chief information officer (CIO).According to a recent report by Booz & Co, the consultancy, the average age of chief executives is now about 51. That means that many grew up in the PC era and have witnessed the impact of technology on almost every part of business.“Chief executives do need to know more about IT – but not the detail,” says Mark Raskino, a research fellow at Gartner, the IT consultancy.“They need better understanding of how technology could improve the firm, but they can delegate a lot of the specifics.“For example, they need to understand how mobility, social networking or dynamic business process management could change the effectiveness of parts of their business models.”Unfortunately, the consultancy’s latest survey of chief executives suggests that even this level of understanding is often lacking.Mr Raskino points out that technology is one of the fastest moving and most disruptive forces in modern business.“A chief executive with a good grasp of how the major technology trends effects their industry, will at least be able to ensure that the company can play ‘fast follower’ effectively.“Chief executives who don’t think about technology, make it appear unimportant to their management teams, who may then marginalise it. This can leave the organisation vulnerable to attack by new business models.”The dangers are particularly acute when it comes to the adoption of technology tools such as business intelligence (BI) applications and executive dashboards, which are designed to provide leaders with greater insight into their company’s operations.“Many organisations mistakenly leave the championing of BI to the IT department,” says Alan Bowling, Chairman of the UK & Ireland SAP User Group, and a former chief information officer himself.IT should only be in charge of supporting the processes he argues, adding that board sponsorship is crucial, as is having as many senior “stakeholders” involved as possible.He believes the chief executive and finance director should certainly be involved, as well as stakeholders from each business unit, such as HR, procurement and IT.“Not having a say in what is behind the high-level figures can be disastrous and lead to assumptions that may be totally inappropriate for the business strategy,” he says.“Business intelligence can extract information that was previously held in silos and provide it in the detail needed for informed decision-making.“At the highest level, this could be ‘key performance indicators’ to show how the business is faring, or summaries of upward or downward trends that might require swift, decisive action.“At the same time, with an appropriate, flexible [executive] dashboard in place for the various BI users, those high-level decisions can cascade down to the rest of the organisation so that the whole business can be united behind overarching goals,” he says.Mr Bowling – whose career includes stints as IT director and then CIO at Northern Foods, which was a provider of chilled meals to UK supermarkets – says executives should plan their strategy and define metrics to ensure they get maximum value from BI.“Otherwise,” he warns, “they’ll have nothing to show for it and won’t be able to demonstrate its value.When done properly, Mr Bowling believes BI can arm executives with critical information to help their organisations become more flexible, allowing them to respond faster to changing markets and giving them an edge over the competition.Bob Weiler, executive-vice president for global business units at Oracle, the software group, agrees. “BI, which has its roots in the simplest of reports, has evolved rapidly in the past decade,” he says.“Business leaders have come to rely on the personalised dashboards that BI provides for high-level perspective as well as ‘deep dives’ into the numbers and data of the business lines behind the dashboard.”Today’s applications go far beyond early financial data-focused tools.Nowadays, says Mr Weiler, they are, “built to meet the needs of executives in specific industries, whether the head of governance, risk, and compliance in a financial services firm, a senior manager in the clinical research group at a leading pharmaceutical company …or a senior executive at a utility seeking [understanding of] the data from smart meter and smart grid deployments.”Cloud-based services are also having a profound effect on the dynamics of business.Cloud computing enables executives to tap into IT resources from third-party suppliers on a pay-as-you-go basis, freeing CIOs to think more strategically about business objectives and growth opportunities.A report published in July by Spencer Stuart, the executive recruitment company, says: “As it changes the landscape of business, cloud computing is also changing certain leadership roles in organisations, with no position more affected than that of the chief information officer.”That view is echoed by Nelson Fonseca, chief operating officer of Terremark Worldwide, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, the US telecommunications group.“The CIO has changed over the past several years from an IT position to a business leader position,” he says.“Cloud computing allows the CIO to focus more on the productivity of the applications the company will need to be successful, as opposed to worrying about the infrastructure to support those applications.”Meanwhile, chief executives and finance directors are becoming more involved in IT decision-making as they see opportunities to cut IT infrastructure costs and make technology into a competitive advantage.“You’re definitely seeing business heads weigh in a lot more on IT than ever before,” says Steve McWhirter, senior vice-president of enterprise sales for Asia-Pacific for Salesforce.com, the cloud computing company.“They are tired of software complexity, long implementations, maintenance and upgrade projects that add no value to the company’s bottom line.“The business is saying: ‘We can remove these headaches, be more agile, and create greater shareholder value.’ With cloud computing, CIOs have the freedom to meet the pace of innovation for their business without compromising on enterprise class requirements such as privacy, security and performance.”Do today’s chief information officers need to be an IT professionals, or can they delegate to a chief technology or infrastructure officer?Mr Raskino says: “The CIO does not require a computing technical background and today about a third of CIOs take other routes to the job.”Increasingly, he says, the role is about managing the information and processing assets of the business.Perhaps that is why a growing number of organisations, particularly in the financial services sector, are appointing CIOs with operational rather than technology experience.
215;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-10-17T14:32:50Z;IT chiefs must ‘lead from the front’;;Corporate information technology leaders must go on the offensive and “lead from the front” to drive innovation and growth, according to Peter Sondergaard, senior vice-president and global head of research at Gartner.“IT leaders must embrace the postmodern business, a business driven by customer relationships, fuelled by the explosion in information, collaboration and mobility,” he said.“The days when IT was the passive observer of the world are over,” Mr Sondergaard told an audience of 7,500 chief information officers and IT leaders at Gartner Symposium/ITxpo in Orlando.“For the IT leader to thrive in this environment, IT leaders must lead from the front and reimagine IT,” he said.“Global politics and the global economy are being shaped by IT, [which is] is a primary driver of business growth,” he noted. “For example, this year 350 companies will each invest more than $1bn in IT. They are doing this because IT impacts their business performance.”Overall Gartner is forecasting that the growth in worldwide enterprise IT spending will slow to 3.9 per cent and total $2,700bn in 2012, down from an increase of 5.9 per cent this year. While enterprise IT spending growth is slowing, Gartner said it is important to note that despite the global economic challenges, enterprises will continue to invest in IT.Two-thirds of chief executives believe IT will make a greater contribution to their industry in the next 10 years, more than any prior decades, said Gartner. This new era brings with it urgent and compelling forces, including cloud computing, social media, mobility and an explosion in information.“These forces are innovative and disruptive just taken on their own, but brought together, they are revolutionising business and society,” Mr Sondergaard said. “This nexus defines the next age of computing. To understand this change, you must appreciate each of the forces.”The cloud combines the industrialisation of IT capabilities and the disruptive impact of new IT-led business models.However, the shift away from traditional IT acquisition models to public cloud services is still in the very early stages. For example, Gartner estimates that while $74bn was spent on public cloud services in 2010, that only represented 3 per cent of enterprise spending. But public cloud services will grow five times faster than overall IT enterprise spending (19 per cent annually through 2015).“What supply chain models did to manufacturing is what cloud computing is doing to in-house data centres. It is allowing people to optimise around where they have differentiated capabilities,” Mr Sondergaard said.The next stage of social computing is about mass customer, mass citizen and mass employee involvement with enterprise systems.“With 1.2bn people on social networks, 20 per cent of the world’s population, social computing is in its next phase,” Mr Sondergaard said. “IT leaders must immediately incorporate social software capabilities throughout their enterprise systems.”The concept of one enterprise data warehouse containing all information needed for decisions is dead. Multiple systems, including content management, data warehouses, data marts and specialised file systems tied together with data services and metadata will become the “logical” enterprise data warehouse.“Information is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine,” Mr Sondergaard said. “Pursuing this strategically will create an unprecedented amount of information of enormous variety and complexity. This is leading to a change in data management strategies known as big data. This creates what we call a ‘pattern-based strategy architecture. An architecture that seeks signals, models them for their impact, and then adapt to the business process of the organisation.”The shift to mobile is almost overtaking many IT organisations who can’t move fast enough to catch up. Mobile is not a coming trend. It has already happened. In 2010, the installed base of mobile PCs and smartphones exceeded that of desktop PCs.Fewer than 20m media tablets, including the iPad, were sold in 2010, but by 2016, 900m media tablets will be purchased – one for every eight people on earth. By 2014, the installed base of devices based on lightweight mobile operating systems, such as Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android, and Microsoft’s Windows 8 will exceed the total installed base of all PC-based systems.“That is incredible change, not only for individuals. It requires IT to reimagine the way it provides applications,” Mr Sondergaard said. “By 2014, private app stores will be deployed by 60 per cent of IT organisations. The applications themselves will be redesigned – they will become context-enabled, understanding the user’s intent automatically. Mobile computing is not just the desktop on a handheld device. The future of mobile computing is context-aware computing.”Cloud, social, information and mobile will be combined into a new nexus. Where data centres will give way to data clouds, mobile devices become windows into personal clouds. Personal computing will become massive collaborative computing, and information technologies will be overshadowed by information ecologies.“The impact of these forces will make architectures of the last 20 years obsolete,” Mr. Sondergaard said. “Together, they force the issue – they drive us to create the postmodern business, drive simplicity and force creative destruction.”
216;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-10-14T14:38:04Z;Companies target children's tablet aptitude;;Ask any parent who has recently bought an iPad and one of the first things they will tell you is how much their children love playing with the device. An international study this year suggested that while only 9 per cent of pre-school children can tie their shoelaces, about 20 per cent can play an app on a smartphone.“Hand-eye co-ordination allows a child to use a tablet from around nine months onward,” says Gary Pope, co-founder of Kids Industries, the children’s research consultancy. “There is clearly a huge emerging market here.”It is little surprise, therefore, that publishers and media companies are increasingly looking at producing content for tablets and phones that is aimed specifically at children.HarperCollins says it will have about 25 to 30 apps available for children by the end of the year, while Penguin, which is owned by Pearson, parent company of the Financial Times, recently announced plans for a number of new interactive children’s books for the iPad, including an app based on the Tale of Peter Rabbit. The company has an in-house app development team.Earlier this year, Bertelsmann also bought Smashing Ideas, the app developer, to create an in-house apps team at its Random House publishing company.Bayard Presse, the French magazine group, recently launched an iPad-based version of its magazine, StoryBox, for children as young as three.Disney has launched a series of toys called App Mates, which interact with the touch screen of the iPad. The first set features the vehicles from theCars animated films, which children can race across scenes on the iPad screen.The children’s app market is so new that there are few estimates of its size. A study of 2,200 iPad-owning parents in the US and the UK, carried out by Kids Industries, found that parents downloaded an average of 27.2 apps for their children each year, spending about $100 in total.Given that Gartner, the technology research group, expects some 63.6m tablet devices to be sold this year, there is clearly a very big opportunity emerging.“We saw this as a fantastic opportunity and started thinking about how to use the features of the touch screen to tell stories differently,” said Kate Wilson, founder of Nosy Crow, a children’s publisher that has been one of the pioneers in children’s apps.“Children are using these devices and as publishers we have a duty to take those reading experiences to where the children are,” she said. “It is important we do this, otherwise someone else will.”“This is not to say that the bedtime story won’t still be best delivered in a calm, quiet, paper-based way. But if children are spending time on these devices they need to have reading experiences that are as exciting as playing games,” she added.One of the alluring things about the children’s market is that the prices can be a lot higher than for standard apps. Nosy Crow’s highly-acclaimed Cinderella app, for example, sells for £5.49, compared with prices of about 59p for many apps on the iTunes store. Kids Industries found that UK parents were willing to pay up to $4.22 for a high-quality app.“Especially if something is seen as educational, you can charge a lot more for it,” Mr Pope said. “For the younger end of the market education is a primary decision-making driver.”However, for publishers there is a paradox: $4.22 is much lower than they would generally charge for a much simpler ebook, read on a devices such as a Kindle or Nook. Yet an app with interactive graphics and sound costs much more to make – anywhere between $5,000 to $100,000 depending on its complexity.“Publishers will make more ebooks and fewer apps because of the pricing,” says Corinne Helman, vice-president of digital publishing at HarperCollins. She says it is still difficult to reach profitability with complex apps and is waiting to see wider adoption of tablets before HarperCollins pushes further development in this area.Big brands are the ones that do best in the apps marketplace, with parents naturally gravitating towards titles that they know. Ms Helman says HarperCollins’ app based on the Fancy Nancy series is a bestseller, despite the fact that the interactivity is very basic.However, everyone in the industry agrees that simply “squashing books into apps” is not enough and not all books work well in an interactive format. Well-known children’s authors such as Julia Donaldson, author of The Gruffalo, have been famously reluctant to take their titles into this format, partly for fear it could turn out damaging for the brand.Mr Pope says while the genre is still so experimental, such caution is justified.“A digital interface is very different from a paper one,” says Mr Pope. “And I think there is a lack of understanding about how consumers use these things. It doesn’t help that the interactive editor at publishing companies is usually 24 years old and the closest they have been to a kid is their nephew in Manchester. It is not enough.”
217;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Lenovo overtakes Dell;;"One small step for Lenovo, one giant leap for the Asian PC industry? Lenovo has overtaken Dell to become the world’s second-largest PC vendor, according to shipment data in the third quarter.The era of US dominance of the PC industry seems to be coming to an end, and Asian companies, which have been making the world’s PCs for many years now, are moving to occupy the top spots in the PC brands as well.The change was marked by both IDC and Gartner in their latest PC market figures released on Wednesday in the US. As usual, the two research firms’ numbers differ slightly: According to IDC, Lenovo’s global market share jumped 36.1 per cent from the same period last year to 13.7 per cent, while Gartner has a 25.2 per cent year-on-year increase to 13.5 per cent market share.That leaves China’s Lenovo second only to Hewlett-Packard – a company which has been trying to exit the PC business.Although HP is still the uncontested leader with an 18.1 per cent global market share in the third quarter according to IDC, and still growing, the firm’s recent back-and-forth on what it wants to do with its PC unit has called the future of this trend into question.And Lenovo is closing the gap. For the past five quarters, Lenovo has been growing faster than any other PC vendor, and despite its strong reliance on China, this growth has broadened beyond its home market to other emerging markets, Japan and Europe.Lenovo is not alone. Asustek, the Taiwanese PC brand, which currently occupies fifth rank behind Acer, is growing almost as fast as Lenovo.Acer itself may be in a trough right now, with a more than 20 per cent year-on-year drop in shipments in the third quarter as its netbook business got hit hard by the sudden rise of tablets. But analysts believe Acer’s suffering from inventory adjustments and a management reshuffle should be over soon, putting the company back in the game.“With the challenges facing HP […], we see opportunity for market shares gains for its largest competitors, especially for the Asia brand PC companies, such as Lenovo, Acer and Asustek,” said Kirk Yang, head of technology hardware in Asia for Barclays Capital, in a recent note.Lenovo is jubilant at what it sees as a new breakthrough. “Lenovo has captured incredible marketplace momentum to surpass two competitors to capture the #2 spot in worldwide PCs over the span of just two quarters,” said Yang Yuanqing, chief executive.There is one caveat: PCs are no longer a particularly attractive industry to be in, with shrinking margins, ever-shorter product cycles and consumers who are seduced by the rise of tablets and smartphones.Those are the reasons both HP and Dell are looking to strengthen services and other hardware fields such as servers.Related reading:

However, losses widened 60 per cent as the digital music service struggles with the licensing costs it has to pay the music industry.Analysts said losses were likely to widen again this year following an expensive launch into the US in July.“Spotify is not in a position at the moment to balance its books as it tries to establish its position in the US,” said Mark Mulligan, independent music analyst. “Spotify can’t afford to be in this landgrab phase in the US for much more than a year,” he warned.“The growth numbers were very positive but you cannot ignore the losses. Over time they will require some realignment of the licensing costs,” said Mike McGuire, media analyst at Gartner.Spotify recently said it had reached 2m paying subscribers, following the US launch, and it has also been plugged into the Facebook social networking service, increasing its visibility to users, so revenues are expected to show another large rise this year. However, the recent figures show that the cost of sales are likely to keep weighing heavily on the business.Revenues at Spotify increased to £63.16m ($99m) in 2010, up from £11.32m the previous year. The bulk of this was from subscriptions, which brought in £45.07m last year, while advertising revenues were £18.06m.However, the cost of sales for the company – much of which will be royalty payments to music rights holders – were £64.8m, more than total revenues. After administrative and other expenses the company made a pre-tax loss of £26.54m, compared to a loss of £16.61m loss in 2009.Spotify’s software for desktop computers and smartphones allows users to instantly call up a song and play it via the internet. The service allows 10 hours of free listening a month, before requiring users to pay for a £10 a month premium service. Spotify introduced tighter restrictions around its free listening service in May to help cut back on some of the royalty costs it is facing.The company is planning launches in other countries following its US debut.“In 2010, we continued to grow our European user base, adding hundreds of thousands of paying subscribers, now representing a ratio of paid subscribers to active free users of over 15 per cent, which is phenomenal for any “freemium” business,” Spotify said.
219;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-10-06T18:11:56Z;Apple’s mystery men line up to fill the void;;The people now in charge of Apple are still enigmas to most outside the technology industry, and it is difficult to imagine any of them taking on the mythic proportions of Steve Jobs, the co-founder who died on Wednesday.Even Tim Cook, who twice served as acting chief executive before taking full control in August, is little known, and his actions this week suggest he does not aspire to being in the spotlight as Jobs did.In his first product launch since Jobs resigned in August, Mr Cook on Tuesday opened and closed a 90-minute presentation to introduce the latest version of the iPhone, which is Apple’s largest and most important product in terms of the revenue it has generated.But Mr Cook yielded a relatively greater amount of stage time than his predecessor would have to his colleagues: Scott Forstall, iOS mobile software chief, explained and demonstrated the improvements in that operating system, and marketing guru Phil Schiller showed off the iPhone 4S’s capabilities.They and others, including Jonathan Ive, Mac hardware designer, had been just as critical to developing and selling Apple’s wares before. But the way Jobs ran things, he often left the impression that he had worked alone for months on a product in his garage and had just raced to the launch to show it, said Michael Gartenberg, Gartner technology analyst, on Wednesday.“The one thing about Apple that will change going forward is that we are not going to see one person representing himself as the physical manifestation of all Apple,” Mr Gartenberg said. “Mr Cook was willing to turn the stage over to those other executives.”Even if he wanted to, Mr Cook would be hard pressed to assume all of Jobs’ mantle. The co-founder took the company from within 90 days of bankruptcy when he rejoined it in the late 1990s, to become the second most valued in the world by market capitalisation in just 14 years, overturning the music and mobile phone industries in the process.In some ways Jobs acted as if he were the only customer who mattered, ignoring market research and focus groups and selecting from among Apple employees the ideas he found most appealing.Jobs inspired great work from people and was a consummate salesman, infecting consumers with his enthusiasm. His longtime deputy Mr Cook, by contrast, appears controlled and lower key, an operations and logistics expert more interested in spreadsheets than graphic designs.Perhaps Mr Cook’s biggest adversary, Mr Gartenberg suggested, will now be the myth of Jobs as a giant who created everything instead of as a leader who wisely selected options.But Mr Cook has already set out on moving Apple beyond that myth.One of his first acts as chief executive was to promote another of Apple’s stars, Eddy Cue, who interacts with many outsiders as the master of iTunes, the media and software applications store.Mr Cue is the key to securing the loyalty of outside developers that are critical to Apple’s future success against Google’s Android operating system, and he must deal with media companies who balk at the cut that Apple takes on content, such as 30 per cent on magazines on the iPad.Mr Cue has worked at the company for 22 years, overseeing the creation of the company’s online store in 1998, the iTunes music store in 2003 and the App store in 2008. In February, he stood alongside Rupert Murdoch to announce the launch of The Daily digital newspaper, available exclusively on the iPad. In anointing him senior vice-president of internet software and services, Mr Cook wrote in a memo to staff: “Apple is a company and culture unlike any other in the world and leaders like Eddy get that. Apple is in their blood.”In his current capacity, Mr Cue is tasked with developing Apple’s new iCloud services, which gives users access to their software and content from any Apple device without having to manually transfer any of them.Also reporting directly to Mr Cook is Mr Ive, the UK-born designer who is considered a design genius for drawing the pared-down lines of the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and Mr Schiller. The other core executive is Mr Forstall, Apple’s senior vice-president of iPhone software, who came up with the inner workings of the device that lets users swipe, tap, and pinch their way through the phone’s applications.Mr Cook let Mr Forstall demonstrate an innovative feature of the iPhone 4S this week, the voice recognition function known as Siri. Mr Forstall worked for Jobs even before Apple, at NeXT, the computer company Jobs founded after leaving Apple in 1985. But on stage on Tuesday, Mr Forstall and Mr Cook both showed their truest dedication was not to their mentor Jobs but to his legacy, Apple Inc.Additional reporting by Maija Palmer in London
220;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-10-04T15:50:38Z;Apple unveils iPhone 4S;;"Apple has unveiled a new version of the iPhone, with the same design as its existing handset but upgrading its hardware, software and services to stay ahead of smartphone rivals.The iPhone 4S, available from October 14, has the same dual-core processor as the iPad 2, an improved camera, 4G data speeds and better battery life. There will be a “World” version of the phone that can be used on different networks and Sprint has been added as a carrier. Apple emphasised improvements in a new version of the operating system – iOS 5 – and demonstrated a voice-recognition personal assistant called Siri.Our live reporting from the event as it happened and reaction to the news is after the jump.12.30pm And so the world moves on. Time to call it a day. Thanks for your company and to Maija and Joe for their feeds from Covent Garden and Cupertino. Personally, I’m disappointed the rumoured slimmer, curved, bigger screen iPhone 5 never materialised to tempt me away from my Android device. But, hopefully, there will be a chance for a hands-on second opinion and for me to write a full review of the latest iPhone in the next couple of weeks.[blackbirdpie id=""121302295676862464""][blackbirdpie id=""121304043032285184""][blackbirdpie id=""121305316733358080""]12.20pm Maija has some reaction from Carolina Milanesi, a Gartner analyst: “There will be some people disappointed by the lack of a new design. But from a feature perspective Apple delivered on all the points that users were waiting for. They have improved the antenna design, there is a faster A5 chip and a better camera. Siri is pretty amazing if it works well with accents and different languages. It is about the overall package. You can’t ignore the little things like the iCloud. The CDMA/GSM version will allow them to optimise their economies of scale and expand in the Chinese market. They are now hitting all the different price points from a 3GS being free to the most expensive. This will open up their addressable market. The free device is a departure from what they have done before.”12.15pm Apple is now down more than 5 per cent. That’s maybe an over-reaction. This was the kind of workmanlike performance that Tim Cook was likely to bring to the company. Apple is expanding its addressable market significantly with the World phone, Sprint addition and new price points, the new hardware inside will match its rivals and not hurt margins, the software is still clearly superior to anything else out there and Apple will sell gazillions of these things, particularly in emerging markets. My only concern would be that it is not differentiated enough in hardware terms to prompt upgrades from existing iPhone owners, while Android owners waiting to switch may not have been sufficiently encouraged to do so.[blackbirdpie id=""121293436153368577""][blackbirdpie id=""121295499834818560""][blackbirdpie id=""121297052956241920""]11.47am On the other hand, we buy Apple more for its software. Siri seems stunning, but can it change the habits of a lifetime and get us talking to our phones? The new iOS 5 has some big improvements and there’s always all those apps. Stick around for more reaction.11.44am Apple shares are down 3 per cent. Frankly, I’m not surprised. Four months late and there is no iPhone 5 – just some updated hardware for the existing iPhone 4. Better camera, faster processor, 4G speeds, a world phone – all well and good, but this puts Apple only at par with its competitors in hardware terms.11.39am And that is it. There is no ‘one more thing’. Steve Jobs is not in the building and a little of the magic has gone from these events.11.38am Tim Cook is back: “When you look at each of these, they’re great and fantastic and industry leading in and of themselves, but what sets them apart…is how they are engineered to work together so well. When you think about it, only Apple could make such amazing hardware, software and services and bring them together in such a powerful yet integrated experience.”11.36am Pricing news – the existing 8Gb iPhone 4 is being cut to $99. 3GS is now free with a contract. 4S available in white (cough!) and black. Preorders from Friday, available on October 14 in US, Canada, UK, Australia, France, Germany, Japan. From October 28 in 22 more countries and, by the end of the year, in 70 countries. There will be a Sprint version in the US, alongside AT&T and Verizon ones.11.34am So the voice recognition seems to be the key new feature, says Maija, there’s also the camera improvements and 1080p video, the better phone quality, world roaming, the faster, dual core chip and the iCloud service11.27am Phil is back for a roundup and hopefully, one more thing. There’s a promo video as well.11.23am Basically, he asks what the weather is like, asks to be woken up at 6am, asks how the Nasdaq is doing and it speaks back to him as if it understands perfectly. You can ask about exchange rates when abroad. This seems to be a feature from Wolfram Alpha. Secretaries of the world, be worried! says Maija.[blackbirdpie id=""121288344650006528""]11.17am Scott Forstall gives a demo. I think you really have to be there to get the wow factor – download the presentation on iTunes later. (Here’s Apple’s official announcement on the new iPod line by the way, and on iCloud.)11.13am Now we are onto the expected voice-recognition features. For decades, technologists have teased us with this dream, says Schiller…but it never comes true – Phil sounding like Friedrich Schiller at this point. We want to talk to our device, ask a simple question,the phone will figure out what you mean – that’s a feature we call Siri. Siri is your intelligent assistant (it’s also a company Apple bought a couple of years back).11.12am If you’re a gadget nerd like me then no you don’t Carolina.[blackbirdpie id=""121283038771560449""]11.08am Joe Menn in Cupertino tells me the iPhone 4S looks pretty much the same as the iPhone 4 physically, so could there still be a “one more thing” iPhone 5 ahead?11.07am The camera – the 4S has an 8 megapixel sensor, 60 per cent more than the iPhone4. Backside illumination gives richer picture quality. It has a five-element lens, 30 per cent sharper picture. There are advanced face recognition algorithms. It can shoot 1080p HD video for the first time.11.02am This is not being announced as a 4G iPhone, but Phil says that, with two antennas, speeds are equivalent to 4G. There is also a world phone being announced with both GSM and CDMA capabilities.10.55am And all in a rush – the new iPhone. And it’s the iPhone 4S….not the 5, that is. It has the same A5 dual-core processor as the iPad, as we expected, and graphics that are up to 7x faster. Cue a gaming demo from the president of Epic games. 8 hours of talk time, 14 hours 2G talk time, 8 hours 3G, 9 hours browsing.10.54am Ooh… he introduces a white iPod touch, goes from $229 to $199 for 8gig, from October 12. (You all remember the white iPhone don’t you and how it was delayed for a year or more? I’m just saying.)10.50am Talking about the Nano. Updates – multitouch display to switch between the apps. Improved fitness experience. You can track runs and walks, upload data about your runs to the Mac. Created new clock faces for people who like to wear it as a watch. You can have a Mickey Mouse watch face if you want. The arms move. Come on, these are the features you really were waiting to hear about, admit it. He says the iPod touch is already better automatically because it can handle iOS5 and the iCloud – sorry, that’s a cop out Phil, new features please.10.48am Ta-da! Phil Schiller takes the stage, that means hardware and hard product news, folks (I hope).10.47am A sliver of new news: iCloud ships Oct 12, iTunes Match at the end of the month.10.45am iTunes Match, again repeating earlier announced stuff – There are 20m songs on iTunes. This will scan and match any songs you already have in the iTunes music library. And allow you to stream them to any device. Itunes Match will cost $24.99 a year.10.42am A new app called Find my Friends displays locations of those who share the information. Parents can stop their kids from turning the feature off. Some iCloud storage is free, with upgrades starting at $20 per year.10.36am Give it up now for Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. He’s going to repeat what we already know about iCloud. Over a third of music we sell is on iOS devices, he says. It is on multiple devices and it can be frustrating to sync. Now you can go to a list of previously purchased music or TV shows on the iTunes store and send them to any device. If you buy a song on an iOS device, it begins downloading to all the owner’s devices. Photos taken on one device also appear on all of them. If you create new documents, these are all saved to iCloud10.35am Here’s news: the iOS5 update is free and available on October 12.10.34am Onto Newsstand, less intrusive notifications and Safari reader, which formats articles for the size of a user’s device. We knew all this already. 67m are signed up to Game Center. Now it will have friend recommendations to find people to play against. Safari – when you tap on the reader button on a web story, it is loaded into a format that is easy to read. Or you can add it to a reading list, which is synced between devices. PC free – a lot of customers wan to just buy an iphone, not have a computer. Now you can do this with PC free. These are some of more than 200+ new features of iOS5.10.30am Scott is refreshing us on what’s in iOS5, due any day now – Notifications don’t interfere with game play, iMessages pushed to all devices, reminders is a new feature. Set reminders like a grocery list, location-based reminders like picking up dry-cleaning. A deeper integration of Twitter to tweet photos, maps[blackbirdpie id=""121274414661763072""]10:26am New apps called Cards for sending cards to people. Create a card and Apple will print and send it to the person. In the US, you will get a notification when it is delivered. Cute, I suppose, but would you pay $2.99 to send one?10.24am Now Scott Forstall is on stage. He’s a software guy, so likely we’re getting more on iOS5 before we see any new products. Apple has now paid out $3bn to developers, he says.10.22am 92 per cent of Fortune 500 companies are testing or deploying the iPad. We have passed the quarter of a billion sales mark for iOS devices….blah blah. Products please.10.20am ITunes has had more than 16bn songs downloaded. “It is mind boggling” We are getting a big spiel on customer satisfaction, very CEO like, where’s the magic Tim?10.15am Get ready for some new iPods. Introduced 10 years ago, the iPod has 78 per cent of the music player market, having sold more than 300m units, he says. Did you hear the Zune died today? Unfortunate timing or a good day to bury bad news?10.12am Last year through June, Mac had 23 per cent growth, many times PC growth, to 58m base worldwide. In US retail market, Mac has 23 per cent share.”We have a lot to go” in PC market. Also talking about the MacBook Air, how models are best selling in the UK. Mac outgrew the PC market by 6 times.10.10am More than 6m copies of OS X Lion have been downloaded. The company now has six stores in China, including two opened last weekend, and 357 stores worldwide.10:08am He is following the traditional Apple script of minor product and other news updates first.10.06am Reports Joe Menn: “Speaking with a mild Southern accent, Mr Cook said Apple had tremendous momentum and that it was the “privilege of a lifetime” to have worked at the company for nearly 14 years.”10.02am Tim Cook walks onstage: “I love Apple and I consider it a privilege to have worked here for 14 years.” Says he is “very excited about my new role”.10.01am The inevitable slight delay, here’s the view from Maija’s seat at the Covent Garden simulcast.9.58am And there’s another leak of the forthcoming announcement on Apple’s Japanese site apparently. Launch will be on October 14th. You heard it here second.9.50am 9t05Mac has apparently got some pictures of a new iPhone leaked from Apple’s own website, according to the Mashable tweet below.[blackbirdpie id=""121264086892806144""][blackbirdpie id=""121262477924245504""]9.30am That’s the online version I think the Gartner analyst is talking about.[blackbirdpie id=""121260652118544384""]9.25am Our correspondent Joe Menn is at the event down in Cupertino, while Maija Palmer is heading to Apple’s simulcast event in London. She says the Apple store in Covent Garden has its windows covered over and appears closed in anticipation. Amazing how they converted that old building across from the market. Took shelter from the rain, used the free Wi-Fi and bought a cable there when visiting in August, quite a big concert space they have as well.9am Pacific time (Noon, Eastern, 1600GMT, 1700BST) – So we’re an hour away from the big event, whichever time zone you’re on, and I’m weighing the odds of who is going to step out on stage first. Steve Jobs is still executive chairman and the guy everyone wants to see, but his health problems and the handing over of the CEO reins would seem to make any appearance unlikely. Tim Cook, the new chief executive, should then be the main man, but he is unaccustomed to making such big presentations. It was Phil Schiller, head of worldwide product marketing, who stepped in when Steve Jobs was last unavailable – he unveiled the iPhone 3GS in June 2009. So my money is on a brief introduction from Tim Cook, before Phil and others including Scott Forstall, head of iPhone software, take us through the main product announcements."
221;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-09-29T15:42:51Z;Nokia: an Asian future?;;"For a company that started out selling rubber boots, Nokia is used to change. The announcement on Thursday that it is closing its factory in Cluj, Romania, with the loss of over 2,000 jobs, and is reviewing its operations in Hungary and Mexico, reminds us that some changes are driven more by necessity than choice.As the FT reports, the Cluj factory was only opened in 2008 at a cost of $88m, but market demands mean that this brand spanking facility is in the wrong place. It makes low-end “feature phones” (as opposed to high-end smartphones) which dominate markets in Asia – which is where Nokia will now make them.When Nokia chief Stephen Elop wrote his now-infamous “burning platform” memo, he told the story of a man who jumped into the icy waters of the Atlantic and survived. But will Nokia survive a dip in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean?“The European market has shifted towards smartphones, whereas the feature phone market is predominant in Asia and we can get greater scale and proximity benefits by using our Asian factories in China and Korea,” Nokia said on Thursday.The closures, while painful for its Romanian workforce, are in line with Nokia’s commitment to cutting €1bn from its costs (as announced in April 2011). They also signal exactly where the company sees its future: in Asian emerging markets.Carolina Milanese, analyst at Gartner, told beyondbrics the move made sense: “Nokia needs sustainable margins. Eastern Europe is comparatively expensive. It has an opportunity in Asia to get into applications beyond voice.”But for how long? In the US, according to Neilsen, 40 per cent of mobile phone users have a smartphone. Android, Apple, and RIM (which makes BlackBerrys) dominate, with 40, 28 and 19 per cent respectively. Windows mobile phones make up only 7 per cent. And who has Nokia partnered with to make smartphones? Microsoft.In western Europe, smartphones now represent 52 per cent of total mobile phone shipments. In the second quarter of 2011, Nokia was the second biggest mobile vendor, with 9m units – down 44 per cent from 2010. In smartphones, it was fifth, with 11 per cent of the market. Just a year earlier, Nokia had been in first place, with a 39 per cent market share. Nokia’s drop – as Android devices from Samsung and HTC have soared – is stomach churning.So Nokia’s future is split, between waiting for its Windows device for the US and Europe to emerge – probably some time next year – and pushing lower-end feature phones in emerging markets, mainly in Asia.Nokia should not be counted out. Although its share price has plummeted 41 per cent in the last year, it still sold 461m phones in 2010 – a “heck of a lot of phones”, as Milanese at Gartner put it. That was a 7.5 per cent drop in market share from 2009, but still over 150m more Nokia phones in customers’ hands than the next best competitor, Samsung.Smartphones are predicted to make up 51 per cent of mobile shipments in southeast Asia by 2015, up from 17 per cent in 2010. Nokia must hope it can upgrade along with its customers. As Milanese said: “It’s tough to close a factory, but you have to go where the growth is.”Related reading:

222;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-09-27T18:36:42Z;Facebook forms political action committee;;Facebook has officially formed a political action committee to allow the company to donate cash to political candidates, signalling its increasing efforts to influence Washington as concerns over privacy issues at the social network mount.The company registered two new internet domains over the weekend for the committee, FBPAC.org and FBPAC.us.“FB PAC will give our employees a way to make their voice heard in the political process by supporting candidates who share our goals of promoting the value of innovation to our economy, while giving people the power to share and make the world more open and connected,” the company said.After Facebook played a key role in the 2008 US presidential election, with Barack Obama harnessing the social network for his campaign and to win voters, now the company is inserting itself into the political process to promote its own interests.The company has repeatedly been criticised by advocates and politicians for not adequately protecting users’ privacy or sufficiently explaining its privacy policies to users. A fresh round of scrutiny comes after every new product announcement, as was the case after Facebook’s F8 conference last week, when it announced a series of new features that make it easier for users to share what they are reading, watching, and listening to.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, has consistently defended the company’s moves and repeated his goal to make the world more social. Analysts say the move to start a political action committee is a logical next step for Facebook.“It’s reflective of a change in Silicon Valley, which now sees Washington as a place that they have to be engaged in,” said Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner. “A lot of Silicon Valley companies realise that political events can have a big impact on their business outcomes and strategies.”Google has been beefing up its lobbying efforts in Washington, particularly around monopoly and patent issues, while LinkedIn hosted Mr Obama at its headquarters on Monday for a town hall discussion on jobs.The formation of the PAC also follows recent board and staff additions that increase Facebook’s ties to Washington. Earlier this month, the company added to its board Erskine Bowles, a White House chief of staff under Bill Clinton and current co-chairman of Mr Obama’s commission on fiscal responsibility. Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary under Mr Clinton, and Joel Kaplan, former deputy chief of staff to George W. Bush, also recently joined the company.
223;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-09-20T10:40:02Z;Joining the dots: Risk management and regulation;;"Financial risk assessment systems failed badly in the lead-up to the 2008 crisis; now the financial services industry is working hard to fix them.Banks can no longer rely on economic models, such as “value at risk”, which is based on past market behaviour.Nor can they trust wholly in the efficient frontier – where asset classes have been carefully analysed to balance risk and reward – and the stability of correlations to allow them to reliably trade off risk for return among asset classes and that historical patterns will hold.Today, the industry still uses highly quantitative computer-driven risk analysis models, which shouldered some of the blame in 2008. But individual companies are working to ensure these models incorporate data from the most distant corners of the enterprise.They are also asking computer systems to do more, connecting more of the dots to show excesses in now notorious areas, such as mortgage lending or structured credit products. The goal is to improve performance before it becomes a matter for compliance.“People tended to manage compliance through a rear-view mirror, but the best institutions recognise that compliance is an operational risk. It has an impact on your performance and your reputation”, says Douglas McKibben an analyst at Gartner, the research company.Financial services businesses have been changing their technology architecture since the financial crisis and many are replacing disparate older systems with a single IT platform. The biggest banks, including the Royal Bank of Scotland in the UK – which was transformed by a series of huge mergers in the months and years leading up to the crisis – are connecting product-specific trading platforms with each other, and with the programs that calculate risk, capital levels, and overall performance.Many banks admit some of the safeguards against insolvency were in order, but say the tough new “Basel III” bank safety rules and other regulations are pushing financial services companies to move much faster to revamp their IT than they would have otherwise – even before regulations take shape.“We can’t predict regulation, but we know there is going to be more of it”, says Stephen Norman, chief information officer of the investment bank division of RBS.“So our strategy is to create a single view of the data and the analytics. Doing the calculations from this is the lesser part of the job. The hard part is having all your data in one place – transactions, market data and counterparty reference data.”Last year, AllianceBernstein, the US-based fund manager, introduced a “dynamic asset allocation” model that combined data on value, growth and fixed income, quantitative and fundamental analysis from across the company, along with insights into the volatility of different asset classes.A majority of the group’s private clients are using the system as are four of the 10 largest US insurance companies, for their variable annuity businesses, says David Steyn, the new head of AllianceBernstein in Europe.“We would have better served our clients [during the crisis] if we had connected those dots”, he says. The unified data and analysis goes along with the recognition that market risk, credit risk and liquidity are interdependent.“You can now no longer distinguish between credit risk and market risk. You need to link assumptions about what the market is doing to the assessment of creditworthiness of your counterparty”, Mr Norman says. “That’s the Nirvana we are all aspiring to.”The biggest financial companies are moving ahead of regulatory timetables, believing they will need the extra time.“It’s like painting the Forth Bridge: as soon as you’ve finished you need to start again,” says Alistair Maughan, a technology partner at Morrison & Foerster, a law firm.There is one significant exception: banks are not yet preparing for proposals to impose much tighter regulations on “systemically important” institutions that are “too big to fail”.“If you think about the top 10 universal banks, this would require a global regulator to co-ordinate how those business should be managed and it requires national and regional regulators to recognise that they respond to a higher authority,” says Laurence Trigwell, worldwide financial services executive at IBM.Companies normally refresh their IT every three to four years, so they are implementing new compliance systems amid this natural refresh cycle. Such was the case with Banco Espírito Santo of Portugal, which installed anti-fraud software from Fiserv, the US-based technology company, alongside mandated anti-money laundering systems.Mr Maughan believes that the pressures of shifting regulatory requirements at national, regional and supranational levels keeps financial businesses from taking full advantage of cheaper, standardised IT systems such as cloud computing, which reduces the absolute control companies have over their data.All of the regulatory activity is expanding the global market for financial risk management technology, which is expected to grow to $4.2bn by 2013, according to Chartis research.IBM has invested heavily in risk modelling, most recently buying the software vendor Algorithmics for $387m, after last year’s acquisition of privately-held OpenPages. IBM offers clients a way to justify each stage of IT rollouts, by calculating the return on each stage of risk IT.Still, with the downturn, many businesses including RBS try to keep IT spending flat each year, except when they are implementing specific regulations or incorporating acquisitions.No matter how sophisticated the models, some argue that it is only possible to assess risk if banks limit their activities to those that can be understood – and stop rewarding executives for taking risk.For Amar Bhidé, professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and author of A Call for Judgement, this never includes a $60bn derivatives book.“The most important problem is that banks are engaged in activities that neither their top managers nor their regulators can control,” he says. Regulation, in these cases, “is simply like mandating a bigger airbag instead of inspecting the brakes.”"
224;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-09-18T19:50:28Z;Dell shrugs off harbingers of PC doom;;Michael Dell says he has little interest in buying Hewlett-Packard’s PC business, but the Dell chief executive says his computer company is poised to gain market share as its larger rival undergoes a comprehensive restructuring.Unlike HP, which last month announced plans to spin off its personal computer line and pull the plug on tablet computing, Mr Dell still believes in selling hardware, despite slowing growth and slim margins. “We are very distinct from some of our competitors,” says Mr Dell in a video interview on FT.com. “We believe the devices and the hardware still matter as part of the complete, end-to-end solution.” The scale of its PC operations, he says, gives Dell an advantage over competitors in the smaller but more lucrative server market.“Think about the scale economies in our business. As a company spins off its PC business, it goes from one of the top buyers in the world of disk drives and processors and memory chips to not being one of the top five,” he says. “And that raises the cost of making servers and storage products. Ultimately we believe that presents an enormous opportunity for us and you can be sure we are going to seize it.”Dell is the world’s second-largest vendor of PCs (by units sold) with 12.9 per cent market share, compared to 18.1 per cent for HP, according to IDC, the industry analysis group. It is third in the market for server systems, behind IBM and HP.“While there is uncertainty over the HP PC business, HP has handed Dell a big slice of business on a silver platter. Dell is perfectly placed to take advantage,” says Bob O’Donnell, analyst at IDC.After HP spins off its hardware business, Dell will be the only one of the big IT vendors still offering a combination of services and hardware. IBM sold its laptop and PC business to China’s Lenovo, now the world’s third-largest PC company, in 2005.PC sales have come under particular pressure in the past year as consumers in western Europe and the US migrate to buying tablets and smartphones. This month Gartner, the research company, substantially lowered its forecast for global sales growth for the sector. Last month, Dell itself was forced to cut its revenue growth forecasts for the year, citing weakening consumer demand and delayed orders by public sector customers.Nevertheless, Mr Dell believes we are not yet in a post-PC era.“There are a billion and a half PCs in the world and while Gartner change their estimates here and there, they also estimate there will be two billion PCs in the world by 2014. So when I look at that, I think the idea that the PC is no longer here is complete nonsense,” he says.“You see PCs, tablets, you see smartphones. But those other devices aren’t necessarily replacing the PCs, so we are very committed to that part of the business, as part of this broader, end-to-end IT solutions company,” he says. PC growth will come mainly from emerging markets, such as China, he says. China is also a big market for Dell’s servers, as a result of deals with big internet companies such as Tencent. “Around 60 per cent of the Chinese internet runs on Dell,” Mr Dell says.Mr Dell indicates that the IT company is still looking to compete in the difficult tablet market. Dell’s Streak tablet, launched last year, has not sold well, and HP abandoned its TouchPad tablet after finding it too difficult to compete with Apple’s iPad. Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, recently said it would stop making its Galapagos tablets.Rumours have suggested that Dell, however, is planning to launch a tablet running Microsoft’s Windows 8 operating system next year. Mr Dell stops short of announcing any planned products but says the company is “very much in line” with Microsoft’s plans to overhaul its Windows software so that it works better for tablets. His comments indicate the company could be aiming for a device that is in between a tablet and a laptop. “The line that separates a tablet and a laptop today will get very blurry and ultimately disappear as you see many new products,” he says.“The trouble is how to differentiate, when there are 30 other vendors making tablets based on the Android operating system. Dell will have to look at how to position itself,” says IDC’s Mr O’Donnell.Despite its founder’s commitment to hardware, Dell is continuing to expand its services business, having bought Perot Systems, the IT services company, for $3.9bn in 2009. Since then it has made more than 10 smaller acquisitions all around services, storage or networking.Mr Dell says the company is still looking for more targets. “We have been acquiring about eight companies a year. You will see us continue at a very rapid pace with our acquisitions,” he says. With more than $16bn in cash on its balance sheet, Dell has plenty of fire-power for purchases.Dell is also spending $1bn on building its cloud computing infrastructure, which includes 10 data centres around the world to store the vast amount of data to be held on the cloud. About 45,000 of its 110,000 staff are now working in the services side of the business.Mr O’Donnell at IDC believes this strategy could eventually pay off. “The services business is always hard. I am not sure anyone has really got it right. But there will be times when they can win business by offering the combination of hardware and services,” he says. “How often that will happen is unclear, but those opportunities should increase over time.”
225;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-09-16T23:44:51Z;Making use of social media for business;What are the opportunities and pitfalls of social media?;"Social networks and social media are confusing concepts for most companies and corporate executives. Most know that the dramatic growth of companies like Facebook and Twitter have transformed the web, but few understand what the business opportunities – and pitfalls – of social media are.To try and answer these and other questions, I interviewed Gartner analysts Mark McDonald and Anthony Bradley, two business friendly social media experts and the authors of The Social Organization. Below is an edited version of our conversation:Q. What’s the most common misunderstanding about social media and its potential for business leaders?There is a common misperception among business leaders that all you really need is a Facebook page and a Twitter account and then, voilà, your organisation is social. This is a limited and dangerous view. The vast majority of significant, even transformational, business benefits of social media come not from marketing communications, but from productive communities.The real business value of social media is that it can be used as an enabler for communities to collaborate, en masse, to achieve otherwise impossible results. It is this mass collaboration that sets social media apart as a phenomenon.Never before have thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of people been able to simultaneously create content, share experiences, build relationships and engage in other forms of productive work and meaningful activities.Q. But surely there is a communications element to social media?Of course you can use social media for marketing communications and collaboration. But we have found that “social organisations” know that mass collaboration presents a multitude of opportunities to amplify their performance and extend their capabilities.Social organisations successfully engage communities of employees, partners, customers and prospects in mass collaboration directed at achieving their most important business goals, addressing their biggest challenges and improving the business processes that give them competitive advantage.In other words, the leading organisations do not relegate social media to just marketing. They view the communities that social media enables as strategic to their business.Q. So what is the potential of getting it right?Social organisations are able to tap into the collective genius of their employees, partners, customers and prospects to transform their business and drive business results.Think of your best project, team or group, the ones that seem to work together seamlessly. How much value do they create? Multiply that number by the number of teams, projects or other collaborative opportunities you are, or could be, pursuing and you have a rule of thumb for the potential energy that lies untapped.We found that one social organisation utilised social media to deliver a 25 per cent improvement in the productivity of their 500-person engineering team in two months, simply by giving them the purpose and the tools to collaborate faster and smarter. It is easy to see the value of 500 employees doing the work of 625.Q. In a nutshell, how did this company achieve that?Well, you won’t get this kind of result asking people to tweet to each other. It goes to the heart of what we call mass collaboration; the ability to bring together large and diverse groups of employees, customers and partners to purse a mutual purpose that creates value. Social organisations are using this to beat their competitors.We have all seen this in action in our own organisation. We say it’s when the ‘stars align’. You have probably seen how much better that team worked and how successful they were. A social organisation has the ability to ‘align those stars’ repeatedly.Q. How do you measure the value of social media?You can’t measure the value of social media. Social media by itself has no value. How do you measure the value of a hammer? Or any tool for that matter? You can only measure the value of the business results you achieve by applying social media. This means, to gain value, you must apply social media to a well-defined business purpose.All too often during our research for the book, we saw a prevalent bad practice we call “provide and pray”. This involves simply providing access to a social media technology and praying something good comes of it. We estimate that “provide and pray” fails almost 90 per cent of the time. It fails due to lack of purpose. Purpose is the cause around which a community will rally. It is the inspiration for their participation. And it is the source of business value.We advise business leaders to apply social media to a specific business purpose with clear business metrics for measuring its success. Business leaders should not be satisfied with activity statistics like the number of participants, the unique visitors per month, the number of fans or the number of likes. These are important measures to understand the robustness of the community. But they do not measure the value to your organisation.Q. Will social media impact the way everyone works in the future?Social media and all-things Web 2.0 are technologies, and technologies come and go. What endures is the new ways of working that people perfect using these technologies. That way of working – mass collaboration – is what we found to be the value of social media. Creating mass collaboration is not luck, but rather a combination of leadership, readiness, culture and technology that when it exists together, provides employees with the opportunity to work in ways that improve and amplify individual ideas and contributions into organisation-wide change.Leaders are already starting to work in this way. For example, Cemex, the building materials group, has turned over its strategy execution to collaborative communities. The result accomplished significant measurable change in five weeks rather than eighteen months. When we asked about this new way of working, the business leader remarked, “Now that we have done it this way … we will never go back to the old way”.We believe mass collaboration is the way people will work in the future. Rather than bureaucratic environments that discount individual experience, limit knowledge sharing, limits recognition and curtails motivation, leading businesses will use social media to nurture borderless communities with a shared sense of purpose that delivers a more meaningful human experience and greater business results.Mark McDonald and Anthony Bradley are the authors of The Social Organization: How to Use Social Media to Tap the Collective Genius of Your Customers and Employees, published by Harvard Business Review Press."
226;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-09-08T12:17:09Z;PC industry faces sales slowdown;;The global forecast for personal computer shipments has been cut dramatically by Gartner, the research group, due to economic instability in western Europe and the US and a consumer shift to tablet devices such as the iPad.Gartner lowered its growth guidance for the global PC market this year to 3.8 per cent from its earlier forecast of 9.3 per cent, and warned that 2012 would also see a slower start to sales. PC sales for 2011 are expected to be 352m – nearly 54m units less than it forecast just nine months ago, in December 2010. It was the second time this year Gartner had lowered its guidance.“The expectation originally was that the economy would stabilise in the second half and consumers who hadn’t upgraded their PCs for some time would be attracted back to the market. But that hasn’t happened and in fact PCs have been pushed even further down the buying criteria,” said Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner.Second-quarter PC sales were much lower than expected in the US and early indications are that back-to-school spending has been disappointing. Many consumers are spending money on smartphones and tablet computers, while holding onto their desktop PC or laptop for a few more years.In contrast to slowing PC sales, Gartner forecast earlier this year that global smartphone sales would grow 57.7 per cent to 468m in 2011, while sales of tablets are expected to more than treble to close to 70m units this year.“It is only towards the back end of 2012 that we could see a boost for the [PC] industry, if companies like Microsoft and Intel begin providing thin and light laptops at cheaper prices. But if that doesn’t happen, we will have to cut numbers again,” Mr Atwal warned.HP’s recent decision to spin off its PC business highlighted the difficulties the industry is facing. In August, Taiwan’s Acer, the fourth-largest PC manufacturer by shipments, projected a loss for 2011, and Dell cut its revenue forecast for the year.“The business model of PC vendors has to change. It used to be about low prices, high volumes and low margins. But the model is breaking down because they no longer have the high volumes,” Mr Atwal said.Mr Atwal said computer companies would have to evolve to producing more varied types of devices, from phones and tablets to televisions.“Apple has shown the way but we will have to see if other companies can follow,” he said.Sales in emerging markets such as China, Russia and Brazil are currently underpinning the PC industry, while sales decline in western Europe and the US.However, Gartner said that if buying behaviour in those markets changed – perhaps with the introduction of cheaper tablets – the PC market would be facing further stagnation.
227;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-08-25T18:31:11Z;Cook tasked with replacing Apple icon;;For many of Apple’s customers, investors and fans, the most important thing about new chief executive Tim Cook is that he is not Steve Jobs.Many consider Mr Jobs, who resigned his post late on Wednesday, to be the best chief executive of his generation. Since returning to the head of a near-bankrupt Apple in 1997 after an earlier ousting in a management shake-up, Mr Jobs re-established Apple’s early role as a leader in personal computers. He went on to upend the music business, the phone handset industry and consumer computers again, with the 2010 launch of the iPad tablet.Mr Cook is not seen as a product visionary, and he has none of the rock-star charisma that made Mr Jobs an icon even for people with no particular love for gadgetry.But that is very different from saying that Mr Cook will not be a top-notch chief executive, which many people interviewed by the Financial Times who have worked closely with him say that he will be.“The board has complete confidence that Tim is the right person to be our next CEO,” Art Levinson, Apple director and chairman of Genentech, the US biotech group, said in the company’s announcement late on Wednesday. “Tim’s 13 years of service to Apple have been marked by outstanding performance and he has demonstrated remarkable talent and sound judgment in everything he does.”If Mr Cook’s weakness is a lack of artistic vision, he already has proved his willingness to trust the instincts of Apple’s designers, who have an unusual position of power over engineers at the company.“There is so much more to Apple than any one individual”, said Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg. “Competitors would be foolish to think this changes the landscape.”Mr Jobs’ departure will have “no impact from a product strategy point of view for probably a couple of years”, said Charles Golvin, Forrester analyst. “The next wave of [Apple] products has already been designed.”That existing pipeline of products could enable Apple to sustain what has already given the company, with the iPhone and iPad, impressive momentum. If it includes a better way of bringing the internet to television screens – something the Apple TV device has attempted with limited success so far – it could also create a big new business that would produce a gush of cash for Apple over the next five years, said Mark Anderson, a US technology analyst and chief executive of Strategic News Service.After leaving a key logistics job at Compaq Computer to join Apple in 1998, Mr Cook played a critical role behind the scenes in bringing the floundering company back from the brink.Apple was then selling computers that were more expensive and performed more poorly than its PC rivals. A supply-chain specialist at Compaq, Mr Cook closed Apple’s struggling manufacturing facilities and outsourced production to improve quality.He was a stern taskmaster, those involved in the process said, and his demands were as crucial to restoring Apple’s profitability as were the elegant new products that were dreamed up by Mr Jobs.Rival companies have repeatedly tried to poach him since then, and he was thought to be a candidate when the post of chief executive at Hewlett-Packard was vacant last year. Each time he has chosen to stay and Apple awarded him $35m worth of restricted stock in September.The 50-year-old son of a shipyard worker, Mr Cook was methodical in his labours before joining Apple. He spent a dozen years at IBM and had short stints in more senior positions at computer resellers before Compaq.He is as demanding as the notoriously finicky Mr Jobs but more predictable, which former Apple executives said could make the company run more smoothly in future.He is famous even at Apple for putting in long hours and a great attention to detail. Unsatisfactory answers are greeted with a hard stare, rather than Mr Jobs’ customary rant, insiders say.“He’s not an emotional guy, but people knew when he wasn’t happy with them,” one former peer said this year. “If one of his teams wasn’t delivering, there was no confusion around it.”Equipped with dry humour, Mr Cook has modest tastes. He has long rented a house in Palo Alto, in Silicon Valley.A passionate supporter of Auburn University’s football team, with pennants and other paraphernalia adorning his office and home, he often flies to Alabama for their games.Mr Cook sports close-cropped greying hair, wire-rimmed glasses and keeps in physical shape with a gruelling pre-dawn gym routine.Mike Abramsky, an analyst with RBC, said that the key transition would be in Apple’s process, as it moves “from icon-led to team-led, from disruptive innovation to continuous innovation.”“Most innovations at Apple are created through small teams, and Steve’s approach to design and execution remains steeped into Apple’s culture,” he said.
228;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-08-15T18:21:23Z;Google/Motorola: patently a good idea;The deal will build an intellectual property fortress around its Android O/S;"It’s the patents. That was the near-unanimous response to Google’s acquisition of Motorola Mobility for $9.5bn (net of cash); Motorola’s patents will allow the search giant to build an intellectual property fortress around its Android operating system. But Google is buying something more: a cheap option on the future of mobile computing.Google is willing to pay up for the IP to protect the profitability of the handset manufacturers that deploy Android. Last quarter, 47m Android smartphones were sold, according to Gartner data. Say the manufacturers were ultimately forced to pay just a $5 royalty per handset – HTC is reportedly already paying that much to Microsoft – to various patent holders. That would amount to $1bn of pure profit taken out of the Android market annually. Put a growth-company multiple of (say) 25 on those profits (Android unit sales rose more than 300 per cent last quarter) and the value of what is at stake is clear. A stronger patent portfolio would allow Google to reduce the royalty burden using cross-licensing agreements. That would protect its own profits from the mobile market, which it realises through its mobile advertising unit. Google says this unit has a revenue run rate of more than $1bn.One should not, however, forget the potential value to Google of having a captive handset manufacturer (one that also makes television set-top boxes). As large as Google’s mobile ad business is, Apple’s integrated hardware/software business is still bigger and growing fast. Considering that Apple sold $13bn worth of iPhones last quarter, and that there is no faster-changing market than mobile computing, it makes sense for Google to broaden its exposure. No one knows whether the open Android or the integrated Apple model – or a combination of both – will have superior economics. Google now has a foot in both camps.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
229;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-08-12T17:21:49Z;Sifting through emerging technologies;;As IT has permeated almost every corporate activity, business executives, along with IT professionals, have been drawn into the mire of technology acronyms and vendor “hype”. The field of emerging technologies – IT concepts that have yet to fulfil their full potential and perhaps never will – is particularly prone to marketing speak and spin.In an effort to seperate the real opportunities in emerging technologies from the rest, I asked Jackie Fenn, vice-president of research at Gartner, about the most hyped emerging technologies and how business leaders should evaluate them.Financial Times: Based on Gartner’s research, what is the most hyped emerging technology?Jackie Fenn: As you’ll see from our latest emerging trends hype cycle, cloud technology in all its manifestations has been the most hyped business technology for the past couple of years, and still is. In 2009, we introduced a separate hype cycle just focused on cloud to acknowledge the fact that certain areas of cloud computing (like software-as-a-service) are more mature than others, and to recognise the surge of new activity in the field. This year, there are 35 entries in the cloud computing hype cycle, with private cloud computing and platform-as-a-service at the peak of inflated expectations. As with most significantly hyped technologies, there is a tendency to rush in (and then abandon) based on market pressure, but there can be real enduring value when the technology is used appropriately.FT: Are there any other technologies that you would specifically identify as likely to have a significant business impact that business leaders should monitor?JF: In the two to five-year horizon, we expect to see significant business value from “big data” initiatives that aim to find business insight from new data sources such as social media, location and time information from cell phones, open government data, event streams from connected sensors and images from cameras and phones. Organisations will find it challenging to deal with the expanding scale and scope of these information sources, and the fact that organisations don’t own the data themselves. Those who can figure out how to harness these incredible resources will be able to analyse and mine the information to identify new services opportunities, marketing and process improvements, improved risk management and a whole host of other opportunities.FT: Should business leaders ignore those emerging technologies that are in the ”trough of disillusionment” on the hype cycle?No. The trough of disillusionment is a period when people and organisations react against the exaggerated hype by moving too far in the other direction. If business leaders have a sound innovation process that guides them to adopt technologies based on potential business value, rather than because of external hype, then those adoption decisions are still valid even in the trough of disillusionment. The trough can be a period to re-evaluate based on early experience, and determine whether now is the right time to continue with an investment or whether the experience should be “banked” until the technology meets the organisation’s needs in terms of performance, price, usability, or business case. In fact, a really good point to watch for is when a technology begins to rise out of the trough and starts its journey up the slope of enlightenment. That’s a great time to still be ahead of mainstream adoption but learn from some of the early successes and failures.More information on the latest Gartner Hype Cycle research is available on Gartner.com
230;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-08-11T21:27:36Z;HTC to take control of Beats headphones;;HTC, the Taiwan-based smartphone manufacturer, is paying $309m for a 51 per cent stake in Beats Electronics, a US-based maker of high-end headphones best known for its partnership with Dr Dre, the rapper and music producer.The deal, HTC’s fifth acquisition this year, will enable the company to integrate Beats’ sound technology into its smartphones. Like other smartphone makers that use Google’s Android operating system, HTC is trying to differentiate its handsets from competitors, including Samsung and Motorola Mobility.HTC said it plans to have a number of products that incorporate Beats technology on the market by the end of the year.The deal was announced in Los Angeles by Peter Chou, HTC chief executive, and Jimmy Iovine, Beats chairman, who said they expect the transaction to close in coming months. Mr Iovine, will continue to run the company.“This partnership is based on a core belief that amazing audio is the key to mobile phone experience,” Mr Chou said. “We think this is a very good opportunity to continue to differentiate our products.”The HTC chief executive added that Beats ”cool” brand image and appeal would also help HTC continue to boost its brand in the US and other markets. “Sound quality is very important. People are willing to pay more for better quality.“Smartphones are becoming the centre of mobility,” Mr Iovine said. “Our goal is to deliver high-quality music to smartphone owners. The music industry has to make music available in the places people want to listen to it.”The latest figures published today by Gartner, the technology market research company, revealed that global smartphone sales increased to 107.7m units in the second quarter, up 74 per cent over the year, with Android-based smartphones claiming a 43.4 per cent market share, up from 17.2 per cent a year earlier.Android-based smartphones now dominate sales of new smartphones ahead of those running Nokia’s Symbian operating system and Apple’s iOS, but it has become increasingly difficult for the manufacturers of Android-based smartphones to distinguish their handsets from each other.Beats Electronics, which also makes speakers, was founded by Mr Iovine and Dr Dre in 2008 and has quickly established a reputation for designing high-end headphones, earbuds and speaker systems aimed at the youth market. The company claims to be the top supplier of headphones priced over $100 in the US and France.
231;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-08-03T18:59:59Z;Fashion for focus may cast its gaze on media giants;Are diversified media conglomerate’s days numbered?;“It is as if the media industry did not get the memo the rest of the business community got back in the 1980s that conglomerates do not create value,” Jonathan Knee, Bruce Greenwald and Ava Seave wrote in their 2009 book, The Curse of the Mogul.Activist investors’ sudden interest in McGraw-Hill, home to local television stations, textbook publishers, aviation trade publications and the Standard & Poor’s credit rating agency, has revived the question of whether the diversified media conglomerate’s days are numbered.So, too, should Rupert Murdoch’s troubles with the News of the World, which he told members of the British parliament accounted for less than 1 per cent of the wider News Corp group. This implied that he had been too thinly spread thinking about other arms of the business such as Fox News, Avatar, HarperCollins and Dow Jones to keep on top of the crisis brewing at a single UK tabloid.The question is not a novel one. The great US conglomerates of the 1960s and 1970s are now memories preserved by architectural relics. Just up Sixth Avenue from the offices of McGraw-Hill and News Corp, the FT’s pink logo lights up the former headquarters of the ITT of Harold Geneen, the “conglomerateur” who added many unrelated businesses including Sheraton hotels and Avis car rentals to the telecoms group. Walk on to nearby Columbus Circle and Donald Trump has his name on the building from which Gulf+Western used to juggle car parts manufacturers, Stax Records, Paramount Pictures and the Miss Universe contest.Media conglomerates have taken longer to follow the fashion for focus. It is not much more than a decade since Jean-Marie Messier’s Vivendi and Gerry Levin’s Time Warner were diversifying, seduced into believing that digital “convergence” would make sense of assets as disparate as RTL and Napster, or HBO and AOL.Jana Partners, the activists pressing McGraw-Hill, joined Carl Icahn’s 2005 tilt at Time Warner. The veteran activist investor backed away but the group later shed AOL and Time Warner Cable. Mr Messier’s successors have rationalised Vivendi’s portfolio and Sumner Redstone split Viacom and CBS in 2005. The slimming moves have been rewarded by shareholders wary of synergy claims.Peter Appert, a Piper Jaffray analyst, says McGraw-Hill’s shareholders have a closer parallel to consider. Dun & Bradstreet, once a sprawling business media empire, began 15 years ago to dispose of brands including Gartner, RH Donnelly and Moody’s, S&P’s rating rival. The result, The Curse of the Mogul notes, was a decade in which its shareholder returns were roughly double those of the wider market.By contrast, VNU, the Dutch publisher that bought two old Dun & Bradstreet companies – Nielsen Media Research and AC Nielsen – faced a shareholder revolt when it tried to add a third in IMS Health, leading to its sale to private equity groups who renamed the group Nielsen and quit publishing. The lesson of VNU’s case is that shareholders only support conglomerates if they believe that their executives have exceptional capital allocation and management talents (think of Berkshire Hathaway or GE).The irony for Terry McGraw, McGraw-Hill’s chairman, is that for 10 years before the crisis in the structured finance markets that made S&P rich, his group outperformed rivals, largely because he avoided costly dotcom-era acquisitions.But as shown by S&P’s recent regulatory and legal battles and by strapped US school budgets, it only takes one or two underperformers to sour investors’ opinions of a conglomerate’s operation. It remains hard to find a media group, from Bertelsmann to Sony, with no questions being asked over the shape of its portfolio.Conglomerate models survive and the urge to diversify remains strong. Many companies branch out because they run out of things to do with the cash their core business earns and are reluctant to hand it back to shareholders.Too often, they invest it in areas that seem to promise faster growth or elusive synergy benefits. As technology investors consider Microsoft’s cash pile or Apple’s unspent $76bn, they should beware of this generation’s corporate stars repeating their predecessors’ conglomerate mistakes.Today’s media conglomerates look over their shoulders at the likes of Apple and Google, which James Murdoch said in June were “much, much bigger beasts” than a News Corp or a Time Warner.History and the cycles of corporate fashion suggest that new media conglomerates will soon emerge – some, perhaps, by buying the assets McGraw-Hill looks likely to shed. Old conglomerates that see the sense in focusing their energies might have to put up with smaller skyscrapers in future but they will be on firmer foundations.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s Media Editor.
232;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-08-03T16:48:32Z;Huawei steps up consumer sales drive;;Huawei Technologies, the world’s second-largest mobile network equipment maker by revenue, is stepping up an aggressive sales push in the consumer handset market.Mirroring similar moves by other handset makers, Huawei on Wednesday launched the Vision, a smartphone that is notable for giving users access to cloud computing services. It follows the launch last week of a cloud-based mobile operating system by Alibaba, China’s largest e-commerce company, which will provide similar services.Huawei broke into the world’s top 10 handset makers by number of devices sold in 2008, according to Gartner, the research company, but the Chinese company trails well behind the likes of Nokia, Samsung, LG, Apple and Research in Motion. Huawei sold 7m handsets in the first quarter of 2011, compared with Nokia’s 108m.Wan Biao, chief executive of Huawei’s device unit, said the company aimed “to be among the world’s top three handset brands in 2015”. Revenue grew 64 per cent to $4.2bn in the first six months of 2011 compared with the same period last year, Mr Wan said, and executives added that they expected growth at the unit for the full year to continue at the same pace.Huawei is poised to quickly become a more meaningful rival for other handset brands as it refocuses. “In the past, we were focusing on [telecoms] operators only. Now we are also focusing on consumers,” said Victor Xu, chief strategy and marketing officer of Huawei Device.As part of the new direction, the company kicked off a marketing campaign with a new brand slogan and sponsorship of Italy’s football super cup.Huawei’s aggressive push into the consumer market comes as growth in its traditional network equipment business has been slowing.The Shenzhen-based company reported revenue of $28bn for last year, up 24 per cent from 2009, and has said it expects sales to expand to $100bn within 10 years. But that is significantly slower than its average growth pace over the past decade.Huawei has struggled in the US, where its services business has grown but has yet to secure a single first-tier operator network contract.Ren Zhengfei, the company’s founder and chief executive, once served in the People’s Liberation Army. Although Huawei insists it is owned by its employees and that Mr Ren’s stake has fallen below 2 per cent, critics in the US accuse the company of maintaining links to the Chinese military, making its network equipment a national security risk.Additional reporting by Andrew Parker
233;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-07-27T19:17:50Z;SAP gaining market share from rivals;;SAP, the business software maker, said it was gaining market share from competitors, including archrival Oracle, after reporting a strong set of second-quarter results that buoyed its shares for a second day.In an interview with the Financial Times, Jim Hagemann Snabe, co-chief executive, said SAP was “taking significant market share in all geographies.”“I actually believe that this marks a tipping point of a structural change in the industry which is pretty significant. You’ve seen companies go out in the second quarter with very different messages. Some are claiming IT spending is not growing. And we are obviously seeing the opposite,” he said.Once considered a rather staid provider of enterprise software that helps companies run more efficiently, SAP is betting that mobile, cloud computing and in-memory computing – a new way to quickly analyse large amounts of business data – will help it gain ground on its rivals.Mr Snabe and co-chief executive Bill McDermott have pushed these innovations since taking over last year and analysts said they could be beginning to bear fruit.“The bottom line is this is a company with two new CEOs who have been making management changes … and you’re starting to see a lot of that change starting to take effect,” Donald Feinberg, vice-president at Gartner, said “Now they’re going to have to deliver on it”.Mr Snabe said SAP was targeting €100m in revenues for mobility and in-memory computing this year. “This is quite significant given they were first launched as an idea and delivered to the market at the end of last year,” he said.Rajeev Bahl, analyst at Matrix Capital Partners, said: “Mobility products are the most significant in the short term. It allows SAP to sweep up business that would otherwise go to others. It also extends the reach of SAP in businesses. On average just 23 per cent of employees in a company would come into contact with SAP software. Mobility takes that much further.”Larry Elisson, Oracle’s founder, once infamously described in-memory technology as “wacko, ridiculous, complete nonsense”.But SAP insists it is now answering its critics. “The pipeline for in-memory computing is the fastest pipeline growth in our history,” said Mr Snabe.“A year ago competitors were laughing at us,” he said. “And now they realise that this is significant and will change the industry fundamentally.”“We have definitely proved [the critics] wrong – you are seeing many companies in the industry desperately acquiring small companies that have any flavour of in-memory computing in their portfolio,” he added.SAP raised its full-year earnings and revenue guidance late on Tuesday, causing its shares to jump 3.6 per cent. The share gained a further 1.6 per cent on Wednesday, on a day when most German blue chips lost ground.SAP expects 2011 operating profit to be at the upper end of its previous range of €4.45bn-€4.65bn ($6.5bn-$6.75bn).
234;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-07-25T21:36:15Z;Supply chain leaders identified;Natural disasters have sparked a new hot topic in boardrooms;"Supply chain management has been a hot topic in the boardroom this year after natural disasters such as the Japanese earthquake and tsunami which focused attention on the increasing complexity and interdependency of many companies processes.While it may not be possible to anticipate every threat to a corporate supply chain, experts suggest that it is possible to learn from global supply chain leaders – those companies judged to manage their supply chains most effectively.Last month Gartner, the IT research firm, published its seventh annual “Supply Chain Top 25” ranking, which highlights global supply chain leaders. The list is designed to highlight best practices that all companies can learn from, and help raise the bar for the supply chain profession as a whole.It focuses on large, public manufacturers and retailers, drawn primarily from the Fortune Global 500 and Forbes Global 2000 lists. “We derive a composite score for each company (there were 263 companies on the list this year) made up of 50 per cent financials and 50 per cent opinion, a balance of objective and subjective components,” explain the authors of the study, Debra Hofman, Kevin O’Marah and Carla Elvy.The Gartner team assesses three financials measures taken from each company’s annual report, return on assets, inventory turns and revenue growth. The opinion portion is equally weighted between a Gartner analyst opinion and a Peer Panel vote. There were 156 supply chain executives who voted in the peer panel this year, coming from the manufacturing and retail sectors around the globe.So which companies led the way this year? The top five this year include three mainstays - Apple, Dell and Procter & Gamble which have all ranked consistently close to the top every year. Despite some challenges with its initial iPad introduction and subsequent supplier issues, Apple retained the number one slot for the fourth year in a row, riding the crest of superior financials and top-of-the-line voting scores.“Dell, moving in to the number two slot on the basis of strong opinion scores and high inventory turns, has been radically redefining itself with segmented supply chain response models,” said the authors. “And Procter & Gamble, one of the most respected supply chain leaders in the world, an early pioneer of the consumer-driven supply chain concept, and in the Top 5 every year since we started the ranking, landed in the number three slot.”Two companies, Canada’s Research in Motion, the BlackBerry smartphone maker, and Amazon, the internet retailer, made it into the top five. Both appeared on the list for the first time last year, having cleared the revenue cutoff, and both jumped up this year – RIM with its global postponement and collaborative supplier management capabilities, and Amazon, coming in second in the peer vote with advanced network delivery capabilities.“The ranking also includes stellar supply chain performers – companies such as Cisco, Samsung, Intel, HP, PepsiCo, Wal-Mart, Coca Cola, IBM, Unilever, Colgate and others that continue to push the envelope of supply chain innovation with a demonstrated commitment to supply chain as essential to their success,” said the report’s authors.Four new companies joined the top-25 list this year. Nestle, one of the world’s largest food producers; Starbucks which has been transforming its supply chain to be a strategic differentiator; 3M, an icon of innovation; and Kraft Foods, with its leading channel management strategy. “All will provide rich sources of supply chain best practices from which others can learn,” the Gartner team said.There were also some interesting trends related to the recovering economy. “Increasingly we see a two-way street in global supply chain strategies, where emerging markets, once attractive primarily for low-cost manufacturing and sourcing, have become important sources of new revenue growth, and this represents a new set of challenges for supply chain practices,” said the team.Four key themes emerged this year among the leading companies. These included how they dealt with the demand volatility they experienced during the downturn and which they now fear is here to stay. Leading companies are now actively building in the capacity for resilience – the ability to deliver predictable results in the face of unanticipated events – as a core strategy going forward.“We are also seeing the traditional question of “vertical integration” versus “focus on core competencies” become more nuanced,” say the authors. “What’s more important than which one of those strategies a company chooses is the extent to which it’s able to control the output of its end-to-end value chain and response to the end customer, and the leaders are devising innovative ways to do that. “The four main recommendations that emerged from the study were:1. Develop supply chain processes and methodologies throughout your trading partner network that will provide the resiliency to deliver predictable results in the face of ongoing volatility.2. Supplement a clearly articulated, long-term value chain vision with strong, agile, and sustainable execution capabilities. Push your team to think differently and go beyond conventional wisdom to push the boundaries on performance levels.3. Measure your supply chain as your customers experience it. Develop the capability to internalize customer needs, and proactively build customer feedback into your supply chain design.4. Step back and consider the basic supply chain capabilities you need, as well as the innovations that will differentiate your performance. Ensure the sustainability of your efforts and initiatives through a constant focus on governance, change management and culture."
235;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-07-24T16:26:39Z;UK’s Tesco to pilot free WiFi in stores;;Tesco is poised to offer customers a free WiFi internet service in its stores, in what is thought to be a first for a British supermarket.The move comes as Britain’s biggest retailer seeks to embrace customers’ changing shopping habits, but also reinvigorate its domestic business, under new chief executive Philip Clarke.Providing WiFi, which enables wireless connectivity to the internet for smartphone and laptop users, means customers will be able to compare prices and read product reviews as they shop.Mike McNamara, Tesco’s chief information officer, said consumers were already using mobile technology to check that the supermarket’s prices were competitive. “You can stand Canute-like and pretend nothing is happening . . . or you can say it’s happening, and I am going to help it happen,” he said.Tesco is currently experimenting with the WiFi service in four stores. Mr McNamara said that if this was successful, it could be rolled out quickly elsewhere. “My guess is it will go to all stores,” he said.Mr McNamara said the service would be free. Much of the investment in infrastructure had already been made, as Tesco uses WiFi in its own operations in stores. However, “if you sit there streaming video forever, we may switch it off,” he added. Tesco could also look to replicate the WiFi service outside the UK.While several US store groups, including the Sam’s Club warehouse chain, are providing WiFi in stores, Tesco is thought to be the first big UK retailer to do so. Sam’s Club is owned by Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer, but serves higher income customers than Walmart-branded superstores, which do not have WiFi.The size of Tesco’s estate – it has 2,700 stores covering almost 37m square ft – will significantly expand the number of free WiFi hotspots in the UK.Many are currently in coffee shops, such as Starbucks and fast food restaurants such as McDonalds. But Paul DeBeasi, analyst at Gartner, said retailers could be the next wave of businesses to offer free internet surfing.Colin Jeffrey, a director at Deloitte, predicted that many customers would expect WiFi as a matter of course within a year: “Its almost taken for granted in coffee shops and hotels now. Retailers are going to have to move quickly to meet the basic expectations of customers.”For Tesco, another incentive to offerWiFi is its Clubcard loyalty scheme, which is poised to become increasingly digital. A US experiment with the scheme this autumn will see customers receive rewards digitally, rather than through physical vouchers. This approach could then move to China, followed by the UK, where customers can already access their Clubcard accounts online.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson
236;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-07-22T06:30:14Z;Intel’s emerging opportunities;;If worldwide shipments of PCs rose only 2.3 per cent in the last quarter, according to the Gartner research firm, what accounted for Turkey and Indonesia’s comparatively stratospheric growth of more than 70 per cent?Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, ran through the impressive figures from emerging markets during the chipmaker’s earnings call on Wednesday and Stu Pann, a vice president in sales and marketing, added some extra colour on Thursday.Turkey has a population of nearly 80m people and one of Intel’s biggest customers there is Casper Computer, with around 20 per cent of the market, he said, in an FT interview.The assumption with emerging markets is that base-level PCs make up the bulk of sales, but that’s not the case here.“They sell, amazingly enough, a lot of quad-core desktops for people that want to do content creation and they also sell some fairly high-end notebooks.“It is a mix of first-time buyers and replacement buyers, so there’s more going on than you might think.”The same kind of thing is playing out in Indonesia, another growing market where GDP is rising and people have more to spend, he said.“In these types of markets, families go and buy PCs – a notebook or desktop for their children to use at school, and it then becomes the family PC.“And they don’t buy that low[-end], they want something they can be proud of, that has a lot of functionality and can last for years.”Intel is also having success with companies building out the internet infrastructure in emerging markets.“A lot of countries want local clouds, where there are companies building up search engine capabilities with specific knowledge of the local market,” said Mr Pann.“We’re seeing some pretty big data centre growth as a result.”
237;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
238;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-07-21T23:46:53Z;Office offsets slow PC market for Microsoft;;Microsoft rang up record fourth-quarter revenues driven by its Office software suite while Windows revenues declined in a sluggish PC market.The company also reported 30 per cent growth in its entertainment and devices division, thanks to strong sales of its Xbox 360 console, Kinect motion controller and Xbox Live subscriptions.Total revenues for its June quarter were $17.37bn, up 8 per cent year-on-year and ahead of analyst expectations of $17.25bn. Profits of $5.87bn, or 69 cents a share, were up more than 30 per cent and beat Wall Street forecasts of 58 cents.The fortunes of Microsoft’s Windows mirror those of other PC makers and chip companies and – like Intel earlier this week – it reported that strength in emerging markets and from businesses refreshing hardware was helping to compensate for weakness in consumer sales in mature markets.Global PC shipments grew by only 2.3 per cent in the last quarter, according to the Gartner research firm, below its expectations of 6.7 per cent, amid poor economic conditions in mature economies and declining interest in netbooks compared to tablets.Microsoft has sold more than 400m copies of Windows 7 but revenues for this division were down 1 per cent for the quarter and 2 per cent for the full year. Business PC growth was up 8 per cent, the company said, and around half of PCs shipped in the quarter went to emerging markets.Peter Klein, chief financial officer, told analysts that Microsoft expected Windows revenues to continue to be impacted by weaker developed markets in its new fiscal year.“While emerging markets are an important opportunity for us …they impact revenue growth percentages as they generate lower average selling prices and have higher piracy rates,” he warned.Microsoft shares fell more than 1 per cent in extended trading before recovering to be flat at $27.07.Its Office 2010 product, released in June last year, drove $22.2bn in sales for Microsoft business, its biggest division, during the fiscal year, representing 16 per cent growth and 7 per cent for the quarter.The company said more than 100m licences had been sold in an “outstanding market reception” with the software suite being deployed five times faster than the previous version.Entertainment and devices’ revenues of $8.9bn for the year were up 45 per cent, boosted by the introduction of the Kinect motion controller, which breathed new life into the Xbox 360 console.Microsoft reaffirmed its guidance for the new fiscal year of 3 to 5 per cent growth.
239;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-07-20T18:36:57Z;20th Century Fox to launch movies on Android phones;;Twentieth Century Fox is bringing movie downloads to Google’s Android smartphone and tablet platform for the first time later this year, setting up the fast-growing operating system as a media platform to rival Apple’s digital dominance.Buyers of Fox’s high-definition Blu-ray discs from October, starting with X-Men: First Class, will be able to download an Android-compatible digital copy of the movie from its website using their computer. This can then be “side loaded” onto an Android phone.The Android download service – which Fox says is the first of its kind – will first be made available in the US, UK, France and Germany.Until now, digital downloads of its movies have only been available for Windows and Apple iTunes, the dominant PC and smartphone platforms. Recent months have seen Google itself launch a digital movie rentals service for Android in the US, while Netflix, the streaming service, launched an app for some Android phones in May.Fox’s move into Android comes six months after Google’s platform overtook Nokia’s Symbian as the world’s biggest-selling smartphone operating system. Its worldwide smartphone market share is expected to climb to 49 per cent by 2012, according to analyst group Gartner, while also capturing some 24 per cent of the tablet market, which is today dominated by Apple’s iPad.Unlike Apple’s iPhone, which comes tied to its iTunes music and video store, Android has not been seen as a media platform because it has lacked some playback and copy-protection technologies which movie studios require. In December, Google went some way towards addressing studios’ concerns by acquiring Widevine, a rights-management and streaming technology which powers services such as Netflix.“Given its strong growth as a mobile operating system, the support for Android is an important move for us because it further enhances Blu-ray discs as the best way to get your movies to all your screens,” said Vincent Marcais, senior vice-president for marketing at Twentieth Century Fox International Home Entertainment.Screen Digest, a research group, reported this month that growth in sales of standalone movie downloads had slowed sooner than expected, dealing a blow to Hollywood’s hope that digital revenues would replace those from DVDs, which are plummeting.Fox began selling bundles of Blu-ray, DVD and digital copies in 2009 and believes that the combination is a better way to sell content than standalone downloads.“The starting point for us is that people like to own a movie,” Mr Marcais said. “We need a business model that satisfies that need and Blu-ray is the business model that satisfies that.” He described streaming services that allow online rental without a permanent download such as Lovefilm and Netflix as “good complements” to ownership.The Blu-ray disc format was designed to anticipate future developments such as 3D TVs and digital delivery, with the forthcoming “Ultraviolet”, a new technology standard, allowing movies and other content to be moved wirelessly from a Blu-ray player to other devices.“One thing we didn’t anticipate was that people would be walking around with something called a tablet,” Mr Marcais said. “But with the connectivity and interactivity [in Blu-ray] we can now use the tablet as a second screen device to complement what is happening as you watch the big screen.”Fox is developing new smartphone and tablet apps for Android and Apple, designed to be used in conjunction with a film being watched on the TV, for example allowing social networking, companion materials such as quizzes and actors’ biographies or other interactive features.
240;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-07-14T16:30:27Z;Microsoft likely to flag up sluggish PC growth;;When Microsoft reports its latest quarterly earnings on Thursday, it is likely to show that sluggish growth in the global PC market and a steady shift towards the emerging markets has continued to weigh on its Windows operating system business.However, the world’s biggest software maker is still expected to report a solid end to its fiscal year, which came to a close in June, thanks in particular to robust demand for the latest version of its Office suite of productivity tools. Overall, Wall Street expects Microsoft to report revenues of $17.3bn and earnings per share of 58 cents for its fourth quarter, compared with revenues of $16.0bn and earnings of 51 cents per share the year before.Revenues from the Windows division fell 4 per cent in the preceding three months, and a further slight decline is likely as the company struggles to top a strong period the year before. IDC and Gartner last week reported that global PC sales grew by less than 3 per cent in the most recent quarter. Meanwhile, revenues from the Microsoft Business Division, which includes Office, are forecast to grow by 15 per cent or more, with the server and tools division also registering double-digit expansion.
241;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-07-04T17:45:03Z;Indian call centres: not as cheap as the UK;;"For well over a decade, India has been the destination of choice for western companies looking to outsource their call centre operations and take advantage of the country’s vast and cheap labour pool.But with Indian salaries expected to rise 13 per cent this year, at least one UK company has decided it’s cheaper to operate out of northern England than in Mumbai.According to a report in the Daily Telegraph, New Call Telecom said it was leaving Mumbai to open a call centre in Burnley, Lancashire after being attracted by low commercial rents and cheap labour costs there.As Nigel Eastwood, New Call’s chief executive, told the Daily Mail:Salaries in India aren’t that cheap any more. Add to that the costs of us flying out there, hotels and software, and the costs are at an absolute parity.Mr Eastwood added he also expected to save money through better staff retention in Burnley.In the UK we will pay workers the minimum wage. Given the current economic environment, we will get good “sticky” employees who will also receive bonuses linked to performance.A decade ago, companies from the US and the UK arrived in India in droves attracted by India’s low labour costs. But this is no longer true as the economic boom bought on by liberalising reforms has pushed up costs. Real estate prices have spiralled while companies have struggled with wage inflation and staff retention.“Voice-based call centres have attrition rates of 25 – 35 per cent, which adds to operation costs,” said Arup Roy, a research analyst at Gartner, an IT-specialist market research consultancy.As India’s upwardly mobile young professionals frequently switch jobs in search of higher wages, salary increases in the IT outsourcing industry in India are expected to average 11.9 per cent, according to Aon Hewitt, the global human resources company.Some of India’s biggest business process outsourcing companies told the FT last year that it is now cheaper to conduct businesses in some parts of the US and the UK. But up until now such cases of relocating back to the country of origin have been few and far in between.“This [relocating back to the US and UK] is certainly not a trend, but companies are moving back also because of the political backlash over outsourcing, especially in the US,” said Roy, adding that companies are more likely to move call centres to other low-cost destinations such as the Philippines due to cost and linguistic advantages over India.“Many of the smaller Indian companies are starting to shut down because they are no longer competitive, but larger ones are still winning new business from existing and new clients as they provide new value-added services,” he added.Related reading:

242;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-06-22T21:15:35Z;Growth in sales of business software;;Business software sales are growing strongly as global economies emerge from recession and companies begin to invest in IT infrastructure again in order to reduce costs, improve efficiency and expand markets.Figures published by Gartner, the IT research firm, suggest that worldwide enterprise software spending is likely to grow by 9.5 pe rcent this year and top $267bn, up from $244bn last year. Gartner predicts the global market will continue to grow in 2012 reaching $288bn, welcome news for enterprise software vendors including Microsoft, Oracle and SAP.“The market for enterprise software continues to recover, following the 2009 downturn, with signs of ongoing growth on the horizon,” said Joanne Correia, managing vice-president at Gartner. “Economic recovery is evident across all regions, although concerns have arisen in some countries in Europe and Asia,” she said. However she also cautioned that “the earthquake and tsunami in Japan has created additional marketplace uncertainty with a multiplicity of effects that are beginning to be determined.”Overall, enterprise infrastructure software spending is expected to reach $153.3bn this year, a 9 per cent increase from 2010 revenues. The market is led by the operating systems segment in which revenue is projected to reach $32.6bn in 2011, followed by database management systems at $25.5bn.Enterprise resource planning software is the largest segment of the enterprise application software market and is expected to account for $23.3bn out of the total $114.4bn spent on business applications this year, up from $103.8bn last year. Sales of office suites including Microsoft’s flagship Office package, will total about 15.7bn.“With this latest research, we see short-term currency uplift for US dollar-denominated growth for the period of 2011-2012 and downward adjustments in GDP across all regions,” Ms Correia said. “We have identified a strong correlation between GDP growth and enterprise software spending growth, where software tends to grow 4 to 6 per cent above GDP in normal market conditions. However, we do have concerns about the rising cost of commodities, including oil, and its impact on certain regional and country economies.”Emerging countries such as Poland, India, China and Brazil, which were less affected by the latest economic downturn than the US and Europe, are expected to continue to invest heavily in enterprise software over the next few years as they build the IT infrastructures necessary to do business on a global basis.Meanwhile Gartner expects enterprise software spending in North America to increase from $112.9bn last year to $121.2bn in 2011. The market will experience consistent growth through 2015, when spending in North America will surpass $158.1bn.“Gartner believes that oil prices and the outcome of the federal budget deliberations are the largest threats to economic stability in North America. However, current indicators are positive with consumer and business spending on both equipment and software holding up. With the extension of federal tax cuts – including the tax relief on capital equipment depreciation – due to expire at the end of the year, additional stimulus revenue could further boost enterprise spending on technology and other capital goods.”Enterprise software spending in Western Europe is forecast to reach $78.3bn in 2011, up from $70.3bn last year. “In Western Europe, enterprise software spending could see slightly stronger growth in the latter half of 2011, but the headwinds are getting stronger. The pace of growth in Europe is slowing, mostly because of recent currency appreciation, fiscal tightening, higher commodity prices and concerns about debt in countries such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain,” said Fabrizio Biscotti, research director at Gartner. “The result of these additional constraints on growth will exacerbate some country growth trends in the region. However, countries on the upside of this trend are Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, and Sweden.”Gartner predicts that the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan) will have the second fastest growth, after Latin America, in enterprise software revenue growth this year with spending expected to reach $26.4bn in 2011, up from 2010 revenue of $23.6bn.“Overall, emerging markets’ growth will slow over the forecast period, but will continue to be faster than those of the developed world,” said Yanna Dharmasthira, research director at Gartner. “However, economic growth in almost all the emerging countries is also likely to be affected by the slowing trends in Europe and Japan. Among the largest emerging markets, China and Brazil will see the most pronounced slowing trends, while growth rates in India and Russia will be less affected.Gartner’s report, ‘Forecast: Enterprise Software Markets, Worldwide, 2008-2015, 2Q11 Update,’ is available at here. Gartner is due to report the latest overall worldwide IT spending forecast on 30 June.
243;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-06-11T03:36:55Z;Time for a new concept: middle office;;"Most business people understand the concept of the ‘front office’ which markets, sells and serves customers, and the ‘back office’ that fulfils demand and handles operations.But Mark McDonald, a Gartner analyst and fellow, thinks it is time we introduced another concept – the ‘middle office.’ Below is an edited Q&A in which I asked him about this new idea.Q. Why exactly do we need this new concept of the ‘middle office’ – isn’t business complicated enough?The dichotomy of front versus back is the basis of how we think of everything from compensation structures and rewards (front office) to information systems (back office) and the way we look at reducing organisational costs (primarily back office).Front office processes are seen as highly competitive, information intensive and customer critical. They are often the sacred processes, as changing them can put the company’s revenue stream to risk. They are managed and viewed in terms of their effectiveness, how they get the job done, rather than their efficiency.Conversely, the back office is highly structured, automated and process intensive. They need to operate with high reliability, low cost and little variance. These are the processes that guard the company’s ebitda margin and, since they do not generate revenue, they are relied upon and measured against their efficiencies.But not every activity fits neatly into either front or back office processes. There are sets of middle office activities that largely go unnoticed, but may prove to be more important than either of end of the organisation, particularly when your organisation can no longer meet growth or cost cutting goals.Q. So what distinguishes these mid-office functions?Mid-office processes are decision centric, semi-structured and require the combination of experience and tacit information to assess a situation, make decisions and mobilise an organisation. Processes like new product development, strategy formulation and supplier management. These processes are often thought of as ‘more art than science’ and therefore they may not be overtly managed.Mid-office processes represent the core of ‘knowledge work” and can be difficult to measure and improve. They are critical because the decisions they produce and the actions they determine typically define the company’s direction and cost structure.Q. What are the distinctions then between the processes found in the front, middle and back office of an organisation?Front Office processes are information intensive, presentation-based and intended to attract and retain customer interest. Examples are sales and service, order entry, web stores and customer self service.Mid office processes involve collaboration and result in intensive decision-based outcome that have no readily repeatable workflow. They use work forms to accomplish tasks and concentrate on communication, transparency and creating engaging connections among interested people.Examples include new product development and product launches, ad hoc taskforce based assignments, performance reporting, complex customer service, case management, strategy formation and execution, supplier strategy and contract negotiation and meetings.Back office processes are highly structures and automated processes needed to carry out tasks with high reliability, low cost and low variance. For example supply chain, finance/controlling, manufacturing and human resource management.Q. Why is it important to identify mid-office processes?It is time to pay attention to the mid-office because the efficacy of its decisions and actions determine a company’s potential more than we realise. The middle office sets front office goals and binds back office processes. A poorly functioning mid-office requires the entire company to work harder than necessary to achieve their goals. Think of the cost of customer support when call-centre person hangs up to keep their average call time down or the warrantee expense from poorly designed products, or the time required to complete complex sales processes.Too often we treat the symptoms of poorly designed or executed mid-office processes indirectly. We implement new technology, re-engineer business processes or restructure organisations in the front of back office. These actions produce temporary results but because they do not take the mid-office into account these results quickly diminish.In addition, mid-office processes respond poorly to business process and IT solutions such as sales force automation, customer relationship management, call-centre solutions or business intelligence. These solutions seek to instil back office standardisation to what are essentially creative and semi-structured tasks.Q. What are the potential benefits of paying attention to the mid-office?The mid-office represents a new area of focus to drive growth and efficiency. The nature of the mid-office is changing as new technologies such as social media, mobility and dynamic intelligence make it possible to transform these processes in the same way that we have transformed the company from front to back. This is good news as most organisations are reaching the transformation tipping point as they can no longer just squeeze their operations or sweat their assets.Business leaders should look to improve the performance in the mid-office by clearing identifying mid-office processes and improve the communication and deployment of mid-office decisions. These decisions can take weeks or months to work their way through the rest of the company and be misinterpreted creating complexity, confusion and cost so they need to be clear.Another step is to stop the technology mismatch by introducing social media and other semi-structured tools to support the semi-structured work done by knowledge workers in these processes. One company taking this approach improved productivity by 25 per cent across 5,000 employees while experiencing dramatic improvements in quality.Q. So to sum up, what is your message for business leaders?If the adage ‘do more with less’ has lost its appeal, it’s time to a look at what goes on in the middle; the processes and activities that have so far escaped scrutiny largely because they do not fit into today’s neat model of what happens in the front and back of the organisation."

245;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-05-26T23:44:29Z;How Google is changing the game on mobile payments;;It’s easy to see why Google and its rivals would have their eyes set on mobile payments, but less easy to see how they can break into this market. With its Google Wallet announcement on Thursday, the search company has just come up with an answer.When it comes to the mobile computing world, commerce is more powerful than advertising: bringing actual customers into stores is the game-changer.In this paradigm, a built-in payment system closes the loop, connecting lead generation with an actual transaction, all on one device.But how to do it? As PayPal (which has sounded very much on the defensive during the recent spate of mobile payment announcements by rival companies) points out, it isn’t enough merely to offer an alternative. To change consumer behaviour, any new payment method has to be demonstrably better.Googles’ answer: tie payments to discounts and retailer loyalty programmes.The idea of receiving a coupon from a favourite merchant on a phone, then going into a store and waving the phone over a terminal to complete a transaction, has clear appeal, says Alistair Newton, an analyst at Gartner in the UK.He still cautions against the hype that usually goes along with announcements like this. After all, most people don’t carry smartphones, and even those that do are likely to use other forms of payment most of the time.But when loyalty programmes and payments converge, Mr Newton says it creates a “sweet spot”: retailers effectively provide a cross-subsidy that incentivises consumers and oils the wheels of the transaction, allowing the banks and card companies to keep their margin. He points to the Starbucks prepayment/loyalty card – now available on mobile phones – as an early example of effective card-less payment.Square, which came up with its own ambitious mobile payment idea this week, is working on exactly the same thought. Also pointing to coffee cards as the model, founder Jack Dorsey called existing credit card-based rewards arrangements “a mess”. They take loyalty programmes away from merchants and build them instead into cards, robbing merchants of the extra gratification that their customers would get from an instant reward tied to making a purchase.There are, of course, many reasons why an idea like Google Wallet might not catch on. Not the least of them is the difficulty of reaching sufficient scale to change the behaviour of both merchants and consumers.Also, as Mr Newton, points out, people might resist the idea of giving Google valuable information about their purchasing habits to add to its growing trove of data. But introducing the right incentives should certainly help.
246;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-05-25T15:27:39Z;Scavenging through the digital landfill;;"Echoing the shopaholic’s cry of “you just can’t get the wardrobe space”, businesses are engaged in the shopping spree to end all shopping sprees with the seemingly endless accumulation of information. Unlike other purchases, the good thing about information is that it hardly takes up any space and disk storage prices continue to fall. But it is one thing to store the accumulated information and quite another to be able to manage it and find what you want when you want it. And this is about to get a lot more difficult, because over the next decade organisations are going to decommission a very large number of the business applications that have been responsible for managing large amounts of business data.This takes place under many guises, such as “application rationalisation” or “process standardisation”, but whatever it is called by the technology leader in your organisation, the rate of loss of older applications is accelerating. This application decommissioning is almost universally beneficial. Organizations end up with a simpler portfolio of applications, less complexity, lower IT costs, more standardised processes and better management information.But there is a sting in the tail – the data that gets left behind. Current data – “live” data – about customers and orders and invoices and everything relevant to the operation of the business today, all of this is transferred from the old application to the new one. But within the old application there can be years of accumulated history for which there is no readily available place in the new application. This historical data are orphaned when the parent application is decommissioned: it has a home on a disk somewhere, but cannot be accessed in a way that meaning is preserved.Does this matter? For a lot of corporate data, the answer is clearly “no.” It’s time to load up the car with this junk and take it down to the local landfill. Wiping this data are fast, cheap and painless. But in a litigious and regulated world it is necessary to stop and think before finally getting rid of such data. You may be under regulatory mandate that obliges certain data to be retained and available for a given amount of time. And whatever you do, when wiping corporate data you must be able to show that you have done so in compliance with your corporate policy on data retention. You do have a policy on data retention, don’t you? Because if not you could find yourself in trouble if legal discovery processes are invoked.So on the one hand we have the enterprise seeking the benefit of a root-and-branch refresh of the ageing application portfolio, and on the other hand we have the challenge of maintaining sensible access to data that is orphaned when the original applications are eliminated. This is not a new problem, but it is a substantially growing problem. Gartner estimates that by 2020 half of all business applications that were running in data centres in 2010 will have been decommissioned. To give some perspective on this estimate, during the decade from 2000 to 2010 less than 5 per cent of applications were decommissioned. This massive surge in decommissioning will not be slowed by the challenges of managing orphaned data; most organisations will seek to seize the benefits of a leaner and meaner application portfolio first, and deal with the fallout later. But deal with it they must.What is to be done? First, ensure that your corporate counsel has an up-to-date enterprise records retention policy, and that enforcement processes are established. This will ensure that the vast majority of orphaned data can be wiped. What remains – the records that are essential to enterprise compliance with regulatory and legal requirements – demand a simple, cost-effective technology solution that will ensure the continued availability of the data. Policy first, technology second; without an effective policy, your organisation risks incurring significant costs for retaining access to rubbish.Andy Kyte, research fellow and Debra Logan, research vice-president at Gartner"
247;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-05-19T12:45:13Z;Nokia’s market share back at 1997 levels;;Yet another instalment of the story of Nokia’s long slow decline came on Thursday with the new global mobile phone handset figures. Nokia is still the world’s leading handset maker but its market share is now down to 25 per cent, a level last seen in 1997.To put that into perspective consider that in 1997 the world still hadn’t heard of 3G phones. The big tech bubble of 2000 was only just beginning to form.Carolina Milanesi, mobile analyst at Gartner said Nokia has come under fire both at the top end of the market from iPhones and Android handsets, and at the bottom end from virtually unknown Chinese entrants pumping out entry level mobiles into emerging markets.It is the latest in a series of small defeats for the Finnish handset maker. In April, HTC of Taiwan overtook Nokia in terms of market value. Last year Apple’s mobile handset business became more profitable than Nokia’s.A new defeat is set for next quarter, when it looks as if Samsung could overtake Nokia in sales in its home market of Western Europe.Android now rules the roost in the smartphone market with handsets using the Google operating system accounting for 36 per cent of the market in the first quarter, compared with just under 10 per cent a year ago. Nokia’s soon-to-be defunct Symbian operating system is only in 27 per cent of smartphones compared to 44 per cent this time last year.Android’s rapid rise isn’t surprising considering that dozens of handset manufacturers make Android phones. But the figures do highlight how rapidly things can change in the handset business.This can be good news for all the Nokias, Microsofts and RIMs, who all find themselves on the ropes. There is always the tantalising hope of a rapid come-back.Microsoft unveils its newest version of the Windows phone operating system on Tuesday, May 24th, giving the world the first real taste of what Nokia Windows phones could look like.But what it reveals had better be radically different. In these latest figures Microsoft’s share of the smartphone market nearly halved to 3.6 per cent.
248;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Product design: Customisation means much more than a local language manual;;"For manufacturers, pleasing customers and shareholders means making products people want – and doing so profitably.A successful product takes account of local preferences and the needs of specific customers. But a profitable product is one that allows its maker to achieve economies of scale, typically by centralising manufacturing.But customising products for different markets is no longer a matter of printing a local language manual and putting different stickers in the box. Companies need to add features for wealthier markets, and simplify products for others. They also want to use as many common parts and processes as possible.Car makers once designed and built entirely different models for markets such as South America, China, and the US. Today, they have global design teams that collaborate to produce base models – or “platforms” – that are remarkably similar in manufacturing terms, even if they look and perform very differently.The idea of standardised platforms is now finding favour in other industries too, from mobile phones to aircraft manufacture.According to Gartner, the market research firm, the need to win share in new markets, while containing or reducing costs is driving companies towards standardised designs that still allow for customisation. Businesses that succeed can increase the number of products brought to market by 70 per cent and reduce development costs by about a third.“Manufacturers want as much commonality as possible to keep costs down, but also flexibility in sourcing,” explains Marc Halpern of Gartner. “If you are sourcing parts from different suppliers, you want to optimise that as well.“You might introduce variants to a design because certain parts that meet certain specifications may not be readily available, and the manufacturer has figured out it costs more to ship standard parts than make a modification to the design to accommodate local suppliers.”Manufacturers are turning to tools from computer-aided design and engineering to product life cycle management software and applications to manage bills of materials and component sourcing. They are especially keen to invest in technologies that help them manage variants of their core products, to maximise the reuse of components, and to make the most of tried and tested production techniques.Global product development is also forcing companies to look beyond e-mail and Excel spreadsheets, to electronic visualisation and design tools that support collaboration. Microsoft’s SharePoint and video conferencing are being pressed into service.“A lot of the IT tools we use – visualisation, solid modelling, 3D drawing and electronic overlays – are pretty standard,” says Rob Gayson, vice-president for global operations and quality at Psion, the handheld computing devices maker.He adds: “Our differentiator in this market is that a lot of companies we compete with, have products that are designed for purpose. We design to a platform, which can then be extended to serve different purposes.”Another challenge for manufacturers is satisfying increasingly sophisticated consumer desires.The trend towards built-to-order manufacturing started with companies such as Dell, but the car industry is now its greatest proponent.According to Georg Gradl, manager for manufacturing industries at SAP, BMW – an SAP customer – has so many options and variations for its best-selling 3 series model that no two cars sold in a year are identical.Supporting a wider range of variations requires closer collaboration between designers, engineers and marketing and sales departments, and a move away from linear, and often paper-based, product development.“Among manufacturers, the idea of doing everything in one place and then shipping it out is long gone,” says Kenneth Taormina, global managing director for engineering at Accenture. “You design in different locations; you don’t always have the intellectual talent where you want it. Manufacturers now also want to tap talent in markets such as India and China.”"
249;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-05-17T12:45:52Z;Systems from the past may haunt manufacturers of the future;Globalisation, M&A and integration drive factory IT updates, writes Paul Taylor;Until the mid-1950s, the only “technologies” available to help managers run a manufacturing shop floor were materials ledger cards and spirit duplicators (known as Ditto machines in the US and Banda machines in the UK). But big changes were on their way.By the late 1950s, US-based manufacturing companies such as John Deere, the agricultural machinery maker, had begun to introduce early computer systems to help manage inventory, create bills of materials (BOMs) and plan production – signalling the first steps towards modern factory IT systems.Today, systems include programmable logic controllers – specialist computers used to control machinery on factory assembly lines – process controls, industrial automation systems, data acquisition systems and robotics.At the same time, more and increasingly sophisticated software applications are finding their ways into plants, eliminating manual processes.A recent study by Gartner found that, on average, each manufacturer owns and operates between 25 and 50 plants globally.Simon Jacobson of Gartner says that one of the biggest challenges facing companies with multiple factories is managing the complex and often “home grown” and incompatible manufacturing systems that have evolved often over many years at individual facilities. That makes it difficult, if not impossible, to have a “single view” of overall operations.This was a problem that L’Oréal, the French cosmetics group, faced. “In our 37 plants, we had probably a dozen different systems – home grown in many cases,” explains Morris Lenczicki, its vice-president of industrial systems applications.Beginning in 2003, L’Oréal began to move towards a manufacturing system built around SAP’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and Apriso’s manufacturing execution system (MES).After testing the system in Belgium, the company began to roll it out in 2005. Since then, the company has implemented the system in 23 facilities in Europe and North America and will introduce the same system in Brazil next month.He comments: “What we’ve noticed the most is that everybody is talking the same language, everybody is following best practices – which were built into the solution – and everybody has the same information …Now we have benchmarking that can go on between four or five different zones,” Mr Lenczicki explains.Now, he says, L’Oréal can begin to improve efficiency in other areas, including its manufacturing supply chain. “Before, our non-integrated systems meant it was very difficult to have a sustained reduction of inventory,” he says. “Everybody had their little pockets of fluff. Now, at least we can see where it is, and we can see where we can reduce it.”Manufacturers, like other companies, are becoming more customer-focused and demand-driven and as a result, distinctions between managing manufacturing and the supply chain are disappearing.“Being demand-driven requires a capability to meet customer demand for products and services with right-first-time production, while eliminating high costs and mitigating risks,” says Gartner’s Mr Jacobson. For most manufacturers, supply network complexity increases every year as a result of outsourcing, market demands, regulations and globalisation.In many cases, companies have inherited multiple manufacturing sites because of mergers and acquisitions.But while some have made substantial progress centralising their manufacturing business and IT strategies in the past five to 10 years, Mr Jacobson says they still face serious challenges applying enterprise software and architecture principles to manufacturing to help achieve standardisation.He says: “Manufacturing strategies are under pressure to ensure that output is not only consistent, but reflective of actual market demand and that the business is developing agility to adapt rapidly to volatile business conditions.”For example, the network of Cemex USA, part of the global building materials group, had grown through numerous acquisitions in the span of a decade, to include a total of 14 cement plants, distribution terminals, more than 100 aggregate quarries and several hundred ready-mix concrete plants.“As a result of our growth, a review of internal operations revealed that customers were served through multiple [systems], each with varied levels of service,” explains Ven Bontha, who is in charge of customer service.Cemex decided it needed to standardise the levels of service provided to customers and chose a customer relationship management package from SAP, the German software group.“Real-time visibility and the monitoring of the supply chain’s main variables to ensure on-time delivery and stock-out avoidance were some of the main challenges,” says Mr Bontha.Other manufacturers are borrowing techniques such as simulation and motion analysis developed for use in other industries to improve their operations.Since 2005, Borealis, a European chemicals and plastic manufacturer, has been using simulation software developed by Honeywell Process Solutions of the US, to help it design plants and processes, test their efficiency and train employees to start up the plant saving costs and improving safety.Jari Vettenranta, who pioneered the use of the simulation software at Borealis, explains: “In 2005, we were making big modifications to the plant and found that [simulation software] was a good way to teach people how these modifications worked.“After large-scale modifications, it’s always a challenge to start up the plant. The [software] gave the opportunity to train people before the actual start-up and get the plant working much faster.” In total, he estimates the simulator which cost about $1.5m, saved the company more than $6m during the start-up.Nevertheless companies such as Borealis and L’Oréal may be exceptions in what Gartner describes as “many years of underinvestment”, resulting in manufacturing capabilities and systems optimised for simpler times and not today’s of continuous re-engineering, process changes, and shorter lead times.
250;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-05-12T15:30:09Z;Manufacturers start investing in IT again;;Manufacturers cut back on IT investment drastically during the recent recession exacerbating a history of underinvestment in technology and ‘band-aid’ fixes for problems at a time when the complexities of global manufacturing have never been greater.Now investment by manufacturers is finally picking up signalling perhaps the introduction of a new wave technology in the factory. But what areas should manufacturers focus their limited IT spending on and what IT areas are the most hyped?To answer this question I interviewed Marc Halpern, lead author of the Gartner Hype Cycle for manufacturing Product Lifecycle Management and Production.Q. The Gartner Hype Cycle is meant to cut through the hype surrounding emerging technologies in various markets, and help business leaders understand the potential for those technologies to change the shape or direction of their industry. Based on Gartner’s research, what is the most hyped technology in manufacturing?There are several technologies that are being hyped in manufacturing. Perhaps the biggest category is analytics. The scope of analytics spans:•Market data to identify the best new ideas for innovative products•Supplier performance data•Factory efficiency•Customer returns, warranty claims, and service calls for repairs•Defect analysis from manufacturing processes•Analytics to estimate product life cycle costs including: product development costs, manufacturing costs, service costs, product discontinuation costsCustomer needs management (sometimes called product requirements management) is another much hyped capability. This has become increasingly important as manufacturers seek to penetrate multiple markets with products deriving from a common product family.To accomplish this, manufacturers need to understand both the common product features that all markets prefer and differentiated features that enable penetration into specific markets. For example, market research might determine that consumers in all markets might prefer a non-greasy skin cream but fragrances can be adjusted according to local preferences.Other hyped technologies support sustainable design and tools that can analyse a design and evaluate a product’s environmental compliance. Sustainable design tools help engineers and designers select the most environmentally friendly materials and help those designers and engineers weight the downstream implications of design choices on manufacturing, product use, maintenance, and product disposal impact on the environment (including a company’s carbon footprint).Q. Any other technologies that you would specifically call out as likely to have a significant impact?Systems engineering, portfolio management, product cost management, and simulation software will all have a significant impact.Systems engineering and portfolio management are necessary to design product architectures and products that maximise the number of common parts, yet can be easily differentiated to address the needs of multiple markets. Manufacturers are expressing great interest in product cost management to insure that they achieve sufficient profitability on any given product. This is becoming particularly important as the cost of raw materials continues to increase and global economic conditions remain fragile.Q. You mentioned simulation software, how is that being used by manufacturers?Manufacturers are continuing to increase their spend on many types of simulation software, most commonly to predict product behaviour under operating conditions and software to simulate factory operations. Such simulation software saves money in a variety of ways:•Identify and eliminate design defects before major investments in capital equipment and plants for production•Reduce the added cost and time of physical testingFor example, over the past 20 years in the automotive industry, simulation software has eliminated billions of dollars of physical testing and reduced the time from concept design to introduction of new cars by 25 per cent and more.Q. Are there any technologies in the ‘trough of disillusionment’ that business leaders should examine?Manufacturers should examine environmental, health and safety applications, regulatory compliance functionality within product life cycle management, and simulation and test data management. Regulatory compliance software within product life cycle management primarily addresses environmental regulations. It has been increasingly difficult and costly to keep track of the regulations as they proliferate globally.Simulation and test data management has value because simulation models and results incorporate substantial intellectual property related to design intent and product performance.Also, manufacturers can continuously improve their design practices by incorporating the lessons learnt from virtual prototypes used in simulation and results from the testing lab. In some industries such as aerospace and defence, automotive, and life sciences, manufacturers have the legal obligation to retain such records.
251;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-05-12T00:51:59Z;Google aims at Microsoft with Chromebooks;;Google has taken aim at one of the main pillars of Microsoft’s business, as it announced that notebook computers running its Chrome OS software instead of Windows will go on sale next month.However, analysts predicted that the company would struggle to find a big market for the first of the new computers, dubbed Chromebooks.Chromebooks give users access to applications running on the web rather than software on the computer itself, making them the first examples of what Google claims will be a new generation of machines purpose-built for the era of “ cloud computing”.Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, said companies in particular should benefit from the new style of laptops.“The complexity of managing your computers is really torturing users,” he said. “It’s a flawed model fundamentally.”Google said that Chromebooks made by Acer and Samsung would go on sale on June 15 in seven countries including the US and UK, and would be available to companies through an unusual subscription fee of $28 a month.Schools and governments will be charged $20 a month, while consumers will be able to buy outright the devices, which carry initial price tags of $349-$499.However, Michael Silver, an analyst at Gartner, said: “Why would Chrome OS notebooks be of greater interest than Linux notebooks, which have near zero interest?” Since most corporate software runs on Windows, he added, “Chrome OS does not really solve a problem today”.Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester, called Chromebooks “an incremental first step in a challenge to the traditional PC model”.Google may be able to create true rivals to corporate laptops “within the next couple of years”, he said, although much would depend on its ability to provide the sort of support companies demand.In one indication of potential interest, Google said it had received nearly 50,000 requests from companies that wanted to try out the machines as part of a free pilot programme.The response could indicate that some companies were looking to use Chromebooks primarily to gain negotiating leverage against Microsoft, one observer said.Related article: Why Chromebooks might turn up in a workplace near you
252;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-05-09T21:42:01Z;Bain approach intensifies Micro Focus debate;;The recent approach for Micro Focus by Bain Capital, the US private equity group, has intensified the debate about the long-term growth prospects of the British software company.Bain’s preliminary inquiry over the Easter weekend – a precursor to a possible bid worth up to £890m– followed a turbulent year for Micro Focus. The departure last June of Nick Bray, its well-regarded financial director, worried investors, as did last month’s resignation of Nigel Clifford after only 11 months as chief executive.The stock suffered a single-day fall of 26 per cent in February after the management said revenue and earnings for the year to April would be about 10 per cent lower than expected – guidance repeated in a trading update on Monday.Investor concern, analysts said, is founded on the company’s focus on Cobol, one of the oldest programming languages that is increasingly unfashionable.Companies will look to move their systems away from Cobol, said George O’Connor at Panmure Gordon, due to fears that the number of technicians familiar with the code is declining. “Cobol was the baby boomers’ lingua franca,” he said. “If you’re a young graduate, you won’t want to learn Cobol.”However, Cobol remains by far the most widespread code, used in all IBM mainframes and relied upon to some extent by most of the world’s biggest companies, including leading banks, utilities and retailers. While its reach is unlikely to expand in the coming years, demand will endure for Micro Focus’ software, which updates Cobol-based systems, said Tintin Stormont at Singer Capital.“Some of these applications are quite core in some of these big enterprises. [Micro Focus] is extending the life of this software …the only other option would be to replace it with package [off-the-shelf] software, so any competitive advantage they’ve built into it would be lost,” Ms Stormont said. “You lose all that individual tailoring.”That suggests a steady stream of cash-generative sales in the long-term future – potentially boosted as companies enlist Micro Focus’s services to help move their data from IBM mainframes to lower-cost servers made by the likes of Dell and Hewlett-Packard.This strong cash flow makes it attractive fodder for a private equity takeover. Bain is familiar with the software industry: its $65bn (£40bn) portfolio includes enterprise software companies, such as SkillSoft in Ireland and Applied Systems of the US.In February, the company highlighted its business in automated testing of companies’ computer systems, which accounted for a third of turnover in the first half of the financial year, as a central focus for future growth. Kevin Loosemore, who moved to executive chairman from a non-executive chairman role after Mr Clifford’s resignation, is expected to continue this strategy.Alexandra Jarvis, analyst at Peel Hunt, said a quarter of the group’s business was in “high-growth testing products” that could begin to reap strong dividends as early as next year.A Gartner study in January put Micro Focus third in the world by revenues in testing, ahead of Microsoft and Oracle, and behind only IBM and HP. “The company has a solid product line that it has invigorated, [and] it has provided a clear direction for customers,” Gartner said.Bain is believed to be planning a bid worth up to 450p a share, compared with 338p when it made the approach. However, analysts expect the buy-out firm to wait for Micro Focus’s next trading statement on Thursday before deciding on the quantum of its bid – or whether to pull out altogether.Micro Focus has forecast sales of $434m-$442m for the year to April, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $141m-$153m.“The update will tell us if they’ve made their numbers or not,” Ms Jarvis said. “If not, it provides strength to the ex-growth theory.”
253;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-05-06T19:55:46Z;Bin Laden spam floods Facebook;;A wave of spam has flooded Facebook over the past week. Hackers are developing more sophisticated ploys to drill through the social network’s security system, such as by preying on peoples’ curiosity to see photos of the dead Osama bin Laden.Analysts and security experts say the recent wave shows that Facebook’s rapid growth and more than 500m active users have made it the top target for spammers looking for passwords and financial details.“Whenever you have a forum or technology or website that has as large a critical mass of users as Facebook, inevitably they’ll be targeted and exploited,” said Hiep Dang, a security analyst with McAfee Labs.“Facebook is really a conduit that bad guys use to make you click on links to get infected with malware.”Spam is an unsolicited message that typically infects the user’s computer with a virus allowing hackers to track keystrokes and inspect stored cookies for account passwords and credit card information, Mr Dang said.Within 24 hours of the announcement that Osama bin Laden had been killed a week ago, links began appearing on Facebook profiles, luring people to click to see fake photos or videos of the dead founder of the al-Qaeda terror network.At the same time, other more established ploys to trick even savvy Facebook users picked up momentum.The spam degrades the quality of the Facebook experience, said Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner, a technology research firm. “If this continues, there will be attrition,” he said, adding that Facebook was likely to fix the problem within a week.But because the network operates on an open platform and is always evolving, “they will always have new anomalies, new bugs and new security holes”.One established spam application offers to show users which of their friends have looked at their profile recently. Another promises “cutting-edge technology” to show users what their face will look like when they are 65.If a user clicks on the link, a new message is generated to each of the user’s friends, and arrives with the user’s name, profile picture, and a casual note: “haha, mine is hilarious!! check yours out :)”.Facebook said its engineers were working hard to solve the problem. “Not only have enforcement mechanisms been pursued to shut down the malicious pages and fake accounts,” it said, “but also Facebook has been putting affected users through educational checkpoints to help curb the spread of the attacks.”The latest flurry of spam has prompted complaints from Facebook users – on Facebook: “Ack! Facebook is exploding with Osama bin Laden spam.”
254;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-05-05T03:31:09Z;Medtronic sees big value in iPads;Medical technology company one of the largest corporate users of the iPad;"Three days after Apple’s first generation iPad became available in April 2010, Michael Hedges, Medtronic’s chief information officer, had ordered 10 of them and had them shipped to Germany.The iPad, he reasoned, seemed like the kind of new technology that would attract attention to Medtronic’s booth at the German Cardiac Society Meeting in Mannheim.“We’ve never had foot traffic like that before at a congress,” said Mr Hedges who got his start in the British Army and has spent the past 25 years working in IT at several multinationals. “Yes, there was certainly a ‘wow’ factor, but it was clear there was something more that we could do with the iPad.”Like other companies that have been adopting the iPad like Edmunds.com, the car research website, and SAP, the German enterprise software vendor, Mr Hedges realised that the iPad was “a game changer” that had far-reaching potential – in Medtronic’s case as a healthcare tool to train doctors today and help patients manage chronic disease tomorrow.“We knew it was a technology that could fundamentally change our interactions with customers,” he says. So Mr Hedges ordered 5,000 of the tablet PCs for internal use, making Minneapolis-based Medtronic one of the largest corporate users of the iPad to date.“The iPad, and the larger wave of media tablets, has captured the imagination of business leaders,” says David Willis, research vice-president at Gartner. “Some companies have issued them to business and IT leaders in the spirit of exploration. Others see areas in which they can use media tablets to bring computing into settings that were not practical or were too cumbersome to use traditional approaches,” said Mr. Willis.Medtronic, the world’s largest independent medical technology company with 41,000 employees and revenues last year of $15.8bn, has developed several applications for the iPad.Taking advantage of the iPad’s visual capabilities has enabled Medtronic’s IT department to re-engineer sales and marketing applications. For example, a ‘virtual heart’ application provides a 3D visualisation of heart function.One application gives the company’s sales representatives one-touch access to marketing literature and journal articles that would require 10 pounds of paper to print.Another helps physicians get their questions answered quickly in a visually engaging way. “We were meeting with a customer who asked about one of our stents,” Mr Hedges explained. “Within seconds, a representative started the iPad, clicked on a multimedia about the stent, and showed the cardiologist everything he wanted to know. Not long ago, we would have had to dig around for a pamphlet, or wait for the laptop to boot up.”In adapting iPads to the enterprise, Mr Hedges and his IT team use a hybrid operating model that allows certain employees and collaborating companies to build applications. “We work for two or three weeks to develop an app, and then give the business (unit) a chance to comment and improve on it,” he explains.The iPads have been so successful that sales and marketing, R&D and other groups now actively seek IT involvement in new projects. “They see us as a source of Innovation,” Mr Hedges sas. “With the iPad, we found a solution credited with motivating sales and marketing professionals, spurring productivity and engaging in a better way with our customers.”Medtronic says the iPad allows the company to explain its innovative technologies in a fundamentally different way, helping increase understanding among its key customers. Now, the company is looking at the next step: developing applications that can translate the massive amount of information the human body generates and Medtronic currently measures — think heart rates, blood glucose levels, brain wave activity — into understandable, useful data that patients can access on their tablet computers, allowing them to better manage their health.“Think about parents with children who have diabetes, as an example,” Mr Hedges said. “We’re working toward a day when a parent can get updates to their iPad or other device sent from a Medtronic sensor monitoring their child’s blood sugar. Let’s say a child is at camp and her blood sugar drops, but she doesn’t realise it while she’s horseback riding. There could be an application that sends parents an alert, so they can contact someone at the camp to avoid a major health issue.”“We are in the business of improving and saving lives. When you have such a mandate, you are obliged to find and implement innovative information technology to get your devices to the people who need them as fast as possible.”Despite some initial concerns, help desk support calls have risen only slightly since Medtronic introduced the iPads and the only significant impact on the company’s application architecture has been the addition of security tools and content management software.Mr Hedges believes incorporating consumer technologies into IT begins with extending IT operations to cover them. “Since the roll-out, we have learnt how to use such disruptive technologies to drive business productivity,” he says.Indeed he believes that one of the biggest benefits of introducing consumer technologies into the enterprise is their inherent speed. “If IT does not act with speed, the business will; and it will find the value IT has missed. Unless CIOs embrace these new consumer technologies, they won’t be able to change the perception of IT for the better.”"
255;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-05-04T02:50:17Z;Battlelines in cloud services market;;When CenturyLink announced an agreed $2.5bn cash and stock bid for Savvis last week it signalled an accelerating push by US telecommunications groups into the rapidly emerging market for ‘cloud-based’ business computing services.These services, which range from delivering software as a service (SaaS) on a pay-as-you-go basis to providing instant access to IT infrastructure and computing power, are likely to become a key element in many corporate IT strategies over the next five years.A new global survey conducted by Axios Systems, a US-based IT Service Management software provider, revealed that 68 per cent of global companies plan to adopt a cloud strategy in the near term.In the Axis survey, 28 per cent of respondents said their organisations have already adopted a cloud strategy in one or more areas. Regarding future plans for cloud-based services, five per cent of respondents have plans to implement cloud services in the next three months and another 16 per have short-term plans to adopt cloud strategies in three-to-six months.“The market shows very clear signs of widespread cloud adoption,” said Axios noting that only 32 per cent of respondents had no current plans to adopt a cloud strategy. Similarly, Gartner, the IT research firm, has predicted that cloud computing will be adopted at an accelerated pace by business users and that, “in less than five years, there will be major shifts and higher adoption ratios.”Overall, Gartner believes the value of cloud computing market could reach almost $150bn worldwide by 2014. This accelerated adoption of cloud computing, in spite of continuing concerns about security and reliability, is one of the main driving forces behind the recent wave of mergers and acquisition activity in the web hosting and cloud computing industry which began with Verizon Communications’ recently completing $1.4bn purchase of Terremark Worldwide.The Verizon-Terremark transaction, first announced in January, focused bankers’ attention on the mergers and acquisition opportunities in cloud services market and the potential for telecommunications groups to add a new revenues offsetting the steady decline in the number of fixed lines they serve.Explaining the Terremark purchase, Lowell McAdam, Verizon’s chief operating officer and designated successor to Ivan Seidenberg when he retires as chief executive later this year, noted: “Every time we see a paradigm shift in computing, we see the number of users go up by a factor of 10. The global presence positions us to be a big player in the next generation of computing, as well. And where everything we do — media, communications, personal data, network intelligence, security protocols and many more — will be stored in the cloud and then delivered around the globe.”Verizon’s Terremark acquisition triggered speculation that AT&T and others would soon follow suit with its own purchase in the cloud computing space. Instead AT&T has focused on growing its internal business services business while announcing plans to acquire Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit for $39bn.Some bankers suggest the T-Mobile USA bid, which now faces regulatory scrutiny, would make it difficult for AT&T to follow Verizon’s lead and make its own cloud computing purchase. “I think they have their hands full at the moment,” one banker said.But such constraints clearly did not apply to either CenturyLink or to Time Warner Cable which paid $230m at the start of February to acquire NaviSite, another provider of enterprise-class hosting, managed application, messaging and cloud services.“NaviSite provides us with a successful managed services business and a new, innovative managed cloud platform representing significant new growth opportunities,” said Glenn Britt, Time Warner Cable’s chief executive. “We expect to build upon NaviSite’s successful enterprise-class offerings, and their operational capabilities, infrastructure and expertise to more rapidly create a robust managed services offering for small and medium sized businesses.”Similarly, CenturyLink proposed purchase of Savvis will enable CenturyLink to deliver managed hosting and cloud capabilities to its business customers on a global basis. Together the two companies will operate 48 data centers across the globe, provide access to extensive national and global telecommunications networks and feature a customer list that includes many of the largest multinational companies.Global reach is expected to be increasingly important in the cloud computing market as multinational customers begin to seek out service providers who can meet their requirements across geographies.“The transaction creates a premier managed hosting and co-location provider with global scale in a high growth sector, and is expected to be accretive to revenue growth and cash flow per share,” said Glen Post, CenturyLink’s chief executive. “Today, businesses are shifting the way they manage their information technology services and infrastructure, and this transaction helps us meet these needs.”James Ousley, Savvis chief executive, added: “As migration to cloud-based services continues to accelerate rapidly, a strategic combination was a natural choice to create significant scale and become part of a large global network for the benefit of our customers, stockholders and employees.” Those Savvis customers currently include nearly 2,500 unique clients and 32 of the top 100 companies in the Fortune 500.From the corporate users’ perspective, the Savvis, Terremark and NavSite deals demonstrate is that the cloud services market is maturing quickly and is likely to be the next battleground between traditional IT services companies such as IBM and Accenture, and relatively new entrants such as Verizon and CenturyLink.
256;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-27T23:08:09Z;Apple pledges to curb collection of location data;;Apple has blamed programming errors for its collection of data that tracked the rough location of iPhone users and pledged to cut down drastically on the practice, which has alarmed consumers and privacy advocates.After a week of increasing criticism and regulatory attention over the issue, the company said that it should not have been compiling the information on users who turned off location-based services. It said it should not have stored the records for a year.“The reason the iPhone stores so much data is a bug we uncovered and plan to fix shortly,” Apple said. “We don’t think the iPhone needs to store more than seven days of this data.”The furore echoes Google’s gaffe with its StreetView service, in which fleets of cars sent out to take pictures recorded personal data sent over WiFi networks. Google’s unauthorised data collection was uncovered by German regulators, prompting the company to drop the practice.In both cases, the companies were trying to assemble databases of communications data to connect users to the best wireless connections or other functions more quickly.The companies were racing to offer more advertisements, maps and other functions to people based on where they were and had stepped on privacy laws and consumer expectations, said analysts.Apple’s confession “is a huge setback” for such efforts, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner.“Consumers are starting to realise they are broadcasting a lot of personal information and that they don’t want to share all this in many cases with people they have no interaction with,” he said.Regulators in Germany, South Korea and elsewhere have begun enquiries into Apple’s collection of data, which was often stored on users’ home computers in unencrypted form and could have been obtained in legal proceedings or by hackers.Two Apple customers have filed a lawsuit citing wiretap laws and are seeking class-action status for their case.Several members of the US Congress, which is considering far-reaching consumer privacy laws, have also demanded explanations from Apple, Google and others about what they compile from increasing powerful smartphones.Ed Markey, a US congressman who was among those writing to Apple for answers, welcomed the changes but said he wanted to learn more.Apple and Google were asked to appear at a hearing on mobile privacy on May 10 by Senator Al Franken, the Democrat heading a new judiciary committee panel on privacy and Apple said it will testify.“The same technology that has given us smartphones, tablets and cell phones has also allowed these devices to gather extremely sensitive information about users, including detailed records of their daily movements and location,” said Mr Franken in announcing the maiden hearing for his subcommittee. “This hearing is the first step in making certain that federal laws protecting consumers’ privacy – particularly when it comes to mobile devices – keep pace with advances in technology.”
257;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-27T17:58:43Z;Cloud services show vulnerability;;When some of the cloud-based computing services run by Amazon under its Amazon Web Services moniker crashed early last Thursday, business customers including Foursquare, the location-based mobile service and Reddit.com, a news aggregator owned by Condé Nast Publications were knocked offline.By the start of this week, most of the services that rely on Amazon’s cloud-based computing platform, including its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Relational Database (RDS) were back to normal.One of the big attractions of cloud-computing for companies has been its supposed reliability (as well as its ability to reduce costs), so the problems at Amazon have garnered particular interest.Amazon has promised to provide “a detailed account of what happened, along with the corrective actions we are undertaking to ensure this doesn’t happen again.” But the outage has inevitably raised questions about the overall reliability of cloud computing and prompted calls from some of Amazon’s customers for greater transparency and improved communication from the cloud computing market leader.“It has been a ‘wake up’ call for organisations that have become dependent on cloud computing to meet their IT needs,” says Jay Heiser, a research vice-president at Gartner.But unlike some commentators who have suggested that the problems at Amazon Web Services could put the brakes on the migration of business computing to the cloud, Mr Heiser doubts that its repercussions will be so dramatic.“Overall I do not think that one event like this will have a significant impact,” he says. Instead he and most other IT consultants say the incident has highlighted the importance of companies fully analysing the risks of their IT strategies, and of making sure alternative resources are available should a failure occur.Eran Farajun, executive vice-president of Asigra, a cloud back-up solution provider, agrees. He suggests a three-point checklist for companies before choosing a cloud service provider:First, when signing on to a cloud service, even back-up service, find out the exit strategy. Second, make sure to have in the agreement that data can be moved to another service provider (so by extension, make sure other service providers can run the backend software, and the service provider agrees in writing to “wire the data” (like wiring money to a new bank account) at a specified cost or no cost.Finally he says it is important to make sure to have an option to license the backend software to run it in the company’s own data centre, or with a co-location hosting provider if that decision needs to be made. Know the cost of the software ahead of time.
258;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-25T19:29:47Z;Examining the cloud’s green credentials;;"Cloud computing is not the panacea for all the ills of corporate computing. But it could be one way to reduce the environmental impact of IT and improve a company’s ‘green credentials.’In this intervew I asked Stephen Stokes, vice president of research at Gartner, about the potential, and challenges, for cloud computing to reduce the environmental impact of IT.Q. Why is cloud computing sometimes linked to sustainability?Among its other advantages, cloud computing offers the potential to reduce the environmental impact of information and communication technology (ICT), mostly due to its flexibility and scalability. Conceptually, the shift to cloud computing has been likened to people moving from owning private cars to using public transport. But, just as buses and trains are inefficient if they are not filled with passengers or running poorly, the same is true for cloud computing service models.Most organisations tend to overprovision computing infrastructure by more than 100%. Shifting to a cloud model allows an organisation to remove redundancies and enables a more elastic model of computing demand. The typical increases and decreases in client requirements are absorbed by the cloud service and data providers resulting in potentially significant increases in resource efficiency due to scale effects.Q. Is this the next wave of green IT?It could be, but there are two critical issues that need to be kept in focus. First, the over provisioning challenge of in-house IT can still apply to the cloud-based IT service delivery and needs to be kept in check. The cloud service model is not automatically guaranteed to deliver more sustainable outcomes.Second, there is a need to distinguish between computational and energy efficiency gains and sustainable computing outcomes. The cloud delivery model is a key part of that future, but building data centres and data warehouses in locations whose grid power is dominated by carbon intensive electricity generation sources will, for the most part, compromise sustainable (low carbon) outcomes. Truly sustainable cloud computing will require relocation to regions whose power is dominated by low emission energy sources. We call this additional factor emission arbitrageThe over provisioning challenge should be addressed by market forces. The emission intensity challenge will only be addressed by wholesale transformation of power generation or by breaking the umbilical cord which places data centers and services in close proximity to their intended users.Q. What is more important for the environment – IT efficiency or lower emissions?It is a balancing act between financial and environmental costs and outcomes. It has been estimated that a third of data center operating costs relating to electricity usage can be saved when efficiency principles are incorporated into design, as well as lowering upfront capital costs.A reduction in energy consumption simultaneously reduces emissions relating to the associated power generation. The flip side is that the emission density of power generation can vary by more than five orders of magnitude. So even a highly inefficient data center operated in a location with low emission electricity would result in better environmental or sustainability outcomes than the most efficient data center in the world powered by coal-generated or some other high emission generation fuel.Efficient data storage is critical for financial outcomes and can reduce carbon emission footprints as a somewhat intended consequence, but it is accidental rather than intentional green IT. Truly sustainable or green IT needs to consider supply side issues of power sources along with other factors and this is where emission arbitrage comes into play.Q Doesn’t outsourcing of data warehousing and storage to any location reduce an organisation’s carbon footprint?Outsourcing IT services, via a cloud computing model or otherwise, does not necessarily reduce an organisation’s carbon footprint. Instead, it really represents an exercise in emission balance sheet adjustments; shifting what was recognised as indirect ‘scope 2’ greenhouse gas emissions (under the Green House Gas protocol) to ‘scope 3.’Many mandatory and voluntary emission reporting platforms require only scope 1 and 2 emissions to be reported, but accusations of ‘greenwashing’ would be highly likely if scope 3 emissions are not fully disclosed.Companies typically employ three strategies to “lighten” emissions burdens and footprints: The development of on-site renewable energy sources; the purchase of carbon credits to offset estimated emissions associated with electricity consumed or the purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs); or the consumption of low-emission (green) electricity. The outsourced service would need to be pursuing one or more of these emission reduction strategies as well as implementing energy efficiency technologies to ensure actual emission reductions.Q Should business leaders pursue renewable energy projects or other strategies?Installing solar panels on rooftops, wind turbines in car parks or making investments in energy efficiency within your organisation are great from a marketing, employee engagement and learning organisation perspective.But these sorts of strategies are in many cases not cost effective, and not sufficiently scalable to meet total energy demands. And they suffer from intermittency problems. Renewable energy sounds great, but when it comes to delivering service levels, business leaders have to distinguish between typically small-scale and intermittent next-generation renewable energies such as solar panels and traditional, more reliable renewable energy sources such as geothermal and hydroelectric energy generation. Data centers cannot afford to go offline when the sun doesn’t shine!The transition away from hydrocarbon-dominated fuel sources to clean energy is many decades away in most developed economies. As mandatory carbon reduction regulations and expectations continue to increase, there will be need for data intensive industries to develop scalable carbon reduction strategies while continuing to achieve growth.Installation of solar panels or wind turbines and the purchase of carbon credits, renewable energy certificates or other environmental assets, generally fail tests of scalability. Without government incentives, they typically fail investment analysis and are therefore a form of green surcharge on shareholders.The win-win strategy is to harness the best of energy efficient computing technologies and position them in locations where low emission power is readily and reliably available. What we have to recognise is that position may in fact be very considerable distances from traditional location close to the business activities. This is when the cloud-based model will start to deliver truly sustainable computing outcomes.Q What does the global map of low emissions power generating capacity look like?Regrettably, there are only a handful of locations globally where reliable abundant low emission energy is currently available. A handful of nations like Iceland and New Zealand have access to geothermal energy. Others such as Denmark, Austria and Brazil have invested heavily on hydropower projects. Countries such as France, Germany and parts of the US have low emission energy from nuclear generation sources, but given the recent events in Japan, this is unlikely to be particularly palatable to the public.The flip-side is the locations whose energy generation is dominated by hydrocarbon energy sources. When viewed from the sustainable business perspective, long-term development of data centers and data warehousing facilities in, for example, Israel (100 per cent hydrocarbon), Poland (96%), Australia (92%) or China (83%) should be carefully evaluated and only pursued in the absence of alternative low emission energy locations.Q. What do you think are the limiting factors to the offshoring of cloud and other IT services?The longer-term availability and cost of electricity will remain highly significant factors. Concerns relating to communications infrastructure data latency issues and data privacy persist and are still restricting wider uptake of cloud services. The need to ensure that latency-sensitive services (e.g., stock market transactions, issues of national security) are securely and located close to users will remain.Additionally, the presence of a local skilled IT services workforce, and, ideally, an advantageous local taxation regime that encourages long-term public/private procurement strategies for electricity will be important enabling factors.Q So is cloud-based data storage the next big business in the offshoring and outsourcing market?It’s likely to present significant commercial opportunities over the next decade. With the right levels of government interest, investment and policy incentives, IT service providers will exploit the benefits of emission arbitrage to offer low carbon or even carbon neutral, large-scale, cloud-based outsourced data services. We could envisage a European market served by Iceland, Denmark and Austria; an Asia Pac market served by New Zealand; and in the America’s a market served by Brazil could easily become established.Given the cloud market is expected to treble in size over the coming five years adding more than a hundred billion dollars of revenues, it’s necessary to start thinking about medium and long-term strategies to accommodate this explosive growth. Emission arbitrage will be an increasingly important aspect of the decision-making process in a similar fashion to the way labour arbitrage is currently factored into many aspects of business process outsourcing (BPO)."
259;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-24T19:03:19Z;Messenger delivers BlackBerry with a loyal following;;Many mobile industry observers are ready to write off the BlackBerry as it faces growing competition from Apple’s iPhone and touchscreen devices using Google’s Android software.Gartner, the analyst group, forecasts BlackBerry’s global smartphone market share to fall from 16 per cent today to 11 per cent in 2015, behind a resurgent Microsoft and its Windows Phone, while Android rockets from 23 per cent to 49 per cent over the same period.But BlackBerry maker Research in Motion has a secret weapon – one that until a couple of years ago even its own executives failed to realise it had.Teenagers and university students are buying BlackBerrys in droves for a single feature – and it is not e-mail.BlackBerry Messenger – or “BBM” – is an instant-messaging application only available on RIM devices.Superficially similar to SMS text messaging, it is both faster and cheaper, coming free without the need for a data package.It is used by more than 39m people worldwide with usage up six times over the past 12 months, making it a real threat to operators’ text-message revenues in some markets.“BBM has been a huge success story for RIM,” says Pete Cunningham, analyst at Canalyst. “A couple of years ago, BlackBerrys were only used in the corporate space. Then they caught a wave of coolness.”Particularly popular in the UK, Indonesia, South Africa, Venezuela and the Netherlands, celebrities such as musicians Adele and The Saturdays are among BBM’s many fans. “There has been a halo effect in those markets where BBM has really taken off,” says Patrick Spence, RIM’s vice-president for Europe, Middle East and Africa.According to GfK, the market researcher, BlackBerry was the UK’s biggest-selling smartphone last year. Mr Spence says BBM is the most significant reason that consumers now outnumber business users of BlackBerry.RIM is hoping that its entrenchment in the youth market will spread back up to older customers and prevent people from switching to rivals.“It’s evolved almost virally,” Mr Spence says. “It’s become its own cultural phenomenon. These things do fly under the radar . . . It’s easy to look back and say: ‘weren’t we smart’ but when we put BlackBerry out there, users determine how they are going to use it and what is ultimately the driver.”BBM grew out of a rudimentary service called “pin to pin”, which used a BlackBerry ID number to send short messages.A few presentational improvements and BBM was born – but largely ignored by corporate users, many of whose IT departments still shut it off because it is hard to monitor and archive for regulatory compliance purposes.While it is now more prominent in BlackBerry marketing, BBM took off “very much before RIM saw it on their radar”, says Graham Brown, director at Mobile Youth, a consultancy. “Teens and students were picking up BlackBerrys as hand-me-downs because parents were up-grading and started playing around and exploring.”Now kids are teaching their parents how to use BBM because they don’t want to incur text-message charges.RIM is building on that opportunity by providing new “gifting” capabilities in BBM, allowing people to send each other talktime vouchers or applications.Other virtual items such as music tracks are expected to follow.RIM is also opening up BBM to third-party developers, allowing them to build other services on top of or incorporating its messaging system.People could chat while they play a game of chess on their BlackBerrys or share what book they are reading on the device, with potential for opening it up to marketers.This BBM “social platform” is still in beta testing mode and RIM remains cautious.“The beauty of BBM is in its simplicity – it’s a clean, tight network,” says Mr Spence. “We are very careful about keeping the user experience.”Tech-blog rumours suggest that RIM is also considering opening up BBM to other mobile platforms, through an iPhone or Android app. RIM declined to comment.There is also the threat of authoritarian regimes clamping down on BBM.“It is BlackBerry’s Achilles heel because some regulatory authorities seem to hate it,” says Richard Windor, mobile analyst at Nomura. “We suspect that BBM is a major cause of the security issues in UAE and India.”If they forced RIM to remove BBM, “part of the stickiness of the BlackBerry user experience could evaporate”, he adds.For now, however, that stickiness remains one of RIM’s unsung assets. Indeed, BBM is so popular that users’ Pins required to start a chat have been spotted on car numberplates in Dubai and are feverishly swapped by strangers all over the world on BlackBerry’s Facebook fan page.“There is almost a brand around it in and of itself,” says Mr Spence. “It has that cachet in the same way that BlackBerry has on the corporate e-mail side.”
260;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-24T16:13:22Z;Emerging markets boost US chip industry;;The US chip industry is looking forward to a strong second half of the year after shaking off the effects of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, weak economic conditions and gloomy analyst predictions.The tablet segment is not cannibalising the PC market to the extent many feared, while increased corporate buying and the strength of demand in emerging markets have been highlighted by semiconductor companies reporting earnings in the past week.“Emerging markets are now over 50 per cent of unit volume,” said Tom Kilroy, head of sales at Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker.“That’s kind of off the radar screen for a lot of analysts.”IDC and Gartner, the research groups, this month reported a decline in PC sales in the first quarter and predicted growth this year of 6 and 11 per cent respectively. But Intel expects 13-15 per cent growth, with more than 400m PCs sold worldwide. It says the research groups are missing a lot of sales by local manufacturers and lesser known brands in emerging markets.Intel reported first-quarter sales and made second-quarter forecasts well ahead of Wall Street estimates last week, while rival AMD also reported “great traction” in emerging markets and this “white box” arena.Consumer demand in the US and Europe, where economic conditions are still difficult, was reported to have been “soft” by Intel and AMD as the public opted for tablet devices or delayed purchases. However, other mature markets, such as Australia and Korea, were seeing strong PC sales, as were China and Brazil, the number two and three markets for PC sales this year.Emerging markets are maturing to the extent that higher priced PCs, smartphones and tablets are selling well.“There were concerns when we moved towards emerging markets, but people there are buying higher-end devices,” said Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, in a Financial Times interview after the leading mobile phone chipmaker raised its forecast for average selling prices for phones this year by $9 to $199-$209.Corporate purchases are also helping the industry. Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, said the prospects looked good for sales of PCs – combining its latest processors and Windows 7 – in the second and third quarters. He said a replacement cycle was under way with 75 per cent of enterprise PCs still running two-generations-old Windows XP.The effect of the disaster in Japan on consumer demand and the supply chain for PCs and mobile devices appeared to have been slight, according to Intel and Qualcomm, with little impact on sales and no effect on supplies.
261;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-22T17:36:39Z;Nokia points to Android as biggest threat;;Nokia’s chief executive has declared Android smartphones to be his main competitive target, in spite of data showing that Apple has overtaken the Finnish company to become the world’s biggest mobile phone maker by sales for the first time.Apple generated $11.9bn of wholesale revenues from its iPhone in the first quarter, compared with Nokia’s $9.4bn of handset sales, according to estimates by Strategy Analytics, a research company.The data highlights the challenge facing Nokia after it signed a final agreement with Microsoft this week to join forces in the smartphone market.However, Stephen Elop, chief executive, said that, while the Microsoft pact would help sharpen Nokia’s response to the iPhone, the main focus was on the broader range of rivals, such as Samsung, HTC and Motorola, which use Google’s Android operating system.“We’ve been very clear that our number one competitive consideration is Android,” he told the Financial Times.Android phones are projected to increase from 23 per cent of the smartphone market last year to 39 per cent this year and nearly half in 2012, according to Gartner, the research company.Nokia’s share, in contrast, is forecast to dip below 20 per cent this year as it makes the risky transition from its own much-criticised Symbian operating system to Microsoft’s Windows Phone. Nokia and Microsoft hope that, by teaming up, they will be able to compete more effectively with Android and Apple than they have so far done separately.When the deal was announced in February, some critics argued that Microsoft stood to gain most by winning access to a big new distribution channel for Windows Phone, with Nokia paying royalties for the software.However, Mr Elop insisted the deal also included attractive financial rewards for Nokia, with Microsoft due to make payments worth “billions of dollars” to its new partner for adopting Windows Phone.“We are making a commitment to do our best work for the Windows Phone ecosystem whereas other [handset makers] are doing their best work for Android,” Mr Elop said. “The very fact we are making that decision is very valuable [to Microsoft].”In addition to expected revenues from the deal, Nokia has set a target to save €1bn ($1.4bn) a year from 2013 by reducing its own software development costs. Talks are due to start with unions next week on the planned restructuring, with labour leaders predicting thousands of jobs could go.Mr Elop highlighted intellectual property rights as a key asset in Nokia’s turnround efforts and vowed to use the group’s extensive patent portfolio more “strategically”. He refused to comment on whether Nokia might be drawn into a dispute with Google similar to its legal battle with Apple over alleged patent violations. But he noted that Microsoft had already filed a lawsuit related to software used by Motorola in its Android phones.Analysts say Nokia and Microsoft could seek to raise costs for Android manufacturers by extracting licence fees for their patented technology.Nokia lifted the spirits of its long-suffering investors on Thursday with a smaller-than-expected drop in first-quarter profits. However, any optimism was tempered by a warning of further weakening in profit margins in coming quarters because of the tough competitive environment and supply chain disruptions from the Japanese earthquake.Mr Elop said Nokia had sought alternative component supplies in countries such as Taiwan, China and South Korea but insisted the company would not abandon Japan.
262;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-19T20:20:13Z;Q&A: What do CEO’s think about IT?;Gartner survey of chief executives reveals some surprises;Chief executives typically delegate day-to-day decision-making about IT to their chief information officers (CIOs). However, a recent survey of more than 200 CEOs by Gartner, the technology research and advisory firm, shows the way they think about technology governs the broad brush strokes of its use in business.I asked Mark Raskino, a Gartner vice president and Fellow, to share the insights he gleaned from the research.Q. If you look at the most important issues for chief executives today, are there any where technology is relevant?The highest and fastest rising CEO concerns in 2011 include growing revenue from existing customers, managing talent and dealing with regulatory change. Technology has an important role to play in each of these priorities. Advanced customer relationship management (CRM), e-commerce and e-service can help companies drive incremental revenue from existing customers.Social networking and personal productivity technologies have a major role to play in talent attraction and retention. Post-recession government regulatory and taxation changes require rapid compliance, or changes to corporate structures and locations. Standardising business applications, consolidating shared IT services and moving some parts to the cloud will help provide the international flexibility and responsiveness CEOs need.Q. How do CEOs think about the role of IT in their business today?Only seven percent of large company CEOs regard IT as “just a cost of doing business.” We found that more than half now see IT as either key to competitive advantage within their business model, or a tool through which they intend to innovate and adapt their business model. This is more bullish than we expected.Q. What sort of valuation do they place on IT?It’s almost impossible to isolate the value of the technology capability from all the other things that make a company effective, but when we asked CEOs to try, most gave us an answer. They attribute between five and 30 per cent of revenue to the IT capability of the firm, with an average of 21 per cent. It’s just a perception by CEOs of course – but an interesting one.Q. Did the recession change CEO attitudes towards IT?Yes. Chief executives generally protected their level of IT investment compared to the severity of the recession. They didn’t cut back as hard as they did in the minor recession at the start of the 2000s. This time IT budgets took short sharp a hit, but not as severe as marketing and some other budgets.Testing post-recession attitudes, we found that CEOs expect more strategic value from IT in their industries in the 2010s and 2020s than in any prior decade. Growth has returned quickly. In 2011, 46 per cent of CEOs intend to invest more in IT while only 9 per cent intend to cut back on their IT spending.Q. What’s the next big technology area CEOs want to invest in?Three quarters of CEOs know what their next major technology investment will be and many already have it underway. The top picks are enterprise resource planning (ERP), CRM and e-commerce – all solid and very well understood ideas evolved in the 1990s. Despite the hype, newer strategic capabilities such as mobile, social or smart grids don’t get mentioned much by CEOs.At Gartner we think this shows relatively weak undertanding among business leaders of powerful new IT enabled capabilities at this point in the cycle. It is hard to see how large companies in advanced economies will innovate, create step changes in productivity and accelerate out of the recession without some breakthrough thinking.Q. Do investors and regulators care about a company’s IT investment and progress?Well that’s intriguing because CEOs say interest is rising, but CFOs seem to disagree. Perhaps the conversation is growing slowly and is general – not yet requiring specific quantification or documentation. This is an area where there are wide regional variations. Almost three quarters (72 per cent) of North American CEOs see rising external interest in IT capabilities, but only 53 per cent of European CEOs see it.Q. What do CEOs think of the CIOs who manage IT for them?Chief executives still think CIOs as a whole trade too much on their technical credentials and have not developed sufficient business acumen. This is despite a significant trend towards hiring CIOs from within the business rather than from technology backgrounds.
263;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
264;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-19T15:37:22Z;Acer trims shipment forecasts;;Acer is set to be overtaken by rivals Dell and Lenovo in terms of PC shipment volumes after the Taiwanese company cut its forecasts for the second time in less than a month.Acer, whose chief executive resigned last month over disagreements with the board on strategy, said it now expected its shipments in the second quarter of this year to be 10 per cent less than they were in the first quarter. At the end of March, Acer had said it expected shipments to be flat in the second quarter.“Recent company reorganisation, inventory adjustment and the seasonal slowdown of the PC industry in the second quarter are the main factors for Acer’s decline in PC shipments,” it said in a statement.Acer’s shipments in the first quarter are already a fifth less than six months ago, according to IDC. The research house pegs Acer as the world number three PC maker in terms of shipment volume, though it would fall to the number four spot below Lenovo if its shipments decline by 10 per cent while Lenovo’s remain flat.According to Gartner, Acer is now the second-biggest in the world, behind Hewlett-Packard, but would drop to number three, below Dell but still ahead of Lenovo, after a 10 per cent decline in shipments.Acer’s new forecast reflects in part the poor outlook of the PC industry, which faces challenges from competition from tablets, supply-chain disruptions in Japan, and increasing labour and raw material costs. In the first quarter of this year, global PC shipments suffered its first year-on-year decline since mid-2009.The Taiwanese company’s fall, however, is outsized compared to the broader industry partly because it is the most exposed to consumer spending on laptop and netbook computers. Acer made the wrong bet at the end of last year by remaining bullish on consumer demand, with the result of being forced to slash prices in the first quarter to try to clear out its inventory.Acer started shipping its new Iconia tablets in March, but it faces competition from better-established rivals, such as Apple’s iPad. The Taiwanese group aims to produce 5m to 7m Iconia tablets this year.Demand from Europe, Acer’s main market, is however still much lower than expected, according to Jenny Lai, head of Taiwan research at HSBC. This has meant a persistently high inventory level because “all the product they shipped in March just ended up as inventory on the shelves”.JT Wang, Acer’s chairman who has taken over as chief executive, had said Acer would now try to strike a balance maintaining its margins and boosting volume. However, analysts point out that size remains an important factor in the PC industry because economies of scale allow companies like Acer to procure parts more cheaply and reliably than its competitors.Acer on Tuesday appointed Jim Wong, who headed the IT products group, as corporate president.
265;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-19T14:26:06Z;Apple vs Samsung;Apple appears to be afraid of unexpectedly persistent competition from Samsung;Samsung Electronics should not be too alarmed at being hauled before a San Jose district court by Apple. Whatever the outcome of the case– Samsung is accused of violating 10 iPhone and iPad-related patents in its Android-based smartphones and Galaxy Tab – the subtext is obvious. You are an unexpectedly persistent competitor, and we don’t much like it.For both companies, legal tussles are nothing out of the ordinary. Since the beginning of 2008 the tally of US cases in which either side has been a party reads Samsung 259, Apple 260.For Apple, though – which is lead defendant about three times as often as it is lead claimant – this is a gamble.For one thing, it risks disruption to key parts of its supply chain. Samsung is the exclusive supplier of the A5 dual-core processor of the iPad 2, for example. Even if rivals such as Taiwan’s TSMC started qualification processes today, they would not be able to begin supplying chips until the fourth quarter of this year.But more important, for Apple, is to find a way to check the rise of its biggest challenger in tablets, and the dominant user of Android, the rival operating system to its own iOS. On Gartner forecasts, by the end of next year Android will account for almost half of the world’s smartphone market, up from 23 per cent last year, with iOS little changed at 19 per cent. As phones and gadgets become less exclusive, what Apple must fear is Samsung’s proven ability to accelerate penetration into mid-market segments in both developed and emerging economies, across all manner of consumer electronics. The Seoul-based company, after all, is the only technology outfit in the world’s top 10 with a three-year average sales growth (21 per cent) anywhere near Apple’s (40).

266;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-18T16:42:45Z;Private or public cloud: Is either right for you?;;Doing things in private versus in public has been a human dilemma for thousands of years. But in recent times, the problem has been exacerbated by orders of magnitude with the introduction of technologies (like the world wide web) that not only allow invasion of privacy, but also suggest that doing things in public is preferable to private.Now comes cloud computing, a way of consuming computer-enabled services while letting someone else take responsibility for making them work. That model comes with advantages like massive economies of scale, large varieties of services, and more efficient use of resources.But, the question for executives now becomes, is the public cloud model safe enough to rely on, or should we retrench to private cloud computing to gain safety and control? The answer may surprise you.Risk is at the heart of the matter when it comes to decisions over whether to pursue a private or a public cloud strategy. So how do you know if private or public cloud is right for your organization?Firstly, cloud computing is a spectrum of options from fully private (delivered entirely internal to one company or organisation) to fully public (delivered to anyone who has the money or desire to consume the services). In the public model, a service provider owns and runs the technologies to deliver the service, and the consumers (users of the service) can use the service, but have no control over its basic operations.That leads to issues like trusting the provider to do things the right way and figuring out how you can get differentiation from a service that is the same for you as it is for everyone else! However, elimination of onsite resources can bring cost savings as well as efficiencies.In the private model, a company or organisation owns the technologies and defines which consumers can use the service. This leads to greater control but not always greater security, and maybe not lower costs because the technologies still need to be operated and maintained internally. Certainly, they can be customised, managed, and monitored by trusted employees, and this leads to greater confidence in what happens to the data and applications delivered.But let’s look at these assumptions for a moment. Is a private cloud more secure than the public cloud? Not necessarily. Many public providers spend large amounts of money to refine their ability to secure and protect their services. They are quite often better at it than the average enterprise or organisation. In addition, while they are more open to attack, they are also more able to focus a lot of energy on detecting and fighting those attacks.Where the real problems lie is in their ability to recover from attacks or failures, their ability to guarantee to all customers the same level of recovery or manageability that each might want.But lest we get carried away with the capabilities of large cloud providers, remember that the epitome of a private cloud service occurs when access is limited to within an organisation, and the service resources are owned and controlled by the same organisation. But there are hybrid models between internal private and public cloud computing models which also carry larger degrees of value.The external private and community private models (a separate company owns and runs the services for one or more specific companies or organisations) gives greater economies of scale than internal private and also removes the resources from the data centres of the participating companies. Not only that, but you also still retain a higher level of manageability and differentiation over generic public cloud services.So how do you go about deciding what’s right for your organisation?For many executives, concerns with public cloud computing remain high (especially with respect to security and privacy), and interest in private cloud computing is skyrocketing. Many Gartner clients have asked about using private cloud computing as a way to avoid the challenges of public cloud computing.Be careful! Find ways to experiment with public cloud computing offerings early, and find out where they fit your needs, and where they don’t. You should look to implement private cloud computing when public cloud services do not meet your requirements for service levels, security, compliance, etc. — just don’t fall back on private cloud services because of a lack of information or vague fears about security. Also, don’t let “that’s the way we always did it” become just a way of protecting the jobs of on premises staff.Vendors try to sell technologies that promise to deliver private cloud computing. However, private cloud computing requires more than just technologies, and enterprises should start soon with process, cultural and business relationship changes that will help prepare them for the evolution that private and public cloud computing will require.The biggest advantages of private cloud computing come from efficiency, agility, and a changed financial model for supporting more flexible budgeting and use of operating expenses as opposed to capital expenses.Security, reliability and manageability need to be key elements in the planning and selection processes. But there is no “one size fits all” answer — organisations must map their risk appetite, governance style and business environment to cloud security and management strategies.Is there another option? Yes. The emergence of cloud services brokerages (cloud intermediaries - to be examined in a future article) can actually help to bring many of the advantages of private cloud computing to the public cloud.Eventually, most enterprises will end up using a hybrid model – a mix of traditional IT and cloud-computing services. In this way, all the risks of a public cloud model can be overcome if they are addressed as part of the evolution toward the adoption of cloud-based services.Most enterprises will use private cloud computing before public cloud computing. Private cloud computing is a steppingstone to public cloud computing and it should be designed to enable future sourcing choices, not as an end strategy.Private or public? It may depend on your appetite for control and risk.Daryl Plummer is managing vice president and research Fellow at Gartner.

267;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-17T16:42:34Z;The ‘boss’ with two brains;;Welcome to Bill’s and Jim’s leadership show. Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe have sat down to reflect on the first 14 months of their joint tenure as SAP’s co-chief executives and, although they are dissimilar, they are proving well-versed in creating an aura of perfect unity.“We have a unique way of making one plus one equal three. That is a real blessing for the partnership,” starts off the American-born, sleek Mr McDermott, who occasionally looks Mr Snabe in the eyes, pats his back and at one point shakes his hand.“We had worked together for eight years …There was a lot of trust and camaraderie and we both have a tremendous history together,” he says.“We have a common ambition to make a difference in the world,” chips in the Danish-born Mr Snabe, the quieter and more reflective of the duo at the head of the world’s largest business software maker.If this show of unanimity at a London meeting seems somewhat too perfect, it is nevertheless this leadership style that has made a real difference at the 39-year-old German software group over the past year.When the management couple took over from Léo Apotheker in February 2010, the company was in bad shape. Customers were baying over high management fees and product delays, employees were bewildered by job losses and perceived management aloofness, and investors had lost faith because of a slowdown in business momentum.The US-Danish team came in with a promise to turn SAP into a “happy company”, and their new style and strategy might have been exactly the type of adrenalin kick the embattled group needed. Company insiders say the mood at the software behemoth has improved. Its business is emerging solidly from the downturn, while last June’s takeover of US mobile software specialist Sybase has broadened its product strategy.Mr McDermott says the two men spent the first two weeks after taking over “working day and night” on a strategy that would create growth and re-establish trust at the company. But sceptics have remained wary over how two such different people could be able to manage a company better than a single chief executive.The differences between the two are quickly obvious. The 49-year-old Mr McDermott, who is mainly responsible for customer relations, is a charismatic salesman with a tanned, immaculate appearance and who charms and draws in his audience with open- handed gestures. He came to SAP nine years ago after rising through the ranks at technology companies Xerox, Gartner and Siebel.Mr Snabe, who takes care of product development, is an intellectually minded and introspective mathematician with a sporty and friendly appearance, who looks younger than his 45 years. The SAP stalwart speaks five languages and is a true technology fan who once stuck an Apple logo on to his standard office computer.A company insider who knows both managers well puts it more bluntly: “McDermott is a brilliant salesperson but he neither understands the Europeans very well nor the company’s technology in depth. Mr Snabe is an intellectual who is not as well received in the US but who knows the company inside out.”In spite of their constant show of affectionate respect, they are equally eager to point out the benefits of having such different strengths and weaknesses.“We both go in the room with each other open-minded to a new way or approach,” Mr McDermott says. “Very often we come out of the room with a third dimension that neither of us thought about before.”“If we always agreed, then there would not be much synergy,” Mr Snabe says, looking at his constantly nodding fellow chief executive. “We are both unpolitical in our approach, we are very much fact-driven and we want to challenge assumptions. We very often come out with the same gut feeling and conclusion.”And he points out another benefit: “Once we have made the decision, we have four hands to make sure that it will be implemented, so it will be executed faster.”Indeed, when Hasso Plattner, the group’s billionaire co-founder and chairman, brought them in to replace Mr Apotheker, he had referred to SAP’s tradition of a co-chief executive structure and its use at other companies such as Microsoft. “Microsoft had its best times when Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates were working together,” the 67-year-old said at the time.Yet there are many who say that Mr Plattner, who has a triple role as chairman, shareholder and technological adviser, is still the one who really pulls the strategic strings.Thomas Otter, research director at Gartner, the research firm, says: “Bill McDermott and Jim Snabe are managing the SAP field and development organisations but the technology vision lies with Vishal Sikka [chief technology officer] but also partly with Hasso Plattner. While this multi-headed model seems to be working fine at the moment, it is complicated.”The management duo concedes Mr Plattner’s role as visionary. “We recognise that we are standing on the shoulders of a giant …and we truly respect and trust his genius,” Mr Snabe says. But he adds firmly: “He is not the guy who defines the strategy of the company.”Mr Snabe and Mr McDermott remain keen to display their friendship and trust in almost every answer and gesture. “I feel as though I always know where Bill is going,” Mr Snabe even says, adding that he is a “great friend and partner”. Mr McDermott talks of the duo “sharing bread” and regularly meeting at the dinner table with their families and occasionally also with Mr Plattner.But Mr Snabe looks quietly amused and vaguely appalled when he realises that he and Mr McDermott have in­advertently chosen matching navy suits and similarly patterned ties that match SAP’s brand colour.In fact, in spite of all the bonhomie, the two are rarely in the same place at the same time, reflecting the global nature of an internationally minded and staffed group that is somewhat isolated from the Teutonic “Deutschland AG” network of other blue-chip Dax 30 companies.While Mr Snabe is based at the group’s headquarters in Walldorf in the economically vigorous south of Germany, Mr McDermott has his office and home at the US headquarters in Newton Square, Pennsylvania.They communicate daily by phone and e-mail and use SAP’s own system to share at an instant all crucial data and information between themselves and throughout the company. Meanwhile, day-to-day meetings of managers and executives are increasingly undertaken with highly sophisticated video software that mocks up a virtual board table resembling the “holodeck” of the Star Trek science fiction series.If, as Mr McDermott says at one point, “the real thing we have in common is our differences”, it does not seem to be stopping them also making a difference to the company they make a practised show of jointly leading.
268;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Enough to give Apple the pip?;;I was once a BlackBerry acolyte, permanently locked in prayer mode over the device just like all my peers, thumbing away furiously at the altar of its keyboard. It was the perfect phone for rec­eiving and viewing the e-mails that dominate my working life and for tapping out replies on those unbeatable keys.But then along came Apple and Android devices to tempt me away with their tactile touchscreens and appetising apps and, as their smartphone concepts developed into tablets, I wanted them as well.So, what to make of the BlackBerry PlayBook, Research in Motion’s first tablet, which goes on sale on Tuesday in the US and Canada, and in other markets later this quarter?It cannot hope for the same hype as the iPad these days. While early BlackBerry users worshipped their new devices, there are now non-believers who prefer Android or are entranced by Steve Jobs’ “magical and revolutionary” device.The big question is whether it can stop the drift away to other platforms – or even reverse the flow. RIM’s share of the global smartphone market fell year on year from nearly 20 per cent to 14 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to Gartner, the research firm.First, the bad news for anyone looking to return to what they knew and loved. The PlayBook’s onscreen keyboard is a poor substitute for the real ones of old on BlackBerry smartphones and there is no easy access to corporate e-mail. Oddly, the PlayBook is also missing crucial apps, which means it is less business-like than close rivals such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab. Moreover, given RIM’s credentials when it comes to security, I would have expected it to have more security features than its rivals, but it lacks some basics – there is no “find your PlayBook” feature for tracking down errant devices, like the iPad’s free service.But the good news for those who have stuck with their BlackBerry, and who RIM hopes to retain, is that the PlayBook has the potential to be a great companion device and the best 7in tablet on the market. I say “potential” because large chunks of software and services are still missing, presumably because of RIM’s haste to bring this to market in a madly competitive tablet environment.The PlayBook name holds a clue as to what this tablet is about, suggesting it is more for pleasure than for business – whereas the BlackBerry smartphone was first adopted by business users – and the device builds on solid hardware to back this up.The all-important screen may be on the small side next to the 9.7in iPad 2 or 10.1in Motorola Xoom – the first device with an Android tablet operating system – but I could see nearly the same amount of information and at a high level of detail. The PlayBook has 1024 x 600 pixels at a density of 169 pixels per inch – the same as the Galaxy Tab – compared with the iPad 2’s 1024 x 768 at 132 pixels per inch.The high-definition video demo that came with the device showed me the sharpness and rich colours that were possible and it played without any noticeable stutter with the help of its dual-core processor. It is full HD capable, thanks to its 1080p format. I also played a Need For Speed racing game included with the PlayBook and there was no lag in performance – except in mine when I crashed into oncoming cars. Tetris is also included.There is a gyroscope and accelerometer inside for sophisticated motion-controlled gaming and a GPS chip and magnetometer (digital compass), al­though another mystifying omission – so far – is the turn-by-turn navigation directions software that these would be used for and are present on Android tablets.Stereo speakers are on either side of the screen for maximum sound effect, while stereo microphones are in the top edge, where there is a very fiddly on-off button, a headphone jack and play/pause/volume controls. The 3Mp and 5Mp front and rear cameras are higher resolution than the Galaxy Tab’s and take a decent widescreen picture. They perform poor­ly in low-light conditions (the Xoom’s camera is the best in this area) but they can record video in full HD quality.The PlayBook is a little larger and heavier than the Galaxy Tab, but still weighs less than 1lb, and feels very light compared with the iPad 2. It should slide easily into a large jacket pocket or a handbag. In fact, it is small and light enough to make the absence so far of a “find your PlayBook” service annoying.I was puzzled at first by the thick frame around the screen, only to discover it is an integral part of the touchscreen and intuitive interface. Swiping up from the bottom of the frame reduces the app being viewed to a smaller window that becomes part of a carousel of windows of other apps that are open. A similar swiping action closes and flings the app off the screen – this is all very similar to the interface on HP’s Palm phones and its own forthcoming tablet.There are third-party music and book stores from 7 Digital and Kobo, but a film and TV show store is missing. There is also a paucity of business apps – I counted a calculator, note recording, teleprompter and Word, Excel and PowerPoint equivalents. But there were no contacts, calendar, messaging or video-calling apps, and e-mail could only be accessed through webmail services in the built-in browser.Help is at hand if you are already a BlackBerry user running version 5.0 or later of its operating system. A Bluetooth connection to the phone reproduces its BlackBerry Messenger, Calendar, Contacts, Tasks and Memos on the larger tablet screen. If the connection is broken, they disappear, with any work you have done with them saved to the phone (one welcome security feature for IT departments), which can also lend its internet connection to the PlayBook.I was disappointed by the dearth of apps that could be downloaded from the App World store ahead of the launch, although RIM says more than 3,000 have been submitted by developers. It says its software will also be able to run regular BlackBerry and Android apps this summer. However, these will have been designed for smaller smartphone screens.This seriously limits the PlayBook’s appeal next to the iPad 2, for example, with its 65,000-plus apps.Corporate IT departments may recommend the PlayBook to executives as a secure accompaniment to their BlackBerry smartphones but the executives may soon tire of the limited choice of things to do on it.For the rest of us, RIM needs to work hard with operators to offer attractive bundles of phones with PlayBooks. Otherwise, in spite of an attractive design and powerful hardware, the PlayBook is hard to recommend as a standalone device.chris.nuttall@ft.com
269;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-14T01:48:55Z;Demand for tablets hits PC shipments;;Worldwide shipments of personal computers declined in the first quarter of 2011, contrary to expectations of modest growth, due to competition from tablets, disruptions in Japan, and increased fuel and commodity prices.This is the first contraction in the market since the second quarter of 2009. Analysts expect the market to face difficulty through the second quarter, but to improve in the second half of the year.While the growth of tablet computers is largely to blame for the slowing demand for desktop and portable computers, analysts say the PC industry has not done its part to keep pace with the competition by developing new products.“We’re seeing economic indicators go up, but we see consumers spending money on other items that were neglected during the recession, like cars and other electronics,” said Jay Chou, a senior analyst with research firm International Data Corporation. “People just aren’t as enamoured with things like net books as they used to be.”IDC said worldwide shipments declined 3.2 per cent in the first quarter, from 83.2m down to 80.5m, rather than the anticipated 1.5 per cent growth.Gartner, the research firm, calculated a 1.1 per cent shipment decline in the first quarter, from 85.1m to 84.2m, compared with a forecast of 3 per cent growth.Tablet sales, by contrast, are growing strong.By region, PC shipments were down in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the US and Japan. Shipments grew in Latin America and Asia, not including Japan.“Those of us who are in developed countries are reassessing our priorities, taking a break. There aren’t a lot of things to justify us buying a new PC,” Mr Chou said.“In the emerging market, like Brazil and China, things are still pretty promising because people are still looking for their first PC, rather than their third.”
270;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Nokia prepares for drop in market share;;Nokia’s board expects the mobile phone company to suffer more losses in smartphone market share before it enjoys gains from its radical change in ­strategy, said Jorma Ollila, chairman.Stephen Elop, Nokia’s chief executive, announced in February that the Finnish company would link up with Microsoft to build a new series of phones based on the US software company’s Windows operating system. Nokia’s Symbian system will eventually be phased out, but the group still aims to sell 150m Symbian phones over the next two years.Nokia is expected on Tuesday to announce two new Symbian devices and updates and improvements to the Symbian software.Mr Ollila said the board had “discussed explicitly that there would be an expected lower market share in the meantime with the opportunity then to pick up and build on the new concept”. He added that management incentives, linked to the achievement of public and private commercial milestones, meant Nokia was “very much geared to win”.In interviews with the Financial Times, Mr Ollila, Mr Elop and the Nokia leadership team identified the transition from Symbian to Windows Phone as one of the most challenging parts of the new strategy. Jo Harlow, who runs Nokia’s smart devices division, told the FT: “The easier task is to start Windows Phone from a fresh perspective, but the more difficult task is to continue to operate Symbian.”In 2007, Nokia’s Symbian operating system commanded 64 per cent of the smartphone market, according to Gartner, the research firm. But competitors, led by Apple, cut Symbian’s share to 38 per cent last year and Gartner estimates it will be 19 per cent this year.Although several analysts think Nokia can meet its 150m Symbian smartphone sales target, some warn it will have to continue to cut prices. Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at Bernstein, said falling prices of Symbian smartphones was the main factor in his forecast for a fall to 8 per cent in operating profit margins at the handset unit this year, compared with 10.9 per cent in 2010 – and 20.1 per cent in 2007.Nokia is on course to complete the Microsoft deal by the end of the month. There are few details of how revenue from the alliance will be split, but Mr Elop told the FT that Nokia would “participate in advertising revenue in a way that we’ve never before been able to do”.He said Nokia would also be able to do “unique and differentiated things with Windows Phone” as part of its contribution to a third “ecosystem” alongside Android and Apple. Nokia and Microsoft would use their patent pools to protect the ecosystem and “encourage others who may be taking advantage of our patents to be properly licensed for the use of those patents – at a fee”.Mr Elop said Nokia was also giving “a turbo boost” to its basic mobile phone business in developing markets, by investing in efforts to reach “the next billion” mobile phone users. In a “buy” note issued last month, Goldman Sachs said there was scope for Nokia “to materially recover lost market share” in basic mobile phones, which accounted for 48 per cent of overall device revenues in 2010.
271;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-11T19:21:02Z;The latest technology news for business;;Managing IT costs downLooking to cut IT spending? FrontRange Solutions has unveiled FrontRange Desktop and Server Management 7 with the bold claim that it can reduce IT expenditure by up to 40 percent. DSM7 is the latest entrant in the market for IT service management software, which helps large organisations track and manage their computer systems.In organisations with thousands of users, seemingly mundane tasks such as setting up systems for new employees or upgrading software, can consume a disproportionate amount of an IT department’s time. IT service management solutions aim to automate these tasks and provide a clearer picture of who has what, so saving time and hopefully money.FrontRange argues that its software is particularly valuable when it comes to updating PCs to Microsoft’s Windows 7 and reminds businesses that Microsoft will end support for Windows XP in 2014. One of the selling points for FrontRange’s DSM7 is that has been designed for today’s “heterogeneous” computing environments, in which traditional Windows-based desktop PCs increasingly coexist with Macintosh computers, laptops, Linux servers and virtualised desktops.Support for non-Windows devices can be weak in rival IT service management solutions, says research firm Gartner. FrontRange argues that its DSM7 product also reduces compliance headaches by ensuring that the configuration of all computers complies with pre-defined policies. FrontRange Solutions was once best known for the popular Goldmine contacts management software, which it still offers, although in recent years it has moved into IT service management.Browser-based security for financial services inductryFRSGlobal, a specialist in compliance and risk management software for the financial services industry, has new web-based versions of its products. The company reasons that with the growth of mobile working, compliance officers and other executives are more likely to need to access compliance reports when away from their desk.The new Java-based solutions and can run in any browser and provide access to the same dashboards and online analytical processing functions as the firm’s conventional software. At the moment, the web-based versions allow users to view results of risk and regulatory reporting data, making analysis easier and more flexible. During 2011, FRSGlobal plans to add further functionality to its web-enabled technology, including the addition of advanced user workflow management and data workflow management.Novel’s new contender in enterprise social networking marketNovell has publicly released Vibe Cloud, the latest entrant in the crowded market for enterprise social networking platforms. Like similar offerings, Vibe Cloud lets employees exchange messages in real time, create blogs, share files and work together on documents.Vibe Cloud already exists as a basic free service and this new Enterprise version comes with more storage, bolstered security and a central management console that IT departments can use to set up and enforce usage and security policies.Novell pioneered enterprise networking and the company clearly hopes that this reputation will win it customers in the brave new world of enterprise social networking. However, the company is currently being acquired by Attachmate which inevitably creates some uncertainly over the long-term future of Novell’s various product lines. The enterprise version of Vibe Cloud costs $84 a year for each user.Cloud-based software aims to improve employee wellbeingVielife has launched a cloud-based lifestyle management initiative to help UK businesses improve employee wellbeing. The six-week interactive programmes, called Vielife Online, are arranged as a series of online questionnaires covering areas such as stress, sleep, nutrition and physical activity.Employees are encouraged to complete the questionnaires with their personal data to get personalised recommendations on how they could improve their wellbeing. By promoting healthier lifestyles, Vielife argues the software can improve productivity and reduce absenteeism due to poor health.Mike Beason, managing director of Vielife, says. “There’s a growing awareness among employers and the government that good health makes good business sense.” In one pilot programme that Vielife ran for Prudential, a leading UK insurer, absenteeism levels among 500 workers reduced by 6 percent and turnover dropped from 16 percent to 13 percent. For their part, the employees reported improvements in overall health, stress management, sleep quality and nutritional balance.
272;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-11T14:22:23Z;iPad set to dominate tablet market into 2015;;The iPad is expected to dominate the tablet market for at least the next four years as consumers continue to be attracted by Apple’s design and range of applications, according to Gartner.The research firm predicted that Apple, which last month launched its second generation of the iPad, would control about 69 per cent of the tablet market by the end of this year, falling to about 47 per cent by 2015.Google’s Android platform, which is used by a range of device makers, is expected to hold on to its second place slot, steadily increasing market share from about 20 per cent in 2011 to about 39 per cent in 2015.Apple’s launch of the iPad a year ago reinvented the tablet, a category of devices that had previously failed to find favour with consumers in earlier incarnations. Since then the iPad has spawned a wave of copycat tablet devices by companies such as Samsung and HTC eager to cash in on the boom in demand for tablets.Carolina Milanesi, research vice-president at Gartner, said manufacturers were making “the same mistake” as they did when Apple first entered the smartphone market with the iPhone by putting priority on hardware upgrades. She said that tablet makers had failed to grasp that to go head-to-head with Apple they needed to focus on developing good software applications and a better overall user experience.She said that device makers needed to do more than just make “oversized smartphones” to compete in the tablet market.Google’s Android platform is used by a range of tablet makers. However, Gartner said that Google’s decision not to open up its new Honeycomb operating system for tablets would stem rapid price decline and limit how much of the tablet market Google takes.Gartner predicted that Canada’s Research in Motion, maker of the soon-to-be-released BlackBerry PlayBook, could secure third place in the tablet market by 2015 as it migrates to its new QNX platform.But Ms Milanesi said that while RIM could hope to pick up market share from corporate customers, it was unlikely to have strong appeal for the broader consumer market. She also said it would “take time and significant effort” for RIM to attract developers and deliver a compelling ecosystem of applications and services around QNX.Absent from the Gartner forecasts was Microsoft, which has yet to bring out a tablet is seen as unlikely to do so until it launches its Windows 8 operating system.
273;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-07T18:44:02Z;HTC overtakes Nokia in market value;;Taiwan’s HTC has overtaken Nokia in terms of market value, highlighting a changing of the guard in the mobile phone industry as a raft of new entrants have challenged the Finnish company’s dominance of the sector.Also, credit rating agency Moody’s on Thursday cut Nokia from A2 to A3, citing its weakening market position and uncertainty over its transition to Microsoft’s Windows Phone software.HTC shares were unchanged on Thursday after rising 5.3 per cent to T$1200 on Wednesday, valuing it at US$33.8bn. Shares in Nokia were up 1 per cent on Wednesday, giving it a market value of US$33.4bn.HTC has now become the world’s third most valuable smartphone maker, and bigger on that measure than either Sony or LG Electronics, according to Thomson Reuters.It is still smaller than Apple and Samsung Electronics, although unlike those two companies, the smartphone is the Taiwanese company’s sole business.HTC is also the only smartphone maker, besides Apple, whose shares have risen this year. Its shares have risen by a third, while Nokia’s have fallen by a fifth over the same period.Nokia remains the world’s biggest producer of mobile devices by volume, with a 28.9 per cent global market share at the end of last year, according to Gartner.HTC’s rapid rise reflects the speed with which touchscreen-based smartphones have become a mass-market product in Europe and the US. While growth is expected to slow this year compared with last, the global smartphone market is still expected to increase 50 per cent, according to IDC.Many mobile phonemakers were caught off guard by this rapid change.Nokia has found its leadership position eroded by Apple’s iPhone and Android-based phonemakers such as HTC. It underwent a high-profile management reshuffle last year, with Stephen Elop, the new chief executive, likening the company’s predicament to a man on a “ burning platform”.HTC was founded in 1997 and for its first 11 years was a little-known contract manufacturer for other brands. It made the world’s first Android-based phone for T-Mobile in 2008 and took advantage of the 18-month-long period when it was the sole producer of such phones to grow quickly in size.CK Cheng, analyst at CLSA, the equity brokerage, says that HTC’s scale means that “in times of tightness in the supply chain, such as now after the Japan earthquake, all the suppliers are going to ensure that Apple and HTC get their orders filled first rather than Motorola or Sony Ericsson”.The rally in HTC’s shares also reflect the fact that it has been quick to fill the nascent market for phones running on much faster, fourth-generation networks. In the US, HTC’s Evo Shift, for Sprint’s network, and its Thunderbolt, for Verizon, are currently the only two 4G smartphones available on the market, although competing devices will soon be launched.“Even if it is just a one- or two-month lead, it is still a significant advantage,” Mr Cheng said.However, some analysts, such as Morgan Stanley’s Jasmine Lu, worry that HTC would face increasing headwinds as competitors catch up, and may see its profit margins fall if low or mid-ranged smartphone models grow in popularity at the expense of premium models.
274;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-07T17:08:15Z;Nokia’s Microsoft tie-up still under scrutiny;;Two months after Nokia leapt from its “burning platform” into an alliance with Microsoft, debate is still raging over whether the move was suicidal or savvy.Reports from investment banks and credit rating agencies have delivered conflicting judgments on Nokia’s decision to embed Microsoft software in its high-end phones in an attempt to stem the decline in its market share.Moody’s became the latest to weigh in on Thursday when it downgraded Nokia’s credit rating by one notch after a similar move by Standard & Poor’s last week.Wolfgang Draack, Moody’s analyst, said the Windows tie-up gave Nokia a good chance of recovering some lost ground while sharing execution risk with Microsoft. But he warned that Nokia was unlikely to regain its previous level of dominance and said the outlook was fraught with risk and uncertainty.In a leaked memo before the Microsoft deal, Stephen Elop, Nokia chief executive, compared the Finnish company with a man stood on a blazing oil rig, faced with a choice between certain death and a risky leap into the unknown.The grim assessment laid the ground for his decision to gradually phase out Nokia’s much-maligned Symbian operating system in favour of Microsoft’s Windows Phone in an attempt to regain ground lost to the Apple iPhone and devices using Google’s Android platform.Investors are hoping for more details of the alliance when Nokia announces first-quarter results this month. Much of the focus is on how quickly the companies can produce their first joint device and how much Nokia can save in costs by outsourcing software development to its US counterpart.Initial market reaction was strongly negative, amid claims that Microsoft got the better side of the deal and fears that, by largely abandoning its own software ambitions, Nokia was condemning itself to a low-margin future as a commoditised hardware producer akin to Dell and Hewlett-Packard.Much of the subsequent commentary has continued in this negative vein, with several investment banks, including UBS and Nomura, lowering their share price target for Nokia.Analysts at UBS said the outlook remained “extremely difficult” and warned of a difficult balancing act between speed and quality as Nokia rushes to develop its first Windows handset by the end of the year.“Our fear is that in prioritising time to market, Nokia sacrifices quality in its new [Windows Phone] product, turning potential customers off,” the UBS report said.With Nokia’s stock close to 13-year lows and 80 per cent down from when the iPhone was launched in 2007, some analysts say the doom and gloom has been overdone.Goldman Sachs has lifted its recommendation on the stock to “buy”, arguing that Nokia’s “back to basics” strategy could spark a turnround.“[Mr Elop’s] decision to take Nokia back to its hardware orientated roots as the industry rapidly commoditises is appropriate, and creates the potential for €1bn ($1.4bn) or more in cost reduction,” said the Goldman report.The scale of challenge facing Mr Elop was underlined on Thursday when Gartner, the technology research company, forecast that Nokia’s Symbian devices would fall from a market-leading 37.6 per cent share last year to 19.2 per cent in 2011, while Android would surge from 22.7 per cent to 38.5 per cent.Next year, Symbian is projected to fall into fifth place behind Apple’s iOS, Research in Motion’s BlackBerry and Windows Phone, as Nokia shifts to the Microsoft new platform.Analysts say the big question is whether Nokia can start selling Windows Phone devices quickly enough to offset decline in Symbian.Gartner projects that, with Nokia’s backing, the Microsoft platform will become the second-biggest smartphone platform after Android by 2015.“Some people think that is crazy,” says Carolina Milanesi, Gartner analyst. “But even on the downside if you look at how many phones Nokia sells and know that they will bet the majority of their portfolio on success in this market, you have to assume that Nokia will not be happy with just third or fourth.”Additional reporting by Mary Watkins in London
275;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-07T17:07:31Z;HTC: taking a nibble out of Apple;The smartphone company that outsmarts its competitors;"Remember Creative Technology? The Singaporean purveyor of digital music devices was considered a leader in the field until it was puréed by Apple. The company, now worth one-twelfth of its peak market capitalisation of S$2.3bn six years ago, has printed losses or 16 of the 24 quarters since then.Its mistakes seem to have been noted by HTC of Taiwan, which is taking on Apple – and others – in smartphones. Where Creative was scattergun, aiming at a variety of market segments through the MuVo and Zen brands, HTC has homed in on the high end. Creative went big on features; HTC prioritised looks over function. It produced design-heavy handsets such as Incredible, Desire and Evolution. For an intrinsically covetable product, this was the right way to go. Most significantly, HTC hooked up early with a credible technology partner: Google’s Android operating system, which is on course to take almost two-fifths of the global smartphone market this year, according to Gartner. Only Samsung can rival HTC’s unit sales growth since 2007, in terms of global handset share (from zero to 8.4 per cent). Analysts expect first-quarter figures on Friday to beat management’s guidance on almost every line.Only 3 of 738 Taiex companies have done better than HTC’s 213 per cent return over the past 12 months. This week its market capitalisation edged ahead of fast-fading Nokia to $33.8bn; as recently as November 2007, the gap between the pair was $150bn in the Finns’ favour. Plenty of challenges lie ahead. Motorola recently launched the first tablet to run the new version of Android, while HTC’s debut tablet has not yet hit the shops. But for now at least, as a case study in how to take a nibble out of Apple, HTC could hardly be bettered.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
276;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-07T12:16:25Z;Android phones to displace Nokia;;Phones operating on Google’s Android platform look set to grab nearly half of the smartphone market by 2012, displacing Nokia and helping to fuel rapid growth in demand for internet enabled phones.New figures from research group Gartner illustrate the decline in fortunes for traditional handset makers such as Nokia, which has seen its market lead in handsets eroded in the past couple of years amid heavy competition in the high-end smartphone market from new entrants such as Google and Apple.Gartner predicts that 468m smartphone units will be sold worldwide in 2011, a 58 per cent increase on last year. The company expects the Android platform’s share of the smartphone market to increase from 23 per cent last year to 39 per cent this year, rising to 49 per cent in 2012.The first phones operating on Google’s open source operating system hit the market in 2008 and it is now used to run phones from about 30 different handset makers.The figures come as it emerged that HTC, the Taiwanese handset maker, has overtaken Nokia by market capitalisation. HTC makes phones that operate on a range of platforms, including Android and Windows.Nokia, which is also losing market share in the lower-end handset market to rivals in Asia, in February announced plans to arrest its decline in smartphones by signing a high-profile deal with Microsoft that will see it switch from Symbian to the Windows operating system. The deal was viewed as a bold gamble for Stephen Elop, the Finnish handset maker’s recently appointed chief executive.Microsoft’s platform was previously not seen as a major contender in the handset market. However, Gartner, expects the tie-up to give Microsoft a fifth of the smartphone market by 2015.“Some people think that is crazy. But even on the downside if you look at how many phones Nokia sells and know that they will bet the majority of their portfolio on success in this market, you have to assume that Nokia will not be happy with just third or fourth,” said Carolina Milanesi, Gartner research vice-president.Apple, whose launch of a 3G enabled iPhone in 2008 helped trigger demand for smartphones, is expected to grab second place this year.Gartner predicts that Apple’s share of the market will dip after 2011, because it is seen as unlikely to relinquish its high margins to gain extra share by producing a dumbed down version of the iPhone.Smartphone devices overall, however, are expected to fall in price, with the average selling price before operator subsidies falling to $300 or below.Gartner also predicts that the smartphone battle is likely to leave Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, with a smaller share of the market.
277;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-06T13:52:23Z;Business leaders drive adoption of iPad;;"Business leaders rather than IT departments, are driving the adoption of the Apple iPad and other tablet PC devices as part of a wave of ‘consumerisation’ sweeping through companies, according to Gartner, the IT research firm.But unlike smartphones, which many chief information officers viewed with suspicion when executives first brought them into the office, company IT departments are embracing tablets much more quickly.“Sales leaders are clamouring to adopt media tablets with their sales teams, as a more engaging way to share sales collateral and promotional materials. And it won’t stop there,” says David Willis, research vice-president at Gartner. “Next will come customer relationship management systems, and order entry and sales configuration applications. For sales managers, media tablets will be a natural platform for business analytics and performance dashboards,” says Mr. Willis.“In other settings, the intimacy of using a media tablet supports more personal interactions. Doctors, nurses and medical technicians find they can sit down with a patient and help that patient understand a diagnosis, walk through a medical procedure and describe a therapy with them. Retail clerks can use tablets to display customised clothing for a customer. Conference attendees can take surveys on their own, with no training required. The opportunities are huge.”Gartner expects media tablet shipments to total about 69m this year, still only a small fraction of the total number of application-capable mobile devices, such as smartphones. Nevertheless the research firm’s analysts argue that already the impact of the device on other forms of computing is great.“The iPad, and the larger wave of media tablets, has captured the imagination of business leaders,” says Mr Willis “Some companies have issued them to business and IT leaders in the spirit of exploration. Others see areas in which they can use media tablets to bring computing into settings that were not practical or were too cumbersome to use traditional approaches.”He added, “CIOs are determined not to make the same mistakes they made with smartphones, which were often written off early as expensive and frivolous toys, or executive status symbols — which then left room for more inventive leaders who saw the competitive advantage that mobile applications would bring,”Companies that have recognised the flood of consumer devices coming into business, and had figured out a way to leverage it rather than fight it, have been more prepared to support media tablets. Those who embraced “managed diversity” and figured out how to manage and secure iPhones, were developing strategies to manage and keep iPads within weeks of its launch.“They are also more willing to see that they don’t need to supply and manage every device that employees use at work: Consumerisation is here to stay, and moving very fast. If you can think of an application for tablets, your competition may well be thinking in the same way — and acting on it. It is time to explore the use of media tablets in business.”Gartner believes that media tablets are neither “better laptops,” nor “better smartphones,” but complement both. Nevertheless media tablets still have enormous potential in the workplace, although who stands to benefit most from the phenomenon remains to be seen.“Fundamentally, the market battle will not hinge on features and specifications; on the fit and finish of a given device; or even on a device at all. The platform that will prevail will have a strong supporting ecosystem of developers producing a wide range of applications. And in this area, Apple is far ahead of any competition,” Mr. Willis said.“Not only does it have a first-mover advantage in the device itself, but it has built a curated application distribution mechanism in the App Store that is notable both for how users hold it in high regard and how detractors see it as a limitation. In the end, Apple’s lead will be very difficult to beat.”"
278;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-04-02T00:33:48Z;Hacking attack at RSA targeted Flash flaw;;The recent successful breach of systems at leading authentication company RSA exploited a previously unknown security flaw in Adobe Systems’ Flash player and remote-control technology associated with Chinese spying efforts, the company has disclosed.RSA revealed the breach two weeks ago, warning banks, government agencies and other customers that use its SecurID tokens with fast-changing passwords to revisit their access policies. Though RSA said then that the hackers should not be able to defeat RSA clients’ authentication systems directly with information they may have gleaned, they said the data could be used as part of a broader electronic assault.The lack of detail on the attack has frustrated customers and fanned speculation, with some in the security industry saying that the damage was limited and others saying that the tens of millions of SecurID tokens in use should be replaced.In a conference call with industry analysts on Friday and subsequent blog posts, RSA shed no more light on what the hackers had obtained. But they did say more on how they had fallen victim to the same sort of attack they are hired to ward off.Company officials said that the hackers e-mailed groups of employees at RSA, which is a unit of storage concern EMC and that the e-mails included a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet as an attachment, labelled “2011 Recruitment Plan”.When opened, the attachment exploited a hole then in most versions of Flash, now fixed by software updates from Adobe, that gave the attackers control of at least one user’s machine. The control technology was a version of what is called Poison Ivy, which was also used in GhostNet, described by analysts as a large Chinese spying operation.The RSA hackers harvested the login credentials of more company users, connected to other RSA employee machines and then raised the level of access that the machines’ users were entitled to, eventually getting into computers with information about how SecurID works. The data were encrypted and transferred out of the company.One irony, according to Gartner security analyst Avivah Litan, is that RSA sells fraud-detection systems to banks that could not only have detected the attack, as RSA eventually did, but stopped it midstream.Such systems look for unusual behaviour by users’ machines, such as attempts to access new parts of the network.In a blog post, RSA executive Uri Rivner said that the rash of major breaches at big western companies showed that the industry as a whole needed to share information and come up with better defences. He said security firms should “define and execute a new defence doctrine based on information sharing, deep analytics and advanced threat management”.
279;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-03-30T11:47:07Z;Tablets to boost IT market despite earthquake;;A surge in demand for tablet devices such as Apple’s iPad is expected to help boost overall IT spending this year and offset any negative impact on the supply chain from this month’s devastating earthquake in Japan.New figures from Gartner, the research firm, predicted that global spending on IT would rise 5.6 per cent to $3,600bn in 2011. The forecast, which was revised up from an initial forecast of a 5.1 per cent increase, includes spending on computing hardware by consumers and companies, as well as enterprise software, IT services and telecom equipment.Richard Gordon, research vice-president at Gartner, said that while the full impact of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan on the supply chain was still playing out, the effect on overall IT spending “doesn’t appear to be catastrophic”.There had been concern that the supply of certain materials such as silicon wafers and plastic packaging for chips would affect consumer electronics manufacturing. Some of those fears appear to be receding as companies get back on line or alternative suppliers are found.Mr Gordon said that large manufacturers such as Apple and Hewlett-Packard “were not screaming about components” at the moment and that initial indications were that there was some slack and flexibility in the supply chain, as existing inventory acted as a buffer. However, he anticipated that there could be some spot shortages in April and May.“We are not out of the woods yet, but at the moment we don’t see the need to change our forecast,” he said.As well as being a major supplier of parts, about 9 per cent of the global IT spend comes from Japan. Mr Gordon said he expected that there would be a slowdown in spending in Japan in the second and third quarter with a pick-up towards the end of the year.He said that the impact of unrest in the Middle East would have only a limited impact on global IT spending. The region only accounts for 2 per cent of spending.For the first time, Gartner included forecast sales of tablets in the same category as PCs and servers. Apple’s launch of the iPad last year triggered a surge in demand for tablet computers, prompting rivals such as South Korea’s Samsung to rush to the market with their own versions.However, there have been growing concerns that the popularity of the tablet, a slimmed down and more portable computer format, as well as internet-enabled smartphones such as Apple’s iPhone would cannibalise sales of personal computers and laptops.This month, Gartner lowered its PC shipment forecast for 2011 by 5 per cent to 387.8m units on the back of weaker demand from China and competition from other mobile devices.Mr Richard Gordon said that without media tablets in computing, forecast for spending in that category would have been down.Spending on tablets is expected to hit $29.4bn this year, compared with $9.6bn last year. By 2015, Gartner predicts that tablets could generate sales of $80bn, equating to a fifth of the overall global computing market.Acer, which is jostling with Dell for the number two slot by sales in the global computing market, last week said that its PC sales for the first quarter would be lower than expected. The Taiwanese company was slower than its competitors to react to the shift in consumer tastes towards tablets.
280;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-03-25T18:30:42Z;Europe and US shift to tablets hits Acer;;Acer said on Friday that its PC sales in the first quarter would fall short of expectations, highlighting the continued shift of consumer preferences in Europe and US from notebooks towards tablet devices.With just a week to go before the end of this quarter, the Taiwan group said its PC revenues were 10 per cent less than in the fourth quarter of last year, during which Acer suffered an 11 per cent year-on-year fall in revenues.“We’ve been hearing about weakness in the US and European markets for some time, but this is confirmation of how weak it is,” Jenny Lai, head of Taiwan research at HSBC, said.“It also shows that tablets’ cannibalisation of the notebook and netbook markets is definitely happening.”Amid concern over the impact of the Japan earthquake on supply chains, Acer’s statement is a reminder that any weakness in global demand represents a far greater danger for most technology groups.Acer’s decline over the past few months has left it struggling to maintain its number two spot against Dell.That shift partly reflects a cyclical change in the PC industry.While the immediate recovery from the financial crisis was driven by consumers buying slimmer notebooks and netbooks with a longer battery life, over the past year it has been corporate IT spending that has driven the PC market.Consumer demand, which weakened as economic uncertainty in the US and Europe persisted, has turned to tablets and smartphones.Gartner, the research consultancy, this month lowered its PC shipment forecast for 2011 by 5 per cent to 387.8m units, citing weak consumer demand in China and competition from other mobile devices.Acer has had only limited success in smartphones and initially adopted a wait-and-see strategy on tablets.It achieved a breakthrough this week when AT&T said it would feature Acer’s first tablet, the Iconia, this summer.Acer said that it expected second-quarter shipments to be flat compared with the first quarter, partly because “Acer started shipping tablet PCs in March, and will launch several new models in Q2 to ramp up the unit shipment”.Acer is probably not alone in having a disappointing first quarter.February revenue numbers from the top contract PC manufacturers in Taiwan, which account for 90 per cent of production, were down roughly a fifth from January.Even Hon Hai, which makes Apple products and desktops for Dell, saw an 18 per cent decline.
281;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-03-22T20:21:51Z;Amazon opens app store for Android devices;;Amazon, the electronic retailer, on Tuesday opened a virtual store dedicated to distributing applications for the Android-based mobile phones and tablets, providing a potentially large boost to the adoption of the operating system.Although sales of smartphones running Google’s Android have overtaken those of Apple’s iPhone in recent months, users complain about the difficulty in finding desired applications, known as apps.Google’s official Android Market is chaotic because it allows any developer to place apps in it. IPhone applications, by contrast, are closely vetted by Apple and are ranked by popularity in multiple categories, making purchases easier.Some hardware makers and wireless carriers, including Verizon, have set out to make their own stores dedicated to Android devices, but none have the extensive customer base and expertise in online sales that Amazon enjoys.Other independent app stores have also appeared, some serving multiple devices.The Amazon store “will definitely help with the fragmentation issue”, said analyst Michael Gartenberg of Gartner.The Amazon Appstore launched on Tuesday with some of the company’s usual features, including customer reviews and recommendations based on past purchases. It also added new functions, such as the ability to test an application through a standard PC web browser.Aaron Rubenson, category leader for the Amazon Appstore, said the company’s retail experience gave it the best marketing and promotional capabilities to direct people to the apps that they would be interested in. With each app tested by Amazon, security and reliability could prove major draws, going a long way towards making Android phones as user-friendly as iPhones.Google declined to comment. It has not sought to profit from the Android Market so far, instead allowing developers to take the bulk of the proceeds with most of the remainder going to the wireless carriers.Amazon will keep 30 per cent of the revenue from paid apps. But it will determine the price, raising or lowering of the cost to consumers in order to drive maximum sales.Amazon will give the developers 20 per cent of the list-price, however, if Amazon decides to offer it for free.
282;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-03-15T20:07:59Z;Microsoft poised to axe Zune player;;Microsoft is to stop making new versions of the Zune player, once the focus of its efforts to counter Apple in digital consumer electronics, as it shifts its focus to a broader software strategy to try to outflank its rival.The failure of the Zune hardware marks an admission, after four versions of the device in five years, that Microsoft never dented the iPod’s dominant market share.But with smartphones, tablets and other devices creating new ways for consumers to access audio recordings, a software-only strategy for Zune could put Microsoft in a position to build a successful digital music business, said Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Forrester.“Most of the music market hasn’t been addressed. There absolutely is opportunity,” he said. The software company’s smartphone alliance with Nokia could open a new market for Zune, given Nokia’s own failure to build a successful digital music brand, he added.Launched in 2006, the Zune device and online store were designed as a direct competitor to Apple’s iPod and iTunes, after an attempt by Microsoft to create an “open” digital music system involving other online music services failed to catch on.The launch of a direct copy, followed by frequent updates designed to improve the product, reflected Microsoft’s traditional “fast follower” strategy for emulating rivals.However, the approach has not worked in consumer markets, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, since Microsoft made the mistake of copying existing products rather than anticipating how those devices will evolve.“Xbox excluded, their consumer efforts have been late,” he said. The failure of Zune hardware could be a warning for Microsoft’s efforts in the tablet market, where it has fallen far behind Apple, he added.Microsoft refused to comment on the fate of the Zune device, but sought to shift the focus to its software strategy, which involves linking Zune to other platforms, notably smartphones and games consoles.“We are thrilled by the consumer excitement for Zune across many new platforms, including Windows Phone 7 and Xbox 360. Our long-term strategy focuses on the strength of the entire Zune ecosystem across Microsoft platforms,” the company said.
283;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-03-15T16:22:30Z;Salesforce automation: Cultural change can be hardest to implement;;Most companies deploy salesforce automation (SFA) tools to achieve one or more of three goals: better tracking of sales leads, improved management of existing accounts, and deeper insight into the sales pipeline.Most mature SFA software, whether installed in-house or – in an increasing number of cases – accessed via the cloud from a third-party software-as-a-service (SaaS) supplier, can deliver all threeIn fact, today’s SFA packages are “commodity items” in terms of features and functions, according to Robert Desisto, an analyst with Gartner, the IT market research company.What should not be underestimated, however, is the amount of “tweaking”, or customisation, that may be needed to make SFA tools reflect an individual company’s size, sales processes and its customer base.Peter Bull, a sales and marketing expert at PA Consulting, which specialises in management and IT, points out that a corporate law firm may sell to a low volume of high-value customers, while a mobile operator selling to consumers will deal with a high volume of low-value customers.Both companies could use the same package, but the way it is configured will need to reflect these differences.“Until you start using a package, you never quite know how it’s going to fit your business. And as your business changes, you’ll probably need to make ongoing changes to the package too,” says Bernard Kent, head of sales and marketing at Premiere Kitchens, a £16m ($26m) company where a small sales team of five uses Sage’s Saleslogix SFA package to sell fitted kitchens to the social housing market.Premiere Kitchen’s client base generally consists of local authorities and housing trusts, government-funded bodies that have strictly defined procurement processes and expect suppliers to jump through a certain number of hoops in order to win their business.Sales cycles vary in length from client to client, says Mr Kent, and in most cases, involve negotiating with multiple decision-makers at an individual agency, culminating in a group decision over whether to buy or not.For these reasons, Premiere Kitchens has done much additional work to its Saleslogix package since implementing it five or six years ago, with the help of systems integration company Pinnacle Computer Solutions.For example, the package has been configured to reflect the five stages in the sales cycle: prospect, qualification, analysis, negotiation and close.“Generally speaking, a complete sales cycle should be about 126 days, but this varies. At the start of a sales cycle, each opportunity is linked to one of a predefined set of processes, which outlines the time frames expected for each stage,” Mr Kent explains.“When each time frame has elapsed, the system alerts us. For example, the time between identifying a prospect and qualifying it is usually 28 days. The system of alerts is what keeps us moving forward with each deal.”Premiere Kitchens has made other customisations to the package. A bespoke sales forecasting module enables management better to understand likely sales patterns for a given period.Because the company surveys every property before building a kitchen for it, a surveying module has been developed that integrates with the SFA applications.And because sales executives need to know approximate delivery times when negotiating a deal, a logistics module has been built, too.In recent years, many companies have opted for SaaS-based SFA tools, with Salesforce.com leading the field.While the SaaS option does little to reduce the need for tailoring, it does at least offer organisations the opportunity to experiment, according to Ian Cohen, chief information officer at Jardine Lloyd Thompson, an insurance broker and pensions administrator and Salesforce.com customer.“What SaaS gives you is the opportunity to try [SFA] quickly, learn quickly and see what works and what doesn’t,” he says.Because a hosted package means there is no hardware to install and no upfront capital expenditure, he continues, “your SFA isn’t set in stone from its roll-out date, resulting in a system that no one is using 24 months down the line.”Mr Cohen’s remarks pinpoint one of the biggest challenges of SFA and one that has generally proved far harder to handle than customisation: the necessity for cultural and process change.This, says Mr Desisto, is where many implementations fall down. “The one thing that companies don’t do in nine out of 10 cases is figure out how the implementation will benefit the individual sales rep. Implementations focus too much on managing sales reps and not enough on helping them,” he says.So what do sales people want from an SFA system? Mr Desisto says they want robust leads, preferably ones that are qualified, prioritised and enriched with information that goes above and beyond simple contact details.They want advice on which products to sell to a particular customer and the key sales messages, or “silver bullets”, that they should use in their pitch.They want quick approvals from their company, so that when a customer requests a special discount or asks a technical question, they can get back to them quickly. And above all, they want access to the system wherever and whenever they need it and applications that are easy to use.Without these features, says Mr Desisto, SFA will never catch on with the people who should benefit the most from its deployment: the salesforce.
284;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-03-11T07:40:18Z;PC makers suffer dismal February;;"If there was still any doubt that events have taken a definite turn for the worse for PC makers since the end of last year, February revenue numbers from the world’s biggest contract manufacturers should put them to rest.Hon Hai, maker of Apple products (and also desktops for Dell), saw revenues fall by 18 per cent month-on-month. Taiwan’s Compal and Quanta, the top two contract notebook makers, saw revenues decline by 18 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, compared to January. All came in well below analysts’ expectations.

This roughly 20 per cent decline applied pretty much across the board for PC contract manufacturers and represented the worst February over the past six years, according to Ticonderoga Securities analyst Brian White.There are a number of reasons for this. February is Chinese New Year so there has traditionally been a sales drop-off from Janurary to February as the vast majority of notebook ODM companies are Taiwanese with factories in China.Another temporary distortion was caused by problems with Intel’s Sandy Bridge chipset , whose full impact we are now seeing reverberating through the supply chain. There was also uncertainty in February over what impact iPad 2′s launch on March 2 would have on consumer sentiment for notebook PCs.More broadly, however, what the dismal February number highlights is the continued weakness in consumer demand. That this was happening in US and Europe was already well-known, but even China was not immune.In the fourth quarter of last year, PC sales in China declined nearly 10 per cent compared to the third quarter and grew only 2.8 per cent year over year, according to Gartner. This month the research consultancy cut its forecast for China PC sales growth this year from 18.7 per cent to 11.6 per cent.While corporate purchases were on track, “it was consumers who suddenly started to delay spending,” said Annette Jump, research director at Gartner.Tracy Tsai, principal analyst at Gartner, said uncertainty in the face of Beijing’s efforts to cool the economy made gave many Chinese shoppers pause. “It doesn’t mean that the users don’t have the budget, but they are more conservative in their spending,” she said.The silver lining is that, with orders being pushed back because of Sandy Bridge, sales are likely to rebound in March. Grace Chen, analyst at Morgan Stanley, expects shipments from the top notebook contract manufacturers to grow by 50 per cent in March compared to February.Still, she says: “We expect all [notebook contract manufacturers] to report weak 1Q results due to margin pressure and smaller scale.”"
285;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-03-08T19:52:35Z;Facebook to host film rental experiment;;Facebook’s potential to become a mass online platform for other forms of media is facing an early test, with news of the first full-length film rental from inside its service.Warner Bros, the Hollywood studio behind blockbuster films such as the Harry Potter series and The Lord of the Rings, on Tuesday made The Dark Knight, the latest instalment in its Batman franchise, available for rent on the social networking site.The move is an experiment to see if films can be closely integrated with how people act on Facebook, said Thomas Gewecke, head of digital distribution at Warner. The film will be shown from inside a page on the network, leaving viewers free to continue communicating with their friends, he added.Viewers will have to pay 30 Facebook Credits, or about $3, prompting them to set up an account to use the site’s in-network currency , and will have 48 hours in which to watch the film. Under its standard terms, Facebook keeps 30 per cent of any payments made through its credits system.Industry observers questioned how easy it would be to link watching films to social networking, particularly as the market for online movie rentals is already highly competitive.“It’s experimental – whether people will want to spend two hours with a Facebook app is hard to say,” said Mike McGuire, digital media analyst at Gartner. The idea was likely to be more successful once more Facebook users started to access the service on tablet computers such as the iPad or on television sets, he added.“There has been an explosion of ways to watch movies online,” said Debra Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer. “Facebook will have to make it a compelling experience to make it worth paying more than you’ll probably have to pay to view it elsewhere.”Mr Gewecke said that Warner had “no preconceptions” about how people would choose to watch films while on Facebook, and whether they would view in chunks or at one sitting. The main objective was to create a “seamless experience” with Facebook to keep users on the site.Facebook opened its credit system to outside developers in January, making it possible for media companies and others to create applications linked to the payment mechanism.While studios might find it hard at first to interest Facebook users in full-length films, such an app could eventually become an “incredible tool” to develop ties with audiences, said Mr McGuire at Gartner.
286;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-03-03T22:55:01Z;Russian operators seal 4G network deal;;Four of Russia’s largest mobile telecoms operators have agreed a deal that will see them share the roll-out of a high-speed next generation telecoms network across the country by 2014.VimpelCom, MegaFon, Mobile TeleSystems and state-owned Rostelecom have signed a deal with Russia’s Yota that will see the Russian wireless broadband company become their 4G network provider.Yota, which was set up just three years ago, will handle the roll-out of a high-speed network based on technology known as LTE to 180 cities and 70m people in Russia using its existing spectrum allocation. As part of the deal announced on Thursday the four Russian telecoms operators will be given an option to each take a 20 per cent stake in Yota in 2014 at market prices.Analysts said that by collaborating on the infrastructure, Russia could steal a march on many of its European neighbours in rolling out a national high-speed 4G network.Phillip Redman, a research vice-president at Gartner, said that telecom operators were increasingly seeing the merits of sharing infrastructure as a way of cutting costs and getting networks operational quicker. Sweden has also taken a collaborative approach to its 4G network.However, Gartner predicts that it will be some time before the 4G market reaches maturity. The research firm expects only 3 per cent of mobile devices globally to operate on LTE by 2014.The deal will end industry fears that the rights to build Russia’s 4G network could go to two little-known, newly-established players close to the defence ministry. Yevgeny Dumalkin, vice-president of Altimo, the co-owner of VimpelCom said, Thursday’s agreement would “bring the controversy around this question to an end”.Over the past few years there has been considerable debate over which of two competing standards for 4G telecoms – WiMax or LTE– would become the industry standard. LTE has emerged as the platform of choice for a number of large telecoms operators including Verizon and Japan’s NTT DoCoMo.Yota, which already operates in five cities in Russia including Moscow and St Petersburg as well as in Nicaragua, had initially planned to roll out its 4G services using WiMax in Russia but decided to switch because there were more LTE compliant devices on the market.Yota is 74.9 per cent owned by Telconet Capital Limited Partnership, a privately owned fund. The remaining 25.1 per cent stake is owned by the government’s Russian Technologies State Corporation.
287;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-02-20T20:27:57Z;Developers sceptical of app alliance;;A year ago, a group of the world’s largest phone operators, including Vodafone and China Mobile, announced an initiative at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to create a mobile applications community that would challenge the dominance of Apple’s App Store.The Wholesale Applications Community aimed to make it easier for developers – which currently have to adapt theirs apps and gain approval every time they put their software on a new phone operating system – to build apps regardless of the device.One year on and Peters Suh, chief executive of WAC, announced in Barcelona the commercial launch of a now 68-strong alliance and unveiled new software tools that will allow developers to sell apps that can be sold across devices. Companies including Ericsson, Telefónica and Huawei unveiled new cloud-based stores that will help house apps outside the existing operator-led app stores.But absent from MWC were the developers themselves. In fact developers and analysts remain highly sceptical that WAC is anything more than a talking shop for telecom operators angry that they are not getting a slice of the revenues from a fast-expanding apps community that is dominated by Apple, maker of the iPhone, and Google, whose open source Android operating system is used by 28 handset makers and has its own app store.Gartner, the research group, estimates that 17.7bn apps will be downloaded in 2011, a 117 per cent increase on last year. Revenue from mobile apps is expected to surpass $15.1bn this year, up from $5.2bn in 2010.Yet while many handset operators have their own apps stores, two dominate. Apple’s store, which accompanied the launch of its 3G iPhone in 2008, houses 350,000 apps, while Google says there are 150,000 apps in its Android store.While some argue having a large app store is irrelevant, analysts say it is what helps tie consumers to one handset market over another, particularly if you have paid for the app.Developers, which range in size from large companies to one-man enterprises, make their money from either selling their apps, splitting revenue with an app store, or by taking in app adverts or in-app purchases on games.Adam Leach, principal analyst at Ovum, says coming up with another ecosystem for developers could prove “an uphill struggle” for operators. Apple and Google have established their own app ecosystems and have their own developer programmes. “Collaborations [between telecoms operators] in the past have not been too successful. There is a business intent and common interest but there tends to be a difficulty on agreeing a standard,” says Mr Leach.Developers agree that reconfiguring apps for each new operating system – be it Apple’s iOS platform, Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7, Android or one of the many other platforms – is an unnecessary expense. It requires additional time and labour to rewrite codes that can run into tens of thousands of dollars depending on the complexity of the app. However, developers remain sceptical about WAC’s ability to drive change.“It would be really good if they could make it work,” says Peter Vesterbacka, head of Rovio, the Finnish developer behind the highly successful Angry Birds app. “But I’ve seen many initiatives from operators over the years and none of them have really gone anywhere.”Even with common standards, very complicated apps would still not work easily across platforms, they say. Developers say they have gravitated to Apple and Google’s Android platform because they have a fertile developer community. Involving the telecoms operators will not necessarily improve that experience.
288;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-02-17T19:52:41Z;The trouble with office email;;In an unprecedented move to reduce information overload, Atos Origin, European IT services company, plans to ban employees from using email for internal communications.The ban will affect more than 50,000 employees although it will not take affect until 2014.Thierry Breton, chief executive of Atos Origin, argues the ban is necessary because the volume of email circulating inside his company is now “unsustainable”, causing managers to spend between five and 25 hours a week just reading and writing emails.He told employees earlier this month that the company intends to eradicate emails between employees within three years. Email will still be used for external communications but employees will be expected to use collaboration and social media tools instead of email to communicate with fellow co-workers.“It is clearly going to be a big challenge for us because email is everywhere,” says Marc-Henri Desportes, executive vice-president for global innovation at Atos Origin.Many large organisations, such as chipmaker Intel and Australia’s science agency CSIRO have experimented with “no email” days in a bid to encourage employees to find other ways to communicate.But such initiatives can backfire if employees simply postpone sending and reading their emails until the next day. “’No Email Fridays lead to More Email Mondays,” says Matt Cain, lead email analyst at the Gartner consultancy.For that reason Atos Origin has decided that a complete ban is the only way to stem the rising tide of email which threatens to hit productivity.A recent survey, conducted by legal information firm Lexis-Nexis, found information overload was a widespread and growing problem among white collar workers around the globe. Six out of ten workers said the constant flow of email distracting them from concentrating on the task in hand.While few businesses have yet to follow Atos Origin’s radical example, many organisations are looking at ways to reduce their excessive dependence on email, particularly for routine internal communications.”Email has its place but not as a catch-all communications tool,” says Michael Redding, global managing director for R&D at consultancy Accenture. For example, email was never designed for real-time communications as anyone who has tried to urgently get hold of a colleague by email will know.Better alternatives to email have existed for some time but as they are less widespread, they are a lot less useful — Catch 22.Microsoft developed NetMeeting, a real-time communications suite back in 1996. “But no one used it,” says Mr Redding.Fifteen years later, its successor Office Communication Server is finally beginning to change the way organisations communicate internally.Atos Origin, for example, plans to use the instant messaging and web conferencing capabilities of OCS to carry a lot of the internal communications that were previously carried by email.Just as email has today largely displaced voicemail for leaving messages, Mr Redding argues newer technologies will also sideline email.By 2014, Gartner predicts social networking services will replace e-mail as the principal method of interpersonal communications for 20 per cent of business users.Mr Desportes says this shift is already evident in Atos Origin particularly with workers under 30 — the so-called Generation Y. “These people do not use email any more. They use social media tools,” he says.The growing use of consumer-oriented platforms such as Twitter and Facebook by businesspeople has spawned a new generation of enterprise social software tools such as Yammer, Socialtext and Chatter.Atos Origin is looking at using Spigit, a collaboration tool designed for “innovation management”. Jive Software offers a similar product.Atos Origin argues the widespread use of these tools can reduce the amount of email by between 10 and 20 per cent.Nevertheless, Gartner is unsure whether enterprise social networking tools will significantly reduce email volumes. “All the evidence of reduced email use to date is anecdotal,” says Mr Cain.It is clear that email is not going to disappear overnight, and so there is growing interest in tools that allow users to manage their bulging mailboxes.Conventional email programs and newer cloud-based services such as Gmail let users organise incoming email using folders and filters. But most people cannot be bothered or do not know how to set up the filters, says Sara Radicati, CEO of analyst firm Radicati Group.That has spurred the development of “inbox management solutions” that automate the filtering.For example, ClearContext offers a plug-in for Microsoft Exchange that highlights important email and automatically files unimportant email from automated senders. In similar vein, Google recently added a “priority intray” feature to Gmail that tries to guess which emails are most important.“These solutions may help high-volume mail users but the risk is they simply move the problem to another level. At the end of the day, a lot of the problems with email come down to user education,” says Ms Radicati.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
290;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-02-17T00:08:53Z;Google’s One Pass to take on Apple;;Google has thrown down the gauntlet to Apple with a payment service for digital content that features a more generous revenue share for publishers than Apple’s new system.Eric Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, launched the One Pass service at a conference in Berlin on Wednesday. It will provide a single point of payment for content across websites and mobile applications.The initial partners are all newspaper publishers, but Google said it could also be used for music or video content.Apple and Google’s conflicting approaches on content payment go to the heart of the growing competition between the two companies – on one side Apple’s tightly controlled “closed” ­platform that leans heavily on apps, on the other Google’s “open” philosophy that attempts to straddle mobile devices and the internet.Publishers of print, music and video content are grappling with the ramifications of Apple’s new subscription plan, which requires all content and subscriptions for Apple applications to be made available for purchase through the apps themselves, with Apple receiving 30 per cent of those revenues.“That 30 per cent is going to be an issue,” said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at the Gartner research firm.Some publishers have already begun to do without Apple. Sony had its Reader e-book application rejected because it did not accommodate in-app purchases and has not said if it will submit a version that meets Apple’s demands. Time Inc last week introduced a new Sports Illustrated online package that did not include iPad or iPhone apps, saying it could not agree on terms with Apple.Google will take a 10 per cent cut of subscriptions through One Pass, a more palatable revenue share for publishers. Unlike Apple, Google will give publishers the names and e-mail addresses of their customers, as well as further details if consumers consent.Mr Schmidt called the One Pass service “very publisher-friendly … We basically don’t make any money on this.”[Google’s] new payment service enables publishers to have full control over their content, the price, sales and customer relations at attractive commercial conditions,” said Andreas Wiele, head of Axel Springer’s Bild and magazine divisions.Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp, has blamed Google for difficulties in monetising online content. But several European publishers, including Axel Springer in Germany, DMGT’s Associated Newspapers in the UK and Prisa in Spain, have signed up to use One Pass.But while Google’s Android platform is growing fast and other alternatives exist, Apple’s iPad and iPhone are still the premier mobile devices in the eyes of most publishers. “You don’t want to ignore the Apple customers because they’re pretty good customers,” said Mr Gartenberg. “On the other hand, 30 per cent can be hard to come up with. It’s a numbers game.”
291;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-02-16T21:34:35Z;Media owners wary of Apple’s bite;;Could we live without our iPads and iPhones? The answer may determine whether Apple’s new policy for subscriptions bought over its devices could lay it open to legal or regulatory challenges from content owners concerned that it may be overstepping the mark.Early reactions from news, magazine, music and video companies suggested that some were examining whether Apple was being too aggressive in demanding a 30 per cent cut of subscriptions sold through its App Store and sharing little customer data.“We will be collaborating with our market peers in determining an appropriate legal and business response,” said Rhapsody, a streaming music service which warned a 30 per cent fee might force it off Apple’s store.Many content owners declined to comment, saying they needed clarification of rules they described as uncharacteristically complex. Michael Gartenberg, analyst at Gartner, said: “It doesn’t feel like there’s an antitrust issue here.” Apple’s iPads and iPhones may dominate discussion, but “you would have a hard time claiming from a legal stance that they have a dominant position in anything”.Michael Boni, an antitrust lawyer at Boni & Zack, said: “The first question you have to ask is what is Apple’s market share, and whether that market share is so strong that it would foreclose ­substitutability.”According to eMarketer, Apple’s iPad will control 78 per cent of the worldwide tablet market in 2011, while iPhones will take 30 per cent of the US smartphone market. But both markets are changing fast. The US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission have been unwilling to rush into ruling on such fast-evolving markets in the past, Mr Boni said, adding: “There does seem to be sufficient substitutability to make it difficult for Apple to lock up this market.”Some publishers emphasised that they had other options. The Financial Times, which charges for some online content, expressed concerns over changes “that may compromise our business model”, but added: “It is a market that is developing quickly and new devices are coming to the market at an increasing rate.”Apple’s changes are not expected to affect consumers, unless they result in a narrower range of content on its App Store.Some media owners also voiced support for Apple, with Bonnier’s Popular ­Science title quickly adopting the new subscription model. Smaller publishers that do not already charge for digital access may be happier to pay Apple’s toll, one digital publisher said.Others expressed concerns, however, noting that Apple would soon launch a music subscription service to compete with Rhapsody and Pandora, which operate on slim margins.The International Newsmedia Marketing Association hit out at the new rules. Apple’s policy will be the main topic at a closed-door INMA meeting at Heathrow airport on Thursday.Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in London
292;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-02-15T16:41:18Z;The latest corporate technology news;;HP to buy Vertica SystemsHP is acquiring data warehousing and analytics vendor Vertica Systems in a fresh attempt to raise its profile in the fast-growing business intelligence market. HP recently pulled the plug on a homegrown data warehousing product Neoview which failed to live up to its expectations. The decision to jump straight back in, this time using Vertica’s real-time analytics technology, shows HP has recognised that business intelligence — which marries powerful databases called data warehouses with clever analytics software — is one of the few enterprise software markets that has yet to turn into a two-horse race. Teradata, SAS, Microstrategy, SAP, IBM, Oracle, Microsoft and a clutch of lesser-known specialists such as Vertica all offer data warehouses and/or analytics tools and the market is growing at about 14 per cent a year according to IDC. Analysts say growth is being fuelled by the advent of all-in-one data warehouse “appliances” and new generation of analytics tools aimed at non-expert users. These innovations are bringing BI to a wider audience by making it easier and faster to “mine” the data generated by operational systems for trends or insights that would otherwise be difficult to spot. Research firm 451 Group recently described five-year-old Vertica as the “biggest independent challenger to the data warehousing giants.” Not anymore. Terms of the Vertica acquisition were not disclosed.Linux is no longer just for start-upsStill think Linux is for start-ups? The London Stock Exchange’s new Millennium Exchange trading platform went live on Monday and it runs on Suse Linux Enterprise Server, a high-end version of the open source Linux operating system. The LSE previously used Microsoft technology but switched to Linux because of the previous system’s unacceptable high levels of latency — the speed with which trades are carried out. The LSE is facing increased competition from rival trading platforms that offer lower latencies. According to the LSE, the new Linux-based platform will give customers superior technical performance and “ultra low latency.” The deal is quite a coup for Novell, which supplied its Suse Linux Enterprise Server product modified with a real-time “kernel” to reduce latency times. Linux is not just for stock exchanges, however. A recent survey by Gartner found that more than half of organisations surveyed have adopted open-source software as part of their IT strategy. “Users are beginning to look at open source software differently – if they can customise the code to make it unique to their company, they have created a competitive advantage,” says Laurie Wurster, research director at Gartner.SAP’s Business By Design aimed at subsidiary offices of multinationalsSAP has a new release of Business By Design, its cloud-based business software. This latest release allows enterprises that are already running SAP Business Suite, its flagship on-premises product, in their main business operations to integrate with subsidiaries that are running the cloud-based upstart. The integration focuses on consolidating accounts, particularly at the subsidiary and transaction currency level, as well as tax jurisdictions. Deeper integration for sales and distribution functions is planned for the next version. SAP faces a particular challenge when it comes to cloud computing in that the organisations most likely to use SAP software in the cloud probably already own SAP’s “on-premises” software. The German group does not want to cannibalise this customer base and so it is looking for cloud computing opportunities that complement rather than substitute the need for traditional on-premises software — such as in the subsidiary offices of multinationals.Fujitsu has a solution for managing smartphonesToo many smartphones, not enough time? Fujitsu has the solution with a managed smartphone service aimed at large enterprises. It consists of a package of cloud-based services designed to take the hassles out of managing multiple devices and mobile operating systems. Fujitsu, formerly known as Fujitsu-Siemens, has long offered this type of managed service for desktop PCs and laptops. It argues the time is now ripe to extend it to smartphone and tablet devices, which create particular headaches when it comes to infrastructure management. As well as offering device management and diagnostic capabilities, Fujitsu will take care of all the security aspects, including authentication, backup, virus protection, firewall and spyware software. Pricing starts at about €5 per handset per month.
293;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-02-13T23:57:28Z;Review: Tablets to rival the iPad;;"Since its launch last year, the iPad has been a great success – in 2010 Apple sold 14.8m of the slate-style portable computing devices.But while the iPad currently dominates the tablet market, competition is increasing.Early competitors, such as Samsung’s Galaxy Tab, which runs Google’s Android smartphone operating system, are about to be joined by a raft of rivals.They include: Motorola’s Xoom, the first tablet to run the “Honeycomb” version of Android designed specifically for tablets; Research in Motion’s BlackBerry PlayBook, which runs the QNX operating system; and a tablet codenamed “Topaz” from Hewlett-Packard, running Palm’s Web OS.All come with high-performance dual core processors, have features designed to appeal to corporate buyers as well as consumers, and will be competing for a slice of a market that Gartner, the research company, predicts could total 54.8m units in 2011.IT consultants almost universally recommend that companies that are not already evaluating tablets as a computing platform, should begin to do so quickly.But which tablet should they buy? I have been testing the iPad v1 and the Galaxy Tab and have also had some hands-on time with both the Xoom and the BlackBerry PlayBook.For visual applications, the iPad and the Xoom have clear advantages because of their larger screens (9.7in and 10.1in respectively), but of course there is a trade-off in portability and weight.As for connectivity, all operate over WiFi networks but only two, the Xoom and the PlayBook, provide the option of an internal 4G cellular modem, which could be a big advantage if usage is expected to involve downloading or uploading large files, particularly video.One of the “missing” features of the iPad (likely to be addressed in version two) is the lack of integrated front and back video-capable digital cameras – essential for applications such as mobile videoconferencing and useful for insurance adjusters, engineers and other mobile workers who need to send digital images to HQ.But perhaps most important is the operating system and the developer ecosystem likely to emerge around each device.Here, Apple clearly has a big headstart, but as Android has proved in the smartphone market, such leads can quickly evaporate and both Android Honeycomb and BlackBerry QNX are impressive and likely to attract strong developer backing.I particularly like the PlayBook because of its ultra-solid multi-tasking operating system, dual-core processor and potential for tight integration with existing corporate BlackBerry infrastructures."
294;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-02-13T23:57:28Z;When staff bring their own kit;;"Whether the corporate IT team is ready or not, a growing number of employees now exercise choice when it comes to the tools and services they use to get their jobs done.They are bringing their own mobile phones, tablet computers and laptops to work and using them to send and receive potentially sensitive business data.That may be good news for employers, because this growing “consumerisation” of IT provides a boost to productivity, according to Josh Bernoff and Ted Schadler, analysts at Forrester Research and co-authors of Empowered: Unleash Your Employees, Energize Your Customers and Transform Your Business.In the book, they present a persuasive argument for enabling employees to solve “customer and business problems using readily available technology that they master first at home”.Their thesis is this: if an organisation empowers its workforce to use the tools and services of their own choosing, they’ll get more done. If those tools and services are available to them, regardless of location, they will be productive when travelling, working from home, or meeting customers.But the consumerisation of IT poses tricky problems for the IT department: in a 2010 Cisco survey of IT managers in the US, Germany, Japan, China and India, 41 per cent of respondents confirmed that employees regularly access the corporate network using unsupported devices.Employee demand is running ahead of the IT department’s readiness to change its approach to managing the mobile workforce, says Peter Siggins, a mobile communications expert at PA Consulting, a management consultancy.“The conservative view of many IT departments is one of ‘safety first’, despite the clamour from employees to use their much-loved personal device,” he says.“However, to open the corporate network to all and sundry, users need to recognise that some additional controls will need to be in place when corporate data are accessible through a personal mobile device.”For example, employers and employees will need to agree on policies that mean the employer can remotely wipe a device of all corporate data if it is lost, stolen or the employee leaves the company.There is also business interest in mobile device management (MDM) technologies, says Nick Jones, an analyst with Gartner, the IT research company.MDM enables central IT teams to exert control over mobile devices “in the field”. Their physical location can be tracked; they can be “wiped” if lost or stolen; their voice and data usage can be managed and monitored; and IT teams can provide support and resolve problems remotely.Sybase is a long-established MDM vendor and its platform supports Android, Apple, RIM BlackBerry, HP Palm OS, Windows Mobile 6 phones and Nokia S60 phones. The platform can be deployed on-premise and is also available as a hosted service, says Mike Oliver, the company’s mobility marketing manager for Emea.While products such as this provide a wide range of functions, IT managers are looking for three basic outcomes, Mr Oliver says: “First, to authenticate the user, usually via password enforcement. Second, to protect the data, via encrypted communications. Third, to control the functionality of the phone, so that only authorised devices can synchronise with corporate e-mail, for example.”The trouble for corporate buyers is that the MDM vendor landscape is populated by a very large assortment of vendors. Gartner has identified more than 40 companies and considers the landscape to be both “immature and chaotic”.Bob Tarzey, analyst at Quocirca, the IT research company agrees. “The range of vendors offering [device] management tools is as diverse as the [devices] themselves,” he says.For that reason, he believes device management is a “headache” and businesses will increasingly outsource it.For Neil Campbell, security specialist at Dimension Data, a systems integration company, it is a “question of philosophy”. Company leaders, he says, “need to think through carefully how they feel about mobile devices and mobile working in general, and how they can best balance the business’s appetite for risk with its desire to provide employee satisfaction.”But, as the authors of Empowered point out, it is not a trend that management can afford to ignore.And IT directors seem to be coming around to that view.In a November 2010 survey of attendees at a Gartner Symposium, re­spondents expected one in five mobile devices used for business purposes in 2012 to be owned by employees."
295;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-02-11T22:52:38Z;Mobile technology hype cycle;;Q&A with Carolina Milanesi, research vice president, Gartner.Q: The Gartner Hype Cycle is meant to cut through the hype surrounding emerging technologies in various markets, and understand the potential for those technologies to change the shape or direction of their industry. Based on Gartner’s research, what is the most hyped technology in mobile devices?If we have to pick one technology as the most hyped it would be glasses-free 3D technology. This is actually not on the hype cycle because, up until very recently, there was no such thing. Since the publication of the hype cycle, we have started to hear more and more mentions of vendors gearing up to launch glass-free 3D mobile phones.As expected, Asian vendors such as Samsung and LG are the front-runners. The main focus when it comes to 3D is usually video content. Many are skeptical about the actual benefit to have 3D on a relatively small screen when it comes to video. Although I would tend to agree with that there is much more to 3D than video. Gaming is an obvious one but more interesting use cases are around user interfaces and applications.For user interfaces, 3D offers an extra dimension to exploit the depth of the screen and therefore improve usability without having to increase the size of the screen. It was interesting to see that Honeycomb, the Android OS designed for tablets, used a 3D user interface. Marketing, mobile commerce and navigation could also benefit from 3D. Using an avatar that looks like me to try clothes or accessories such as hats or glasses for instance.The second technology I would pick is near field communication (NFC). NFC offers the convenience of contactless payment and the ability to view account information from the mobile phone. We expect NFC will account for 30 per cent of total transaction volume in 2014 but only 5 per cent of the value, because most transactions will be used for small payments and transport ticketing.We have been waiting for NFC to become a mass-market phenomenon for years but, finally, with both Google and Apple showing interest for this technology we can expect NFC enabled devices to finally hit the market in such a volume to make it a mass market solution.Q: Are there other technologies that you would specifically identify for business leaders as likely to have a significant impact?For the transformation impact that we believe this technology will have on the consumer electronics market, I would say multitouch. Multitouch technology has the potential to transform the way users interact with the electronics they use every day.We have seen multitouch-enabled touchscreens or touchpads to be widely adopted in smartphones, media tablets, notebook PCs and portable consumer electronics devices. Multitouch will change use models and will have a significant impact on product design. This impact can already be seen in handsets with full screen devices lacking hardware keypads and buttons.Multitouch could have a similar impact in the PC market on the traditional keyboard/mouse input devices, especially as media tablets continue to gain traction.
296;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-02-11T09:58:01Z;Nokia jumps to Windows – as it happened;;Nokia is leaping off a burning platform to adopt Windows Phone 7 as its operating system for smartphones.The Finnish handset maker tried to justify its dramatic decision to analysts at a strategy event in London, with chief executive Stephen Elop and Microsoft counterpart Steve Ballmer explaining the reasoning.FT correspondents Mary Watkins and Andrew Ward were also there and their live blog is after the jump.MW = Mary Watkins, AW = Andrew WardAW, 9.54: The initial reaction to the Microsoft news is in and it’s not pretty. Shares down 8.5 per cent. Citigroup is “deeply sceptical” of the turnaround plans and says the investment community is “deeply disappointed”.MW: Shares were down as much as 12 per cent last time I looked. Investors clearly not sure of the merits of the tie-up. But Nokia faces a difficult dilemma. The company has been way to slow to see the threats from China at the low end of the handset market and new entrants like Apple. And then there’s AndroidAW: More from Tim Boddy at Goldman Sachs, who says “investors are unlikely to embrace Nokia’s bold new strategy until it is shown to be working, as Microsoft’s traction in mobile is unproven”.MW: Well that is very true. I went to the Windows 7 launch last year. And I have to say the new phones did look a lot better. But if you look at the figures from Gartner this week you can see the scale of the challenge. Nokia’s global share of the handset market is down from about 36 per cent to 29 per cent.10.01: There’s signs of something happening at the press conference….MW: Going back to the Gartner numbers from this week. They show that handsets operating on Android overtook those smartphones running on Nokia’s Symbian platform in the fourth quarter.AW: Most devastating of the analysts’ reaction so far comes from Pierre Ferragu of Bernstein, who riffs on Elop’s “burning platform” memo to staff this week. “One’s worst enemy when fighting against fire is time. A fire spreads at exponential speed, every minute counts. This partnership could kill Nokia.”MW, 10.02: That backs up research from Canalys last week. This burning platform analogy is going to be used time and time again isn’t it? I rather liked the Lex note we had on the potential tie up.AW: Jury still out on whether it was a good idea to be so blunt in his assessment of Nokia’s problems. I suspect he will be more upbeat today.MW: He will have to be. He does have the benefit for seeing things from inside both companies – having been a leading player at Microsoft. Do you think analysts would have rather he went down the Android route?MW 10.06: Stephen Elop is heading up to the stageAW: Google already delivered its verdict on the Nokia-Microsoft tie-up ahead of time. Vic Gundotra, Google’s VP of engineering, twittered on Tuesday that “two turkeys don’t make an eagle”. If there was any doubt what he was talking about he gave the message a hashtag #Feb11 – the date of Elop’s speech.MW: Elop: “entire smartphone market growing rapidly and we should be setting the pace”. he’s quoting Winston Churchill – genius. He’s an optimist he says. “Our long term strategic alliance will create a global ecosystem that will go beyond on anything else out there”AW: Throwing their lot in with Android might have allowed them to cut their massive R&D budget more — giving a short-term lift to profits — but in the long-run most analysts realised it would be a false economy that condemned Nokia to becoming the Dell of the mobile world.MW, 10.10: Agree. The danger is that all phones start to look the same. And noboby wants that. Telecom operators particularly not keenMW: So Mr Elop’s talking about the ecosystem, and “a faster path to the United States” plus “products that are more competitive”AW: Wonder what Lucy Kellaway — the FT’s resident business jargon-buster — would make of all this ecosystem talk?MW: True. What does it really mean? “Iconic hardware, stellar software” apparently.10.13 STEVE BALLMER (Microsoft chief executive) has just stepped on the stageMW: Balmer is talking about Windows 7 phone. Claims it is the easiest smartphone on the market to useAW: Ecosystems jars with me but hard to think of a better word to describe what he’s getting at — the magical formula of hardware, software and services that Apple and Google have mastered where so much depends on attracting that critical mass of independent developers to create applications.MW: Ah yes. Ballmer is back to the fact that Microsoft has been “delighting” customers with Windows 7. Ms Kellaway would love thisAW: With all the focus on Nokia, easy to overlook that this is a big move by Microsoft too.AW: Microsoft obviously hopes Nokia will give it a leg up in the smartphone operating system market but also, by embedding its Bing search engine in Nokia phones, it could help them challenge Google hegemony in the search market. For all its problems, Nokia is still the big daddy of the mobile industry. Sold nearly two-thirds more phones in Q4 than its nearest rival, Samsung, despite its share decline.MW: Gosh. That didn’t last long. Questions now.AW, 10.20: What happens to Ovi? Good question.MW: That’s the app store that was supposed to challenge Apples’s App Store. But hardly any apps. Apple got a quarter of a million, Android more than 100,000. Nokia is trailing way behindAW: Sounds like Ovi disappears into Microsoft MarketplaceMW: Question on timing of first joint product… answers quite vague from both men (Elop and Ballmer)MW: Interesting. This is not an exclusive partnershipMW: Number one priority is “ecosystem”AW: The one thing Nokia can bring to the App party is maps. Remember it spent $8bn buying Navteq in 2007. Apparently Nokia Maps will be integrated into the Bing search engine.MW: Actually yes. That’s a good point. I feel they could do a lot more with NavteqAW: “we explored the opportunity with the Google ecosytem… commoditisation risk was very high” [Elop]MW: Credit Suiise have a done a lot on the commoditisation issue, and I have to say that when you see some of the Android phones they do all start to look the sameMW: Ah. A question on MeeGo. Is it the ugly unloved step-child? Good question.AW: First MeeGo phone will ship this yearMW: This is the long-awaited next generation operating system. Windows phone remains core platform for the time being but MeeGo still in playAW: But after the first phone, MeeGo then shifts to a “future orientated” platform. Hmmm. Sounds like a polite way to say they’re not expecting too much from MeeGo and all bets are on WindowsMW: There’s a Finland question. Will Nokia stay Finnish?AW, 10.30: “Finland is our home”… “We will always be a Finnish company”MW: He’s got to do it: 145 year history, critical to the economy.AW: That’s to push back against those stories this week claiming Nokia could move its HQ to Silicon ValleyAW: Elop: “significant reductions in employment around the world — including Finland”MW: Bernstein Research did some interesting research on R&D last week. They’ve delved into the figures a bit. Nokia spent $3.9bn (€2.9bn) in R&D in 2010, 3x the average of its peers. “Symbian itself accounts for only one third of the cost, but it isn’t as monolithic as most observers think. We estimate €1.05bn was spent on the operating system itself in 2010, corresponding to ~ 1200 developers inherited from Symbian in 2008, 5,000 developers who were already working on the Symbian UI at the time. This would represent 6,200 employees.” The rest of the R&D budget is split across a number of different divisions including funding Meego and Qt.AW: No firm numbers on job cutsMW: They’ve been talking to the Finnish government. That suggests quite big changesAW: That’s one of the things that disappointed investors this morning. They were hoping that going with another software platform would allow Nokia to slash its huge R&D spend — the biggest in the industry. But there were no cuts spelled out in the press release.MW: Andrew Parker, the FT’s telecoms editor, is asking a question on R&D and guidance, and saving money.AW: He must be telepathic.MW: He’s going to put up a graph on R&D. Admits that some areas have been less efficient. Mr Elop says that he’s been speaking to operatorsAW: “This is now a three horse race” Three horse race. That’s as clear a statement as we’re going to get from Elop that Nokia has given up on Symbian and has little hope for MeeGoMW: I think it needs to be a three horse race. If you are stuck with just two systems, you risk going the way of the PC market. Everything looks the same and that affects marginsAW: Does Nokia have a tablet strategy, asks The Guardian? Answer: “We have multiple options” but no firm strategy as yet.AW: I felt sorry for the guy asking the question from the website “All About Symbian”…MW: He was asking a question on Android and how fast the market is moving. I have to say when you see how many updates Android comes up with every year, you realise how fast the Google team works. It’s really pushing the handset makers to constantly come out with new devicesAW: Yet Nokia has far more people. That’s what Elop described as “unbelievable” in his memo. Which leads us onto a question on Nokia’s suppodesly bureacratic cultureMW 10.43: Classic example of a company that took an early lead and then failed to identify the challengers, and how quickly rivals from inside and outside the core handset market would moveAW: Elop talks about “the fighting spirit of the Finnish people”. Never underestimate that fighting spirit. The Finns twice fought the Soviets to a standstill during the second world war.MW: Press conference is now winding upAW, 10.45: And that’s it. What’s the share price doing? Down 10.11 per cent.MW: So investors are still to be convinced. What did you make of it then Andrew?AW: Well, he was more positive than in the memo…MW: Very true. But it was a bit thin on actual detail. Lots of chat about the ecosystem and the marriage of two industry leaders etcAW: Indeed. More questions than answers — particularly on financial targets, job cuts, R&D spend, and when are they going to get these Microsoft phones into the market?MW: Well there are more presentations going on so perhaps it will start to become clearer by the end of of the dayAW: One thing’s clear, there’s no quick fix to Nokia’s problems. Will the new strategy work before the platform is down to a charred stump? Investors don’t seem optimistic.
297;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-02-11T09:56:06Z;Nokia Investor Day: Elop takes the icy plunge;;"So Stephen Elop has taken the plunge. The chief executive of Nokia has just announced a “broad strategic” tie-up with Microsoft on phones and said it would make Windows its main smartphone operating system.It’s a bold move for the Canadian and investors haven’t greeted the news that well. Shares were down as much 12 per cent in early morning trade.Mr Elop, a former Microsoft man, took over at Nokia last September. He was the surprise choice, not least because he was the first non Finn to lead Nokia. But he has a good track record at a series of tech companies and was highly regarded at Microsoft. Crucially he brings Silicon Valley knowledge to a Finnish company that in the space of a few years has turned from an innovator to a follower in the handset market.Nokia still has the biggest share of the global handset market but its lead has been slipping steadily over the last few years. Gartner said this week Nokia’s share of the global handset market fell from 36 per cent to about 29 per cent in 2010.Mr Elop has clearly been alive to the need to made radical change in the face of stiff competition. This week, an internal memo leaked out in which he liked Nokia’s dilemma to that of a man standing on a blazing rig, torn between being burnt alive or taking the plunge into icy waters.It’s a refreshing change to hear such words from a company that been stuck in a rut for some time but unwilling to admit.A number of things have fundamentally changed for Nokia over the last three years. The number of cheap handsets being churned out in places like southern China has risen dramatically, eroding Nokia’s share of the low-end of the market.At the same time the group failed to keep pace with what was going on at the upper end of the handset market in the so called smartphone sector.Apple entered the market in 2007 with the iPhone and Google launched an open source operating system called Android, which was quickly adopted by a range of handset makers to run their phones.Nokia’s smartphones, meanwhile, operate on the Symbian platform, which analysts viewed as inferior systems to either Android or Apple’s iOS.From nowhere Apple has now entered the ranks of the top five handset makers in the world. And by some estimates Android overtook Nokia’s Symbian as the most popular operating sytem for smartphones in the last quarter of 2010.Teaming up with Microsoft will bring together two leaders. However, the danger is that they bring together the worst of both worlds. Microsoft’s Windows 7 phones still lag Android and Apple’s iOS.On the other hand, had Nokia adopted Android, the handset market could have become highly commoditised.Mr Elop has not abandoned Symbian or its long-awaited MeeGo operating system but made clear the Microsoft collaboration is clearly a core part of his strategy. A strategy he is pursuing with a slightly altered management line-up, which he announced today.Mr Elop clearly realises that handsets are no longer about just hardware or just software. It’s about the whole ecosystem. Have a good app store, sleek phones and a great operating system and you might be closer to challenging in a market that is moving incredibly fast.
Whether a partnership with Microsoft is the answer remains to be seen. Judging by the initial share price reaction, analysts and investors will need some convincing.Follow Andrew Ward and Mary Watkins as they blog on Mr Elop’s strategy speech…"
298;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-02-09T18:59:02Z;RIM and Apple join top five handset makers;;Apple and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, entered the ranks of the world’s top five mobile handset makers by sales last year, underlining how demand for high-end smartphones is fuelling growth in the handset market.Gartner, the US research group, released data on Wednesday showing sales of mobile devices jumped 31.8 per cent to 1.6bn units in 2010.Sales of smartphones, up 72.1 per cent in 2010, remained a key driver in developed markets and helped RIM and Apple to dislodge Sony Ericsson and Motorola from the top five.The move represents a significant achievement for Apple, which only entered the mobile handset market with the launch of the iPhone in 2007. Apple sold 46.6m units in 2010, which was an 87.2 per cent increase from 2009.The US group now holds 2.9 per cent of the overall global handset market, just behind RIM with 3 per cent, LG with 7.1 per cent and Samsung, ranked second, with 17.6 per cent.Nokia, meanwhile, saw its lead cut last year. The company’s market share dropped to 28.9 per cent from 36.4 per cent, underlining how much Stephen Elop, the Finnish group’s recently appointed chief executive, has to do to claw back market share.Nokia, which will outline its strategy to investors on Friday, is facing competition at the bottom end of the market from cheap no-brand devices, notably from China.But the company has also seen its dominance of the smartphone market eroded amid competition from Apple and a plethora of handsets that are now operating on Google’s open-source Android platform.Nokia has steadfastly stuck to using the Symbian operating system in spite of criticism that the platform has failed to keep pace with Android or Apple’s iOS.Gartner said that sales of mobile phones using Google’s Android platform had overtaken Nokia’s Symbian unit sales during the fourth quarter but said that taking into account Symbian’s use in some legacy products being sold by other operators, Symbian remained slightly ahead of Android.For the year, Symbian still had the largest share of the smartphone market but lost ground to Android, which jumped from having just 3.9 per cent of the market in 2009 to 22.7 per cent last year.Carolina Milanesi, research vice-president at Gartner, said that Apple and handset makers running Android were also making headway in the enterprise market, where RIM has traditionally done well.She said it would be interesting to see how RIM’s new tablet device fared, given that consumers were increasingly looking for “an all round experience” and an ecosystem of the type offered by Apple or Google.Ms Milanesi also predicted that overall growth in the mobile handset market would be constrained in 2011 as device makers face the prospect of component shortages amid growing competition for parts from tablet producers.
299;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-01-25T17:50:27Z;Nokia faces challenge of shrinking market share;;Stephen Elop was known to some colleagues as “the general” during his years rising up the ranks of the US software industry.Four months after taking charge of Nokia, his martial nickname seems more appropriate than ever as the 47-year-old Canadian draws up a battle plan to preserve the Finnish group’s status as the dominant mobile phone maker.The next few weeks could go a long way in determining his chances of success.On Thursday, Nokia announces fourth-quarter results that will shed light on whether its latest range of web-enabled smartphones has stemmed decline in its market share.More important still will be the group’s annual capital markets day next month, when Mr Elop is expected to give more details of his turnround plans, followed days later by an appearance at the Mobile World Congress, the trade show, in Barcelona.The events will set the tone for what some analysts view as a make-or-break year for one of Europe’s biggest manufacturers.Nokia sells nearly two-thirds more phones than its nearest rival, Samsung Electronics, but its share of the market shrank from 36.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2009 to 28.2 per cent in the same period last year, according to Gartner, a research company.Most damaging has been its share loss to the Apple iPhone and devices using Google’s Android in the high-margin, high-growth smartphone segment.Critics say Android and Apple’s iOS software offer a more user-friendly experience than Nokia’s much maligned Symbian platform, putting the Finnish group at a disadvantage in an era when consumers increasingly choose phones based on software and web applications, such as e-mail, maps and video.Symbian phones – made almost exclusively by Nokia – fell from 44.6 per cent of the smartphone market to 36.6 per cent in the past year, while Android increased its share from just 3.5 per cent to more than a quarter.Analysts say Android – used by manufacturers such as Taiwan’s HTC and Samsung of South Korea – is on course to overtake Symbian this year.Against this backdrop, speculation has mounted that Nokia could abandon its software development and follow the rush to embrace Android.One rumour claims that Mr Elop, a former Microsoft executive, could seek a tie-up with his old company to adopt a Windows operating system.Either move would mark a U-turn after years of investment in Nokia’s in-house software capabilities including its Ovi brand of services intended to rival the iPhone’s App Store.“If they go with Android, they would be throwing away all that effort and tying themselves to Google,” Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner, says.“I don’t think they have any choice but to keep improving their software and hope they can gradually build some traction.”Analysts warn that, without its own operating system, Nokia would be reduced to a low-margin, commoditised hardware maker much like Dell in the personal computer market.They point out that, while Nokia’s gross margin has slipped, it remains relatively high at about 31 per cent compared with Dell’s 18 per cent.Mr Elop’s software background  was among the main reasons for his appointment to replace Olli-Pekka Kallsvuo, a Nokia veteran, last September.He was not in place long enough to influence the latest flagship Symbian device, the N8, which was released to mixed reviews last October.More important will be the planned launch this year of the first devices to use an operating system called MeeGo, jointly developed with Intel and intended to spearhead Nokia’s fightback.In addition to a progress report on MeeGo, investors will want to hear how Mr Elop plans to protect Nokia’s dominant position in India and other big emerging markets after share losses.Another concern is North America, a longstanding weak spot where Nokia has become all but invisible in the smartphone market.Martin Garner, CCS Insight analyst, cautions against writing off a group that reinvented itself from a stodgy conglomerate into Europe’s most successful consumer technology brand.But he says Nokia must rediscover the knack of delivering winning products if investors, hit by a two-thirds drop in its share price over the past three years, are to keep faith.“If, in 12 months time, that has not happened, it’s going to face some very difficult decisions.”
300;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-01-25T16:10:32Z;Supply chain is a strategic discipline;;"Globalisation has driven a revolution in corporate procurement and put a new generation of professional supply chain managers and their technology tools at the forefront of the push to build sustainable and profitable businesses.Supply chain management has changed a great deal over the past decade.A complex web of global partners and suppliers, volatile energy and commodity prices coupled with currency fluctuations are now the norm.Rick Blasgen, chief executive of the Illinois-based Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals, says: “The number one issue facing our members is the increasing pressure from global competition.”Mr Blasgen, whose 25-year career has included senior supply chain positions at three of the world’s largest food companies – Nabisco, Kraft Foods and ConAgra – took leadership of the Council in 2007. He says the second most important issue his members face is keeping tabs on the information transmitted between supply chain partners.Today, companies need to collaborate with supply chain partners to minimise risk and maximise transparency, he says. “You have to trust your partners with information that in the past you might have considered proprietary.”Businesses operating global supply chains also have a range of other factors to consider including the tax, regulatory and environmental impact of their decisions.Most importantly, they need to view the supply chain function in an entirely new way. Kevin O’Marah, a Gartner analyst in charge of supply chain research, says, “traditional planning cycles are obsolete.“Internet connectivity and global markets have accelerated change so dramatically that businesses must revisit daily investments in product development, manufacturing capacity, and inventory.”Businesses should also take advantage of technologies such as GPS (the global positioning system) tracking, RFID (radio frequency ID) tags, communications networks and software tools.“We always look at how technology is applied,” says Rob Riddleston, head of transport and logistics at Barclays, the banking group.When companies get it right, their supply chains can become a strategic and competitive advantage.Mr Blasgen notes: “Supply chain logistics used to be viewed as a cost-cutting mechanism; now they are being used as growth drivers to open up new markets, particularly emerging markets.”Which companies operate the most admired demand-driven supply chains and document their best practices?In October, Gartner’s AMR unit published its annual list of the top 25 companies that demonstrate leadership in supply chain management.Apple, whose extended supply chain is regularly cited as one of the most sophisticated and effective, took the top slot for the third year running, Procter & Gamble, the only company to have been in the top five for six consecutive years, came in at number two, followed by Cisco, Walmart Stores and Dell.Five companies joined the Top 25 for the first time: Research in Motion (RIM), Amazon, McDonald’s, Microsoft and Inditex, the fashion distribution group.But even the best managed supply chains still face unexpected challenges.Mr Blasgen cites the case of Mattel, the US toymaker that was forced to recall nearly 1m toys in 2007, after it emerged that a Chinese contract manufacturer had covered them with lead-based paint.As companies extend their supply bases and manufacturing operations across the globe, new risks are introduced, including intellectual property theft, supplier viability, volatile exchange rates, product safety, and even piracy.“Supply chain risk has become a big deal in the past five years, and very, very prominent at the time of the oil price spike,” says Mr O’Marah. “When oil was hitting $140 a barrel, people started worrying about whether they were over­exposed in Asia or whether they were overly reliant on materials that are based on oils such as plastics.Fortunately, there are technologies that can help manage these problems, but nevertheless, Noha Tohamy of Gartner says strategic thinking is essential.Generally, she says, software tools can be grouped into two main categories.First, there are those that enable strategic scenario management, or “what-if” analysis. Second, are tools that focus on what is happening in real time.Global logistics presents another set of challenges that have been amplified because while import/export was once a small slice of many economies, today it is big and vital.“The need for both adequate capacity on ocean lanes, rail, road and air links as well as visibility to where your shipments are and whether they’re at risk is suddenly mission-critical,” explains Mr O’Marah.But while many logistics firms are being pressed to provide capacity and visibility, adequate technology tools are still lacking, he says.Supply chain professionals also have to grapple with a new class of supply chain in emerging markets. “Economic growth is disproportionately coming from emerging markets such as India, China, Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa,” says Mr O’Marah.He adds: “Consumer demand is high, but supply chains often look very different, requiring companies to think and build their networks to suit these markets.So, for instance, in Brazil you have serious problems with the roads, whereas in China you have good roads but you have other issues with respect to borders.“Unfamiliar local distribution infrastructure, retail networks, manufacturing capacity and of course regulatory and cultural factors all call for specialised strategies.”Companies, particularly multinationals, are also more concerned about sustainability, while environmental accounting is expected to weigh increasingly on supply chains where factories and transportation contribute substantially to their carbon emissions.Such considerations mainly apply to physical products such as cars, food and clothing.These have a big variable cost component. Digital supply chains for music, software and games can be reproduced and “shipped” at essentially zero marginal cost and present different challenges.“Intellectual property ingredients of physical products can often be separated from the plastic, metal or other material that gets shipped,” says Mr O’Marah.Managing 21st century supply chains requires a new set of skills.The notion of “supply chain” as a professional discipline barely existed a decade ago, says Mr Blasgen.Before the internet connected companies globally, most people working in the shipping, production and purchasing departments of businesses were tactical operatives in cost centres.Today, supply chain competence has become a competitive weapon essential to success in launching products, entering markets and responding to competitive threats."
301;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-01-25T03:41:50Z;Supply chain hype cycle;;"Q&A with Tim Payne, Research Director at Gartner and lead analyst on the Supply Chain Management Hype CycleQ. The Gartner Hype Cycle is meant to cut through the hype surrounding Supply Chain Management (SCM) technologies, and understand the potential for those technologies to change the shape or direction of their industry. Based on Gartner’s research, what is the most hyped supply chain technology?A: Sales and operations planning (S&OP) and/or integrated business planning solutions are probably the most hyped SCM technology at the moment. S&OP has been around in supply chain circles for decades, but it increasingly being seen as a key process for managing value trade-offs across an integrated value chain as part of company’s drive to become demand-driven and improve supply chain effectiveness and business value. Gartner’s supply chain research is positioned under our umbrella model of Demand-Driven Value Networks (DDVN) as a model of supply chain leadership (it also underpins our ‘Top 25’ supply chain research). As with all business strategies and processes there are stages of maturity to go through before you achieve maximum business value. The same is true of DDVN and also for supporting processes such as S&OP.In the lower levels of DDVN maturity (more akin to traditional internal supply chain management) the S&OP process is likely to be an operationally focused demand/supply matching process (we show this as the S&OP technology profile on the 2010 SCM Hype Cycle in the slope of enlightenment) and many companies have this type of S&OP process in place today.However, those organisations that are driving towards DDVN and are at a higher level of process maturity are typically moving their S&OP processes to higher levels of maturity also, and in some cases towards the beginnings of integrated business planning (IBP). We show this on the 2010 SCM Hype Cycle as the IBP technology profile which is firmly in the technology trigger zone of the cycle. IBP offers companies the opportunity to link planning across different domains, from operational, through tactical, to financial and strategic planning.In most companies today there is still a massive disconnect between strategic planning and what happens at the operational level. Even with an S&OP process in place this gaps typically exists. IBP is seen to connect S&OP through to Corporate Performance Management (CPM) and to facilitate the development and evaluation of feasible, and financially modelled, strategic initiatives that can illuminate alternative operational models that better support the achievement of strategic goals.Today, there are no fully baked IBP solutions in the market, although some of the more advanced S&OP solutions are evolving in that direction as well as a couple of emerging niche vendors. There are also other analytical applications that are emerging that support the modelling and analysis aspects of a IBP/high maturity level S&OP process – technologies to support processes such as how to segment and design your supply chain for maximum value creation; how to optimise your product portfolio to maximise profitability; how to analyse demand patterns to gain better market insight that can be driven into models for determining a profitable response to such patterns.What these emerging SCM technologies have in common is their strong analytical nature and provide evidence of a continuing convergence between process-orientated business applications and analytics-orientated business intelligence capabilities. In many ways, these emerging SCM technologies are showing signs of possessing pattern-based strategy capabilities in the way they can help companies seek patterns, model the impact of these patterns and offer ways in which the organisation can adapt to maximise return/minimise risk of the identified patterns.Q: Any other SCM technologies that you would specifically call out as likely to have a significant business impact that executives should monitor?A: I’ve mentioned several of these above in the way that they support an evolving IBP process for an organisation. Perhaps of those the one that offers significant business impact, either as part of an IBP process or as a standalone capability, is what Gartner calls segmented supply chain response. In essence this is the recognition that one-size-does-not-fit-all when it comes to the supply chain. Now supply chains have been doing demand and supply side classifications for years, but what leading companies are discovering is that this segmentation needs to be expanded to encompass much more of the supply chain, and ideally needs to be end-to-end in definition. These companies need technologies that help with the design and evaluation of different supply chain configurations that support different performance capabilities that can be matched with relevant customers and products. We are seeing a lot of interest in segmentation from the business side of supply chain (especially in industries such as high-tech and consumer goods) but the technology side is lagging behind. Executives need to monitor the evolution of technologies to enable robust segmentation processes and learn how to leverage them for supply chain advantage.Q. Should business leaders ignore those SCM technologies that are in the ‘trough of disillusionment’?A: Definitely not. In fact, this can be an opportunity to progress in “stealth” mode while the technology is out of fashion. Often these technologies offer significant value to the supply chain but perhaps not at the levels extolled when the technology was at the peak of its hype. A great example is RFID – which has a valuable place in the supply chain, but is not a panacea for all the ills of supply chains as previously hyped. Many of the SCM technologies in the trough of disillusionment are focused on the execution side of supply chain management; several with a globalisation flavour to them as well. These are valuable technologies to support a more integrated and responsive execution capability as part of a journey towards DDVN, but some companies have struggled to transform their organisational structures and business processes to successfully leverage these technologies on a broad scale and have had to often narrow their focus in order to deliver tangible business benefits whilst recognising the limitations of the existing technologies.You might be able to buy the technology more cheaply, hire staff that have gained some early experience and explore opportunities without the intense market pressure of the peak. There may certainly be challenges to overcome in areas such as performance, integration, user adoption, business case evaluation and predictable return on investment, so as with any early-stage adoption you need to phase your investment through evaluations and trials."
302;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-01-22T02:47:57Z;CIOs need to rethink IT operations;;"Corporate IT leaders need to rethink their IT operations to support corporate growth and help their companies achieve competitive advantage, according to the results of a Gartner survey of more than 2000 CIOs published on Friday.The survey, which examines business priorities and CIO strategies, confirms that corporate IT budgets this year are flat and points to the need for CIOs to reduce the cost of supporting existing IT systems, for example, by moving applications into the cloud. This in turn would help them fund new initiatives designed to fuel the growth that business leaders are seeking or enable companies to expand into new markets.CIO budget projections for 2011 are globally flat, with a weighted average budget increase of just 1 per cent. While the survey shows that CIOs do not expect IT budgets to return to their 2008 pre-recession levels, the number experiencing budget increases this year outnumbered those reporting a cut by almost three-to-one.Corporate IT leaders report that their organisations are emphasising growth, in addition to continued vigilance on cost and operational efficiencies. Gartner notes that this emphasis is consistent with emerging signs of economic recovery and increasing competition to attract and retain customers.""CIOs and IT have been boxed in between modest budget growth and growing legacy requirements,"" said Mark McDonald, group vice-president and head of research for Gartner Executive Programs. ""New lighter-weight technologies and IT models enable the CIO to redefine IT, giving it a greater focus on growth and strategic impact. These are two things that are missing from many organisations.""The resource realities indicated in the 2011 CIO Agenda Survey raise the urgency and importance of adopting new infrastructure and operations technologies, such as cloud services and virtualisation,"" Mr. McDonald said. ""These technologies were voted the top-two technologies for 2011 by CIOs and are well-suited for this budget reality, as they offer similar service levels at lower budget costs.""In fact the survey reveals that CIOs expect to adopt new cloud services much faster than originally expected. Currently, just 3 per cent of CIOs have the majority of IT running in the cloud or on software as a service (SaaS) technologies, but over the next four years CIOs believe that this number will increase to 43 per cent.The survey also confirms that CIOs believe they will be able to fund infrastructure changes and new projects by reallocating resources within that budget. Gartner believes that this approach to funding will become a standard operating procedure because IT budgets are not likely to recover to their 2008 peak until 2014.A ranking of business strategies reported by CIOs indicates that growth is a core expectation for 2011 and beyond. Mr McDonald says the move to growth appears to be more of a change in emphasis than a restructuring of business strategies and business expectations for IT, because previous top concerns for reducing enterprise costs and improving business processes still remain important."

This is hardly the case yet. Less than 20 per cent of the smartphones sold in the third quarter of 2010 used Apple’s iOS operating system and 25 per cent used Google’s Android system, according to Gartner. Almost 40 per cent used Nokia’s Symbian system. But the market is changing: Nokia’s share is falling, Apple’s is steady – although it reported strong European iPhone sales on Tuesday – and Google’s is rocketing (a year earlier it was just 3.5 per cent).Apple’s growth will be limited by the number of people willing to pay extra. Google is less constrained. More than a dozen different phone makers use Android already and Nokia might one day join the club. Google’s Android could well come to dominate the market for smartphones and tablets in the same way that Microsoft’s Windows dominates PCs.One difference: Google gives Android away for free to anyone who wants it. Still, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Telecom Italia, Telefónica and Vodafone are taking no chances. They have set up an “expert group” to watch the market and flag any unfair practices to regulators. Perhaps they think that Android will not remain freely available forever; or that Google will use its reach unfairly to control the market for mobile advertising.A touch of paranoia can be healthy, and the inclination to stand together against the US giants is understandable. But these five operators, the biggest in Europe, must watch their step. They should resist any temptation to go further, for example by using their collective power to help rivals of Google and Apple sell more phones. If the operators try too hard to stop an anticompetitive market developing, they risk becoming the very thing they seek to prevent.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
304;IT;Gartner Inc;2011-01-14T00:49:28Z;Intel upbeat after strong earnings;;"Intel shrugged off concerns that its core PC market is under pressure from tablets and smartphones, reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings and giving an upbeat forecast for this year.The world’s biggest chipmaker reported fourth-quarter earnings ahead of Wall Street expectations, with profits of 59 cents a share on revenues of $11.46bn. Analysts expected 53 cents a share on sales of $11.36bn, according to a Bloomberg survey.The Silicon Valley company admitted that “softness” that began mid-year in consumer markets was continuing, but it was being more than offset by record revenues from its business customers.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said that the growing number of PCs and internet-connected devices such as smartphones and tablets meant there was more demand for its chips in servers in data centres as users accessed services in the “cloud”.Intel said 2010 was by far its most profitable year with net income of $11.7bn, record revenues and gross margins reaching a record 67.5 per cent in the fourth quarter.The company gave an upbeat outlook – predicting revenues of about $11.5bn for the first quarter, compared with analyst expectations of $10.7bn. It expects the launch last week of a new family of desktop and notebook processors, codenamed Sandy Bridge, to help drive sales.Intel provides processors for four out of every five PCs sold, but it has yet to gain a significant foothold in tablets and smartphones, which are being increasingly favoured by consumers as computing devices.The IDC and Gartner research firms reported on Wednesday that worldwide PC shipments grew less than expected in the fourth quarter, largely due to the impact of Apple’s iPad. They reported gains of 2.7 per cent and 3.1 per cent respectively, compared with earlier forecasts of 5.5 per cent and 4.8 per cent.However, Intel’s fourth-quarter revenues rose more than 8 per cent compared with a year earlier and were 3 per cent higher than the third quarter. Intel shares rose 2.6 per cent in extended trading in New York on the news to $21.84.It is the first large technology company to report this earnings season and its comments should create optimism on Wall Street about the prospects of others in the sector.Intel recognises it faces a challenge from power-frugal chips based on designs by Arm of the UK and it announced it was increasing its capital expenditure in 2011 by 73 per cent to $9bn to make it more competitive.This will pay for an extra factory and the move to the next level of miniaturisation – chips with circuit widths of only 22 billionths of a metre, down from
32 nanometre widths."
305;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Apple iPad surge hits PC shipments;;Worldwide personal computer shipments grew less than expected in the fourth quarter, largely due to a surge in purchases of Apple’s iPad, which is spreading to new markets.Researchers IDC and Gartner, in separate reports issued on Wednesday, said total shipments were less than previous projections.They also warned that the PC market would come under pressure as consumers turned to tablets, game consoles, smartphones and other devices rather than replace home and portable computers.Neither company defined the iPad and its growing number of rivals as PCs, although many users perform the same functions on the gadgets. If tablets were considered PCs, the overall market would be showing tremendous growth, with IDC estimating a 19 per cent gain in volume from 2009 to 2010.IDC also estimated that manufacturers shipped about 17m tablets in 2010, the vast majority of them from Apple.With an array of competitors entering the market and a second-generation iPad in the works, IDC analyst Jay Chou expected the number to reach 44m in 2011, on top of the 385m PCs.IDC said worldwide shipments of PCs increased a modest 2.7 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, instead of the 5.5 per cent gain predicted.Gartner said growth slowed to 3.1 per cent in the latest quarter, not the 4.8 per cent anticipated.“Media tablets such as the iPad, as well as other consumer electronic devices such as game consoles, all competed against PCs,” said Mikako Kitagawa, Gartner analyst.Between 90m and 93m PCs were shipped in the past three months of 2010, more than in any previous quarter.Economic recovery pushed sales for the year up 14 per cent to between 346m and 351m units. US sales declined 6.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to Gartner, which said it was a less severe drop-off than had been expected. The region including Europe showed a 6.2 per cent increase, with Asia shipments rising 4.1 per cent.Researchers said their 2011 projections for PCs may be reduced in part because of the popularity in tablets. The uncertain US employment outlook and inflation in China are also putting pressure on the PC makers, Mr Chou said.Samsung, Motorola, and Research in Motion are bringing out their own versions of a tablet computer.In another sign of growing power in the new category, Microsoft this month said it would make a version of Windows to run on mobile chips based on designs by the UK’s ARM, which dominates the tablet world.
306;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-12-29T22:38:53Z;SAP in hot pursuit of investor happiness;Management has to convince founders of standalone strategy;When Jim Hagemann Snabe and Bill McDermott became SAP’s co-chief executives in February they promised to turn the business software maker into a “ happy company”.Ten months on and company insiders say the mood at the world’s largest business software maker by sales has indeed recovered from two years of bewilderment and anger with perceived management aloofness. However, management is still struggling to achieve another, equally important task: to make SAP’s investors happy.Analysts say next year management will have to convince the group’s three founders, who hold a combined 24 per cent of the shares, about SAP’s standalone strategy. Otherwise the group could become a takeover candidate.Thomas Otter, research director at Gartner, says: “2011 is a crunch year for the management. SAP has significantly improved as a company when compared with one year ago. But what I don’t know is whether this will be enough to keep the founders happy.”SAP’s share price has been trailing US arch-rival Oracle’s performance for yet another year. Management suffered a further blow last month when SAP had to pay $1.3bn in damages to Oracle in a copyright infringement verdict.On Wednesday, the court ruled that the group would also have to pay interest on the damages claim sum. Already SAP’s comparatively low market value of €47bn ($62bn) is starting to attract investors.People close to SAP’s main shareholders say several investors from the east, presumably sovereign wealth funds, have asked if Klaus Tschira, one of the founders who owns about 8.4 per cent of the shares, would be willing to sell his stake.But Mr Tschira told the Financial Times he has no plans to sell at the current share price: “At the moment, I have no intention to sell. And I don’t see any pressure to act.”Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP’s co-chief executive, is equally convinced of the three main investors’ backing. “The three founders stand by SAP, not only as investors but also with their hearts,” Mr Snabe said in an interview with Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper.But analysts and industry insiders say the large shareholders, all of whom are more than 65 years old, might decide eventually that the sale to a strategic partner would be the best way to secure SAP’s future.The list of possible buyers is led by Hewlett-Packard, as the group is looking to expand its reach in software. Of other companies big enough to mount an acquisition, IBM turned its back on the applications business in the 1990s and has shown little indication of returning, while Microsoft, which tried to acquire SAP three years ago, is focused on competing with Apple and Oracle in the mobile and online markets.Speculation about interest by HP was fuelled by news in September that Léo Apotheker, who was forced out as SAP’s boss in February, would become the US company’s chief executive. “For the three founders, HP would be a good exit,” says Helmuth Gümbel, managing partner at IT research firm Strategy Partners.But with its stock market value only 50 per cent higher than SAP, HP would face a challenge absorbing the German group. Stuart Williams, software analyst at TBR, a technology research firm, says: “It’s a lot of money and execution risk.”Mr Gümbel says: “The big question is: will the current management be able to prove that it can reinvent SAP [without a partner]? I don’t see the visionary who could meaningfully drive such a restart.”Mr Snabe, an intellectually minded manager, and Mr McDermott, a charismatic salesman, are making a big effort to convince markets that SAP has already reinvented itself.The group, which traditionally sells desktop software for business processes such as personnel planning and accounting systems, is trying to broaden its customer base and expand into mobile devices with new products and May’s $5.8bn takeover of US database and mobile software specialist Sybase.Mr Otter says that so far these initiatives have failed to bring significant growth. “The next six months in particular will be crucial for SAP to show that its new products will make some revenue impact,” he says.
307;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-12-23T17:25:21Z;Moving from ‘Information’ to ‘Insights’;;The unprecedented volatility in today’s business environment has made it crucial that companies can quickly reconfigure strategic priorities. For most companies, this means re-evaluating the quality and effectiveness of their decision-making processes to ensure that decisions are informed by business insights.Chief Information Officers have a vital role to play here. Gartner, the IT analyst firm, recently put this into perspective, saying: “When organisations have to navigate a business transformation, the IT organisation is usually in the middle of it in some way, either as a key enabler or a key constraint. CIOs…need to prepare more vigorously to ensure that IT does its job to advance strategic change.”To do so successfully, CIOs must combine their love of technology with a broader awareness of strategic context. Specifically, this means moving IT’s focus from managing and securing data towards manipulating it to obtain insights that drive fact-based decision-making and competitive advantage. If they can do this, CIOs have an opportunity to emerge as ‘Chief Insight Officers’ – staking their claim to be significant business partners in their organisations.The good news is that CIOs will not be starting from scratch. Most larger companies have already invested in key technology infrastructure - data warehousing and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, for example. But at best, these capabilities are only equipped to process and store proprietary data. The next step must be to mash up this vital internal resource with targeted external data to deliver strategic insights in real time.The end goal for CIOs is to ensure that key decision-makers including the chief executive, are plugged into the targeted data and insights that will let them answer the question “What is the best that can happen?” If they can succeed in this objective, the benefits could be substantial.Take Sales & Operations Planning, for example. Vital strategic ‘bets’ for this core function are still being placed on the ‘HIPPO approach’ (the highest-paid person’s opinion) – with gut feeling the deciding factor in most instances. This could be transformed, provided CIOs can successfully embed predictive analytics capabilities into the fabric of re-engineered decision-making processes.Of course, the scale of the ‘data challenge’ should not be underestimated. In a 2009 Accenture survey of 600 UK and US blue-chip companies, two-thirds of respondents cited ‘getting their data in order’ as an immediate priority. And around 40 percent said that their current technological resources and systems significantly impeded the effective use of enterprise-wide analytics.Because of such deficiencies, these companies are finding it difficult to forecast market trends, pinpoint optimum purchasing options or nurture rising talent – just a few examples of areas where analytics ‘leaders’ such as Google, Capital One, and Tesco in the UK are realising powerful benefits.Commitment to analytics need not be the preserve of technology-driven giants. The Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is using predictive analytics techniques to enable innovative decision-making. For example, backed by sophisticated audience analysis, the RSC was able to launch a much broader range of productions and audience experiences. The risk paid off, with a 20-plus per cent increase in ticket sales over previous Stratford-upon-Avon seasons.To ensure their organisations can realise such benefits, CIOs can and should be taking the initiative, first, by demonstrating to the business at large their commitment to fact-based decision-making, and second, embedding analytics into decision-making processes throughout the organisation.All companies have ‘got’ reporting. They routinely use descriptive, backward-looking analytics to handle that process. Having already invested in the hardware, software and talent they need to manage that core function, the challenge for CIOs is to connect these capabilities organisation-wide, while exploiting developments in predictive analytics technologies to enable what is, literally, ‘business thinking’.This means answering a host of tough questions. How should we reorganise our systems and processes? How can we acquire the right analytical talent to drive this new capability? What’s the most effective way of unlocking the insights within social networks?We know that winning companies – those that achieve a higher return on invested capital – exit recessionary periods as leaders and sustain their advantage over time. These are the organisations that exploit the opportunities at hand, using the cash-flow generated by cost-reduction programmes to reinvest in innovation and create their own upturn.As Chief Insight Officers, CIOs will play a vital role in galvanising and sustaining this process, helping to define the critical processes needed to deliver insights to key decision-makers and, as important, to define the data sources that will inform these insights.Dave Rich is Global Managing Director of Accenture Analytics
308;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-12-17T17:39:52Z;Software ‘rust’ risk to shareholder value;;The Industrial Revolution was fuelled by capital investment in tangible assets: cotton mills, steam engines, iron foundries. Over time, accountants in industrial corporations developed disciplines to manage the dilapidation and depreciation of these capital assets. Shareholders gained insight into the integrity of the assets and the capital provisions made to fund their renewal and replacement. These fixed asset management disciplines and the associated structured financial reporting have been bread and butter basics for financial analysis for best part of a century.This fixed asset model is all well and good for Industrial Revolution corporations, but about as much use as a chocolate teapot when evaluating Information Revolution corporations. For many industry sectors, capital investment has already transitioned investment in tangible assets to intangible assets, notably large scale software applications. These include systems such as Core Retail Banking, Insurance Policy Administration, Claims Processing and the three-letter acronym trilogy of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Supply Chain Management (SCM). Some corporations are now almost completely virtual: internet gambling and gaming firms have practically no assets other than their software and their client lists.So what? Well, the problem is that software rusts. It decays. It gets dilapidated, geriatric, arthritic, sclerotic, senile – and eventually it dies and goes to software Valhalla. But neither corporate finance teams nor shareholders have any insight into the integrity of the portfolio of software assets that underpin the corporation. And every year that goes by, the corporation becomes even more dependent on its portfolio of software assets, and those assets are getting bigger, fatter, older, more difficult to manage and more expensive to replace.How does software “rust”? The software that delivers support for the business process – the “business application” – is the tip of an iceberg of technology components, generally known as a “stack”. The stack is based on hardware: on top of the hardware is an operating system, on top of that are components such as database software, compilers and application servers, security components, integration servers and message handlers. Each one of these components is provided by a specific technology vendor, and is at a specific version and release and is known to interoperate effectively with the other components in the stack. But each of these components has a life cycle, whereby vendors release new “improved” versions and progressively withdraw support from older versions, thereby destabilising the stack. Eventually one of the stack components might completely lose support, when the vendor goes out of business or is acquired or simply loses interest in the product. Whilst there is generally no major problem running a business application for a while with unsupported stack components, it is not a satisfactory situation for mission-critical applications.But software dilapidation is more than loss of stack integrity. A growing problem is software obesity. What was once a lean mean business application has millions of pounds spent on adding new features, functions and integrations to help deliver new business capability. Many aging business applications are software camels, built as racehorses but progressively ruined through a constant stream of modifications designed to meet quarterly business objectives without any consideration for the overall impact on design integrity or total cost of ownership.“It has ever been thus – there is nothing new here” say the naysayers. OK – but what is different now is the scale of the problem. Worldwide, Gartner estimates IT debt – the investment needed to bring today’s portfolios of applications up to fully-supported status - to be $500bn, with an expectation that this will rise to $1,000bn by 2015. The problem here is not the IT debt itself – it is the ignorance about the scale of the problem in any specific enterprise. This ignorance is a problem for two reasons of direct relevance to the CFO. First, the CFO needs to lead the capital planning to deal with the substantial number of upgrades, replacements and transformations that will be needed over the next decade that cannot possibly be executed within the “business as usual” IT funding. Second, the CFO needs to grasp the full extent of enterprise risk posed by the aging and bloated application portfolio. Gartner has already seen large corporation CIOs being interviewed at length by industry analysts and ratings agencies wanting to gain an insight into the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) impact of the state of the applications portfolio.Over time, corporate dependency on software will inevitably increase – and so will the cost of managing software. Few organisations today have a comprehensive inventory of their business applications, let alone any structured asset valuations or dilapidation plans. Through M&A and corporate restructurings over the last 10 – 20 years, many corporations have bloated portfolios of duplicated applications all destined to die over the coming decade – and no plan to manage them. Meanwhile, the relentless combined pressure of IT cost cutting and continuous demand for new features to help meet short-term business objectives means that essential maintenance and replacements are delayed and new capital is invested in dying software. This is a train wreck waiting to happen.What is to be done? CFOs and CIOs need to work together to start applying the disciplines of fixed asset management to the world of software assets. An inventory would be a good starting point, together with fully-overheaded line-item cost statements for the current FY running costs. This should be combined with a seven-year “liability cost of the asset” plan, showing expected upgrade investments needed to maintain the integrity and value of the asset – or the point at which the asset needs to be sunsetted and replaced. Simply making the data available and sharing it through the management team is an immensely powerful tool for gaining the necessary level of business attention to this significant problem. CIOs should start to produce an internal annual report on the integrity of the application portfolio, whilst understanding that the day is not that far off when shareholders will expect to see and understand this material as part of their evaluation of corporate performance. The challenges of software dilapidation will not go away, and they will not be solved by concealment.

It dips and swoops stylishly and is covered with exciting phrases such as Extreme Transaction Processing, Social Analytics and Idea Management.I spend my life helping large organisations get their online communication right, and occasionally wonder if I should try to think up snappy labels to stick on my ideas. They will get my clients excited, surely, and must go down well in the C-Suite (to borrow another bit of snappiness). But no, I have decided that if a word or phrase needs too much explanation, it is worth avoiding. Which is my long-winded explanation (excuse?) for celebrating a word that is unlikely to set any pulses racing. It is ‘governance’.Governance is control, regulation and influence, according to my dictionary, and it is very important indeed. Over and again I find that the answer to problems in the world of the web and social media rests not on bleeding edge ideas, but on sheer bloody organisation. And it’s good governance that gets that organisation right.Take the agenda of a conference we ran in the summer, which tried to reflect the hopes and fears of online managers. There were three big themes: running a global web estate, social media and reputation management.Design, usability, Facebook, Twitter, we talked of all these – but in the end the discussion always tipped towards management and organisation.It is fairly obvious why with the global web estate – though that doesn’t make it easy. I am talking here to the person who manages the web in headquarters. If you are not him/her, maybe you are a boss or colleague; I hope this helps you empathise.The first job is handling the boss. Two issues sound contradictory, but often go together. Many senior managers still don’t see the web as important – they may pay lip service to it, but they just don’t get it. But the same people can come back from a dinner with their peers and say ‘We need to start tweeting!’ A dangerous combination.Next, persuade your colleagues around the world that they shouldn’t set up websites when they like, how they like – that things like brand consistency and shared costs have some merit. Be nice to the guys in IT (unless you are a guy in IT) and take careful note of everything they say. Then set up a system that gets the right balance between supporting other people and keeping them in line. There are a number of good governance models – the trick is to get the one that is appropriate (another dull word I’m fond of).If you do all this, and well, you have a chance of getting a web estate that does all the things it might do, and well. Until of course someone comes along and says, ‘What about social media?’What about social media? If you do not get the governance right here, you are in trouble. There’s a specific problem arising from the demarcation – increasingly artificial – between marketing and communications. Many companies have put their social media activities into marketing. It seems to make sense: think of all the exciting opportunities it brings to have a dialogue with customers.But the website is usually run by the comms team (we have done a survey – it is), and if there isn’t co-ordination between web and the social media people, what fun can there be. A large company’s social media manager got back to work to find the group had made a shattering decision on its future. He tweeted that he was ‘offline for my son’s birthday party. Came home to find news. While trying to collect info, I tweeted that I knew zero.’ Lovely that he put his family first, but why on earth was this important voice of the company not told that his corporate world was about to shake? Because, I suspect, the comms and social media people didn’t think to talk to each other.Reputation management – in the news recently, largely thanks to BP. Increasingly the web is the main line of defence. Here you can put the company line, provide practical detail, and put sticking plasters on your image. But who is traditionally in charge of defending reputation? The press office, with its hot list of a dozen journalists who can kill any story with the stroke of a typewriter key. At least they used to be able to. It doesn’t work any more, thanks to websites, Twitter, blogs, Facebook and their friends – so the press office needs to work hand in glove with the online team. You need to react very fast indeed, and that involves having a pre-arranged process that can be activated in minutes.Why do I talk about governance, rather than sticking to even plainer words like organisation? Because effective online communication has to be governed from the centre: yours may be the most decentralised group in the world, but with only one web presence, it must be controlled, regulated and influenced from one spot. Senior managers need to understand that, even if they leave implementation to the worker ants who know just what needs to be done.David Bowen is senior consultant for Bowen Craggs & Co, a web effectiveness consultancy (www.bowencraggs.com) dbowen@bowencraggs.com."

Nokia is also working on a new operating system, called MeeGo, due to be introduced next year.Nokia remains the world’s biggest smartphone maker by sales but its market share slipped from 44.6 per cent to 36.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2010, compared to the year before, according to Gartner, the research firm.Success in smartphones is crucial if Nokia is to maintain its leadership of the overall handset market because it is the segment with the fastest growth and fattest margins.While total global handset sales grew by 35 per cent in the third quarter compared with last year, smartphone sales soared by 96 per cent and account for a fifth of the overall market, according to Gartner.In the most advanced western markets, such as Sweden, as many as eight out of 10 handsets sold are smartphones.
311;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-12-08T00:42:42Z;Google challenge to Microsoft software empire;;The battle between Google and Microsoft to shape the future of personal computing has stepped up a gear after Google unveiled an internet-centric laptop that it said would offer a cheaper alternative to the traditional PC.Executives at the search company said companies such as American Airlines and Kraft had been lining up to try out the new machine in the hope of saving large amounts on their PC costs.They said Acer and Samsung would start selling consumer versions of the notebook computers running the new operating system, known as Chrome OS, by the middle of next year.However, Google also conceded that it had fallen six months behind in completing the software as it tried to iron out technical problems, and analysts said the company was in for a long battle as it attempted to launch a direct attack on the main stronghold of Microsoft’s software empire.The Chrome OS laptop marks the culmination of Google’s efforts to build a PC that draws entirely on the information and computing power on the web, rather than running “native” software made by Microsoft or other traditional software companies.Eric Schmidt, chief executive, called the software “a viable, third choice in real operating systems” to stand alongside Microsoft and Apple, and a culmination of a vision he has worked on since 1983. As chief technology officer at Sun Microsystems, Mr Schmidt was among the main proponents a decade ago of “thin clients”, or machines that relied on networks for data storage and computing power rather than running their own software.“This is the first step, but there’s a long way to go,” said Ray Valdes, an analyst at Gartner. “People will probably be concerned about compatibility and functionality – will it meet their needs?”One Google rival added that the company had done little to explain to computer makers and consumers how it would support the new operating system, adding to the uncertainties.Google first announced plans for Chrome OS a year ago and at the time said it expected the machines would be on sale by this holiday season. On Tuesday, the group said that it was still working to fix bugs in the software and that the device would not be available until the “first half” of 2011.The group also said it was still perfecting ways to solve one of the biggest problems faced by a new computer operating system: how to work with all the printers, cameras and other hardware devices that are plugged into them, all of which need compatible software “drivers”. Problems with compatibility like this were central to the bad reception for Microsoft’s Windows Vista operating system.Google announced a pilot programme on Tuesday to test an early version of a Chrome OS laptop and said a number of big companies would be involved in the trial. Advantages over traditional PCs included being able to make frequent updates to the operating system remotely, as well as the lack of any need to buy or maintain other software, it said.
312;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-12-07T23:23:52Z;Tablets: Companies prove as keen as consumers on ‘magical’ devices;;When Steve Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, announced the launch of the iPad this year, he emphasised its appeal to consumers as a “magical and revolutionary device at an unbelievable price.”He now acknowledges however that he underestimated demand from another market segment – companies.“We’re already seeing tremendous interest in the iPad from education and, to my surprise, from business,” he told analysts during a rare conference call in October. “It’s being grabbed out of our hands.”“I talk to people every day, in all kinds of businesses, from corporate board directors – who are shipping iPads around instead of board books [ the documentation company directors are expected to read and digest before board meetings] – down to nurses and doctors in hospitals and other large and small companies,” Mr Jobs said.Gartner, the research company, forecasts that sales of tablet computers, such as the iPad, will reach 19.5m units around the world this year.Apple’s head start in the market means it is likely to account for about 70 per cent of that total.The company has not officially disclosed what proportion of iPad sales are finding their way into corporate hands – with or without the blessing of the IT department.But all the indications are that it is a much higher figure than most had expected and could perhaps match the estimated 40 per cent of iPhones that end up in enterprises.Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer, told the same analyst audience that: “Enterprise CIOs are adding iPad to their approved-device list at an impressive rate. More than 65 per cent of the Fortune 100 are already deploying or piloting iPad.”Among the companies that have recently disclosed significant corporate iPad deployments, SAP, the German business software group, is providing iPads to thousands of its employees.Oliver Bussmann, SAP’s chief information officer, says he expects employees to use the device for many corporate functions including remote access – for example, sales presentations.He also believes the iPad and other tablet devices will be used by managers to access the business intelligence applications and management consoles that help them track and optimise business performance.Indeed, a number of the iPad apps that enable business managers to access SAP’s enterprise resource planning and other enterprise software, including BusinessObjects and Crystal Reports were on display at SAP’s recent “Sapphire Now” user conference.Some of SAP’s customers are already using iPads to help with finance and governance functions – the devices enable mobile and therefore more timely access to company performance metrics and market data.Meanwhile, tablet computers have also emerged as a viable and secure alternative to board books.Several companies have recently rolled out dedicated board book iPad applications. One of them is New Zealand-based Diligent, which provides a web portal that directors and administrative staff can access to update and examine board materials before and during board meetings.“Using either the built-in WiFi, or a 3G connection, directors can review board materials while on the move with the convenience of knowing that they are always reviewing the latest version of their board materials,” Diligent says.Leslie Fiering, research vice-president at Gartner, notes, “a growing number of companies are using iPads to distribute securely the documents directors need for board meetings using specially developed secure cloud services.”Among other potential uses, Ms Fiering says “media tablets” such as the iPad are also particularly suitable for mapping, schematics, video storage-playback, as a portable reference library, providing executives with access to corporate ERP systems, for video chat and conferencing, digital signage, interactive brochures and enterprise telephony.As a result, she says, “they are already finding their way into a wide range of companies including field service organisations, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing and retail.”
313;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-12-07T23:23:52Z;Finance heads need much wider view of IT;;Finance directors and chief financial officers are pivotal in most companies and often have a big role in defining IT strategy, either directly or through their control of corporate budgets.Traditionally, CFOs have used spreadsheets and other relatively simple software internally to manage repetitive tasks such as payroll, keep track of transactions and to undertake rudimentary business analysis.“CFOs have used IT to realise efficiency gains for years, keeping the accounts correct, reporting to tax authorities and investors, and managing cash flow,” says Alexander Drobik, managing vice-president of research at Gartner.He adds: “These are all critical activities that IT has traditionally supported well. Corporate performance management processes, such as planning and forecasting, are examples of IT increasing organisational effectiveness for finance leaders.”What is less clear – because the technology is less mature – he says, is the opportunities presented by social computing: for example, collaborative investor forums, desktop financial reporting tools that integrate market data and social feeds, as well as the usual “executive” or “special interest group” forums, in this case for CFOs.Indeed, business and IT consultants argue that finance chiefs need to adopt a much more expansive view of technology if they want to tap its potential, not just to cut costs and improve efficiency, but to make a meaningful contribution to a company’s overall business strategy and growth opportunities.How, then, can CFOs deliver the strategic insight to help the chief executive, the management team and business unit leaders make better decisions and achieve strategic goals?Nigel Rayner, a Gartner analyst, says: “From the strategic perspective, most CFOs are woefully inadequate, because they are still trying to deliver these capabilities using Excel spreadsheets.”Although CFOs want to help their companies increase profitability and cash flow, Mr Rayner argues that very few of them actually have any idea of what drives profitability in their organisations.But it need not be that way, he says.“There is a raft of specialised technology applications such as profitability modelling and optimisation that allow them to do just that, and yet only a handful of organisations and CFOs use them.”So why is that? Sometimes, he says, it is simply because they do not know about the applications that are available and they are happy to use spreadsheets and a team of accountants. Sometimes, it is a cultural issue, a familiarity issue and a skills issue.“I find when I meet CFOs that if I talk to them about the transaction stuff they know everything about ERP [enterprise resource planning] software because most of them have been through lots of ERP implementations,” says Mr Rayner, “and they will talk to you about what they are doing in that area.“But when you talk to them about management reporting, understanding the drivers of profitability, forecasting or planning, all they know are spreadsheets because they have always done it that way. They are not aware of how the technology market has developed.”However, it is a limitation that CFOs are becoming aware of. As Gartner analyst John Van Decker points out in his piece analysing the results of the 2010 Gartner-Financial Executives International (FEI) Technology Study elsewhere in this report, CFOs view profitability management as a top technological constraint.He and other business analysts do not see this situation changing quickly, because they say most business and finance education does not address these issues.“It is also a cultural issue, because finance folks tend to be very conservative,” says Mr Rayner. “They are comfortable with what they know, which is spreadsheets, and having an army of spreadsheet jockeys.They are not very good at working with IT and technology in anything other than a very practical sense.”Gavin Michael, managing director of R&D and Alliances at Accenture, the consulting business, agrees. “The discussion about how finance and IT work together is perennial,” he says.There are three main areas that should be addressed to make the relationship between the CFO and chief information officer more productive.First, they need to speak the same language. “CIOs tend to talk in terms of technology, whereas CFOs speak in terms of cost. The CFO is looking for tangible outcomes and many CIOs struggle to articulate that. It’s important for CIOs to take the lead and clearly communicate the business results for any technology investment.”Second, they need to agree on how to invest savings from IT initiatives. “CIOs should make a business case for reinvesting in IT initiatives now in order to save later.For example, strategically investing in technologies such as virtualisation or cloud computing, could reduce costs and enhance IT performance.”Third, a consensus must be reached on how to fund broad-based initiatives in the organisation. “CIOs have visibility across the organisation, yet funding is often siloed within specific operating groups. The challenge lies with the CFO learning to think differently about how funding constructs operate within the organisation, which traditionally does not allow broad-based investments to span multiple business units.This may mean allowing funds to be administered centrally to enable cross-company initiatives rather than to specific lines of business.”But there are other issues as well.Gartner argues that, typically, when CFOs are faced with the challenge of understanding an important business issue such as profitability management and who are the most profitable customers, they call in consultants or strategic business service providers who then develop customised applications using tools like Microsoft Access.“That simply perpetuates the problem,” argues Mr Van Decker. Nevertheless, he says that being able to use IT to support more sophisticated business concepts such as activity-based costing – which enables a company to assess the cost of a product or service more accurately – represents “a very big opportunity for companies.”The CFO can play a key role in instigating this and other initiatives, such as electronic invoicing networks, improving the tracking of key performance metrics and risk indicators.“Too often, business leaders including CFOs perceive IT as a back-office activity focused on driving efficiency gains, such as standardised business process software, desktops, call-centres, networks, or mobile phone support,” says Mr Drobik.He adds: “To business leaders, IT should also be about driving effectiveness, competitive advantage and, ultimately, increasing revenue, improving customer loyalty, enhancing product innovation and driving market opportunities.”
314;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-12-07T22:47:49Z;Business IT is not a one-trick pony;;Too often, business leaders perceive IT as a back-office activity focused on driving efficiency gains, such as standardised business process software, desktops, call-centres, networks, or mobile phone support.To business leaders, IT should also be about driving effectiveness, competitive advantage and, ultimately, increasing revenue, improving customer loyalty, enhancing product innovation and driving new go to market opportunities.This view is supported by a Gartner survey of more than 1,600 chief information officers (CIOs) that identified the top three business expectations of IT were “improving business processes”, “reducing enterprise costs” and “increasing the use of information/analytics”. Delivering business value, such as increasing workforce effectiveness, attracting and retaining customers, or creating new products, were much lower priorities for CIOs.This contrasts starkly to another recent Gartner survey, this time of chief executives, that revealed their top business issue to be “retaining and enhancing existing customers.”The difference between CEO and CIO priorities illustrates the need for CEOs, and the c-suite in general, to look more closely at how IT can help increase top line revenue and performance, not just bottom line efficiency. It also shows how CIOs, and IT leaders in general, must communicate the business value of IT more effectively to their colleagues on the c-suite, and not just focus on how IT can aid efficiency goals.For example, sales leaders typically rely on IT for reporting rather than improving sales productivity or identifying new growth opportunities. Sales force automation projects have more to do with gaining management insights into sales pipeline forecasting than it has with making sales people more effective.Using IT for sales productivity is less mature but is becoming more widely used in territory management and pricing optimisation. In addition, increasing global internet/mobile connectivity combined with the exponential growth of social computing is rapidly extending e-commerce opportunities for organisations. IT can play a central role in helping sales leaders to identify and capture new customers and business opportunities.IT continues to help marketing leaders be more efficient in, for example, content control, program spend and resource management. IT also helps marketing leaders to be more effective, for example, by using analytics to establish the link between activity and end-result.Social computing is set to change the relationship between an organisation and its customer, prospects and all other constituents. Marketers have used the social phenomenon to drive new social customer relationship management (CRM) and digital marketing business processes in brand awareness, campaign creation, promotions, service support, product ideation and brand reputation programs, albeit with different levels of success.Similarly, HR leaders continue to use IT for efficiency gains, for example, to reduce the cost of payroll, or keep an up-to-date system of record of employment. These efficiency-focused processes will continue to be critical for the organisation. IT also has an important role to play for HR leaders as they increasingly focus on productivity hot spots for their organisations, such talent management and performance management.Social computing in particular, is making an impact on HR, specifically around hiring and employer reputation. Anyone with a teenage son or daughter will know that their view of employers is mainly driven by what they learn from their friends and peers about the company, not by the employer’s literature. HR leaders need to work with their colleagues in IT to identify and respond to the opportunities and threats that social computing creates for their organizations.Chief financial officers have used IT to realise efficiency gains for years, keeping the accounts correct, reporting to tax authorities and investors, and managing cash-flow. These are all critical activities that IT has traditionally supported well. Corporate performance management processes, such as planning and forecasting, are examples of IT increasing organizational effectiveness for finance leaders. Less mature is how social computing impacts and presents opportunities for the finance department.Early examples include collaborative investor forums, desktop financial reporting tools that integrate market data and social feeds, financial reputation management, as well as the usual “executive” or “special interest group” forums, in this case for the CFO.Every c-level executive must shift their perception of IT away from purely back-office efficiency and focus more on how IT can make their departments more effective and drive real business value for their organization. Every c-level executive must also understand how IT is changing the market structure itself.Alexander Drobik is managing vice president of Research, Gartner
315;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
316;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-12-03T17:26:39Z;Manufacturers hope tablets will stick;;"Last month, I compared Apple’s iPad to a donkey (in a metaphorical sense, of course); this month, I am considering it as a horse – a Trojan horse, that is, set to facilitate the US company’s advance into the front line of business data processing.Apple, as everybody knows, has never been much of a success in business IT, with the notable exception of the creative industries. Cost, the ubiquity of Intel processors and Microsoft’s Windows interface saw to that.The iPad and the iPhone, however, represent a new level of abstraction in personal information technology – low cost, transportable and versatile computers with built-in communications of remarkable power.A pioneer neither in portable nor tablet computers, Apple has nevertheless vaulted into a leadership position in both segments as a consequence of introducing first the iPhone and then the iPad.The competition, however, is hotting up. The potential of iPad-like devices as business tools has not been lost on other manufacturers and has led to a veritable avalanche of tablet computers, some more obviously slanted towards business than others. There is, for example, Hewlett-Packard’s Slate 500 tablet computer, aimed squarely at employees on the move and featuring a 9-in screen and the Windows 7 Professional 32 interface.The world’s largest personal computer group is planning to launch another tablet, the HP PalmPad, in 2011. The result of HP’s acquisition earlier this year of Palm, this computer will use Palm’s WebOS operating system and the smart money thinks it will be aimed more at the consumer market than is the Slate.Other companies that have launched, or are planning to launch, iPad-like tablets include Samsung, Research in Motion, Cisco, Dell and Google.So there should be no surprise that mobile applications and media tablets are among the top 10 strategic technologies for 2011 identified by Gartner, the US market consultancy.There can be little doubt that the huge number of independently written applications, many of them well suited to the business environment, is an important factor in the new popularity of tablet computers.IT Business Edge, an online consultancy, for example, points to the business relevance of communications services such as Skype, which will run on both the iPhone and the iPad, and LogMeIn Ignite, an application that enables the user to control a Mac or a PC remotely, giving access to customer relationship management (CRM) or enterprise resources management (ERM) software at the click of a virtual button.These novel kinds of hardware and software are encouraging a new trend – BYOT or buy (or bring) your own technology. The idea is that some employees might be willing to pay some or all the cost of a productivity enhancing technology for work if they were able to choose the technology themselves. It is essentially a development of the by now well known phenomenon that many employees’ own personal technology is superior to that provided in their workplace.BYOT, however, could save a company money while enhancing job satisfaction and commitment in its workers.It is an idea that could prove popular. Almost three-quarters of a group of 141 individuals canvassed this year by Unisys, the IT company, said they would be willing to pay at least part of the cost of technology for their own use.But executives at Dimension Data, the computing services company, say managing such a programme is far from simple, arguing that it will bring a number of business issues to the surface around security, compliance, compatibility and network performance.Unisys has some recommendations for organisations keen to try BYOT. These are mostly common sense – for example, carry out an initial survey to test interest among employees.The whole process should be simple and transparent, written into policy documents and contracts with clear guidance for staff on issues such as insurance, tax and standards.An initial pilot project involving only the most IT savvy individuals is just as important in introducing BYOT as it is for any IT project.BYOT would have seemed a non-starter at any earlier time in the evolution of data processing: even today the notion seems a little outlandish.But the iPhone and iPad have changed the name of the game and Apple has opened a Pandora’s box of opportunity."
317;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-29T17:28:48Z;Apple, Android to take out PC sales – Gartner;;Tablets, led by the iPad, will cut increasingly into PC sales from this year onwards, according to the latest forecasts from the Gartner research firm.While the chipmaker Intel has predicted tablets will expand the PC market, Gartner suggests Apple and Android tablets will displace around 10 per cent of other PC sales by 2014.Gartner said on Monday worldwide PC shipments should grow 14.3 per cent in 2010 to 352.4m units, but that is down from its prediction of 19.2 per cent growth to 367.8m units made on August 31.It predicts 15.9 per cent growth to 409m units in 2011, down from its earlier estimate of 18.1 per cent growth.“These results reflect marked reductions in expected near-term unit growth based on expectations of weaker consumer demand, due in no small part to growing user interest in media tablets such as the iPad,” said Ranjit Atwal, Gartner research director.“Over the longer term, media tablets are expected to displace around 10 per cent of PC units by 2014.”Gartner describes media tablets as touchscreen devices running Android, Chrome or Apple’s iOS operating systems and does not include them in its PC figures. It does include tablets running Windows operating systems in its figures.The research firm says the PC market will be weakened by disruptive forces such as media tablets and next-generation smartphones. Desktop PCs could be hit by adoption of computing in the cloud, with only thin-client “barebones” PCs or refurbished ones needed.“PCs are still seen as necessities, but the PC industry’s inability to significantly innovate and its over-reliance on a business model predicated on driving volume through price declines are finally impacting the industry’s ability to induce new replacement cycles,” said George Shiffler, another Gartner research director.Emerging markets are providing growth, but there is a risk consumers there could leapfrog PCs for alternative devices, Gartner says.To complete the gloom, the research firm says economic uncertainty is making consumers postpone purchases in mature markets and media tablets are “rapidly finding favour with PC buyers who are attracted to their more-dedicated entertainment-driven features and their instant-on capability.”
318;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-24T22:43:26Z;Tapping into a revenue stream;The mobile phone app market has taken off with the iPhone;When pop singer Katy Perry launched her single “Firework”, one of the first places fans were able to listen to the song was on an iPhone through a bespoke version of the highly popular Tap Tap Revenge game.The mobile phone app, which allows users to tap the phone in time to the music, provided a clever marketing platform for the singer. But for US-based developer Tapulous, which launched the game for free a week ahead of the song’s release to US radio stations, it offered a fresh way to get gamers hooked on its apps.The Tap Tap Revenge app has been downloaded more than 40m times and more than 25m songs have been downloaded within the game, including free and paid downloads.Tapulous’s collaborations with acts such as Coldplay and Lady Gaga have also helped the games developer tap into a sizeable revenue stream. Its success attracted the attention of Disney Mobile, which acquired Tapulous earlier this year for an undisclosed sum.Tapulous is one of several small companies to ride the wave of mobile apps in the past two years. But as the market becomes increasingly crowded, and well-established large groups jostle with the minnows, developers are finding they have to work harder to stand out.Apps have been offered on mobile handsets for years and more recently have emerged on social networking platforms such as Facebook. But it was only when Apple launched the 3G iPhone in 2008 and started offering easily downloadable app software through its iTunes store that the market really opened up.According to research firm Gartner, revenue from mobile apps is expected to hit at least $6.8bn this year and could be worth $29.5bn by 2013.Apple’s early success and the launch of smartphone handsets operating on Google’s Android operating system have encouraged a wave of kitchen-table entrepreneurs as well as more established players to try to make money out of apps. Apple boasts more than 250,000 apps and the Android and Nokia app markets are rushing to catch up.Ben Holmes, a partner at venture capital firm Index Ventures, says the mobile app market has changed dramatically in the past two years. Previously, apps were sold already installed on a phone, and how much a developer made depended on the success of the handset. Now small players are generally operating on a level playing field with big companies and venture capitalists such as Index are seeing the opportunities for investment.Malcolm Barclay, a UK-based app developer, had been contracting for years when he realised he could make up to £100,000 ($158,000) by focusing on making apps full-time. “I started over two years ago. I was one of the first in there with a free application – Tube Status, which gives you the status of the London Underground lines,” he says. “As soon as it went in there, it went crazy. I had requests flooding in for more features and functionality – maps, departure boards. So I decided to sit down and build a pay-for app.” He says that within a few months, he realised that could make a living with the new app which he called Tube Deluxe, an evolution of his original creation.Every week he sells thousands of his apps at prices ranging from 59p to £1.79. He has to pay some royalties: after Apple takes its cut, he gets about 36p from a 59p sale.Mr Barclay says once an app is released, in order to keep customers interested, developers must continually update and polish the product. “When they first came out, apps were very simple and people were easily impressed. Now they’re not . . . People’s expectations have risen exponentially,” he says.Rael Boj set up Piky Team, a games developer based in France, less than a year ago. His Nude Runner-Girl Edition, an adult game app featuring a nude cartoon girl, recently made the top 10 in the US iTunes app charts.Mr Boj says that if you are lucky you can get back about a year’s investment. However, he stresses the importance of being highly flexible and employing freelancers, rather than staff, for big jobs. “It’s dangerous to go further when you’re a small independent studio. It’s really easy to lose money,” he says.Smaller developers such as Mr Boj are increasingly coming up against competition from large companies – including often giving their apps away for nothing as part of a wider marketing campaign. Scrabble, Mono­poly and Need for Speed by Electronic Arts, the games publisher, have all proved popular. Barclaycard’s free waterslide game, which was tied into a television advertisement, briefly topped the charts earlier this year.Analysts say that as bigger companies join the gold rush, making money out of apps will increasingly be down to good marketing, a clever idea and a lot of luck.Howard Tomlinson, managing director of UK-based games developer Astraware, who found early success with apps for Palm, says that while the size of the apps market “is technically huge”, few people are making money from it. “There are a massive number of Android users, but very few purchase products because so much is free.”Patrick Mork, chief marketing officer at independent app store GetJar, agrees. “Yes, there are thousands of apps on Apple, but less than 1 per cent will make any significant money.” He says the “freemium model”, whereby apps are offered for free but developers then charge for in-application extras, is becoming increasingly popular and is potentially lucrative if developers come up with a sensible business plan.Astraware’s strategy has been to create lots of products and release them on as many platforms as possible. “I can’t predict in advance which apps will make money, but in the early stages I can often see which ones won’t and then stop working on it,” says Mr Tomlinson. Testing a game on children, for example, to see if it has a wider appeal is a good way of working out early on if the app will work.Marketing is key. On Facebook, when a game is downloadedit registers on a user’s news feed and spreads virally to friends. For Apple apps, what determines success is how far up the iTunes chart they are. Unless a developer is in the top 25, they do not get enough volume to make money either on a pay-per-download or advertising model.Angry Birds, developed in Sweden and marketed by UK-based Chillingo, has maintained a high ranking on app charts for months. Chillingo, which was last month acquired by Electronic Arts, experiments with business models and platforms. The full game costs 99 cents in the Apple store but on the Android platform is free to download.Tapulous also uses a number of different models to monetise its apps.“Our free, franchise games including Tap Tap Revenge and Riddim Ribbon, feature advertising, in-app commerce, virtual goods as well as high-profile integrated sponsorships. In addition to ‘freemium’ games, we also release premium games that are pay-to-download,” says Bart Decrem, general manager of Disney Mobile and original co-founder of Tapulous.As the technology changes so rapidly, inevitably developers hoping to profit from their apps will have to continue to experiment. “I failed several times before and I’ll probably fail again,” says Mr Boj. “When I tell people I make iPhone apps they say, ‘Oh you’re a millionaire then’. The App Store has that image of successful developers that sell thousands of apps a day. But a large part of the store is made of unsuccessful apps. Lot of studios have invested and lost money.”
319;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-24T18:53:43Z;Cloud computing faulted by security pros;;"Security researchers last week demonstrated new methods for attacking corporate data stored with the increasingly popular “cloud” services, adding to concerns about the much-hyped technology that are preventing many big companies from taking it up.A presentation at the Black Hat USA security conference in Las Vegas showed how users of Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) services were tricked into using virtual machines that could have included “back doors” for snooping. Another criticised Amazon and Microsoft for relying on insecure methods for granting access to their sites after users claimed to have forgotten their passwords.The findings follow the embarrassing theft of Twitter corporate documents from Google’s cloud applications a week earlier. Although experts faulted Twitter’s policies in that case, they said the break-in might not have occurred if the start-up had kept its files at its own headquarters.Taken together, the developments help illustrate why off-site computing power, data storage and software have not matured to the level that the largest potential clients would require.“The security of these cloud-based infrastructure services is like Windows in 1999,” said John Pescatore, Gartner security analyst. “It’s being widely used and nothing tremendously bad has happened yet. But it’s just in early stages of getting exposed to the internet, and you know bad things are coming.”Mr Pescatore predicted that at least until 2013, companies would spend more money on in-house virtualisation, in which software can run several times on the same machines, than on outsourcing their computing functions. By then, cloud computing companies will have to not only be more secure, but prove that they are.The problem is that many of the companies offering to host, analyse and process information remotely have business models developed to deal with consumers, not other businesses. Most such firms either cannot or will not make millions of users jump through hoops, for example when they have lost their passwords.Some free e-mail services or social networking sites just send passwords to an alternate electronic address, which could be hacked, or ask security questions the answers for which are on the victims’ Facebook or MySpace pages. Birthdates can be gleaned from such places as Amazon wishlists.Amazon’s EC2 and Microsoft’s online version of Office have similarly lax password-recovery systems, researchers said. Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.
● As smartphones proliferate, hackers too are investing more time into methods for breaking into them. A number of new techniques were detailed at the Black Hat conference. One would have allowed outsiders to take control of Apple’s iPhone through a series of SMS messages containing binary code. The researcher who developed the attack method warned Apple weeks before the presentation, and on Friday Apple set its iTunes store to automatically update phones with a patch to stop that threat.The broader issue is that people trust communications to their phones more than e-mails to their computers – that trust is now being exploited to an increasing degree."
320;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-19T19:20:06Z;Nokia suffers fault with flagship smartphone;;Nokia said it has had to fix a fault on its new flagship smartphone, the N8, which was supposed to kick-start the Finnish group’s fightback against Apple’s iPhone and other rival devices.The world’s biggest mobile phone maker said the power problem had so far affected only a “small number” of devices.Nokia is not alone in experiencing faults with complex new smartphones. Apple’s latest iPhone was hit by antenna problems and the launch of Sony-Ericsson’s Satio device last year was marred by software bugs.However, the N8 is under particularly close scrutiny because of its importance to Nokia’s drive to win back lost ground in the lucrative smartphone market.Nokia’s failure to respond to rivals in the smartphone market saw Stephen Elop replace Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo as chief executive two months ago.Niklas Savander, Nokia’s head of marketing, said a small number of N8 users had reported that the phone switched itself off and could not be switched on again. He blamed the problem on a production glitch, which had now been resolved.While acknowledging it was a serious fault for those affected, he insisted the numbers involved were limited and that most customer feedback was positive.Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner, the telecoms consultancy, said it appeared to be a relatively minor setback for Nokia but cautioned that the jury was still out on the N8, which was released last month after a series of delays.She said sales had been patchy, with strong demand in some markets, such as France, but a more lack-lustre response in the UK.Nokia is the world’s top smartphone maker, but its market share slipped from 44.6 per cent to 36.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2010, according to Gartner.Most of the ground was lost to devices using Google’s Android operating system, whose market share has increased from 3.5 per cent to more than 25 per cent in the past year.Critics have highlighted shortcomings in Nokia’s Symbian software compared with rival platforms as one of the main reasons for its struggle to compete at the top of the market, where margins are greatest.Software operating systems have become increasingly important as mobile phones have evolved into multimedia devices.
321;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-14T17:57:43Z;Acer targets mainland China PC market;Taiwanese company taps Founder’s domestic network;When Acer announced a partnership in China with local PC maker Founder in May, it attracted little attention. Both companies are also-rans in this market. Lenovo is far ahead of everyone else accounting for 30 per cent of all shipments. HP and Dell are the only other players with a sizeable share.But the Chinese PC market, expected to become the largest in the world by unit shipments next year at latest, could be in for a shake-up as Acer is getting ready to pounce.Over the past half year, the Taiwanese company has begun to reorganise its China business, tapping Founder’s extensive retail and distribution network. Analysts believe the restructuring will place the world’s second-largest PC maker in the top ranks in this market where success has been elusive for more than a decade.Alvin Kwock, head of Asia-Pacific technology hardware at JPMorgan, lists Acer as the top stock for a turnround in 2011 and predicts that Acer’s and Founder’s combined share of the Chinese notebook market will soar from 8.5 per cent this year to 13.8 per cent in 2011 and 16.9 per cent in 2012.For Acer, it is high time that happened. While the company outgrew the global PC industry for the past 10 years, it tried – and failed – twice to get China right.First, the company tried to treat China like an extended home market, and replicate the model which had helped get it started in Taiwan, by managing its own sales outlets. But since China is so much bigger and more regionally diverse than Taiwan, costs quickly exploded, while the company still failed to reach all corners of the market and properly understand consumers’ preferences.In 2005, Acer conceded defeat. It abandoned the idea that its common language and cultural background would give it a special position in China and decided to treat China as just another foreign market. It started relying on large, third-party distributors, a strategy that had catapulted into the top ranks in Western markets.That also failed. In China, electronics retail chains with a national reach account for a much smaller part of the market than in the US as smaller distributors and retails dominate in certain regions. Acer remained confined to China’s largest cities, while Lenovo and even HP and Dell made inroads in smaller towns which are becoming the most dynamic part of the Chinese PC market.As a result, Acer had no more than 3.5 per cent market share in China in the third quarter, according to Gartner. Revenues from the Chinese market accounted for just five per cent of Acer’s global revenues.Acer’s new China offensive and the Founder deal will change all that, say company executives. “Next year, the China contribution [to Acer’s revenues] will be above 10 per cent,” says Gianfranco Lanci, chief executive.Although Founder, one of China’s oldest PC brands, has seen its market share slide and in the third quarter held no more than 6.4 per cent according to Gartner, the company still has one of the most extensive distribution and retail networks. Acer’s deal with Founder gives it access to more than 10,000 shops down to the local level.Some analysts warn that putting this network to productive use will be challenging as Acer needs to integrate its China marketing team with Founder’s without having actually taken over the Chinese company.But signs are encouraging. Lan Ye, Founder’s former chief executive and also a former Lenovo manager, has joined Acer’s payroll as have hundreds of other Founder employees.Late last year, Acer hired a number of executives who had formerly run HP consumer notebook marketing in China. The team is led by Zhang Yonghong, a former HP printer sales head who also earlier worked for Lenovo. Under him, Acer confined its nationwide distribution partners’ role to certain functions such as billing, and took marketing back in its own hands.Many analysts are optimistic about the results because Acer has been so successful in the past in using acquisitions of small PC companies to win market share. In 2007, the company took over Gateway, a deal which also brought it control of Packard Bell and helped it overtake Lenovo and eventually Dell to become the world’s second-largest PC vendor.“Acer has a strong record in making these things work, especially in winning market share while bringing cost down and making operations more efficient,” says Simon Ye, Gartner’s PC analyst in China. “The results from the restructuring should be visible by the third quarter 2011.”
322;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-11T21:01:03Z;Gartner Hype Cycle;;"Q&A with Jackie Fenn, Gartner Fellow and lead analyst on the Emerging Technologies Hype CycleQ. The Gartner Hype Cycle is meant to cut through the hype surrounding emerging technologies in various markets, and understand the potential for those technologies to change the shape or direction of their industry. Based on Gartner’s research, what is the most hyped emerging technology?A: Cloud computing and social media are still hot topics in most companies, but I would have to say that the fastest rising hype is around media tablets, most notably the iPad. We’ve seen the first generation of stylus-based tablets move through the hype cycle, but the iPod and its competitors are triggering a new round of hype and expectations.The user experience, the size and shape, the instant-on and other features are making these devices a paper replacement like no other device has quite managed to before. The initial impact is in media and content consumption, but over time the content creation capabilities will evolve as well. We expect media tablets to bring digital publishing to mainstream status as well as drive disruptions in a broad range of industry processes and business models.One question that inevitably arises with something as compelling as the iPad is, will there be a ‘Trough of Disillusionment,’ or will it be skipped? For this type of consumer-led technology the Trough usually relates to enterprise use – is it secure enough? will I get enough business value to warrant the investment? – before it becomes a part of mainstream business.Q: Are there any other technologies that you would specifically identify as likely to have a significant business impact that executives should monitor?A: There are a couple of technologies that will have wide-ranging impact, subject only to the imaginations of designers and developers.The first is augmented reality, which is the overlay of digital information on a person’s view of the physical world. Traditionally this has been delivered in a heads-up display, but today’s smart phones are emerging as a platform to deliver this type of context-specific information using location, direction and other sensors.Image recognition through the phone’s camera adds another rich set of capabilities, such as overlaying reviews or instructions on top of a product that the camera is pointing at, or superimposing clothes or accessories on a video stream of the user.These applications are being delivered on top of open platforms that make the contextual information from the phone available to the applications, so we will see an explosion of creativity akin to app stores over the next couple of years. And once the media tablets get cameras too, they will also offer a great platform for augmented reality.A second highly significant technology is 3D printing, or digital fabrication. This technology takes a computer design and creates a physical model of it. What is disruptive is the price point of the latest techniques – the machines cost about $10,000 (instead of about $200,000 for the previous generation of machines that were used to create prototypes in manufacturing).Progress centers around expanding the range of materials that can be used in a single-step process – already the 3D printers can create full color, highly detailed model out of powder and colored binders, or simpler but functional plastic objects. This is driving a broad range of applications in architectural design, art, toys, furniture and even medicine and dentistry. The impact to logistics and transportation is huge – instead of shipping a spare part, you could send the design electronically and print the part locally.Q. Should business leaders ignore those emerging technologies that are in the ‘trough of disillusionment’?A: Definitely not. In fact, this can be an opportunity to progress in “stealth” mode while the technology is out of fashion. For example, companies may be able to buy the technology cheaply (or even acquire a relevant technology company), hire staff who have gained some early experience and explore opportunities without the intense market pressure of the peak.There may certainly be challenges to overcome in areas such as performance, integration, user adoption and predictable return on investment so, as with any early-stage adoption, you need to phase your investment through evaluations and trials.Even if a re-evaluation shows that now is not the right time to progress with a technology, it is important to “bank” the lessons that you have learned. One good practice is to identify the current obstacle – for example price or performance – and return regularly (for example once a year) to examine briefly whether the technology has passed the threshold.With this approach, you are more likely to catch a technology as it starts its journey up the slope of enlightenment. Unlike the peak and the trough, which are major turns, the start of the slope can otherwise be subtle and hard to spot.Jackie Fenn, vice president and Gartner Fellow, is the author of “Mastering the Hype Cycle; How to choose the right innovation at the right time”, published by Harvard Business Press.

323;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-11T19:02:54Z;Smartphones in hacking risk;;Certain smartphone models running Google’s Android operating system have security flaws that could allow hackers to steal personal information or record conversations, researchers said this week.In a demonstration at the Black Hat security conference in Abu Dhabi, a UK researcher showed how a vulnerability in the web browser on an HTC Android phone allowed him to install an application that gave him broad control over the phone.Another method of attack is to get a user to install a seemingly harmless application, which can then be used to access data. The researcher from MWR InfoSecurity showed that the application could re-install itself with greater privileges and give a hacker broad powers, including recording.The Black Hat presentation was the latest in a series of findings in the past two weeks raising concerns about the security of Android phones, which have overtaken those made by Apple to claim 25 per cent of the global market in the third quarter, according to Gartner.Another team presented a similar scenario at a security conference in Oregon, using what appeared to be an innocuous application for a popular game – Angry Birds – that in turn installed malicious programs.“We’ve begun rolling out a fix for this issue, which will apply to all Android devices,” Google said.“As always, we advise users to only install applications they trust.”While there have been few reports of criminals using such techniques yet, experts said it was only a matter of time.Some of the demonstration code produced by researchers is circulating, while a recent analysis of the Android kernel – the core of the operating system – turned up scores of critical bugs, as first reported by the Financial Times.Most of the attack techniques that have been made public, including those shown at Black Hat, do not work on the latest edition of Android, called version 2.2.The MWR researcher, a browser expert who uses only the first name Nils, agreed that Google could easily fix the holes he used to break into Android.But he said that Google’s fragmented model of distribution, which includes multiple handset manufacturers and many carriers, means that some owners of older Android phones will remain exposed for an extended period.
324;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-10T16:32:48Z;Android eats into Nokia’s smartphone lead;;Sales of mobile phones operating on Google’s Android system are threatening Nokia’s lead in the highly lucrative smartphone sector, just as the Finnish handset maker is feeling pressure at the other end of the market from low-cost Asian rivals.More than a quarter of the smartphones sold globally in the third quarter of 2010 ran on the Android operating platform compared with 3.5 per cent a year ago, according to new figures from research firm Gartner. Nokia, which runs on Symbian, saw its share of the market slip from 44.6 to 36.6 per cent over the same period.The results highlight how the adoption of Google’s open source platform by more than a dozen manufacturers including Samsung and HTC, as well as strong demand for Apple’s iPhone, is making it harder for Nokia to retain its lead.About a fifth of the handsets sold globally were high-margin smartphones, which offer a range of multimedia services.“We’ve been very bullish on Android,” said Carolina Milanesi, research vice-president at Gartner. “For me, the story is about Samsung and how when you have a heavyweight supplier, you see how quickly volume grows.”Apple, which ranks third in the smartphone market after being overtaken by Android-operated phones in the last quarter, saw a slight dip in its market share though overall unit sales rose.All of the big players are seeing their overall global market share of the handset market eroded at the low end by a growing army of non-branded or copycat manufacturers.These “white-box” manufacturers– which largely operate out of China and other parts of Asia – buy ready-made chipsets and then package their low-cost phones for sale to emerging markets. Some of the bigger players operate legally but many more garage-style operations shift their goods to India, Africa and Latin America without licences or proper identifying codes.Gartner said that global sales of handsets rose 35 per cent in the third quarter to 417m units. However, a third of the devices sold were made by companies that were not among the major players – many of whom were white-box manufacturers.Ms Milanesi said that the massive jump in shipments from non-branded and copycat phone groups was “having a profound effect on the top five mobile handset manufacturers’ combined share”.Nokia’s overall share of the global market fell from 36.7 to 28.2 per cent in the third quarter, its lowest level since 1999. Samsung’s share dropped from 19.6 to 17.2 per cent, while third-ranked LG declined from 10.3 to 6.6 per cent.On the back of growth in white-box sales, Gartner is now predicting a 30 per cent rise in overall handset sales for the year.The research firm also said it expects the expansion of Apple’s iOS platform to the iPad tablet would help the US group grab more market share.
325;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-08T15:58:33Z;Strategic planning: Look hard and social media may yield good ideas;;In a recent report Gartner, a research firm, identified at least 100m websites and social media services, used by more than 600m people worldwide.These consumers “are influencing each other’s behavior and buying activities, all outside the traditional reach of enterprise activities”, says the paper.Over the past few years, the number of consumers using blogs, online discussion groups and social media sites has exploded.Facebook alone claims 550m users worldwide. At the start of this year, Twitter, another popular social media site, claimed 75m.The sheer scale and scope of online services dwarfs even the largest businesses’ own databases. Tesco, the retail group that did much to blaze a trail for analysis of customer data, has 13m active members of its Clubcard loyalty scheme in the UK.Companies such as Tesco have successfully used information from their own databases to improve sales. But the opportunity to mine the wider internet for strategic information, as well as information on competitors, is that much greater.“You can use these networks to get some extremely insightful and rapid information from consumers,” says Gary Curtis, co-head of Accenture Technology Consulting. Social media and websites also give companies the chance to look for business insights among much larger groups of consumers than they could access through conventional market research, he suggests.Companies ranging from grocers to consumer electronics manufacturers and airlines and hotel groups are already using sophisticated tools to research what customers are saying about their brands online.“Especially in consumer products, it is becoming very important to engage with communities of interest, as that will have an impact on the decisions a company will make,” says Chris Steel, head of the North American IT practice at PA Consulting. “[Social media and the web] is not something organisations can afford to ignore.”By monitoring trends on sites such as Twitter, as well as comments on popular blogs, companies are using software to carry out “sentiment analysis” around their brands. This, for example, can give managers an early warning of a customer service issue, or even that a competitor has come to market with a more attractive offering.These tactical insights are valuable to businesses, because they can often provide quicker feedback than conventional data sources, such as customer service records or point of sale systems. By the time a business notices a fall-off in sales from its back office systems, the customer has already moved on.Scanning the internet and social media gives businesses a way to pre-empt problems, as well as to generate more positive feedback, for example by directing dissatisfied customers towards a service site, or by promoting special offers. But this is largely a tactical response to day-to-day problems, rather than an attempt to influence strategic direction.“Strategy is the hard part,” says Jeff Mann, research vice-president for collaboration and social software at Gartner. “But there are examples. What you are looking for are the weak signals. You are looking for things going on that may be more important in a couple of years time.”Car companies, suggests Mr Mann, are starting to use the internet and social media to look at factors such as consumer attitudes towards green technology.Given the relatively long development cycles for automotive technologies, manufacturers want to gauge the views of today’s college students, as these will be their core customers in 10 or 15 years’ time.In groceries, retailers and producers of vegetarian ingredients might scan recipe sites for new vegetarian dish ideas, in order to predict demand. Conventional business analytics tools cannot provide that depth of insight.“One of the biggest advantages [of social networks] is input from people you don’t know about yet,” adds Mr Mann. “Software such as ERP – enterprise resource planning – is really good rear-view mirror stuff. It gives you an idea of what the customer base is thinking of, but there are a lot more people who are not customers.”Gaining access to this group should give businesses ideas that go beyond their current products or services. “Social media contains deliberately chaotic sources of information,” says Andy Mulholland, chief technology officer at Capgemini, an IT consultancy. “Social media give genuinely chaotic results, but that also opens up genuinely new ideas.”Often, the reaction to new ideas can be highly polarised on internet sites or social media services, but Mr Mulholland does not believe that should deter businesses. “You need to distinguish between people who say they don’t like your product, but have not tried it, and those who have a reason for their dislike.”Sifting through data for weak signals or subtle sentiments is not an easy task.Although there is a growing market for tools that monitor social media, these typically look for key words or particular phrases associated with consumer sentiment. Turning that type of information into strategic insights still requires a large amount of skilled, human analysis.Companies should also consider the context of information they find, especially in social media sites.Although, as Mr Curtis points out, businesses that do use social media often find customer feedback is less negative than they feared, by no means all websites are representative of public opinion.“No successful business will bet the house on the first piece of analysis [from these sources],” agrees John Bastone, who is responsible for social media tools at SAS Institute, a software vendor. “The right way to do this is to test, and learn.”
326;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-08T15:58:33Z;Board can struggle with data puzzle;;Like the companies they run, most corporate executives and senior manages have seen their roles in the business altered, if not transformed, by IT over the past few decades.In many companies, the chief executive and leaders of core business functions such as finance, human resources, sales and marketing and sometimes the chief information officer, meet regularly as an executive board.But, as Gartner consultants point out, that does not always mean they pull together as a team on issues including the use and deployment of technology.Many factors can affect what Gartner calls “the dynamics across the table”. For example, only about 38 per cent of CIOs report directly to the chief executive.“There is more than one successful model for an enterprise,” says Val Sribar of Gartner, “but we have generally seen a maturation process of the dynamics across the table.”Initially he says, individual business leaders tend to think in “silo terms” but then business function leaders start to pair up or organise themselves into small groups and work across silos. “The most advanced organisations really do have a set of things that are done collaboratively all the way round the table.” Often they are spurred on by a chief executive with a wider vision.Among the more common pairings are the head of sales and the marketing manager who co-operate to achieve a particular objective, for example to ensure that marketing does a better job handling leads to sales.Similarly, there is often a natural affinity between the head of procurement and the chief financial officer who want to know what money is being spent on and who the biggest suppliers are, or between the head of customer service and either the heads of sales or marketing or maybe all three.Liz Miller, a vice-president of the US-based CMO (chief marketing officer) Council, adds that another natural pairing is between the chief marketing officer and the CIO. “There is a great opportunity for companies to increase revenue if CMOs and CIOs partner using digital marketing to improve their focus on the customer,” she says.The Gartner consultants have identified three specific scenarios that can help drive co-operation between business leaders.First, the introduction of a product or service. This can sometimes drive sales, marketing and the head of manufacturing to work together to get a product to market. Second, mergers and acquisitions often spur co-operation as does the decision to enter a market.“If a company makes the decision to go into a new geographic market like China, the whole of the top table really needs to be on the same page,” says Mr Sribar.Another way of looking at the development of an organisation and the relationships of the senior management team is to look at the use of information and how they make decisions.Initially each business function leader turns up at the executive meeting with their own set of spreadsheets and anecdotes, and 90 per cent of the time at the table is spent arguing over who has the most accurate set of numbers or the more compelling set of anecdotes.“They literally fight about what the real information is,” says Mr Sribar.At the next level of maturity, the executive board agrees one executive should be responsible for collecting each data set, for example sales or customer information.“Then, instead of 90 per cent of the conversation at the executive level being a fight about what the information is and which anecdote is valid, it moves on to a discussion about what the information says.”After that, the executive board typically begins to spend more time discussing what they are going to do with the information and then assessing whether their actions worked. “The use of technology is very different depending on what level of maturity the company is at,” says Mr Sribar.“At the top level companies are trying to be more predictive …they are not just trying to be smarter about how they deal with information and make decisions, but they actually want to drive the changes and outcomes.”But the consultants also warn, “business leaders really struggle when it comes to connecting the information side of the puzzle and things like decision making with the profit side of the puzzle and things like outcomes.”One of the problems facing business leaders is that the information systems installed over the past 30 years have led to a “data deluge.” To help them sift through this data, IT departments have introduced another layer of technology usually under the banner of “BI” or business intelligence over the past 15 or 20 years.“What you see is business leaders in meetings holding some of these spreadsheets and reports up to the light and saying ‘I wish we could see the patterns in this stuff’’,” says Gartner. “All of these guys would like to have a better forward looking view and be able to predict what is going to happen both in their own functions and across the table.”Gartner also argues “dynamics across the table” lead to strikingly different ways of getting value from technology. For example, most executives want to reduce costs by adding self- service capabilities for employees and by creating communities where customers help each other – a move they say enables companies to effectively “add people to customer support without paying a dime.”Alexander Drobik of Gartner argues companies have also shifted their IT focus over time. “IT used to be very much aimed at efficiency, reducing costs, accelerating processes and taking people out. What has happened in the past five to 10 years is that technology has moved into front office functions – the things that impact HR, finance, sales and marketing and so on.”Today he says business leaders are trying to understand how IT can take further costs out, but they also want to use information they have access to, and the technologies that they and their customers and suppliers have, to run their functions more effectively.A lot of IT in the past 30 years has been about efficiency gains, but suddenly business leaders see a new set of IT capabilities becoming available that enable them to become more effective.For example the HR director can now use IT systems not just for benefits and payroll, but for talent management and recruitment. “You see this duality between efficiency and effectiveness for everyone around the table,” says Mr Drobik.But he also has a warning for CIOs who talk technology rather than business strategy.“CEOs care very little about the ‘cloud’ or virtualisation or web 2.0 …its not a message they understand. They want to understand what technology is available that could help them run their business in a more effective way.“To a CEO, the cloud is something the CIO should sort out and figure out how it can help.“CEOs don’t generally wake up in the morning and say, ‘I have a problem retaining customers, so must go cloud.’ They will say, ‘I have a big problem retaining customers, what do I know about why customers are leaving? What analytics do I have and what is my marketing guy doing for me?’”For many business leaders, IT remains a mysterious “black box”.But what everyone agrees on, is that business functions and IT are now totally intertwined and that IT vendors and CIOs need to step up to the new challenges.
327;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-05T19:59:34Z;Google block on Facebook heats up war;;Google has blocked Facebook from “scraping” some types of data from its servers, setting off a telling skirmish in the broader war between the two internet powers that many observers believe will shape the next phase of the web.The new bar ends Facebook’s automated access to lists of contacts kept by Google’s Gmail users, considered valuable data as Facebook seeks to expand the “social graph” of connections it maintains for its own 550m users.Until now, Facebook has been able to offer anyone setting up a new account the option to import their contact lists automatically from web e-mail services like Gmail, Microsoft’s Hotmail and Yahoo Mail.Those lists have provided a quick way to build a network of social connections on Facebook.On Friday, Google said it had changed its rules to block Facebook’s computers from tapping into its own systems to carry out this function.The move had been prompted by Facebook’s refusal to offer a reciprocal service, it added.The contact information to which Google seeks access was Facebook’s “core asset”, said Ray Valdes, an analyst at Gartner.For a long time, Facebook’s resistance to letting its users download their personal information from the service allowed rivals such as Google to paint it as a restrictive, or “closed”, service, in contrast to their own, more open approach.Last month Facebook changed course and said users could extract all their personal data from the service, although it still does not offer the sort of easy, automated access Google is demanding, and does not let users take the all-important contact information for their friends that would help a service like Google build a rival social network.Google accused Facebook of leaving “users in a data dead end”. To avoid being seen itself as becoming more restrictive, the search company claimed that its fight for reciprocity “will be an important step towards creating a world of true data liberation”.The fight over contact information pointed to a key battle shaping the web’s future, Mr Valdes said. “There are different centres of power and agendas of self-interest on the web, but the fundamental power conflict is emerging between Google and Facebook.”Skirmishes over automated access to data have become more familiar as rivals seek to build walls around the information they consider most valuable. Access is made through connections known as application programming interfaces, or APIs.
328;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-04T21:51:24Z;Arm set to swallow more of tablet PC market;;Warren East, chief executive of Arm, said the market for tablet PCs could grow to as much as 60m unit sales next year as he brushed aside concerns that Intel would pose a major competitive threat to the UK chip company in the fast-growing market.Arm’s chip design powers almost all major tablet PCs, including Apple’s popular iPad device, but the company faces looming competition from Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker.Intel has been pushing to bring its ‘Atom’ processor from netbooks, where they dominate, to tablets and smartphones.Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, told analysts last month that Intel is “going to utilise all of the assets that are at our disposal to win this segment”.Mr East, however, told the Financial Times that while Atom may appear in some tablet models next year “Atom designs are just not good enough in terms of power consumption [right now]. Intel knows this”.Arm has been a strong supporter of tablets as a new category of computing device partly because it has had much more success there than in previous attempts to put its chips inside netbook computers.The relative dearth of tablet models – only Apple, Samsung and Dell have tablets on sale – is set to be remedied by a raft of new devices to be shown at the Consumer Electronics Show at the beginning of next year, Mr East said.He says that tablet sales next year “will be what they will be. They could be anywhere from 30m to 60m [but] probably at the higher end of that range”.Gartner, the research firm, estimates that media tablet sales will reach 54m in 2011, up from 19.5m this year.Mr East admitted that there was still some concern, however, that consumer spending on electronics in the west could weaken over the next few months.But, he said: “You can’t avoid that, it’s like the weather. We’re concerned that it might rain. There are clouds up there. But what we’ve experienced in 2009 was that Arm still outperformed the industry in a down year.”While Arm has made some initial headway into the server market in recent months, Mr East said he did not think that market would be a major contributor to Arm’s revenues within the next five years.“It’s a very low expectation, actually,” he said, citing a need to improve virtualisation software and technical limitations on the current A9 chip.Instead, Mr East sees far greater opportunities for the company in the increasing use of Arm-based microcontrollers in energy related applications, such as those used in solar and wind-energy generation, as well as in electric motors.Semiconductor chips are increasingly used in these areas to improve efficiency, which makes Arm’s chips, which are known for their low power consumption, an attractive solution, said Mr East.
329;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-11-04T19:31:00Z;Samsung targets sales of 1m tablet PCs;;Samsung Electronics, the world’s second-largest mobile phone maker, forecast sales of more than 1m of its first tablet computer by the end of this year, as it revealed plans to launch the device in several sizes to fight Apple’s dominance of the fast-growing segment.Encouraged by the success of Apple’s iPad, which sold 3.3m units in the three months after its launch in April, groups including Research in Motion, Cisco, Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard, LG Electronics and ZTE are preparing their own tablets.However, Samsung’s Galaxy Tab which runs on Google’s Android operating system and has a smaller screen than the iPad, is the only significant challenger to the iPad on the market.The South Korean company began selling the Galaxy Tab in its domestic market on Thursday, after launching it in parts of Europe and south-east Asia in the middle of October. It has a seven-inch screen and weighs 380g, compared with the 730g iPad, which has a 9.7-inch screen.“We are confident of [making] over 1m sales this year as consumer responses in Europe and Asia have been quite good,” said Shin Jong-kyun, president of Samsung’s mobile division.“Various sizes of tablet devices will be launched by many companies next year. To become a market leader, we are preparing various tablets with screens of between seven-inches and 10-inches, and even bigger.”His comments came after Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, took a swipe at competitors to the iPad last month, forecasting that seven-inch tablets would be “dead-on-arrival”, saying the display was too small for high-quality applications.According to research firm Strategy Analytics, Apple controls 95 per cent of the tablet market with 4.2m units sold in the last quarter.Gartner, the research group, forecast tablet sales would more than double in 2011 from an expected 19.5m units this year.
330;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-27T08:25:23Z;Role of the CIO: Chief innovation officers are required;;After last year’s sharp decline in IT spending, there are signs that businesses are once again loosening the purse strings. According to Gartner, the industry research firm, spending on IT by end user businesses fell by 5.2 per cent worldwide in 2009.This year, the firm expects to see a modest return to growth, at 3.3 per cent. But the total business outlay on IT is set to remain below 2008.Total IT spending of $3,300bn – the Gartner figure for 2010 – represents a significant commitment to technology by global businesses. Yet the chief information officers and managers who control those budgets still feel under siege. The reason is that IT costs – and the returns on that investment – are under greater scrutiny than ever before.This is prompting some businesses to question how they buy IT services, and for some IT departments, to question their future.“Departments are feeling bruised,” says Nathan Marke, chief technology officer of 2e2, a UK-based IT services company. “We’ve had to become more savvy about how business spends on IT and more aware of the customer balance sheet. We are seeing demands for a much shorter return on investment, not even within 12 months but often just six months.”But it is not merely a tougher spending environment that is forcing departments to change. Businesses have more choice than ever in how to source technology services.They no longer need to choose just between building and running their own infrastructure or outsourcing it to a large services company.The growth of companies such as Salesforce.com and NetSuite that offer software-as-a-service (SaaS), and the emergence of cloud computing, where companies buy anything from raw IT capacity to complete business services from third parties, creates a range of options.Some industry observers believe cloud computing, in particular, could be as game changing as the personal computer in the 1980s.“Advances such as cloud computing are providing increasing choice and what you can do with that choice is increasing as [business] data is held in the cloud or elsewhere,” says Bryan Cruickshank, KPMG’s head of global IT advisory services.“That is pushing the CIO to have more of a business role. Rather than the supreme technologist who sits on top of an IT delivery organisation, the CIO becomes a broker of services to the business, managing a portfolio of service providers and becomes more of a business person as a result.”In some businesses, the CIO has reacted by broadening his or her role. At British Airways, for example, Paul Coby is also head of services for the airline, a trend he expects other technology-dependent companies to follow. But elsewhere, the CIO is falling back into a more conventional technical role, perhaps reporting to the CFO.“The more technology-minded CIOs are coming back under the CFO but the more forward thinking are being renamed as the chief customer officer or chief innovation or chief transformation officer,” says 2e2’s Mr Marke.The route they take will depend on how critical IT is to a business and its ability to increase competitive advantage, as well as the maturity of the technology base. “The fundamental thing about technology is it enables business. You don’t buy technology for its own sake,” says Mr Marke.Business unit leaders have also been driving the trend to decentralise IT, partially because of the option to buy flexible, easy to set up and apparently cheaper cloud or SaaS technologies and partly because in-house departments are often seen as expensive and unresponsive.“The real danger for CIOs is they lose control of IT, rather than give it up,” explains David Cappuccio, vice-president and chief of research for infrastructure and operations at Gartner. “Clients are looking at the cloud as an alternative to traditional IT, if that IT is not agile or cost effective.”The CIO’s response should be to bring the IT department closer to the business, but also to take a rigorous approach to sourcing technology. The days when the effectiveness – and power – of a CIO is measured by the number of servers they run, or the number of people they employ, are largely over. “IT is about services, not servers,” says Mr Cappuccio.Departments should be looking to the market to provide services, where those services are a commodity. In turn, this allows them to focus expertise and resources on areas of the business that provide differentiation and competitive advantage, says Frank Modruson, CIO at Accenture, the consulting firm.But the IT department should also be the technology advocate for the business and a co-ordinator of external services who ensures that IT functions as a whole.“E-mail, for example, is a piece of infrastructure that is important but not your secret sauce,” says Mr Modruson.“There has to be a very good reason not to buy it in.“What matters is having a good data model, understanding the data you are collecting, and how do you get to one version of the truth. That is the value of IT.”
331;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-27T08:25:23Z;A tricky balancing act: cost, risk and innovation;;As the world economy recovers, albeit unevenly, from what the International Monetary Fund calls “the deepest recession since the second world war,” companies, big and small are looking to information technology to drive the next wave of growth.In western economies in particular, companies sharply cut back employment during the financial crisis and now, with only a modest upturn in domestic demand, most are seeking to consolidate cost savings while they exploit growth opportunities. Peter Sondergaard, senior vice-president of research at Gartner, the IT consultancy, suggests that IT departments face the challenge of balancing four factors in their use of technologies: Cost, value, risk and innovation.While IT departments are still under pressure to deliver process cost savings he adds, “the real focus is about how technology delivers value to the organisation, value defined as either revenue, or if it is a public-sector organisation, by increased service levels to citizens.”If IT is to deliver on this opportunity he argues it must be closely aligned with an organisation’s overall business strategy.Steve Schuckenbrock, president of Dell’s Large Enterprise business agrees: “CEOs, CFOs and CIOs all recognise there is zero separation between business strategy and IT execution today,” he says. “There is pretty much nothing you can do, from cutting costs across your company or growing across a company, without the enablement of IT in one way, shape or form.”But both Mr Sondergaard and Mr Schuckenbrock also recognise that IT budgets are flat or rising only slightly and that departments are going to have to be creative if they are to fund new projects.“IT departments need to become much more efficient and effective within their current constraints,” says Mr Schuckenbrock. “You have this torque in the rope between IT teams’ ability to efficiently execute and deliver a lot more innovation to the business within a strained environment.”One of the ways CIOs and IT departments are delivering innovation is by embracing mobility, including the latest generation of smartphones and slate-style tablets such as Apple’s iPad.Mr Sondergaard describes this trend as, “the extension of technology with wireless technologies and super-intelligent devices at the edge of the universe, whether they are physical devices we carry around, or devices in machines.“This leads to an opportunity that we call ‘context-aware’ computing,” he says. “Once you know the contextual positions – in this case the location, or things like the relationship between one person and another person and the desires of those people when they either meet or are in proximity to something – this allows for the emergence of a large number of business service that will enable companies to increase the value they deliver to customers and to be able to develop product and services.”Mr Schuckenbrock says it does not really matter what device you are talking about, whether it is Dell’s Streak tablet or the various Android, Apple and Microsoft devices that will flood the market over the next couple of years. “It is that the kinds of applications enabled by those devices are going to help businesses become more efficient and effective.”He says Dell is receiving requests from companies and organisations seeking, for example, to take advantage of the camera on a device or the RFID (Radio frequency identification) chip with a mobile device.He also highlights the importance of location-based or GPS information from mobile devices that allows companies to know where their assets or employees are relative to a specific event or transaction.“Those kinds of applications are going to drive an enormous increase in data requirements and server requirements and in data centres, not to mention the application development capacity that will be needed to support and maintain them,” he says.Similarly analysts argue social networking technologies such as Facebook and Twitter are finding their way into companies and becoming engines for growth in their own right.“Instead of social networking being an island supported by the marketing department to extend brand promotion,” Gartner’s Mr Sondergaard predicts that social networking technologies will become embedded not only in the way companies engage with customers, “but also in the way we collaborate and work internally in companies …this is not about Facebook as another application, it is about the concept of collaboration embedded in back office processes.”The integration of social networking and corporate internal processes over the next decade will create the next wave of innovation in IT, he says.But as with mobile applications, the challenge for companies and their IT departments is not just to master these technologies.Rather, says Mr Schuckenbrock, it is, “how do you drive enough efficiency out of what you do to be able to move money to enable those kind of activities that will help businesses grow and drive cost effectiveness?”He believes other technologies, including virtualisation and the shift to cloud-based service delivery, will provide the answer.“When you look at most IT budgets, 75 or 80 per cent of what IT organisations spend their money on is running what they have, and that is not good enough,” he says.He predicts that “everything from a desktop to the biggest of public cloud companies will be virtualised. What does virtualisation mean? It means not just much better utilisation of core hardware assets, but critically it also means better use of your people.”That is because at least half of the 75 to 80 per cent of the budget for an organisation’s IT systems is usually spent on labour. He says virtualisation helps companies get more value from “hard” assets such as facilities, storage and networks, but that it can also help make better use of employees. If you look at the big cloud companies they are often 10 times more efficient than traditional data centres, he notes.So what is different? In a traditional data centre there are decades-worth of technology decisions – proprietary mainframes and infrastructures, multiple databases, storage architectures and relatively little virtualisation – typically about 25 per cent of servers.In contrast, the big cloud-based companies such as Amazon or Google use full-scale virtualisation infrastructure and are designed for optimisation of power and cooling, the way people work, and use of the hardware through virtualisation.“In a traditional data centre you might have one administrator that supports 30 or 40 servers, in the cloud it is one per 3,000,” says Mr Schuckenbrock.“What is happening is that technology is moving at such a pace that we have to help customers absorb it faster. And they need to use that technology in a manner that allows that 75 to 80 per cent number to be more like 40 or 50 per cent and the other 50 per cent will be put to good use in driving new applications that enable the business strategy.”Mr Sondergaard believes chief executives have exaggerated expectations of what IT can deliver at the moment, in part because IT teams are still largely focused on optimisation rather than growth and creating business value.“Information has become the new gold or oil of the 21st century,” he says.“Technology plays a pivotal role not just in increasing operational excellence and the performance of an enterprise, IT will assist in driving the revenue and value of the company.”
332;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-27T08:25:23Z;Financing: Services in the ‘cloud’ offer value and speed;;In an uncertain economic climate, smart chief information officers have always been able to coax a good deal out of their IT suppliers.Today, the rise of cloud computing – where software and infrastructure are offered as hosted, pay-as-you-go services by third-party providers – means that there are more bargains to be had than ever before.That is the view of David Chan, formerly head of business systems at the BBC and CIO at mortgage lender GMAC-RFC, and now director of the Centre for Information Leadership at London’s City University.“The range of options available to today’s corporate customers when it comes to sourcing technology systems and services puts them firmly in the driving seat,” he says.“In particular, the whole concept of consuming IT as a service, paid for on a per-usage basis, is creating a market where there’s lots more competition between vendors and less risk of lock-in to a particular supplier, so customers are able to negotiate on a much more level playing field,” he explains.IT budget holders, it seems, are voting with their cheque books. In a recent survey of 1,587 technology decision-makers across 40 countries, conducted by IT market research company Gartner, 39 per cent said they were allocating IT budget to cloud computing as a key initiative for their organisation.One-third of that cloud spending was carried over from the previous year – but new, incremental spending on cloud computing represented a further third, while 14 per cent was spending diverted from a different budget category in the previous year.“This indicates a shift in spending from traditional IT assets such as the data centre and a move towards assets that are accessed in the cloud,” says Bob Igou, a research director at Gartner.At the heart of that shift is a new way of viewing corporate IT – as a “utility”, similar to electricity or gas paid for out of operating expenditure (opex), rather than as an “asset” that requires substantial upfront investment and is paid for out of capital expenditure (capex).The benefits of cloud computing go beyond immediate budgetary concerns, however.For many organisations, it accelerates innovation, because cloud services can be up and running very quickly, enabling them to tap into new market opportunities at speed.That said, the terms and conditions attached to cloud computing contracts may be very different from those the CIO is accustomed to seeing, warns Roger Bickerstaff, joint head of the IT Sector Group at law firm Bird & Bird.“The message that I try to give to clients is that, with traditional outsourcing arrangements, the service being offered is usually customer-specific and so is the contractual protection, with strong service levels, robust warranties and high limits of (supplier) liability,” he says.“With the move to the cloud, companies are typically buying into an arrangement that is much more general, because the provider is able to offer lower prices on the basis that it’s offering the same service to many different customers. As a result, it’s far more difficult for customers to negotiate the terms and conditions.”For many organisations, then, loose contract terms can make cloud computing an uncomfortable fit with mission-critical systems, regulated personal data and sensitive intellectual property.But other options exist for companies that do not have the resources or inclination to draw on “capex” to make IT investments.Just like company buildings, vehicles or furniture, technology infrastructure can be leased.Leasing is still a hugely popular option for corporate IT: in 2009, more than $100bn of IT equipment, software, and services was leased or financed – where a loan is made to buy equipment and paid back in instalments – worldwide, according to IT market analyst firm IDC.In the US, Japan, and big European Union countries, say IDC’s analysts, between 14 per cent and 18 per cent of all IT equipment involves some type of leasing or financing arrangement.But while leasing solves the problem of systems and data residing outside the customer’s data centre, “in the cloud”, it comes with its own challenges.Most notably, the customer is typically still responsible for the day-to-day management of leased equipment, whereas in most cloud computing contracts, the provider shoulders that risk in its entirety.As a result, leasing does not offer the same benefits of low management overheads that are associated with cloud computing.That may explain why users in a 2009 IDC survey rated cloud computing as their top alternative to traditional leasing, more popular even than traditional outsourcing agreements.And it is a trend that seems set to continue, in part because most of the largest infrastructure vendors offer both leasing and cloud options and the distinctions between the two are rapidly blurring.Either way, the old way of buying IT – provisioning a server, buying software licences to run on it and decommissioning it when it reaches the end of its life – increasingly looks slow, inefficient and, above all, costly.
333;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-26T21:30:35Z;Arm looks to cash in on tablet market;;Arm, whose chip designs are used in Apple’s iPad and iPhone, is expecting to benefit from growing demand for tablet computers.Speaking as the group revealed third-quarter results, Warren East, chief executive, said Arm was “excited” that this year’s launch of the iPad had opened up a new market for tablet computers.The group – which licenses its low-powered chip designs to semiconductor manufacturers and then collects royalty payments – said that new tablets from Dell, Research in Motion and Samsung Electronics would all contain its semiconductor designs.Last week Gartner, the research group, said it expected tablet sales to more than double in 2011 from an expected 19.5m units this year, and surpass 208m units in 2014 as rival technology groups launch tablet products.Arm creates the architecture for chips found in more than 90 per cent of mobile phones sold globally. The group has benefited from growing consumer demand for smartphones, which use more of its chips per handset than standard low-end phones.Arm’s chip designs are also being used increasingly in digital cameras, televisions, microcontrollers, printers and washing machines.Mr East said the increasing “consumerisation of the internet” was encouraging companies to look at adopting more energy-efficient server technology and to move into cloud computing, in which digital information is housed remotely on centralised servers rather than on users’ computers.He said Arm’s chip architecture would be used in the next generation of more energy-efficient servers that are due to hit the market in four or five years.Arm, which reported pre-tax profit of £19.6m for the three months to September, compared with £7.7m in the same period last year, on revenues up 34 per cent to £100.4m, said that 1.5bn of its processor chips were shipped during the quarter. The group expects to exceed consensus revenue forecasts for the fourth quarter of about $158m.The results failed to cheer investors, however, and the shares, which have more than doubled this year on takeover rumours, fell 23p to 366.2p.Mark Davis, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said that Arm’s “punchy” multiples were partly to blame for the share price fall. Consensus forecasts put Arm on 42 times earnings for this year and 38 times for next year.He said the long-term outlook was very promising, given that Arm stands to benefit from the push towards using low-powered chips in servers.“But in the short term there is still some concern in the consumer market over what the impact of austerity measures will be,” said Mr Davis. “Is Christmas going to be good? The royalty levels [Arm receives] are based on the number of products that are shifted.”
334;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-21T18:59:33Z;Ballmer dismisses Goldman’s ‘nutty’ idea;;Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer was in fine (fighting) form on stage at the annual Gartner Symposium in Orlando today, punching his hands for emphasis and positively bristling at the suggestion that Microsoft should split its consumer and corporate businesses.He described a recent Goldman Sachs idea to spin-out the consumer unit as “nutty” and “the second most crazy idea I have ever heard.” Unfortunately he did not tell his audience of about 5,000 senior IT executive what was the craziest.Mr Ballmer was pressed hard on whether it was possible to serve two masters – the consumer and the company IT department – but insisted that it made no sense to think of Windows users as two distinct groups. Much of the discussion, however, focused on Microsoft’s latest attempt to halt its slumping share of the booming smartphone market with Windows Phone 7.Despite the apparent skepticism of his interviewers – two senior Gartner analysts – and the ignominious recent failure of its ‘Kin’ handset, Mr Ballmer insisted that Windows Phone 7 would be Microsoft’s next $1bn business, though he did concede that new security and other features were needed to enhance its appeal to corporate users.Tablets in general, and the iPad in particular, have been a hot topic at the Gartner event this week but Mr Ballmer appeared evasive when it came to discussing Microsoft’s tablet strategy. “I’m not giving any specifics today at the Gartner conference,” he said adding, “If you push me too hard I may do it tomorrow at a Forrester conference. ”He did, however, confirm that there will be some Windows-powered tablets available by the holiday season but hinted that Microsoft’s big push into this increasingly competitive market is not likely to happen before the launch of Intel’s new OakTrail processor early next year. The key, he said, is long battery life and added, “we need help with both the hardware and software.”Mr Ballmer was also asked about the recent departure of the company’s chief software architect, Ray Ozzie. Unsurprisingly, he insisted it would have zero effect on the company’s cloud strategy. “We’ve taken a strategic direction anchored in the cloud,” he said. “That vision is our company strategy. It doesn’t live in any one head or mind.”As for his own future he added, “I’ve got a lot of energy and passion for what I’m doing. “If I ever thought there was a day when the company would be better off without me, I’d leave that day.” Given Microsoft’s recent share price performance, some investors may hope he runs out of energy sooner rather than later.
335;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-20T23:22:18Z;Apple’s iPhone and iPad apps move to Mac;;Having succeeded in making phones more like computers, Apple is now trying to make its computers more like phones.The company on Wednesday brought its free video calling service from the iPhone and iPod touch to Mac computers and said a version of the App Store would come to its home and mobile computer lines within three months.“Bringing some of these things back to the Mac is really going to delight Mac users,” Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, said during demonstrations at Apple headquarters. He said other aspects familiar to iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners would come next summer with the next version of the Mac OS X operating system, such as the ability to flick from one screen to another.Mr Jobs described the new features as a cross between the existing Mac operating system and iOS, the software that powers Apple’s gadgets. There are limits to the combination, though, and touch gestures will remain confined to the large pad on the Mac keyboard instead of migrating to the screen.Still, the enhancements could help lift Mac sales. Helped in part by the sale of iPhones, Mac shipments are already growing twice as fast as the overall PC market. But in the latest quarter, Apple sold more than 14m iPhones and 4.2m iPad tablets, compared with 3.9m Macs.In a related announcement on Wednesday, Apple released two new models of light notebook Macs using only Flash storage, which means they will start up almost as quickly as phones.“‘Instant on’ is incredibly valuable to people. It avoids an awful lot of frustration,” said Gartner analyst Van Baker.Other analysts agreed that computers will begin to resemble smartphones. “The next wave of PC design will be inspired by mobile devices,” said Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps. “This isn’t just about apps, it’s also about the experience of using the device.”It remains to be seen how well Apple will execute the other ideas in the forthcoming “Lion” version of Mac OS X and how well other manufacturers can move the best of the gadget world to desktop and notebooks.Most computer-makers rely on Microsoft and so have limited options. Hewlett-Packard has a backup in WebOS, the operating system it acquired when it bought Palm, and could bring that to regular computers as well as a promised tablet.In the meantime, the video calling service Facetime and a Mac version of the App Store are easy wins for Apple.Apple already has more than 160m credit card numbers from iTunes and the App Store, so buying there will be easy. Apple keeps 30 per cent of sales by programme developers.“Instead of driving to the Apple store or Best Buy, all you have to do is press a button,” Mr Baker said. “The only people who lose are online software resellers and retailers.”Some apps designed for iOS devices will work well on the Mac, Mr Jobs said.
336;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-18T22:21:59Z;Global IT spending expected to rise;;Global corporate IT spending will increase by 3.1 per cent to $2,500bn next year, fuelled by strong growth in emerging economies. This will offset lackluster spending in more developed nations, according to Gartner, the IT consultancy.In the current year, worldwide corporate IT spending is on track to total $2,400bn, a 2.4 per cent increase from 2009, Gartner said but warned that the next five years will represent, “a period of timid and at times lackluster growth with spending increasing to just $2,800bn in 2014.”Peter Sondergaard, senior vice president at Gartner and global head of research, presented the latest IT industry spending outlook to an audience of more than 7,000 IT leaders at Gartner Symposium/ITxpo, taking place in Orlando, Florida this week.“Several key vertical industries, such as manufacturing and financial services will not see IT budgets recover to pre-2008 levels before 2012 or 2013,” Mr. Sondergaard said. ”Emerging economies continue to be the locomotive of enterprise IT spending, substantially outpacing developed economies.”Nevertheless Mr Sondergaard predicted that IT spending will continue to transform businesses, launch new industries and help drive the global economy. “The transformation in IT spending will accelerate individual corporate change,” Mr. Sondergaard said. “We are on a one way trip towards the IT driven intelligence society – driven by the consumer – where growing access to this growing universe of data gives us the opportunity to not only make better decisions, but to make smarter decisions.”Improvements in IT access and skills can, directly or indirectly, contribute to individual welfare, increase national productivity and output and improve productivity. A broad range of socio-economic benefits are also apparent, including better educational performance and other developmental goals.“At the heart of the change, the next 20 years will be intelligence drawn from information,” Mr. Sondergaard said. “Information will be the ‘oil of the 21st century’. It will be the resource running our economy in ways not possible in the past.”
337;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-15T22:57:45Z;Corporate IT faces new challenges;;Corporate IT departments must face up to changes with implications as far-reaching as the arrival of the personal computer or the commercialisation of the internet in the 1990s, according to Gartner, the IT consultancy.This will be one of the core messages delivered to over 5,700 company chief information officers who are expected to attend Gartner’s annual symposium, which kicks off in Orlando, Florida, on Monday.Peter Sondergaard, senior vice president of research at Gartner, who will deliver the symposium’s opening keynote, argued that over the next five to 10 years, the confluence of four key trends that Gartner has identified will lead to a new IT cycle with enormous repercussions for companies, their customers and partners.“I believe these trends are, in combination, as substantial as when we, 15 years ago, sat and questioned whether the internet would be used for anything, or when 25 years ago we questioned whether PCs – and therefore an intelligent device in the hands of the office user – was of any value,” he said.The background to these changes, he suggested, is an environment of flat IT budgets where the focus of IT organisations must balance four things in their use of technologies: cost, value, risk and innovation.Because of the continuing need for cost-optimisation, company IT departments will mostly have to find the funds for new projects from within existing budgets. At the same time, however, Mr Sondergaard suggested that the real focus within many companies has switched to how IT delivers value to the organisation, with value defined by either revenue or, if it is a public-sector organisation, by increased service levels to citizens.IT organisations are also going to have to assume that there is no difference between IT risk and business risk. “The traditional mentality of IT, which is risk reduction in everything you do, is something that will shift towards an acceptable level of risk in projects that are IT-related and the capability of IT to support the reduction of business risk with technology,” Mr Sondergaard said.But he also predicted that innovation will continue to play an important role for the IT organisation “as we run into this somewhat lopsided investment cycle”.“Every IT organisation is faced with having to balance these four components,” he said, but added that each company is in a different cycle, so there is no specific prognosis for what a specific IT organisation needs to do.“There is a large difference between what different organisations do even within a specific industry. For example, in pharmaceuticals, you can have one CIO who is massively focused on cost optimisation because the business finds itself beyond the ‘patent cliff’, and has to deal with generics and a competitive environment, and another CIO in the same industry with patents running out in 7 or 9 years is focused very much on how IT supports innovation, not just innovation to support R&D, but innovation within the organisation at large.” This, he said, is the new reality of IT.Against this background Gartner has identified four key trends: “The first is that we are commencing a transformation of IT towards elastic, scalable IT services based on a business model that is continuously chargeable and uses internet technologies, popularly called ‘the cloud’.”The cloud is not only a transformation of how the IT organisation delivers IT, said Mr Sondergaard, “it is in essence a different way of developing how you do business long-term.” In the short term, he said, in some instances it is about making IT more efficient and therefore supports the optimisation cycle that companies need to embark upon in order to be able to reinvest what they are doing in value-enhancing IT projects or projects that drive business value.The second major trend identified by Gartner is what Mr Sondergaard called “the extension of technology with wireless technologies and super-intelligent devices at the edge of the universe, whether they are physical devices that we humans carry around, or devices in machines”.“This leads to an opportunity that we call ‘context-aware’ computing,” he said. “Once you know the contextual positions – in this case the location, or things like the relationship between one person and another person and the desires of those people when they either meet or are in proximity to something – this allows for the emergence of a large number of business service that will enable companies to massively scale the value they deliver to customers and to be able to develop new product and services.“The context-aware computing infrastructure is what we have built over the last decade and is enabled now through the next wave of what I would call super-smart devices at the edge of the universe instead of having the super smart devices at the center.”Third, Gartner argued that over the last couple of years the “consumerisation of IT” has led to “social-networking technologies being a pivotal part of the consumer’s life”. The next step is the business usage of social networks and technologies associated with them and the development of information services and software tools that take advantage of them.Instead of social networking being an island that is supported by the marketing department to extend brand promotion, Mr Sondergaard predicted that social-networking technologies will become embedded not only in the way companies engage with customers, “but also in the way we collaborate and work internally in companies …this is not about Facebook as another application, it is about the concept of collaboration embedded inside back office processes.” The integration of social networking and corporate internal processes over the next decade will create the next innovation in IT, he said.The fourth trend that will be highlighted by Gartner during the symposium is the emergence of what Gartner dubbed “pattern-based strategy”.“There is a growing recognition that information about what we did in the past is not sufficient to drive decision processes in an organisation, and what is really important is the capability of detecting patterns using technology prior to human beings seeing the patterns, or detecting deviations from patterns that allow you to take decisions that are valuable to the customer, the business or the associate. This is what we call pattern-based strategy and it is a step further than analytics or what IBM would call ‘predictive analytics.’”Mr Sondergaard argues that what is really most exciting is that these four trends are interrelated. Together he believes they will enable businesses to take business decisions based on future patterns and deliver services in “a continuously chargeable manner through the cloud.”“I think there will be an enormous amount of disruption caused by these trends, and I think that in the intersection of the four is the capability to see the next Facebook, the next Google, the next Microsoft, because what you have is something that, first and foremost extends the reach of IT, and every cycle is about the next extension of reach.”In this case he argued that the extension is primarily the result of the deployment of mobile networks that connect both physical devices and human beings. But in addition, he noted, it is also something that is fundable because there is money available for projects that support a business trend: “the need to understand more about your customer and to accelerate economic growth”.
338;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-15T20:53:05Z;US tech stocks climb on Google results;;A peek into Google’s YouTube and other new businesses sparked sharp gains for technology groups, the best performing sector on the week.In addition to reporting expectation-beating earnings, Google said in a one-time announcement that non-text display advertisements, such as those on YouTube and mobile phones, would generate $2.5bn in sales in 2010, which impressed analysts.JPMorgan Chase said YouTube represented about $1.5bn of those revenues. Credit Suisse said it estimated that YouTube was nearing profitability.“This colour should help improve sentiment around the sustainability of Google’s long-term growth,” said Spencer Wang, an analyst at Credit Suisse.Google’s shares rose 11.2 per cent to $601.45, their highest since January. It was the biggest one-day gain in two years.Akamai, maker of the video software that powers YouTube, gained 2.2 per cent to $47.09.Shares of networking equipment maker Cisco added 1.3 per cent to $23.36.Google also said paid clicks were up 16 per cent in the third quarter over the same period in 2009.Search and online ad rival Yahoo gained 2 per cent to $16.25 and Microsoft added 1.2 per cent to $25.54.Expectations also rose for Apple, which reports earnings on Monday. Its shares were up 4.1 per cent to $314.74, an all-time high.Gartner, the market research firm, estimated that the market for tablets such as Apple’s iPad could double next year.“A big fourth-quarter beat is expected …with innovation and future opportunities as strong as ever,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets.Private equity groups were said to be interested in a buy-out of Seagate, the data storage group.Its shares were marked up 22 per cent to $15.51 on the rumour that the offer by KKR and TPG would be $15 a share. Shares of rival Western Digital advanced 8.1 per cent to $31.89.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index added 1.4 per cent to 2,468.77. Over the course of the week, the Nasdaq strongly outperformed, rising 2.8 per cent. S&P 500 tech shares also rose 3.9 per cent, the best of any sector.The broader S&P 500 index was up 0.2 per cent, rising 1 per cent for the week to 1,176.19.The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent to 11,062.78, bringing down its five-day gain to 0.5 per cent.On Friday, Gannett, the newspaper chain, said advertising fell 5 per cent for the quarter over the comparable period last year. Its shares were down 8.8 per cent to $12.85.Shares in rival New York Times Co retreated 2.5 per cent to $8.28.Financials were the leading fallers on the week, dropping 2.4 per cent as fears rise of possibly fraudulent mortgage foreclosures, which could cause losses for lenders.On Friday, consumers were also reported to be increasingly late on their credit card payments.Capital One Financial said charge-offs on consumer debt rose to an 8.4 per cent annualised rate in September, up from 8.2 per cent in August.Its shares, which fell 7.6 per cent to $36.86, led a drop of shares in leading lenders. Bank of America fell 5 per cent to $36.86 and JPMorgan Chase sank 4.1 per cent to $37.15.BofA led the large bank decliners on the week, losing 9.1 per cent, to its lowest level since July 1999.General Electric declined 5 per cent to $16.30 after it said sales in its core industrial businesses fell 6 per cent for the quarter.Industrials were weaker over the five-day period as producer prices rose, while the consumer price index continued to fall.Toymaker Mattel reported strong earnings growth but, excluding a one-time tax adjustment, failed to meet Street expectations. Its shares fell 6.5 per cent to $22.45.
339;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-15T19:56:25Z;Apple’s iPad to drive growth in tablets;;Strong consumer demand for Apple’s iPad is expected to trigger rapid growth across the burgeoning tablet sector, with overall unit sales expected to exceed 200m within four years.A report by Gartner, the technology consultancy, forecasts that tablet sales will more than double in 2011 from an expected 19.5m units this year, and surpass 208m units in 2014 as rival technology groups rush to bring out their own models.The figures highlight the impact of Apple’s iPad, which launched in April. Analysts say the US group, which reports quarterly earnings on Monday, could sell 15m tablets by the end of the year.Spurred on by Apple’s success in the tablet category, groups such as Research in Motion, Cisco, Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard and ZTE are now playing catch-up with plans to launch their own rival devices. However, Samsung’s Galaxy Tab is likely to be the only iPad rival to launch this year.Carolina Milanesi, research vice-president at Gartner, said: “Some people will think we’ve been drinking the Apple Kool-Aid. Our forecasts are aggressive, but you need to look at the media tablet as an older sibling to the smartphone rather than related to the PC.”She said given the attraction of the segment, both mobile phone and PC manufacturers were developing products for the category.Consumers, meanwhile, are increasingly seeing tablets as an attractive secondary device to a PC.Gartner is predicting that tablets will start eating into market share of other devices such as e-readers, gaming devices and media players. However, the largest impact is likely to be on netbooks – low-priced, ultra-small personal computers.Ms Milanesi said that so far the iPad was selling to “tech savvy” consumers or “fashion victims”.As prices come down, so the appeal of the tablet will spread, she said. The other potential area of growth could be in the business segment, where companies could start using the iPad as a sales or marketing tool.The hype around the iPad is also lifting other categories for Apple. IDC, another research group, which together with Gartner reported PC sales for the third quarter this week, said there was a “halo effect” surrounding the iPad that had boosted sales of the iMac computer. As a result, Apple pushed into third place behind HP and Dell in the PC market in the US in the three months to September, although it still has a relatively small share of the global PC market.
340;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-14T18:43:54Z;Tablets start to cause side effects for PCs;;The hype surrounding the iPad and other tablets is starting to have an impact on purchases of personal computers as consumers struggle to decide which device to buy, the latest data suggest.Sales of PCs grew much less than expected in the third quarter as consumers delayed buying while they considered whether to purchase a tablet instead, according to Gartner. The research firm said that global PC shipments grew 7.6 per cent to 88.3m units in the third quarter of this year, compared to a forecast rise of 12.7 per cent.Gartner and IDC, another research group, said there was evidence that the hype around tablets was causing customers to take a “wait and see” approach to buying PCs. Also, continued economic volatility in the US and the threat of public spending cuts in western Europe was also affecting consumer confidence and spending patterns.“Apple has raised the profile of the tablet,” said Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner. However, analysts said there was little evidence that tablets were directly cannibalising PC sales.Compared to the hype around the iPad, PC vendors did not have any big releases to help market their products as they did with Windows 7 last year.Vendors also suffered as retailers that overstocked in the netbook category at the beginning of the year held back from making further purchases to see if tablets would take off.“Those buying tablets are early adopters who already own multiple devices,” said Mr Atwal. IDC said PC shipments rose 11 per cent to 89.7m, 3 percentage points below its expectations.Bob O’Donnell, vice-president for clients and displays at IDC, said there was evidence of “consumer fatigue” for notebooks and netbooks. Consumers who previously bought PCs for their home and another secondary device, may now be looking to replace netbooks with tablets.He said that, while the iPad had had some negative impact on the netbook market, “the halo effect” of the device also helped propel Mac sales and moved Apple into the number three position in the US market behind Hewlett-Packard and Dell.IDC said there were signs of a pick-up in shipments in September, something Intel picked out in its earnings announcement this week.According to both IDC and Gartner, HP maintained its lead in the global PC market at about 17.5 per cent. Acer jumped into the number two slot with Dell slipping to third.Additional reporting by Chris Nuttall in San Francisco
341;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
342;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-14T17:57:13Z;Rivals yet to scratch surface of Apple’s lead;;Apple’s quarterly results on Monday are expected to confirm 2010 as the year of the iPad but the tablet category to which the gadget belongs is in its infancy.A swathe of companies are approaching tablets as either large-format smartphones or keyboard-less notebooks but none has so far mounted a serious challenge to the iPad.Therefore, in spite of the hooplah that greeted the creation of an entirely new computing sector at the iPad’s launch, the success and size of this category is far from being determined.Apple could sell about 15m units this year of a product it unveiled in January and only introduced in April, according to analyst estimates. By comparison, the iPhone sold less than 6m units in its first full year.The iPad’s only significant challenger in 2010 looks like being the Samsung Galaxy Tab, a seven-inch tablet that will go on sale in November.Hewlett-Packard, the leading PC maker, has postponed a planned tablet launch till next year and Research in Motion will not introduce its recently unveiled seven-inch tablet, the BlackBerry PlayBook, until the first quarter of 2011.On Tuesday, ZTE, the fast-growing Chinese telecom equipment maker, became the latest IT company to join the bandwagon. The ZTE Light, which runs on Android and has a seven-inch screen, is expected to go on sale before the end of the year.Doug Reid at Stifel Nikolaus, the investment bank, expects the iPad to have an 82 per cent market share of the 19.2m tablets he forecasts will ship this year.Mr Reid said its dominance would be due to the end of shipment delays, a “window of de-facto market exclusivity” and the likelihood that rivals will try unsuccessfully to integrate their hardware with operating systems such as Android that are unproven relative to Apple’s iOS.Apple is also likely to upgrade the iPad in January: a seven-inch alternative to its 9.7-inch screen is rumoured, while front and back cameras for video conferencing is expected.As well as being a hit with consumers, the iPad is being rapidly adopted in the corporate world.Good Technology, which makes consumer-oriented devices secure on corporate networks, says the iPad entered its top five of devices activated on such networks in its first two months.Apple’s rivals, while eager to enter the segment, are hoping that tablets will not cannibalise sales of netbooks and notebook PCs– expected to be about 40m units and 170m units respectively in 2010.That may already be happening, without consumers actually buying tablets. The latest data from Gartner, the research firm, suggest that netbook sales are flagging. It said consumers were holding off purchases and adopting a wait-and-see attitude due to the forthcoming tablets.Warren East, chief executive of Arm, whose chip designs are the blueprint for the iPad’s processor, said recently the next five years might see the end of the PC and “a new era of computing based on smartphones and tablets”.Intel, AMD and Microsoft, who have more of their business tied up in the PC, have maintained tablets will help grow the overall PC market into a bigger pie, while analysts say a mixture of both cannibalisation and the addition of new sales is most likely.Christian Heidarson, principal analyst at Gartner, says direct competition from tablets will likely only shrink the PC market by 8 per cent this year. “But from 2013 onwards, the impact will be significantly more pronounced …we will see tablets with the same capabilities as netbooks retailing for $300 instead of $600,” he says.Arthur Hsieh, analyst at UBS, said the netbook was originally aimed at people who wanted a second computer, or those who would not buy a full-featured notebook and that “the tablet pretty much fulfils both these functions”.What most analysts agree on, however, is that Apple will maintain a significant lead against competitors for at least the next year due to their struggles with different operating systems.Tablets using Android, originally designed to power smartphones, do not easily display content at a high resolution without extra customisation. While Samsung has worked out a compromise on its seven-inch Galaxy tablet, LG this month shelved its plans until a more tablet-friendly version of Android is released next year.Meanwhile, analysts say that problems persist with Windows 7, which they say remains difficult to use without a mouse and a keyboard. This has led to a number of prospective tablet makers, such as Lenovo, preferring to wait for Android rather than launch a Windows-based tablet.Gartner’s Mr Heidarson says PC and smartphone makers are likely to find more success in making seven-inch tablets rather than trying to compete directly with Apple’s 9.7-inch iPad.Mobile operators are much more likely to want to subsidise a seven-inch tablet such as the Galaxy Tab than a bigger model that users may not always carry around with them.
343;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-13T22:59:45Z;Netbooks fade as iPad looms in Q3 PC sales;;Tablets in, netbooks out is no longer a media-hyped fashion trend. Gartner and IDC have the cold, hard, third-quarter PC sales numbers to back it up.Sales of PCs grew much less than expected worldwide, with consumers delaying purchases as they thought instead about buying a tablet, according to Gartner.The research firm reported worldwide PC shipments of 88.3m units in the third quarter, up 7.6 per cent on a year ago but below its earlier forecast of 12.7 per cent growth.Its rival IDC, which uses a different methodology, reported 89.7m shipments, up 11 per cent on a year earlier but nearly 3 percentage points below its expectations.In the US, growth was up just 3.8 per cent year-on-year, well below second-quarter growth of 11.7 per cent and IDC projections of around 11 per cent.As Intel indicated in its earnings on Tuesday, things picked up in September after a sluggish August in mature markets that had prompted the world’s biggest chipmaker to reduce its revenue forecast.“Lower PC component costs, budding excitement around new media-centric form factors and continued business buying should still make for a competitive holiday season,” said Jay Chou, IDC analyst.IDC said Apple’s influence on the PC market continued to grow, particularly in the US, as the iPad had a negative impact on the netbook market.Intel dominates netbooks with its Atom microprocessor and reported third-quarter sales fell 4 per cent on the second quarter.Gartner said consumer mobile PC sales in the US were the weakest in years.“Hype around media tablets has led consumers and the channels to take a ‘wait and see’ approach to buying a new device,” said Mikako Kitagawa, Gartner analyst.Non-student buyers normally lured by back-to-school promotions had stayed away from PC purchases, she said, partly because of the gloomy economy and partly because of the promise of the iPad and its tablet rivals.HP remained the top PC vendor globally with a 17.5 per cent market share, followed by Acer with 13.1 per cent, Dell with 12.2 per cent and Lenovo with 10.4 per cent, according to Gartner.
344;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-10-02T00:23:02Z;Microsoft files lawsuit over Android;;Microsoft has mounted an indirect legal attack on Google over its highly successful Android smartphone operating system, accusing handset maker Motorola of patent infringement for including the software in its own devices.The action adds to a growing pile of lawsuits over Android that has been filed by some of the tech industry’s leading names in recent months.However, the legal challenges have not slowed the momentum of the software platform, which overtook Apple’s iPhone software in the second quarter of this year in worldwide shipments, according to research group Gartner.Earlier this year, Apple sued HTC, the Taiwanese handset maker, alleging patent infringement in its Android phones, while Oracle attacked Google last month, claiming Android illegally included elements of its Java software.On Friday, Microsoft filed claims with the US International Trade Court and in a Federal court in Seattle, accusing Motorola’s Android handsets of infringing nine of its patents. The claims cover some of the most basic functions on smartphones, including the way they synchronise with e-mail held on servers, as well as with calendar and contacts information.While the suit targets Motorola, “the patented features implicated in the action are in the Android platform” itself rather than in technology added by the handset maker, said Horacio Gutierrez, Microsoft’s deputy general counsel.Legal actions tend to be filed against a handset’s maker rather than producers of the underlying software or other technologies in the device, since the hardware producer takes on direct responsibility for “clearing” the intellectual property rights involved in their products, according to one legal expert.Motorola said it would “vigorously defend itself” against the Microsoft claim, while Google said: “We are disappointed that Microsoft prefers to compete over old patents rather than new products. Sweeping software patent claims like these threaten innovation.”The action comes shortly before the launch of handsets running Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7 operating system, a delayed response to touchscreen smartphones such as Android handsets and the iPhone.The timing did not appear to be a coincidence, suggested Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC: “I have no doubt that Microsoft wants to make sure everyone understands the value of the IP protection that comes with licensing their products, as opposed to unprotected software like Android where the device makers have to fend for themselves.”However, Microsoft dismissed suggestions that the lawsuit was designed to slow down adoption of Android.“We have a very strong bias in favour of licensing,” said Mr Gutierrez.
345;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-09-28T15:11:47Z;Aerospace: Finding spares can be a complex challenge;;Modern civil airliners are complex pieces of equipment with as many as 4m components involved in their manufacture. Organising the supply chain that delivers anything from nuts and bolts to complete sub-assemblies is equally tricky.Enterprise resource planning systems are common throughout many industries as a way of managing a wide range of company functions, from finance through human resources to supply chain.Big ERP suppliers, such as SAP and Oracle, offer systems that can manage ordinary supply chains, but aerospace industry experts say specialist products to meet the sector’s requirements are needed.For all its high-tech image, the aerospace industry has proved less than leading-edge in managing its supply chain – as both Boeing and Airbus have found. Delays to recent launches by the two leading aerospace companies have revealed gaps.Boeing made the mistake of subcontracting large parts of the manufacture of its 787 Dreamliner while at the same time boosting the quantity of high-tech composite materials in the design. EADS, the European aircraft-making consortium, faced problems installing the 500 kms of electrical wiring in each of its Airbus 380s.“The aerospace industry has been very much a craft industry for a lot longer than the automotive sector,” says Peter Dickin, marketing manager for Delcam, a Birmingham, UK based developer of manufacturing software. “Until now, the industry didn’t make aircraft in anything like the volumes cars have been made in for decades.”“The sector is split between large groups, such as Rolls-Royce, that are global, and a very long tail of smaller companies,” explain Ed Savage and Tim Lawrence, supply chain experts at PA Consulting Group. “There are thousands of components in an aircraft and any one can stop it flying. There is a real logistical challenge in tracking all these components deep down into the supply chain.”The challenge facing the industry is complicated by the fact that aircraft may remain in service for decades and need spare parts for their entire working life.“Auto manufacturers bring out a new model every four to six years, but an aerospace company can be making the same components 40 years later,” says Andrew Mair, chief executive of the Midlands Aerospace Alliance, a UK regional grouping of suppliers.“Companies have to service, overhaul and repair aircraft, but that often involves only small volumes of a particular part.”Just as specialist logistics companies have evolved to handle deliveries in sectors such as food retailing and automotive components, similar organisations have emerged in the aerospace industry. Umeco, a London-listed company, works with customers, such as engine supplier Rolls-Royce, to establish their needs, create bills of materials required and match that with inventory that it holds from component suppliers.“We provide an outsourced solution for C-class parts, the nuts and bolts of the industry,” says Clive Snowdon, chief executive. “We inspect products and deliver to the point of use. We have a proactive vendor management programme and may put our people into suppliers if they default. We look for well financed, well-resourced suppliers, because a casualty can cause enormous disruption.”Umeco uses a common IT platform to link its five supply hubs around the world so it can see where it has a particular product in its network.It originally bought an IT package from a local supplier, but when that company said it would no longer support the software, Umeco bought the code and continued to update it and broaden its functionality.“A lot of mainstream distributors have tried to break in, but they realise their systems are not capable of dealing with the complexity,” says Mr Snowdon. “Our customers need full traceability, so we have to provide provenance back to the base metal.”Michael Burkett, managing vice-president of supply chain research at Gartner, an IT research company, says: “The aerospace industry has a need for basic supply chain management capability, such as demand planning and production scheduling, but there are also business processes that are unique to aerospace.“The big airline manufacturers have long order books but they don’t necessarily know the configuration customers want. When they get the final order, they have to be prepared for things to change. They need the capability to deal with that.”This has led to the creation of a web-based business-to-business hub called Exostar, formed by a partnership of BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. This allows customers to forecast their requirements and source material from suppliers.“The ERP vendors have achieved a deeper penetration of supply chains, but ERP its still not 100 per cent what the aerospace industry needs,” says Mr Burkett. “Spare parts planning, in particular, requires unique algorithms to forecast demand. The problem is still the ability to make rapid changes.”
346;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-09-27T18:28:14Z;Orange reaches for the cloud;;Hardly a week goes by without a big technology company trumpeting its cloud computing services. Not to be left out, telecoms operators are also eyeing the burgeoning market.Orange has just announced a tie-up with Cisco, EMC and VMware that will see the four companies offering cloud computing service for businesses.Over the last few years technology groups have been heavily touting the benefits of cloud computing, whereby software applications and data are housed remotely by centralised web servers rather than on a user’s own computer. Because data and software are stored on a hosted server, so the theory goes, moving to the cloud allows companies to significantly reduce their IT costs.Vivek Badrinath, chief executive of Orange Business Services, says offering cloud was “a fairly natural extension” for the telecoms group. “Cloud at a very raw level is about renting servers and storage capabilities”, he says, something telecoms operators are already very experienced with handling.Certainly the numbers are pretty compelling. According to Gartner, revenue from cloud services worldwide is forecast to reach $68.3bn in 2010 and by 2014 that figure is projected to reach $148.8bn.Orange says it is already talking to a number of potential customers in Europe about its Flexible 4 Business pay-per-use managed cloud services. Initially the service will be offered as a private cloud, using a customer’s own datacentre, before moving to a hybrid model.Mr Badrinath says each of its partners brings something to the party. Cisco is the world’s largest maker of networking equipment, EMC is the biggest standalone maker of storage gear, and VMware specialises in virtualisation software and cloud infrastructure solutions. Other partners could join the venture at a later stage.Orange is not the first telecom operator to try to cash in on the shift to the cloud. Last year Verizon Communications, the US telecoms operator, launched a hosted corporate pay-as-you-go computing services for its customers. AT&T also offers cloud services.Moving towards the cloud clearly offers telecoms companies another potential revenue stream at a time when operators are seeing their core phone operations dwindle in the face of increased competition and alternative technologies.The question is whether customers are really going to pick an Orange packaged option over a pure tech offering from the likes of IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft or Amazon. Watch this space.
347;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-09-22T09:19:05Z;Gartner Hype Cycle - Banking and Investment Services;;Q&A with Alistair Newton, author of the Gartner Hype Cycle for Banking & Investment ServicesQ: The Gartner Hype Cycle is meant to cut through the hype surrounding emerging technologies in various markets, and understand the potential for those technologies to change the shape or direction of their industry. Based on Gartner’s research, what is the most hyped technology in banking and investment services?A: If we have to pick one technology as the most hyped, that would likely be mobile consumer banking. The mobile phone has been positioned as everything from the saviour to the slayer of the banks. Visions of customers deserting PCs and branches for their banking have proved ill-founded. The role of mobile operators in the financial services value chain has remained limited in all bar a number of developing financial services markets, where the absence of existing bank infrastructures have indeed offered fruitful pickings for these new entrants. Mobile technology does however have a huge role to play in the financial service industry. The key to the successful and ultimately profitable utilization of mobile within financial services is a clear and precise understanding of where it can add value and when customers will use a mobile channel rather than any of the others offered by their bank.In this instance, early hype around the potential for mobile channels to revolutionize the industry has served to drive adoption by many financial services companies who have raced to offer their customers products and services delivered via mobile devices. However, in all too many cases, those original business cases were based on too much optimism and too little customer demand. New mobile services have been established as stand-alone entities in their own right, with no integration into existing delivery channels, or indeed across other areas of the bank. This lack of integration, combined with limited customer demand for mobile services and increasing concerns over privacy and security, caused Gartner to forecast in 2007 that some banks would by 2010, start withdrawing their full service mobile banking offerings from the marketplace. We have indeed seen this occurring through the early part of this year.That is not to say that mobile technology cannot or will not have a positive impact on financial services markets. The Hype Cycle highlights the positive impact of mobile phones in developing financial services markets and the potential benefits to accrue in more developed markets where financial institutions adopt a customer focused and enterprise wide strategy for delivering mobile financial services.Q: Any other technologies that you would specifically call out as likely to have a significant impact?A: Whilst the actual level of impact of specific technologies will often vary depending on geography, local regulatory environment, or the broader technology adoption within a particular market, one other heavily hyped technology which we would call out from this Hype Cycle would be financial social networks (FSNs). To many in financial services, making the link between social networks, such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter has involved embracing these new media solutions as marketing or communication channel.In reality the role of social networking has been subject to significant hype, and such a marketing led approach will underplay the potential that social networking has to influence not just individual customers, but also the entire financial services ecosystem. Key to understanding the role of social networking in financial services is recognising three messages: 1) social networking has always taken place – the difference now is that technology allows those conversations to take place across a wider community, and for those conversations to be stored and recorded. 2) social networking has already had significant impacts on many industries outside of financial services, in the way that consumers look for external reviews on goods or services, as well as price comparison, before they make a purchase. 3) social networking is about sharing information – in this way it brings transparency to communities, markets and industries.Financial social networks is the Gartner terminology to describe those solutions that embrace the concepts of social networking to deliver services targeted at the financial services industry. These solutions were originally pioneered by independent non-bank providers to bring financial services specific price, product and service comparison and discussion, combined with product recommendation and budgeting and forecasting tools. The model is now developing to embrace bank-owned solutions, as well as customer-owned social networks, focused on sharing financial services specific knowledge and information between like-minded customer groups.Optional questions:Q: What about technologies that are not featured on the Hype Cycle?A: From first view, it should be clear that the featured Hype Cycle only covers a limited number of technologies within the financial services arena. So what about technologies that are on the radar of your company, but which are not highlighted within this or other Gartner Hype Cycles? Well it is important to highlight that any framework or methodology will, almost by definition, have to exclude certain factors if only to ensure clarity for the reader. Just because a particular technology isn’t covered, doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be important to your own organisation – simply which taken at an overview level, there are other technologies which are considered to have a more significant impact on the industry as a whole. If that technology doesn’t appear on the Hype Cycle, you can still use the methodology to help you assess the impact on your organisation or market sector.Recognise that from the discovery of a technology – at the trigger point and moving forward – it is likely that there will be significant hyperbole surrounding the potential uses for that technology and the impact it will have on an industry. This hype tends to grow, until such stage that it has reached a peak and early adopters have started to struggle with delivering against these expectations. At this stage the sentiment surrounding the technology tends to fall away, as disillusionments sets in with these original over inflated expectations. Ultimately, if the technology is robust and useful, it can move beyond this disillusionment as users begin to fully understand what it can – and cannot – deliver, until ultimately it may make it to a productive and mainstream deployment.The key is to recognise that these stages exist and to understand what stage your particular technology has reached. For example, intuitively it may seem wrong to invest in a technology as it is approaching the Peak of Inflate Expectations – why would you want to invest in an over-hyped technology? In fact this may not be the wrong time for many to invest - market timing may indeed be perfect from a customer or competitor point of view. What is fundamental to the success of that investment is recognising that the technology is the subject of hype – and recognising the likely subsequent fall off in those positive sentiments. Positioning any technology on the Hype Cycle allows business users and technologists to make the correct decisions with a full and clear view of the facts.Q: What goes into developing the Hype Cycle?A: A Hype Cycle is a methodology, developed by Gartner, with the objective of helping business and technology executives understand the role that certain emerging technologies will play in influencing and impacting particular markets or business sectors. It is often very difficult to cut through the noise and hype surrounding new and emerging technologies. On the one hand, advocates will have a vested interest in hyping the impact of a particular technological advance, whilst others may underestimate the potential for that technology to change the shape or direction of their industry.The Hype Cycle is an independent lens on those technologies, and a means to cut through this hype, recognising the natural cadence of technology innovation – early optimism, tempered by the reality checks of real world deployments, and finally the potential for real productivity as the use of the technology matures. Hype Cycles help business and technology executives identify technologies to track, understand their potential and provide an indication of how quickly those technologies will migrate to a position of maturity, and hopefully, financial payback. By recognising early on in any adoption process that new technologies will undergo these variations in popularity and usefulness, it is possibly to build realistic business plans that manage expectation and set an understanding of the timelines against which any such investment may become productive.This particular Hype Cycle, one of many produced by Gartner, focuses on the challenges of retaining and acquiring customers in the Banking & Investment Services industry. It doesn’t attempt to cover every technology that may conceivably impact bank customers – instead it focuses on those that are proving the most difficult or complex for our clients to follow and track.
348;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-09-13T22:37:16Z;Spending on IT defences to increase;;More companies expect to increase spending on technological defenses against security breaches than had forecast such a boost in any of the previous five years, a global survey of more than 12,000 executives shows.About 52 per cent of respondents said their companies would spend more in the coming 12 months, up from 38 per cent a year ago, according to the annual poll to be released on Wednesday by the PwC consulting firm. Executives said the additional funding would come despite constraints that have delayed security investment for the past two years and continuing economic concerns.One reason is that while the number of companies reporting no recent security breaches is rising – to 27 per cent in 2010 from 19 per cent a year earlier – those that are getting hit are getting hit harder.Fully 20 per cent of those who had an incident said their company lost money as a result, up from 14 per cent in 2009 and just 8 per cent in 2008. Intellectual property theft is also surging, tripling in three years to afflict 15 per cent of breached companies.Those reports bear out anecdotal evidence of an increase in sophisticated attacks tailored to penetrate specific companies, said John Pescatore, lead internet security analyst at Gartner.“A lot of people when it was broad, mass attacks like viruses, were very aware,” Mr Pescatore said. “The whole goal of targeted attacks is for them not to know. But they are doing more damaging things, like stealing customer data and passwords.”Such intrusions received more attention with Google’s disclosure in January that it and other prominent companies had been targeted by hackers seeking intellectual property with the apparent backing of the Chinese government, which denied involvement. Organised crime groups, especially in eastern Europe, are also capturing control of personal computers in more homes and businesses in order to win access to financial accounts.As a result, spending is shifting to monitor company networks more closely, even as more employees bring in their own computers and smartphones.Security concerns also are taking on a higher profile inside corporations. The proportion of chief information security officers reporting to their companies’ chief information officers has dropped to 23 per cent from 38 per cent in the past three years, PwC found, while those reporting to the chief executive or board jumped to 68 per cent from 53 per cent.
349;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-09-02T12:46:42Z;Capgemini taps into Brazil IT market;;Capgemini has placed a bet on Latin America, announcing on Thursday a deal to buy a majority stake in CPM Braxis, Brazil’s largest information technology services group.Europe’s largest IT services company is paying €233m ($298m) for a 55 per cent stake in Brazil’s CPM Braxis, a regional market leader. CPM Braxis has an enterprise value of about €437m.The deal will give Capgemini a platform to grow further in Brazil, where it will be looking to compete with rivals in the region such as Accenture, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Unisys.According to figures from Gartner, Latin America’s IT services market is worth about $23bn, with Brazil accounting for just under half of the total market. Brazil’s IT services market, which has seen the fastest rate of growth in the region, is projected to exceed 10 per cent a year in 2014.Capgemini joins a growing list of companies that have made acquisitions in Brazil this year as multinationals bet on the Brazilian economy, which is forecast to grow 7 per cent this year on the back of a huge boom in domestic consumption.The French group said that as part of the deal with CPM Braxis it has an option to buy the remaining 45 per cent of the company from the existing shareholders between three to five years after the deal is signed.CPM Braxis employs more than 5,500 people and is forecasting revenues for 2010 of €450m. The group is particularly strong in the financial sector, where the Brazilian lender Bradesco was its biggest client as well as being its largest shareholder before the Capgemini deal. The Brazilian group also has clients in telecoms, utilities and manufacturing.Paul Hermelin, chief executive, said the CPM Braxis deal was part of a wider growth strategy for Capgemini that would help the French group extend its presence in Brazil as well as supporting its existing global clients in the region.Capgemini already employs a few hundred people in Brazil and has businesses in Mexico, Guatemala, Chile and Argentina.Capgemini, which like others in the IT services sector, was hit hard by the global financial crisis is benefiting from a recovery in corporate investment.The group started hiring again at the end last year and increased its global headcount by 6 per cent during the first half of this year – mainly in emerging markets in Asia, eastern Europe, North Africa and Latin America.The French group said at its half-year results in July that it expects revenue growth of 3 to 5 per cent in the second of 2010 compared with the same period last year.Capgemini shares, which have risen about 4 per cent since the beginning of the year, were trading at €35.19 in early afternoon trading on Thursday.
350;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-09-01T18:25:38Z;Social networking comes of age;;When bosses at Cognizant Technology Solutions rolled out a new internal communications system two years ago that mimicked the principles of social networking sites, such as Facebook, they were unsure if it would work.But within a few months, executives at the US-listed outsourcing company, most of whose staff are in India, found that younger members of the workforce, the under 30-year-olds who fall into the so-called “millennial” generation, were migrating to the new system en masse.The system, called Cognizant 2.0, is so popular that attrition among active users of the software is about one third of the level among staff who seldom use it, according to Malcolm Frank, Cognizant senior vice-president and chief strategist. “Millennials eat this up,” says Mr Frank.For a generation that has grown up with the internet, mobile phones and other forms of connectivity, social networking with its infinite possibilities for collaboration is not just a pastime but a way of life they are increasingly insisting must be present in the workplace or in e-commerce.For Indian outsourcing companies, this growing demand among employees and consumers for social networking-like functions represents a new frontier. Clients are increasingly asking them for help first to understand the trend and then to write and implement software incorporating it into their businesses.“The whole digital native generation has grown up expecting that computing is just ubiquitous,” says Partha Iyengar, regional research director for India at Gartner, the consultancy. “This concern that when you’re on Facebook, you’re not working is a very misplaced concern.”Already, some companies are turning the principles of social networking into a business in itself. S. Gopalakrishnan, chief executive of Infosys Technologies, India’s second-largest outsourcing group, points to Innocentive, a company that provides a platform for thousands of engineers around the world to collaborate on problems.Within Infosys, the company has set up its own collaboration software, iEngage. Social network-like internal communications systems are particularly useful in software services companies because they allow easy collaboration between engineers when they are writing codes and programmes.The international nature of Indian outsourcing companies also means that virtual networks of programmers from around the globe can join a group working on a particular client job on systems such as iEngage. The open format makes it easy for supervisors or external experts to keep an eye on progress and make suggestions.Cognizant, Infosys and others are starting to market their internal social networking systems to third parties, as well as helping customers with other social networking-related software. “This is an important initiative for a lot of businesses, especially the retail business. Retail is completely moving digital,” says Mr Gopalakrishnan.He says retailers are moving from traditional forms of advertising to software that allows them to leverage social networks better. This can be through “peer recommendations” in which a person recommends a product or service to his or her friends on the network.The millennial generation is also driving changes in customer relationship management, says Mr Frank. Millennials do not like traditional bank branches, preferring to do their banking or other retail activity over the internet. But they do not like the impersonal nature of the traditional e-commerce and companies are hiring online agents who use social networking-like software to get an integrated view of a customer’s account, previous buying history and interactions with other staff.It is unclear whether the trend will last. “It’s early days,” says Mr Frank. “It only really started to take off two years ago.”He admits that, for the older generation at least, there is still nothing that can beat a face-to-face meeting. During the economic crisis, Cognizant started a quarterly review meeting in which senior executives get together from around the world to discuss challenges and opportunities arising from the turmoil.“Breaking bread and having a few drinks together – that still matters,” he says.
351;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-09-01T18:25:38Z;Outsourcers warn US producing too few engineers;;US universities are producing too few engineers to meet industry demand, Indian outsourcing companies say, leaving such businesses little choice but to hire foreign skilled workers to fill jobs in America.Cognizant Technology Solutions, the US-listed Indian outsourcing group, says it has 57 recruitment staff in the US permanently looking for engineers locally but is still being forced to import Indians on work visas.“If you look at the core of what we do, the technology work, the US simply doesn’t have the talent base today,” said Francisco d’Souza, Cognizant president and chief executive. “Although unemployment in the US today is high, IT unemployment is still very low.” The US last month passed a border security law that will be partly funded by doubling the cost of visas for IT workers, a move that will mostly affect Indian outsourcing companies.Indian outsourcing companies usually keep a small portion of their workforce in the US to work closely with clients, supported by the bulk of their staff in development centres in India.But the protectionism move – a senator who sponsored the legislation described Indian outsourcing companies as “chop shops”, a reference to garages that dismantle and sell stolen cars – may have little impact.About 70 per cent of US PhD students are foreign born and are often hired in the US, making their way into Silicon Valley or government agencies such as Nasa, said Partha Iyengar, of Gartner, the consultancy.“The bigger challenge for the US is, if they start to lose this talent at the lower end, the innovation engine that has been driving the economy starts to dry up,” Mr Iyengar said. India’s undergraduate university courses produce about 600,000 engineers a year compared with about 84,000 in the US in the 2007-08 academic year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.While less than one quarter of India’s engineering graduates are considered of international standard, they tend mostly to seek careers in the information technology outsourcing industry, creating a huge pool of talent for the sector.By contrast, US engineering graduates are spread across all industries.Mr d’Souza says about 20 per cent of Cognizant’s workforce of 88,700 work in the US and of those more than half are Indians or foreign nationals in the process of becoming permanent residents.S. Gopalakrishnan, chief executive of Infosys Technologies, India’s second-largest IT company, said the group had 10,000 staff in the US but only 1,600 were nationals or permanent residents. The company wanted to hire 1,000 people a year in the US but faced a scarcity of talent. “It is a struggle,” he said.
352;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-08-31T18:48:25Z;Wireless chipmakers;Intel's takeover of Infineon leaves the market open to disruption;There are still a few billion people left on the planet yet to own a computer. And a large proportion of these unwebbed will get their first taste of processing power from the most personal of computers: smartphones. At the same time mobile phone technology is finding its way into other consumer devices, for example providing books and map updates on the go. No wonder then that Intel, which makes the microprocessors found in four of every five PCs sold globally, this week snapped up the wireless chip business of Germany’s Infineon.Up for grabs is a $30bn annual semiconductor market. While 2010 mobile phone unit sales should be around a tenth higher on last year, the smartphone portion – which contains more valuable silicon – is expanding at three times that rate. As smartphone units replace simpler phones, average selling prices for chipmakers should stay reasonably stable, even as smartphone prices themselves continue to fall. New devices such as e-readers and media tablets are still in the tens of millions range, but such growth is incremental and technologically straightforward to address. Gartner forecasts revenue growth for the mobile application processor market of 22 per cent annually from 2009 to 2014.Production is still relatively dispersed. Qualcomm is the biggest manufacturer, supplying processors for 80 per cent of smartphones using Android, the fastest growing mobile operating system. But Qualcomm only takes 30 per cent of wireless chip market revenues overall, calculates consultancy iSuppli. While the competition has shrunk over the last five years from around 15 suppliers of baseband (a phone’s internal modem) to five which count, the market is still open to distruptive innovation.The source of that disruption remains to be seen. Texas Instruments is winding down its baseband business in wireless to concentrate on processors, while Intel is heading in the opposite direction – Infineon’s engineers are expert in cramming several functions onto one chip. It is not hard to understand the appeal.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
353;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-08-25T23:00:35Z;Google to compete with Skype;;Google on Wednesday moved into direct competition with Skype, the internet telephony service, as it unveiled a feature that will enable its Gmail users to call landlines and mobile phones from their e-mail inbox.The new feature broadens Google’s growing array of communication products and creates a potent rival to Skype, which is preparing for an initial public offering.“It might cloud the impending IPO a bit,” said Ray Valdes, web analyst at Gartner. Earlier this month, Skype said i t planned to raise at least $100m with an offering on Nasdaq by the end of the year.Google faces an entrenched adversary. Last year, Skype became the leading carrier of international voice calls. In the year to June 30, Skype’s registered users rose from 397m to 560m. Gmail has just over 200m users.But just 8.1m of Skype’s users pay for the service, and the company relies on these direct payments from these users for most of its revenues.Google plans to undercut Skype’s prices. In a price comparison chart that showed rates from Google and the “leading internet telephony provider”, Google offered cheaper calls to landlines and mobile phones in the UK, Mexico and France.In a promotion designed to attract new users, calls to the US and Canada will be free for at least the rest of the year. Calls to other countries will be as low as 2 cents per minute, and will not include a connection fee. The service will become available to US Gmail users in the coming days.Google already offered Gmail users free voice and video calls to other Gmail users, and the company rolled out Google Voice, a call management programme, earlier this year.“It was only a matter of time before Google moved to Skype-like features,” said Mr Valdes.In unveiling the feature, Google emphasised the ongoing convergence of traditional telecommunications and the web. “Given that most of us don’t spend all day in front of our computers, we thought, ‘wouldn’t it be nice if you could call people directly on their phones,’” the company said in a blog post.Analysts said it was too early to tell if low prices and the convenience of the inbox would allow Google to lure users away from Skype.“Google has huge resources, both technical and financial,” said Mr Valdes. “At the same time it’s very, very early for this to be a significant threat. Skype users are tremendously loyal.”Skype declined to comment.
354;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-08-17T14:47:48Z;Android predicted to surpass RIM this year;;Google’s momentum in smartphones is not likely to stop at just overtaking Apple’s iPhone in terms of global sales, according to analysts from Taipei-based Digitimes Research, who are predicting that Android sales will jump to number two above Research In Motion’s BlackBerry before the end of the year.Gartner, the research group, last week said Android’s global share in smartphones had jumped from 1.8 per cent a year ago to 17.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2010. This put it ahead of Apple’s iOS operating system, which had a 14.2 per cent share, but still behind RIM’s 18.2 per cent global market share.Digitimes’ numbers are fairly similar, but analyst Luke Lin goes further in predicting that Android sales, which totaled 117m in the first half, would jump a further 40 per cent to 163m in the second half of this year. This would give Android a 20.3 per cent share of the global smartphone market, behind Nokia’s Symbian operating system with 35 per cent.Android is expected to have the fastest growth among smartphone operating systems because “the world number two and number three phone makers, Samsung and LG, are expected to put far more resources into developing and marketing Android smartphones in the second half of the year compared to the first half,” Mr Lin said.“From the expected BlackBerry models it seems there is very little room for [RIM] to raise shipment volumes significantly in the second half of the year,” he added.That ominous forecast for RIM seems especially true today, as news comes that it only sold 150,000 units of its new model, the well-reviewed Torch, on its debut weekend.

356;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-08-13T17:36:26Z;Oracle’s threat to Google mobile push;;The legal war over software rights that Oracle launched against Google late on Thursday could hamper the internet company’s successful push into the smartphone market, industry analysts warned on Friday.Oracle’s aggressive move was also a “nuclear deterrent” that would spread much more widely across the mobile devices industry, with long-term implications for many handset makers and carriers, said Mark Driver, an analyst at Gartner.The lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Francisco, accuses Google of patent and copyright infringement over the inclusion of parts of Oracle’s Java software in its Android smartphone operating system.Android, which Google makes available free of charge, has been taken up by handset makers including Motorola and HTC, and in the most recent quarter phones carrying the software overtook Apple’s iPhone in global sales.Oracle acquired rights to Java, a set of tools that make it easier for software developers to write applications that run on many different operating systems, as part of its purchase of Sun Microsystems earlier this year.The lawsuit shows that Oracle will seek to make more money from the rights to the widely used Java than Sun did, analysts said.“You’re definitely going to get a stronger licence enforcement policy – and rightly so, perhaps,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC.The lawsuit also serves as a warning to handset makers that are using Android and could tilt the balance in favour of other operating systems, including Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7 software, which is due to be launched later this year, Mr Hilwa said.If Google is forced to pay Oracle for the use of its technology, it could lead it to charge for Android, also making the software less attractive to handset makers, he added.Many handset makers already have a licence that allows them to use Java. The prospect that Android would continue to grow fast raised the danger for Oracle that it would lose its power to charge a royalty on many new handsets, said Mr Driver.However, some experts also warned that Oracle’s lawsuit could backfire, encouraging companies to look for alternatives to the Java technology.At the time it bought Sun, Oracle executives said they would tread carefully in how they exercised their Java rights, since a heavy-handed approach could undermine the software’s standing as a de facto industry standard.Legal battles over patents are rare between the technology industry’s leading players. Most maintain large portfolios of rights and have enough mutual self-interest to agree broad cross-licensing deals that give companies access to each others’ patents.Oracle’s attack on Google highlights the internet company’s relatively weak patent portfolio, Mr Driver said.www.ft.com/google
357;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Google’s Android mobiles overtake global iPhone sales;;Global sales of Apple’s iPhone have been overtaken by the multitude of phones using Google’s Android system, which has quickly become the US smartphone market leader.The latest evidence of Google’s rapid success in mobile comes from Gartner, the research group, which said Android’s global share of the smartphone market had leapt from 1.8 per cent a year ago to 17.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2010.That growth came largely at the expense of Nokia and Research in Motion, which produces the BlackBerry.Android handsets now outsell Nokia smartphones and the BlackBerry in the US.Google’s success has provided a boost to struggling handset makers adopting Android such as Motorola and Sony Ericsson.“We thought [Android] would be the second-largest global smartphone operating system by 2012, but we are now seeing it could be as soon as the end of this year,” said Carolina Milanesi, research vice-president at Gartner. “For a lot of companies, Android has been a godsend.”Although the iPhone continues to gain on its rivals, the fact that it is available only from Apple and a limited number of mobile operators has constrained its growth rate compared with Android, which is free for anyone to adopt.“Apple have gone from being the underdog and people rooting for them to seeing an increase in the level of scrutiny and criticism,” Ms Milanesi said. “Now they are seen as arrogant.”Through their touch screens, application stores and easy web browsing, Google and Apple have reinvented the smartphone market. Nokia remained the largest mobile manufacturer in the second quarter, according to Gartner, selling 111.5m devices. But its share has fallen from 36.8 per cent to 34.2 per cent. RIM, which is entangled in arguments over security and privacy with governments around the world, is also losing market share.But Android’s success is a mixed blessing for the mobile industry. By making its highly advanced features available to any manufacturer for no fee, Google has made it harder for device makers and operators to differentiate. For marketers and developers, the Android app store also remains less appealing than Apple’s because of its weaker payment system and wide variety of software versions, screen sizes and devices.

359;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-08-04T01:08:42Z;Amobee steps up mobile ad battle;;Amobee, a Silicon Valley advertising technology group, is stepping up its attack on the mobile ad efforts of Google and Apple by striking a deal with a major European publisher on Wednesday.Amobee will announce a deal with Bertelsmann’s Gruner+Jahr to deliver ads both within applications and on the websites of many of the biggest content companies in Germany, including Stern, Der Spiegel and Financial Times Deutschland.Amobee executives said the company’s first publishing deal will allow it to serve billions of mobile ads monthly and cover 75 per cent of the premium content reaching 100m German mobile phones.Zohar Levkovitz, chief executive, told the Financial Times that the deal, which displaces Google’s DoubleClick, would be followed by a broader arrangement with other parties in about two months.“We’re going to announce something much bigger than this in Europe, and hopefully the same next year in the US,” Mr Levkovitz said.Amobee already has exclusive deals with some of the world’s biggest wireless communications carriers.The German deal may usher in an era of consolidation and simplification in the fragmented world of mobile advertising. Germany is the largest such market in Europe and one of the biggest in the world. As a whole, Gartner has projected that mobile advertising will soar to $7.5bn in 2012 from just $530m in 2008.Apple, which is gaining market share of the most internet-friendly breed of smartphones with the iPhone, made its own dramatic entry into advertising this year with iAds, which are displayed within applications on the device. But those adverts are aimed at a premium audience within the iPhone market. That points up the broader problem of fragmentation, which is frustrating ad buyers that are devoting an increasing percentage of their budgets to mobile.Google’s AdMob, now officially banned from new iPhone applications, can reach a large number of users. A myriad other ad networks also compete, but ad buyers cannot reach everyone that way and have difficulty ensuring they are not reaching the same person over and over.That is one reason companies like Amobee, backed by investors including top-tier venture firms Accel and Sequoia, can charge as much as 20 times more for each ad impression they deliver. They have relationships with the carriers, who know the most about their users and can reach the broadest swathe fastest.Amobee now wants to capitalise on its position above the chaos by striking new deals with publishers.
360;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-07-28T01:03:59Z;Disney clicks in to buy Playdom for $563m;;Walt Disney on Tuesday agreed to buy Playdom, which makes social games for Facebook, a move that sets the stage for Mickey Mouse and Iron Man to feature in games on the world’s largest social networking site.Disney paid up to $763.2m for the two-year-old company – $563.2m in mostly cash plus a performance based earn-out as high as $200m.Playdom, already one of the largest social game companies with about 42m monthly users, will benefit from Disney’s vast catalogue of intellectual property. Disney will have new and robust channels to reach users on Facebook, MySpace and other social networking sites.Disney’s characters ranging from Snow White to Beauty and the Beast are well suited to the casual and cartoonish games on Facebook. Disney’s $4bn acquisition of Marvel last year brought Iron Man and the X-Men into the Magic Kingdom, and these superheroes could also feature in social games.“We’re already looking at the Disney catalogue and how we can bring those characters into our games,” said Playdom’s chief financial officer Christa Quarles.But analysts said that while the tie-up makes sense at first glance, there could be risks.“The success of social gaming has been about the user, rather than the branded character,” said Ray Valdes, a media analyst with Gartner. “When a person plays FarmVille [the most popular social game] they aren’t interacting with random characters, they’re creating their own world.”There will also be questions of how successfully a conglomerate can integrate a young technology company. “When News Corp bought MySpace it was number one in the social networking sector,” said Mr Valdes. “But that marriage between the corporate parent and the once hot property didn’t pan out.”The acquisition marks another big step in a social games industry that has consolidated around “the big three” of Playdom, Playfish and Zynga.Last year, video game publisher Electronic Arts bought Playfish for up to $400m. Zynga, the largest of the three, looks set to remain independent and likely go public in the coming years. The high price Disney paid for Playdom “is a reflection of the vibrant growth in the social gaming sector”, said Mr Valdes.“Media companies are recognising that social games are a big market and a way for them to reach a large number of consumers and monetise well on the internet,” said Justin Smith, an analyst with the Inside Network. “A lot of media companies were initially sceptical of the web because they got burnt early in the 2000s, but the fundamentals of social games are strong.”For its part, Playdom welcomed Disney’s advances in the competitive market. “We believed we could accomplish more with Disney than on our own,” said Ms Quarles.
361;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-07-21T21:55:53Z;Facebook on course to reach 1bn users;;The number of people using Facebook has topped half a billion, according to figures from the company on Wednesday, and internet analysts said the network effects driving its growth had put it on course to exceed 1bn comfortably.Facebook’s announcement that it has 500m members came five-and-a-half months after it reached 400m, with growth coming mostly from non-English speaking countries.Use of the social networking site has spread as users invite their friends to join and spend more of their internet time there, according to analysts.Over the past year, for example, use of Facebook among Portuguese internet users went from 10 per cent to 63 per cent, typical of the rapid spread of the service across Europe, said Andrew Lipsman of web research firm ComScore.Ray Valdes, an analyst at Gartner, said: “It’s doing a great job of weaving itself into the fabric of the social web.”He added that “internet users are going to have an account with a social network of some sort” and outside China there was a good chance that 80-90 per cent of those would eventually be with Facebook.In spite of the unease stirred up in some quarters by Facebook’s push to make more information about its users public, the company had managed to maintain a balance between advancing its own commercial interests while not antagonising users enough that they considered giving up their accounts, Mr Valdes said.Figures from ComScore show that Facebook has reached those levels of penetration in some countries, with 92 per cent of the internet population in Turkey visiting the site, 87 per cent in Indonesia and 80 per cent in the UK.Mr Lipsman said those high figures suggested that even in countries where Facebook was widely used, like the US, with a penetration rate of 67 per cent, there was room for growth.For its next leg of growth, Facebook has been turning increasingly to the emerging markets and to Asia, where penetration levels are still low.It has started to look to mobile users rather than the web, for instance by sending a team of engineers to develop a mobile service for Japan, where its penetration rate stands at only 7 per cent.The company disclosed on Wednesday that its number of users in Brazil, one of the few strongholds of Google’s rival Orkut service, had risen to 6m from 1.3m a year ago.Facebook’s member numbers compare to the 932m monthly visitors to Google’s search engine and its other sites, including YouTube.Microsoft draws 789m users, while Yahoo has 633m, according to ComScore, though the fact that Facebook users have accounts with the service gives it a far stronger relationship with them and greater business potential.
362;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-07-20T18:16:14Z;Nokia boosted by talk of Kallasvuo exit;;Shares in Nokia jumped as much as 5 per cent on Tuesday following reports that the world’s largest mobile phone maker is looking for a new chief executive.Analysts said that Nokia should choose a successor to Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo who has Silicon Valley experience.Mr Kallasvuo, Nokia’s chief executive since 2006, has been under growing pressure because of the Finnish company’s failure during the past three years to keep up with smartphone innovation by Apple and Google.Although Nokia remained the world’s largest mobile phone maker, it had not produced a smartphone to match Apple’s iPhone, said analysts.Google’s Android smartphone operating system had also highlighted serious shortcomings in Nokia’s equivalent, called Symbian, added the analysts.Nokia’s shares closed 2.2 per cent higher at €6.92 after the Wall Street Journal reported that Jorma Ollila, Nokia’s chairman, had approached potential successors to Mr Kallasvuo who work for US technology companies.Nokia declined to comment.Anssi Vanjoki, head of Nokia’s smartphone unit, was the strongest internal candidate to succeed Mr Kallasvuo, according to people familiar with the company.Since Apple launched the iPhone in June 2007, Nokia’s shares have fallen 66 per cent and almost €56bn ($72bn) has been wiped off the company’s market capitalisation.Symbian’s market share has fallen from 50.8 per cent in June 2007 to 44.3 per cent in March this year, as platforms by Apple and Google have rapidly gained ground, according to Gartner, the research firm.Nokia publishes second quarter results on Wednesday, having issued a profit warning last month.Nokia has cut its profitability guidance twice this year, partly because it is struggling to produce sophisticated smartphones that appeal to consumers.Such devices attract significantly higher profit margins compared with basic handsets that have been Nokia’s staple product.Nick Jones, an analyst at Gartner, said Mr Kallasvuo had lost the confidence of investors and a change of chief executive would be the best thing for Nokia.He added Nokia’s problem was finding someone similar to Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive.“The new chief executive needs the experience to run a company the size of Nokia, the charisma to pacify investors, the knowledge to recognise bad products and strategies and the courage to kill them,” said Mr Jones.“There aren’t a lot of obvious candidates who have all these traits plus the ability to fit into a Finnish management culture.”
363;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-07-16T15:09:07Z;Android platform boosts Sony Ericsson sales;;Revenues grew 25 per cent at Sony Ericsson in the second quarter of the year, thanks to the mobile phone maker’s focus on high-end phones using Google’s popular Android operating system.Bert Nordberg, chief executive, said Android had become a key platform for the company and that Sony Ericsson was likely to stop using either Microsoft’s Window’s Mobile or Nokia’s Symbian for its products.“I want us to have the biggest share of Android phone sales in the world. If you look globally, the competition is really between Android and iPhone. We currently have three operating systems that we use and I would like that to go down to two, with most of our activity going on Android,” Mr Nordberg said.Sales in the three months to the end of June were €1.75bn, compared with €1.4bn in the first quarter. The company shipped 11m phones at an average selling price of €160, much higher than the €134 prices it was achieving earlier this year.“They have really over-achieved on average selling price. It really shows the product mix is moving in the right direction,” said Carolina Milanesi, handset analyst at Gartner. She cautioned, however, that sales prices were unlikely to continue rising at this pace, as competition would tighten in the market in the run-up to Christmas.Sony Ericsson, a joint venture between Sweden’s Ericsson and Sony of Japan, was hit hard in 2008 by both the recession and a failure to offer customers high-end smartphones and touch-screen devices that could compete with Apple’s popular iPhone. However, a restructuring programme and the launch of high-end smartphones, such as the Xperia X10 Android phone, helped the company return to a profit last quarter. Fifty per cent of revenues now come from smartphones.Ms Milanesi said the Android phones gave Sony Ericsson a good opportunity to grow sales in the US, a market in which it has struggled over the past few years. However, much would depend on the company’s ability to continue bringing out new, desirable devices.“We’ve seen Sony Ericsson in the past do well in the US for a few quarters and then be unable to follow up with new products. The critical part is continuing to deliver,” she said.Sony Ericsson continued its turnround with a small net profit of €12m in the second quarter, compared with a loss of €213m last time. It also generated €46m in cash, the first positive cash flow for at least two years.“It is one thing to come back to profit but the real test is generating cash,” Mr Nordberg said. “We have not done that for a long time.”The company, which has a 4 per cent share of the global market, maintained its forecasts for only “slight” growth in worldwide handset sales this year.
364;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-07-14T21:19:33Z;Hardware spending leads way for revival;Businesses replace aging equipment;Spending by companies on technology hardware is bouncing back sharply from the global financial crisis with record results from Intel providing the latest evidence of the strength of the recovery.Businesses are finally replacing ageing data-centre servers, desktop PCs and notebooks, after extending the length of their “refresh” cycles to conserve cash during the recession.“We’ve felt for some time that this phenomenon had to happen,” said Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, on new orders for desktop and laptop PCs, helped by Microsoft’s introduction of its Windows 7 operating system.“These machines were just costing more to keep on the books than they were worth, in terms of being out of warranty and repairs.”Mr Otellini said companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon were fuelling a revival with big server installations in data centres to cope with booming internet traffic.Intel saw a 170 per cent increase in sales in the second quarter of its Xeon microprocessors for data centre servers compared with the same period last year.The trend is being helped by companies shifting the running of their applications and services to the internet “cloud” of remote data centres.Meanwhile, IT departments are buying new-generation servers with more powerful processors that can do the work of 20 older servers.This can reduce energy costs by 90 per cent and means the servers pay for themselves in savings in a matter of months.Intel’s record sales, profits and margins augur well for other component makers and hardware manufacturers such as IBM, Dell and Hewlett-Packard in the current earnings season.Research company Gartner this month trimmed its IT dollar spending forecast for 2010 to 3.9 per cent growth, down from 5.3 per cent, largely due to the weakness of the euro.However, it raised its forecast for hardware spending growth to 9.1 per cent from 5.7 per cent.“Hardware was first to feel the pain when the market crashed, what you are seeing here [with Intel] is the resumption of a lot of that spending for replacing ageing and broken machines,” said Richard Gordon, Gartner research vice-president.Business investment in technology has been one of the biggest drivers of America’s economic recovery, contributing 10-15 per cent of total growth in recent quarters. “Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly,” the Federal Reserve noted in its statement on June 23.
365;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Apple sells 1.7m iPhone 4 units on launch;;Apple has notched up 1.7m sales of its latest iPhone in its first three days on the market, setting a new launch-weekend record for the mobile phone industry in spite of supply problems and crashes in online ordering systems.The sales topped the most optimistic projections for the iPhone 4 by analysts, who had published reports predicting sales of as many as 1.5m units. A year ago, Apple sold 1m units of the iPhone 3GS in a similar three-day launch blitz.Existing Apple customers formed the majority of those who queued in line for hours at many stores, showing that the company is strengthening its recurring revenue as people upgrade from previous iPhones.The sales performance will add pressure on its competitors. In a bid to cut into iPhone 4 buying, Motorola announced that a new version of its popular Droid phone, based on Google’s Android operating system, will ship in July.Motorola shipped 2m smartphones in all of the fourth quarter, including the Droid and another model. Shares of other rivals, Nokia and Research in Motion, which makes the BlackBerry, have declined as Apple has gained power.“I’ve never seen anything like this,” said veteran mobile industry analyst Ken Dulaney of Gartner. “They may not have the top marks in every category, but in overall performance they just outdistance everyone else.”The top draw for iPhone 4’s first wave of buyers in the US, UK, Japan, Germany and France was the ability to make video calls on the device, though that is for now limited to communications with other iPhone 4 owners via WiFi networks.The crisper display of the new model was an additional incentive, along with more flexible monthly rate packages from sole US data carrier AT&T.Some customers complained that they had more dropped calls on AT&T’s crowded network with the new phones than they had with their previous iPhones.At least some of that was due to the new design, which includes a 3G antenna built into a metal strip that circumnavigates the phone. After a day of gripes on Thursday, Apple told buyers to make sure they didn’t cover a small black line on the bottom left of the phone when they held it.But others said that phone’s call performance deteriorated even on previous models when they upgraded to Apple’s new software, suggesting a glitch beyond the hardware.One customer emailed Apple chief executive Steve Jobs and said the company’s founder responded that there was no reception issue and that he should “stay tuned”, which was interpreted as a hint that a software fix was in the works.An Apple spokesman didn’t dispute the email’s authenticity but declined to elaborate
366;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-06-25T04:22:25Z;BlackBerry sales fall below expectations;;Disappointing BlackBerry sales caused shares in Research in Motion to fall nearly 5 per cent on Thursday, just as Apple fans queued for hours to buy its rival iPhone 4 smartphone.Toronto-based RIM said it shipped 11.2m devices in its first quarter, ending May 29, and added a net 4.9m new BlackBerry subscribers.Although the company shipped its 100 millionth BlackBerry during the quarter, the figures were at the bottom end of its guidance of 11.2m to 11.8m in handset shipments and subscriber additions of 4.9m to 5.2m. RIM’s disappointing report followed a worse setback for Nokia, the leading smartphone maker, which a week ago warned that its second-quarter profit would miss previous projections. Nokia’s share of the market has held steady, with average selling prices falling, and it is losing out in the high-end of the market dominated by the iPhone.RIM’s numbers fell well short of the spectacular growth disclosed by Apple and Google in recent days.Apple said last week that it took in a record 600,000 orders for its iPhone 4 on its first day.Google said on Wednesday that daily sales of devices based on its Android operating system had risen from 100,000 to 160,000 over the past month. Gartner, a research group, reported last month that RIM’s share of the worldwide smartphone market in the first quarter fell to 19.4 per cent from 20.6 per cent a year earlier.In contrast, Apple’s share rose to 15.4 per cent from 10.5 per cent and Android’s increased to 9.6 per cent from 1.6 per cent.RIM said first-quarter sales grew 24 per cent on the previous year to $4.24bn, but this was below average analyst estimates of $4.35m, according to a Bloomberg survey. The handset maker reported earnings per share increased 41 per cent on a year earlier to $1.38. Quarterly profit was $769m, up from $643m the year before.RIM shares fell 1.8 per cent to close at $58.58 in New York.
367;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
368;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-06-21T15:40:31Z;PC prices;For once, computers are getting more expensive;It is the tech-land equivalent of water flowing uphill: PCs are getting more expensive. The natural law is for computer prices to deflate – usually by 10 to 15 per cent each year. An average PC that cost almost $900 three years ago is about $650 today (it is also a lot better). But Acer, the world’s second biggest PC-maker, has actually increased its average selling price slightly this year, for the first time in five years. Other manufacturers have also reported a better pricing environment. What’s going on?PC prices fall because their manufacturers, having ceded innovation to software and component makers, have few other ways to compete for customers. But this year the semiconductor cycle has swung from a glut to an undersupply and the price of key components has shot up: a DRAM memory chip, for example, has doubled since last year to $40. In past cycles PC-makers coped by putting less memory and hardware in new PCs, but today’s punters are too savvy for that. Absorbing the increased costs, though, would be painful for an industry that already has wafer thin operating margins (9 per cent at HP, 3 per cent at Acer and 4 per cent at Dell at the last count). So they are passing them on to consumers.Demand, though, does not seem to have suffered. Indeed, Acer just raised its third quarter revenue growth forecast from 10 per cent quarter-on-quarter to 15 per cent. A sign, perhaps, that the fad for low-cost netbooks was also a recession phenomenon, and function is becoming as important as price – just look as Apple’s rapid growth. That is not to say the natural law has been rewritten: firmly price-driven emerging markets account for about 40 per cent of industry revenues, and the semiconductor cycle will turn again. Technology consultancy Gartner thinks the average PC price will fall 5 to 10 per cent this year. But beneath the surface, the currents are shifting.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
369;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-06-17T22:12:43Z;OnLive launches ‘cloud gaming’ service;;OnLive, a potentially revolutionary online gaming service, has been launched at the annual E3 video game trade show in Los Angeles in the US, to cautious support from the industry.The first large “cloud gaming” service aims to stream console versions of games over the internet to tens of thousands of players at once, removing the need for the console or for games to be bought in stores.The Silicon Valley-based start-up was flipping the switch on the new service on Thursday and making available 23 titles, including well-known games such as Assassin’s Creed II, made by Ubisoft, and Mass Effect 2 from Electronic Arts.The industry will want to see if OnLive’s technology can deliver video games without “latency” issues – delays of more than a few milliseconds in the action – to different devices over the internet.“We are using the internet and computers in ways that have never been tried before,” said Steve Perlman, OnLive founder and chief executive, in a blog note. “Like any new technology, you can expect a few bumps on take-off, until we reach cruising altitude and achieve a smooth flight.”Van Baker, video game platform analyst with Gartner, a research firm, said OnLive’s goals were challenging. “So many games require quick responses to be successful and I don’t see OnLive getting much traction because of performance and latency issues,” he said.“It’s very much an open question about whether they can succeed.”The digital service is attractive to games publishers in removing the costs of making and distributing packaged goods. They could cut out the cost of retailers and avoid both paying licensing fees to console makers and losing sales in the used disk-based games trade. But publishers are cautious about putting brand new releases on an unproven service and risking upsetting established relationships with retailers such as Gamestop.“Conceptually it’s phenomenal, but we’ll have to see how it works out in practice,” said Strauss Zelnick, executive chairman of Take-Two Interactive, whose current Borderlands and NBA 2K10 titles feature at the launch.“But your pre-existing channel is going to have something to say about it and retail represents 91 per cent of our business and we have to respect that.”OnLive will initially deliver its service to PCs and Mac computers. It plans to sell a small box to attach to a TV that adds internet connectivity and the ability to plug in a games controller.The initial roll-out is in the 48 contiguous US states.OnLive has received financial backing from AT&T, a telecoms operator in the US, the UK’s BT and Belgacom in Europe.It announced this week that AT&T was sponsoring free membership for a year for founding members, before a $5 a month subscription kicks in.
370;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-06-17T12:56:17Z;High-end rivals turn the screws on Nokia;;Nokia warned second-quarter financial results could miss previous guidance, in another sign of pressure on the world’s largest mobile phone maker. The shares fell 9 per cent to €7.22.The Finnish group said tough competition at the high end of the market and a shift towards less profitable products were among the factors behind its reduced earnings estimates.The profit warning, rumoured in the market for several days, highlighted the challenge facing Nokia as it struggles to compete with Apple’s iPhone, Research in Motion’s BlackBerry and a growing range of devices based on Google’s Android software.The move marked the second cut in guidance this year and is sure to intensify pressure on Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, chief executive, after a series of disappointing results and underwhelming product launches.Nick Jones, analyst at Gartner, a technology consultancy, said the reshuffle of top management last month may not be the last leadership change at Nokia this year as investor frustration grows.“It’s looking now as if 2010 won’t be the year in which Nokia’s problems get fixed, and I suspect the investors are running out of patience and will want to hold someone accountable,” he said.Nokia staged a wide-ranging organisational and management shake-up last month in a bid to raise its game. But the board gave a vote of confidence in Mr Kallasvuo, in spite of rising unrest among investors.Speaking to the Financial Times last month, Mr Kallasvuo said that Nokia had a “clear direction” as it shifts its focus from hardware to the software and online services, such as e-mail and music downloads, that increasingly sell phones.Nokia still has by far the biggest share of the global market for smartphones – mobile phones that double as mini computers – but it is losing ground to Apple and others at the high end, where margins are greatest and where brand image is forged.Data from IDC, the market research company, last month showed Nokia’s share of the smartphone market was flat at 39 per cent in the first three months of 2010, while Apple’s share jumped to 16 per cent from 11 per cent a year ago.Total smartphone sales rose 57 per cent in the quarter, showing how Nokia is struggling to exploit the fastest-growing part of the market.The average selling price of a Nokia smartphone fell to €155 ($196) in the first quarter from €190 a year ago, compared with the $600 average price for Apple’s iPhone.Nokia is also facing pressure at the lower end of the mobile phone market from South Korean rivals Samsung and LG and, in emerging markets, from a growing range of low-cost Chinese manufacturers.Depreciation of the euro amid the European debt crisis has also hurt performance through disruptions in pricing and costs, Nokia said.The group now expects second quarter sales in its core mobile devices and services business to be at the lower end of its previous guidance of €6.7bn to €7.2bn, due to lower-than-expected average selling prices and volumes.Operating margins in the devices and services division were expected to be at the lower end of, or slightly below, its previously guided range of 9-12 per cent, which was itself cut in April from an earlier target of 11-13 per cent.The group, which reports second quarter earnings on July 22, said it also expects a slight fall in its share of the overall mobile market in 2010 by value, compared with previous expectations for a slight rise.“We know where we are going. But we have had difficulties with execution at times,” Mr Kallasvuo added.
371;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-06-13T21:26:50Z;TSMC boss sees $30bn chip boost from China;;Rising Chinese demand for electronic goods could add nearly $30bn to the global semiconductor market over the next five years, the head of the world’s biggest contract chipmaker has said.Morris Chang, chief executive and chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, said demand from China would push the industry’s growth rate to 6 or 7 per cent for the next five years, above the 5 per cent rate that he has predicted since returning to the helm a year ago.“Because of China, I am revising my estimate,” he told the FT. “It will be 6 or 7 per cent a year [for the next five years], which is still quite respectable.”Mr Chang’s estimates are closely tracked by the electronics industry because of TSMC’s size – it commands half of the global contract chipmaking market – and because its chips go into nearly every type of electronic product, ranging from consumer electronics, such as computers and mobile phones, to machinery for companies.Global semiconductor sales are likely to reach $290bn this year, according to Gartner, the consultancy. A compounded annual growth rate of 7 per cent for the next five years would result in a market size nearly $30bn bigger than if that growth rate were 5 per cent.Mr Chang said China had become more important after the financial crisis.Beijing had boosted demand with crisis-related subsidies for purchases of appliances and electronic goods in rural areas.However, Mr Chang said growth would be sustainable beyond the temporary stimulus. “I don’t want to over-exaggerate the importance of China [but] it’s not small,” he said.TSMC is on a massive expansion drive partly as a result of this demand. It is spending $2.7bn this year, while over the next few years it will expand capacity by 50 per cent at two factories that are already the world’s biggest. It will also build a third factory of a similar size in central Taiwan.Mr Chang said TSMC's customers had overreacted to the financial crisis by pulling orders too quickly in early 2009.However, their rapid recovery put a strain on TSMC, which had cooled its investment rate. As a result TSMC has been forced to accelerate its expansion to catch up.Overall, the chip industry is “still in the overheating [phase]”, Mr Chang said. “I don’t think it is excessive, but I do expect the growth rate next year may not be as high as everybody hopes.”
372;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-06-10T19:32:35Z;Microsoft Office set to go free online;Move to counter rise of online computing services;Microsoft is set to launch a free online version of its widely used Office software next week, a watershed moment for one of its core businesses as it seeks to counter the rise of Google Docs and other online services.The move comes nearly five years after Ray Ozzie, chief software architect, warned that Microsoft needed to embrace the internet faster. In a landmark speech, Mr Ozzie predicted that a “services disruption” was about to up-end the company’s traditional software business and urged all its developers to treat the move as a matter of urgency.Since then, according to industry observers, the company has moved steadily to add services that complement its software products but has been happy to leave it to others to set the pace in the move towards “cloud computing”, or the handling of applications online.“I wouldn’t quite say they’re dragging their feet, but they’re definitely not moving fast,” said David Smith, an analyst at Gartner.He and others said that the pace reflected a calculated bet by Microsoft that it could extend the life of its current, highly profitable business model without losing out on future opportunities online.“They’re just trying to preserve their existing business – it’s a fine line to walk,” said Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft.With the free, advertising-supported version of Office, together with options that let companies buy some of its capabilities as online services, the latest release of the software “shows we’re all-in, we’re fully engaged with the cloud,” said Stephen Elop, head of the Microsoft Business Division, which gets most of its revenue from Office. He denied that Microsoft was dragging its feet, but said it was moving at the pace of most of its customers who want to continue to use traditional software while starting to add more cloud applications.In spite of that, Office is “the more exposed of Microsoft’s two main businesses” to disruption from the internet, said Mr Rosoff. In its last fiscal year the business division was Microsoft’s largest and most profitable arm, although the launch of Windows 7 has since pushed the operating system back to the forefront.Only about 20 per cent of Office revenues come from consumers, Mr Elop said, and analysts expect only a small proportion to be lost as some users give up software to use the free service.“There’s an upsell opportunity there for us,” Mr Elop added, as the company tries to convert online users to paying customers.Dave Girouard, who runs Google’s online applications, said adoption of its services had accelerated, with new paying customers added at a rate three times faster than a year ago. “These things are moving in our favour,” he said.
373;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-06-03T18:44:15Z;Nokia rolls out pedal-powered charger;;Mobile phone manufacturers have been struggling for years to find ways for users to keep their handsets charged while on the move. On Thursday, Nokia unveiled its latest solution: a pedal-powered battery charger.Cyclists will be able to plug their handsets into a charger mounted on their handlebars and connected to a dynamo that harnesses electricity from the wheels.The product could prove popular among the environmentally conscious as a carbon neutral way to charge a mobile phone, but its main appeal is likely to be in developing countries, where access to electricity is limited.“Bicycles are the most widespread means of transport in many markets around the world, so this is just one more benefit to be gained from an activity people are already doing,” Alex Lambeek, Nokia vice-president, said at a launch event in Nairobi, Kenya.It would take two-and-a-half hours for a cyclist riding at 15km an hour to fully charge a battery, the Finnish group said. The device will be available by the end of the year at a retail price of about €15 ($18).It is hardly the kind of technological breakthrough that is likely to worry Apple, as Nokia struggles to find an answer to the US group’s iPhone in the crucial smartphone market.But the bicycle charger highlights efforts by Nokia to shore up its dominant position at the lower end of the market in the developing world, amid rising competition from cut-price Chinese handsets.China and India were Nokia’s two biggest markets last year, accounting for one-fifth of total revenues, and the group is also strong in Africa, the Middle East and Russia.Nokia is trying to defend its leadership by introducing mobile services, such as email and music downloads, that, in many cases, represent users’ only way of accessing the internet.In India, it has launched a service that allows farmers to access weather forecasts and crop prices using their phone. The group is also developing financial services that enable users without bank accounts to pay bills and transfer money through their handsets.The bicycle charger fits the same strategy of adding value to Nokia phones that copy-cat producers cannot match.Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner, says Nokia is doing a good job of building brand loyalty in the developing world, where future success and failure is likely to be determined. But she warns that Nokia must still find a way to become more competitive in the high-end smartphone market, where margins are greatest and brand image is forged.“Most people in emerging markets can still only afford an entry-level phone, but they need a high-end product to aspire to.”
374;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-06-03T15:59:56Z;Climate change: Winners and losers within sectors start to emerge;;The response to climate change has been uneven across sectors. Some have taken the opportunity to make widespread changes, while others have moved less quickly.Two types of companies have been most affected by climate change. First, fossil- fuel-intensive ones, such as energy producers, miners, steelmakers and cement groups, and, second, businesses with a strong consumer focus.The Carbon Disclosure Project found that utilities and energy companies stood out when it came to identifying risks and opportunities of climate change, but financial services companies – which are very consumer-focused – also did well.In terms of overall performance, however, the information and communication technology (ICT) sector performed best, probably because it sees real opportunities in dealing with climate change.“The sectors doing best are those that are able to grow profitably in a rational response to climate change,” says Paul Dickinson, CDP chief executive. “Anyone involved in the process of dematerialising the economy – doing more with less, essentially – is well placed.”He cites the example of video-conferencing. Companies such as Cisco, with its slogan “Work is not a place, it’s an activity”, are taking advantage of high fuel prices, the impending inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and advances in technology to create an alternative to business travel. The sector has repackaged itself as “telepresence” and analyst Gartner estimates it will replace 2.1m airline seats by 2012.“In the past two years, the ICT sector has started to create business models and has discovered areas where ICT can be embedded, from smarter buildings and grids to logistics,” says Peter Lacy, head of Accenture’s Europe, Middle East and Africa sustainability practice. “Some disruptive changes are coming, and business leaders understand that.”Renewable and nuclear energy providers, electric vehicle makers and energy efficiency companies are also likely to see growing markets.However, performance within sectors remains variable, Mr Lacy warns. “About a third of companies are really making progress, another third are muddling along doing the bare minimum, and the final third are not really doing enough.”David Symons, a director at environmental consultancy WSP, agrees: “Responding to climate change is less about sector, and more about the performance of individual companies in those sectors.”This difference in performance is important, not just for the companies themselves but also for their investors. In a report on the carbon risks in UK equity funds, Trucost, an analysis outfit, found that the carbon footprints of individual portfolios ranged from 209 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per £1m ($1.4m) to 1,487 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per £1m.“The significant variation in the carbon footprints of portfolios indicates varied exposure to carbon costs,” the firm says. An analysis of US mutual funds found an even starker division – the lowest carbon footprint was 40 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per £1m while the largest was 1,549 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per £1m.In general, the best records on climate change tend to be in Europe, followed by North America. However, a transformation is under way in some emerging markets triggered by the economic stimulus packages that emerged from the financial crisis, says Nick Robins, head of the Climate Change Centre of Excellence at HSBC.“These funds – in places such as South Korea – are going towards energy efficiency and transport projects that will position both national economies and companies to benefit from green growth.”Companies in consumer-focused businesses are at the forefront of many business sustainability initiatives because “the biggest democracy in the world is how people spend their money – every time they buy something, consumers are voting,” says Mr Dickinson.“People are worried about climate change, and it will only increase in importance. Those identified with the problem will face trouble, while those identified with solutions will clean up.”Consumer-focused companies such as retailers have moved on from greening their own operations to driving down the environmental impact of supply chains.Walmart has announced plans to cut 20m tonnes of CO2 emissions from its supply chain by 2015, for example.“It is something customers and employees expect us to be involved in,” says Lucy Carver, director of The Bigger Picture, Sky’s responsible business initiative. The company’s activities extend from more efficient set-top boxes for customers to a top-rated broadcast centre and into its programming.“We want to take climate change to consumers who may not have engaged with the issue before. We are in 9.7m homes – this is a way of playing to our strengths,” Ms Carver says.According to HSBC’s Mr Robins, “Climate change is a necessary competence that all companies must have. For some it will be a key revenue driver.”
375;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-05-31T19:52:08Z;Large claims for tablets are a little hard to swallow;;"Computex, the world’s second-biggest IT trade fair, does not officially start until Tuesday, but already the hype is in full swing about which tablet personal computer will challenge the iPad as the hottest product of the year.The chief executive of Nvidia, the specialist graphics card company that is also a big supplier of chips for tablet PCs, kicked things off by making the prediction that within five years “tablets will be the world’s biggest computing category”. Jen-hsun Huang said tablets could even surpass netbooks and notebook PCs in terms of volume.This is a bold claim, given that Gartner, the technology research group, expects only 12m tablet-like devices to be sold this year and even the most optimistic projections say that tablets would only take up 50m-60m of the 700m PC units sold by 2014.Mr Huang says, however, that three key factors missing in the past are now coming together to make this possible.For tablets to succeed, the industry needed effective touchscreen display, a mobile processor (such as Nvidia’s Arm-based Tegra processors, Mr Huang would say), and a suitable operating system.While the first two have arguably been present for a while, it was not until recently that Google’s Android emerged as a potent challenger.“We finally have an operating system to unite behind …now we need to raise the bar on what tablets are capable of,” Mr Huang says.Solar loses its shineWith BP still struggling to plug its broken deep-water well in the Gulf of Mexico and end what looks like the worst oil spill in US history, these should be sunny days indeed for investors in the relatively clean business of renewable energy.Even solar power, the midget among renewables in terms of its current output, is credited with a bright future. The International Energy Agency said this month that solar plants could be producing 22 per cent of global electricity needs by 2050.Unfortunately, as European investors are now being reminded, solar power in particular depends heavily on subsidies. And the arrival of a new age of austerity to rescue the public finances of eurozone member states means some governments are regretting their earlier generosity.Nowhere is this more obvious than in Spain. The problem is not just that the embattled Spanish government will reduce subsidies for new projects; the industry regards cuts as inevitable, even sensible, given that subsidies are delivered via the wholesale prices paid to producers and will have to be repaid eventually through higher prices for consumers. More serious is the fear that the government will cut previously agreed subsidies for projects already built or under construction.Uncertainty over possible retroactive subsidy cuts has cast a long shadow over the sun-drenched Spanish landscape, and Miguel Sebastián, industry minister, has so far done little to allay the doubts.Two initial public offerings in renewable energy have been recently postponed, at least in part over the uncertain future of Spanish price support. Abengoa, the energy and engineering group, expects its profits to be affected at least temporarily by changes to the subsidy regime. FCC, the infrastructure and services group, has just announced a freeze on €600m ($737m) of investments in two thermo-solar plants.Unfortunately for the industry, solar power subsidies are an easy target in times of crisis.It does not help the industry’s case that profit margins on some new plants have soared as a result of the falling cost of solar panels, that they stand to make outsize profits for the best part of 20 years, and that the technology thus subsidised is often out of date even before it is installed.Nor is it any help that the National Energy Commission has been investigating solar plants reportedly producing power at night; investigators say what happened was that wind producers registered as solar generators to claim the higher subsidies available.Still, Spain should avoid throwing out the renewable energy baby with the dirty bath water.Thermosolar energy is regarded as being a more competitive source of bulk electricity than arrays of photovoltaic cells. And the promotion of wind energy, despite the occasional abuses, has been a big success, reducing Spain’s energy import bill, cutting its carbon dioxide emissions and encouraging the growth of internationally competitive energy companies.Supporting renewable energy through subsidies is not necessarily foolish. But Spain’s experience shows that it needs to be done with more forethought and a better assessment of costs and benefits.world.view@ft.com"

377;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-05-19T17:21:56Z;Android overtakes Windows in smartphones;;Sales of smartphones using Google’s Android operating system have overtaken Microsoft’s Windows mobile phones for the first time according to figures published on Wednesday.Sales of Android phones, which include Google’s own Nexus One and Motorola’s Droid, accounted for just under 10 per cent of all smartphones sold globally in the first quarter of 2010, up from just 1.6 per cent last year, according to figures from Gartner, the technology research group.In contrast, Microsoft, whose Windows Mobile operating system has been available since 2003, saw a sharp drop in market share, from 10.2 per cent a year ago to 6.8 per cent in the first three months of this year.Android phone sales have also overtaken Apple’s iPhone in the North American market, accounting for 26.6 per cent of units sold, compared with 22.1 per cent for the iPhone.Apple is the sole vendor of the iPhone, while several different manufacturers use the Android system and there are more than 20 phones using Android worldwide, according to Google.However, the figures underscore just how quickly Google has been able to take a sizeable stake in the mobile phone market. The first Android phones only came to market in October 2008.“We were always bullish about the potential of Android but it is surprising how quickly it has happened. US carriers have really pushed the advertising around Android,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner.Android phone shipments increased more than eight-fold in the US year on year.In February, Google hinted at strong growth, saying about 60,000 Android phones were being shipped every day.Microsoft is planning to release a new operating system, Windows Phone 7, by the end of this year in an attempt to recapture market share.Previews of the new software have been favourable, but the much-delayed Windows Phone 7 devices may simply be too late to the market to compete.“Consumers still see Windows as a business brand,” Ms Milanesi said.Nokia’s Symbian smartphones and Research In Motion’s BlackBerry also saw their market shares eroded. Nokia fell from 48.8 per cent of smartphone sales to 44.3 per cent, and RIM dipped from 20.6 to 19.6 per cent.Nokia has been hurt by launch delays of a series of smartphones this year.Overall, sales of mobile phones in the first three months of the year were 314.7m, a 17 per cent rise from the same period in 2009. It is the fastest pace of growth the industry has seen for four years.Smartphones were again the fastest-growing segment of the market, rising 48.7 per cent to reach 54.3m units.
378;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-05-19T16:50:02Z;Netbooks face tablet challenge;;The netbook has been knocked off its perch as the fastest growing category in the PC industry, toppled by two newer concepts that pose a challenge for the world’s biggest chipmaker.Intel has dominated netbooks with its Atom microprocessor, but ultra-thin notebooks and tablet devices are enjoying a huge growth spurt.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel’s rival in “x86” processors, has led in the development of ultra-thin or Consumer Ultra Low Voltage (CULV) as the category is known, while a host of semiconductor makers are competing in tablets with chips based on designs by the UK’s Arm.In addition, Intel is unrepresented in a sub-category of netbooks known as smartbooks, which favour Arm-based chips and 3G wireless connectivity.“Everybody says tablets are going to eat the notebooks’ and netbooks’ lunch,” Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, told analysts at the company’s annual investor meeting last week, while insisting: “On the scale of the PC industry, they’re relatively insignificant.” Mr Otellini said tablets were fundamentally consumption devices that would not take away market share from netbooks.He showed a chart representing 700m PCs shipped a year by 2014, with desktop PCs growing at an annual rate of 2.4 per cent, notebooks at 22 per cent, netbooks 15 per cent and tablets 73-88 per cent, according to the Gartner and InStat research firms.Despite the high growth rates for tablets, they would only take up 50m-60m of those 700m units by 2014 on the most optimistic estimates, he pointed out.Netbook shipments grew by about 103 per cent in 2009, but the market is now maturing. The iSuppli research company predicts growth of 30 per cent this year and 19 per cent in 2011.Intel feels it can help sustain the category with battery life and performance improvements from Atom. It also sees strong growth at better price points in emerging markets.Mooly Eden, general manager of Intel’s PC Client Group, told analysts Intel was serious about tablets and would actively participate in the category. “Stay tuned for Computex,” he said, referring to the upcoming Taipei show.Taiwanese manufacturers planning tablets seem to be giving Intel a serious look“Arm is better than Intel at power consumption but that is because its performance is not nearly as good,” said Sambora Chen, marketing director of notebooks at MSi. “That is not so much a problem in mobile phones because the display is much smaller, but it is an issue for notebooks and tablets.”Arm processors have dominated in mobile phones because their low-power operation extends battery life. As their performance has improved, they have come into competition with Intel’s Atom chips which, in turn, are becoming competitive on low-power operations.The Apple iPad’s A4 processor is reported to have an Arm-based design. Marvell Technology said recently it would ship Arm-based server chips this year, challenging a core Intel strength.Intel has said its latest Atom chips should start to appear in smartphones in the second half, although handset makers seem reluctant to switch.Tsai Ming-kai, Mediatek chief executive, says because all its chips have been designed with Arm “it just takes too much effort” to switch to Intel.AMD has not produced a processor that is competitive with Atom in netbooks and smaller devices. Instead, it came up with the ultra-thin or “thin and light” concept for notebooks early in 2009, hoping consumers would turn to a category that provided more functionality and bigger screens than netbooks, but was still light, affordable and capable of long battery life.For its latest generation, it has announced 26 ultra-thin notebooks, up 30 per cent on last year, offering up to eight hours of battery life. Intel is expected to respond in the second half with ultra-low voltage versions of its Core i3 and i5 processors.
379;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-05-11T22:00:13Z;SAP on lookout for large acquisitions;;SAP is scanning the market for large acquisitions, its co-chief executive said, as Germany’s largest software maker moves faster into new technological fields.In an interview with the FT, Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP’s co-head, underlined the company’s commitment to push the world leader in enterprise software back towards growth, which he said could include takeovers.“M&A is certainly on the agenda. But it is not relevant for us to buy market share or consolidate legacy,” Mr Snabe said. If SAP were to make an acquisition, it would be to move the company forward in terms of new technology, he added.Asked if this could include large-scale takeovers such as the €4.8bn ($6.1bn) acquisition of Business Objects, its rival, almost three years ago, Mr Snabe, 44, said: “We are certainly looking for such opportunities.”His comments reflected the regained confidence at the group, which suffered an erosion of trust and business momentum in the past year.The woes triggered the departure of Léo Apotheker, chief executive, in February, and the appointment of Mr Snabe and Bill McDermott as co-chief executives.“The main themes Bill and I have focused on are two factors: our relationship to customers and our speed of innovation,” Mr Snabe said.Analysts have voiced doubts over whether SAP can succeed in its aim to return to its former growth path of double-digit sales increases.Thomas Otter, an analyst at Gartner, said: “The risk is that SAP becomes less relevant, and is increasingly isolated as a utility that runs the back office, rather than a vendor that companies turn to for growth.”Mr Snabe countered that SAP would become more agile with the removal of hierarchical layers and the instalment of small development teams. “We believe there is a big opportunity in combining scale and speed,” he said.The mathematician announced an ambitious target when he said SAP would become market leader in on-demand products within the next five years.Such software is being used remotely rather than being licensed and installed on a computer, and SAP is making its first foray into this area this summer.“In five years, we are hopefully the number one in on premise software, on-demand software and on device software,” he said.Mr Snabe dismissed fears that Business by Design, the company’s often-delayed on-demand product for medium-sized customers that will launch in July, would lead to an erosion of the group’s margins.“If we grow our business with on-demand software we can still expand our margin,” he added.
380;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-05-10T19:31:25Z;Android’s smartphone surge surprise;;Android overtaking the iPhone in the smartphone market may have been inevitable, but few expected it to happen this fast.Android sailed past Apple on US smartphones in the first quarter, according to the NPD research firm, with 28 per cent of unit sales, compared to 36 per cent for BlackBerry maker RIM and 21 per cent for those using the Apple operating system.There are caveats. NPD based its figures on 150,000 completed online consumer research surveys rather than actual sales figures.Further, a comScore survey in April showed the Google-led operating system more than doubling its smartphone subscriber market share in February, but to only 9 per cent from 4 per cent three months earlier. Apple had stayed constant at around 25 per cent.Again, comScore’s figures are not based on actual sales, but on monitored usage of smartphones.To add to the confusion, AdMob, the mobile advertising network, reported 50 per cent share for Apple in February and 24 per cent for Android. But its figures are based on requests made to its network to serve ads, reflecting the iPhone’s dominance in applications.The Gartner research firm predicted last September that Android would overtake the Apple OS on smartphones worldwide by 2012, when they would have 18 per cent and 14 per cent share respectively, but that forecast now seems too conservative.Andy Rubin, Google’s vice president of mobile engineering, commented last summer that the iPhone platform could not scale compared to Android, as Android would be available on many more devices from different manufacturers.That was certainly true in the first quarter, with a variety of Android devices to choose from and a range of carriers, compared to AT&T’s exclusivity with the iPhone.Verizon had a buy-one-get-one-free promotion for Android phones and it has been a major driver of the platform’s recent success, with its heavy marketing of the Droid phone.“As in the past, carrier distribution and promotion have played a crucial role in determining smartphone market share,” said Ross Rubin, NPD analyst, in a statement.“In order to compete with the iPhone, Verizon Wireless has expanded its buy-one-get-one offer beyond RIM devices to now include all of their smartphones.”Apple is expected to unveil its next-generation iPhone in June, but it will find itself facing more than a dozen Android alternatives in the US, compared to the solitary HTC offering from T-Mobile when the iPhone 3GS launched a year earlier.
381;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-04-28T20:43:59Z;Hewlett Packard to buy Palm for $1.2bn;;Hewlett-Packard has stepped in to buy the troubled smartphone maker Palm, announcing a $1.2bn deal on Thursday that brings to an end the growing doubts over the future of the personal technology brand.The deal will catapult HP, the world’s largest tech company in terms of revenue, into the middle of the rapidly growing smartphone business in direct competition with a handful of other tech giants, including Apple, Google and Microsoft.HP said it would pay $5.70 a share in cash for the company, representing a 23 per cent premium over its closing stock price on Thursday.Palm’s shares have fallen by three-quarters from their peak six months ago as the Silicon Valley-based company has failed to drum-up the sales it needed to convince Wall Street that it could remain an independent company.Shane Robison, chief strategy and technology officer at HP, said the company was making the purchase mainly to get its hands on Palm’s Web OS operating system, which has won plaudits in the tech world since its launch early last year. HP executives also hinted that they would use the software in future for larger “tablet” computers to rival Apple’s iPad.The purchase brings a new twist in the shifting rivalries between some of the world’s biggest tech companies as they jostle for position in the booming market for smartphones and tablets. As the world’s biggest PC maker HP has been a close ally of Microsoft, but will now find itself a direct competitor in software.“This will probably anger Microsoft,” said Ken Dulaney, an analyst at Gartner. He also questioned HP’s decision to spread its efforts across different operating systems, adding: “They’ve got a lot of work to do on both fronts.”The purchase is intended to jump-start HP’s smartphone business by bringing both technology and developers from Palm, Mr Robison said.Although an early leader in the hand-held PCs that preceded smartphones, HP has stood by until now while first Apple and then Google revolutionised the business with a new generation of touch-screen devices.Palm’s value to HP also lay in its portfolio of more than 1,000 patents, which will make it easier for the company to carve out a place in the market, Mr Robison said.Palm also revealed on Wednesday that it had suffered a further sharp deterioration in its smartphone sales and cash reserves, adding to its urgency in finding an acquirer. The company said revenues this quarter were likely to reach only $90-100m, compared to the $300m Wall Street had been expecting as recently as last month. It also said its cash would fall to $350-400m by the end of May from $592m three months before, prompting analysts to predict that it could run out of cash before the end of the year.
382;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-04-27T16:48:24Z;Smartphone demand doubles Arm earnings;;Profits at Arm nearly doubled in the first quarter of 2010, thanks to growing demand for high-end smartphones, such as the Apple iPhone, which use microchips designed by the Cambridge-based company.Arm, whose designs are also used in Apple’s iPad, said shipments of chips into mobile devices increased 50 per cent year-on-year. Sales of smartphone chips alone increased about 30 to 40 per cent.Warren East, chief executive, said Arm was planning to hire about 100 more engineers this year – the first headcount additions for four years – mainly to work on high-end processors that are used in smartphones and netbooks.Arm-based chips are already used in more than 95 per cent of the mobile phones in the world, but as phones become more complex, with computer-like functions, they need more semiconductors to run them. There are now on average 2.4 Arm-based chips in each phone sold globally, compared with 1.9 a year ago.Smartphone sales increased 24 per cent in 2009 in an otherwise flat mobile phone market, according to Gartner, the technology researcher. Analysts at Nielsen, another research firm, expect smartphones to account for half of all US handset sales by the end of next year.“It underpins our confidence. Arm is well exposed to a multi-year trend of increasing smartphone penetration,” said Tim Score, chief financial officer.Arm’s royalty revenue rose 33 per cent year-on -year, compared with a 20 per cent increase in global chip shipments, showing that the company was gaining market share.Pre-tax profits for the three months to the end of March were £25.9m (£13.1m). Earnings per share were 1.47p (0.77p) while revenue rose 16 per cent to £92.3m, ahead of expectations. The shares fell 6.8p to 251.8p.● FT CommentEven before smartphones Arm was a juggernaut, generating huge royalty revenue from chips used in everything from light switches to washing machines. Inclusion in the iPad raises the possibility of expansion into lucrative areas of computing, even rival Intel’s heartland of servers.That said, the shares, on about 30 times earnings expectations, trade at a substantial premium to the average for the global semiconductor sector of 17 to 20 times. The share price has more than doubled in the past year, most recently lifted by a rumour that Apple was considering bidding for the company. No one faults Arm’s fundamentals, but at these levels the valuation looks full.
383;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-04-22T12:28:07Z;Nokia cuts guidance as phone launch delayed;;Nokia cut profit guidance for its key mobile phone division on Thursday after announcing a delay to the launch of a new range of high-end phones that would help it compete with popular devices such as the iPhone and BlackBerry.Shares in the Finnish handset maker fell 14.2 per cent to €9.68.“We will not ship the product until the quality meets the end-user needs and demands,” said Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, chief executive. He admitted it had been more difficult than anticipated to get the technology right.Though Nokia is still the world’s largest handset maker by volume, it has struggled to compete in high-end phones, the fastest-growing segment of the market.The N95, launched in 2006, was the company’s last hit smartphone, and since then its products have been overshadowed by rival devices with larger, touch-screen displays.“Everyone else has caught up and Nokia has been left behind,” said Carolina Milanesi, handset analyst at the Gartner research company.Nokia is to challenge the iPhone with a new range of phones, which Mr Kallasvuo promised would be “more intuitive, more fun and faster”. But shipments, previously expected in June, will be delayed until the third quarter.“Competition will only get tougher in the second half with the run-up to Christmas,” Ms Milanesi said.In the meantime, competitive pressure is taking its toll. Although Nokia’s share of the smartphone market increased to 41 per cent in the first quarter, from 38 per cent last time, this came at a cost.Nokia said operating margins for its handset division would be 11-13 per cent in 2010, down from a previous forecast of 12-14 per cent.The average selling price of Nokia phones fell from €66 to €62 as the company was forced to slash prices. The average price of smartphones slid to €155 in the first three months of the year, from €190 a year ago.In sharp contrast, this week Apple announced a 90 per cent increase in profits and doubled sales of the iPhone, at an average selling price of $600.Nokia first-quarter sales rose 3 per cent to €9.5bn ($12.6bn), with handset sale rises offsetting a fall in the Nokia Siemens infrastructure business.Operating profit increased nearly eightfold from €55m to €488m, thanks to extensive cost cuts last year, including axeing thousands of jobs. Earnings per share rose from €0.03 to €0.09.
384;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-04-22T09:03:13Z;Hynix posts best quarter in three years;;Hynix Semiconductor, the world's second largest memory chipmaker, on Thursday reported its biggest quarterly profit in more than three years as demand for personal computers and a shortage of chips helped push up prices.Kim Min-chul, Hynix’s chief financial officer, forecast that demand for the South Korean company’s chips would remain strong throughout the year as the global economy continued to improve.Hynix plans to almost double its production capacity for Nand flash memory chips, which are used in gadgets such as the iPhone and iPad, by the end of this year as demand is expected to grow further on new product launches.The South Korean chipmaker on Thursday reported Won817.2bn ($737m, €551m) in first-quarter net profit, compared with a Won1,190bn net loss a year earlier. It was the highest since a record Won858bn profit in the fourth quarter of 2006. Sales more than doubled to Won2,780bn.The results provided further evidence of that the semiconductor industry is emerging from a three-year slump.Hynix has benefited in particular from increased demand for PCs, which use the dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) chips that it produces.PC shipments increased 27 per cent in the first quarter to 84.3m units, according to research firm Gartner. Hynix said the average price of its D-ram chips rose 3 per cent in the first quarter from the previous quarter.“D-Ram prices were much better than expected,” Mr Kim said. “We expect supply to rise going into the second half but a significant growth in supply is structurally limited …we are cautiously optimistic.”Prices of Hynix’s Nand flash memory chips, meanwhile, fell 8 per cent in the first quarter.Hynix has earmarked Won2,300bn for capital spending this year, up from Won1,000bn last year. The company said last month it may increase capital spending further this year if chip supply shortages continue.Earlier this week Elpida reported better-than-expected results with an estimated net profit of Y2bn ($21m) for the last financial year while Taiwanese companies such as Nanya Technology and Inotera Memories posted wider quarterly losses than expected. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, last week forecast record profits for this year.Separately, LG Display, the world’s second largest liquid crystal display screen maker, reported a net profit of Won649bn in the first quarter versus a Won347bn loss a year earlier. Sales jumped 66 per cent to Won5,876bn as the industry’s recovery gathers pace with strong TV sales and new product launches such as Apple’s iPad.LG Display, a supplier to Apple’s iPad tablet PC, is spending $1.3bn to increase output as it struggles to meet rising demand. Taiwan’s AU Optronics on Thursday also returned to profit in the first quarter.
385;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-04-15T18:28:14Z;Shares in ‘cool technology’ Toumaz could turn red hot;;"Little-known Toumaz Holdings will on Friday be named by Gartner Group as one of its “cool technologies for 2010”.The Aim-listed, Imperial College London spin-out has rarely attracted much attention from investors but is causing a stir in the healthcare industry.Chris Toumazou, its founder and chief executive, has developed a disposable “digital plaster” that contains a microchip and electrocardiogram pads.About the size of a credit card, it is stuck to a patient’s chest and monitors vital signs such as body temperature, heart rate and respiration for problems such as diabetes over a five-day period.The plaster wirelessly transmits data to a server that can download the information to a nurse’s station or doctor’s handheld device at a power 100 times lower than Bluetooth.It means patients can be monitored round the clock but without invasive tubes or expensive hospital-based systems.Mr Toumazou said the digital plasters, the culmination of eight years’ work, will cost about $35 (£23) each and offer savings to the National Health Service by averting serious clinical incidents and more intensive emergency treatment.Successful trials have been conducted at St Mary’s hospital in west London. To help illustrate the technology’s credibility in the industry, the group appointed Sir Richard Sykes as executive chairman a year ago. Sir Richard is chairman of the World Health Organisation international advisory board that oversees the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. He is also a former chairman and chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline.To crack the US market, it has signed a development deal with CareFusion, the US medical technology company. Further trials are being conducted in the US and CareFusion is guiding the digital plasters through US Food and Drug Administration approval, which is expected at the end of the year. The technology already has European approval.The short-term aim is to monitor patients with chronic illness or those requiring post-operative care, but Mr Toumazou sees further applications as the cost and size of the semiconductor falls.A potential market could be home diagnostic kits, but Mr Toumazou said the chip could also be used to give handheld home electronic devices portable internet radio receivers.But it remains early days for Toumaz’s story and consequently its shares only trade at 7.2p, giving it a market capitalisation of £41m. Annual results last month showed revenue rose from £2.7m to £4m, although pre-tax losses widened from £2.7m to £4.8m due to investment and a restructuring of the board.Nevertheless, its financial position looks secure thanks to its partnerships and a year-end cash position of £9m. Broker FinnCap is forecasting revenue to rise to £4.6m in 2010 and mushroom to £12m in 2011, when it is expected to become profitable. Should it receive FDA approval, 2010 could yet be the milestone its supporters are hoping for.Thirst grows for AmiadThe past 18 months have been tough for Amiad Filtration Systems.Revenues for the year to December 31 at the London-listed Israeli water filtration group fell from $73.3m (£47.4m) to $69.1m as the global economic slowdown bit – a marked change to the 20 per cent annual growth of the past three years.The shortfall was in its traditionally strong irrigation market – Amiad’s products were developed from providing water for a kibbutz in Israel.But demand improved from heavy and extractive industries such as mining in Chile, Turkey and Brazil and Arik Dayan, chief executive, expects the market to continue growing. India is the group’s main growth target and last year secured its first deal for its self-cleaning filters.Meanwhile, Mr Dayan has launched a bid for Arkal Filtration Systems Co-operative Agricultural Society, Amiad’s main domestic competitor of the past 40 years. The deal is expected to close in the next few months and will give Amiad enhanced technology that could help it win contracts at municipal water treatment plants. It is also intended to make Amiad the largest water filtration company in the world.In spite of the fall in turnover, pre-tax profits rose 30 per cent to $8.7m. It held its final dividend at 4.3 cents for a 7.8 cents total. Net cash rose from $6.5m to $8.6m, intended for further deals.Having navigated through the downturn, Amiad looks well positioned. Demand for recycled water is higher than ever, as China and India industrialise and develop their middle classes. From commune to global leader would be quite a journey.philip.stafford@ft.com

386;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-04-07T19:30:23Z;Servers soaring as recession thaws;;At Intel’s launch of its newest processors in San Francisco last week, Jean Gonnord of France’s atomic energy commission gave a thank-you speech to the chipmaker.The programme director for numerical simulation at the Commissariat à l’Énergie Atomique (CEA) told the audience he appreciated the on-time delivery of his order for 18,000 of the chipmaker’s new Xeon 7500 8-core chips.Priced at more than $2,500 (€1,877, £1,642) each, perhaps Intel should have been thanking him.The order is destined for just one supercomputer – among the world’s five fastest – which will run checks on France’s nuclear arsenal. The order might be exceptional in size, but it is typical of the major upgrades taking place in servers and high-performance computing (HPC) this year.The “refresh cycle” is good news for chipmakers such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and for server vendors, who are led in terms of sales by IBM, followed by Hewlett Packard, Dell and Oracle.A once-in-a-decade market inflection took place in the fourth quarter of 2009 as business shook off the effects of the recession, according to IDC, the research firm.Although full-year server revenues for 2009 were down nearly 20 per cent on 2008, the rot stopped late in the year as companies re-evaluated their needs for server upgrades.“There have been a lot of deferrals of orders that should have gone through in 2009, so to that extent there is pent-up demand,” says Jean Bozman, IDC server analyst.“Also, the bigger, older servers …some have been held onto for a very long time and technology has gotten so much better.”About 40 per cent of the installed base of higher-end servers are still running single-core processors and, according to Gartner, the research firm, more than 1m server upgrades were delayed by the downturn.Switching to energy-efficient multi-core servers can dramatically cut the amount of power, space and cooling needed for them in data centres, meaning they can pay for themselves in less than a year.“You can get your money back in five months and in seven months you’re making money,” says Kirk Skaugen, general manager of Intel’s data centre group. “It’s a cash machine for IT [departments].”Some of this surplus is going into new projects, which in turn require new equipment, according to Steve Schuckenbrock, Dell’s head of large business deals. “We’re going to see this run for a long time,” he said.Intel’s smaller rival AMD launched its own line-up of high-end server processors – the Opteron 6000 series – the day before Intel and claims it offers similar performance but better value in different segments of the server market.“Just because people are having to go through a refresh because they’ve got to end-of-life on their servers or they’re no longer supported on their warranty, that doesn’t mean they’re going to rush out and buy the most expensive servers,” says John Fruehe, head of server marketing at AMD.Both chipmakers and server manufacturers have timed their new offerings to perfection, says Jim Ganthier, vice-president of marketing for Hewlett Packard’s industry standard servers division.“We’re seeing a perfect convergence of new products coming along at just the right time and we are able to deliver radical [returns on investment] to our customers.”He says the work of 20 old servers can now be done on just one new HP ProLiant server and buyers can see a return on investment in about two months.As well as more powerful hardware, consolidation of servers is being further enhanced by virtualisation software. This allows servers to be split into many virtual machines and pooled with others to allow greater task-sharing.Other factors driving server sales include the growth of cloud computing, where web services and applications are delivered from data centres and the need for business information to be served in real-time.JPMorgan analysts expect server revenues to grow in 2010 at a higher rate than other segments such as PCs, printers and storage.The new processors will drive more than profits as they help scientists better predict natural disasters, explore the universe and tackle major diseases.“We’re going to transform scientific discovery at a rate and pace never before seen on earth,” says Mr Skaugen.Additional reporting by Joseph Menn
387;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-04-04T22:49:11Z;Much-hyped iPad proves a strong draw;;"Thousands of technology aficionados who flocked to Apple’s US retail stores at the weekend to pick up the computer maker’s most important new product since the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, found ample supplies of the iPad instead of the sell-out debut analysts had predicted.The launch performance was strong, judging by the lines and customer reactions, if not a blowout.“Sales are going about as expected,” said Gartner analyst Ken Dulaney. “Early evaluations are mixed – some ecstatic and others pointing out real limitations of the product.”Gene Munster, analyst at Piper Jaffray, said Apple’s ability to fulfil orders in spite of a production bottleneck suggested it might have sold 600,000-700,000 iPads – more than double his earlier estimate. Others said the remaining inventory meant Apple had overestimated demand when it limited pre-orders to two per customer.Apple had said it wanted to produce 1m iPads per month – “clearly in excess of demand”, said Ashok Kumar, an industry analyst at Rodman & Renshaw.“Eventually it will find a niche and a success, but it’s not going to be of the scale and scope of the iPhone.”More important than sales chalked up is the enthusiasm of early adopters. Unlike the iPhone or iPod, which the iPad resembles in touch-screen functionality, the $499-plus gadget is a luxury rather than a must-have. More-over, it requires a separate computer during set-up.Social networking were filled with excited posts from the Apple faithful who bought their iPads first. Buyers raved about watching streaming movies with their Netflix subscriptions, the crisp appearance of photos and the ability to surf a large-screen web with nothing but their fingers. “It’s the beginning of the end for the standard laptop,” said Brett Kacmarczyk, a 48-year-old police officer.Some who came to look said it was not worth the price until a camera and other features were introduced. “I’m sure I’ll get one in a few months,” said Ted Smith, who owns an iPhone, in New York. “I think it fills the niche between the personal
computer and the iPhone.”A critical factor is the online marketplace for applications. Many of the most popular free apps at the weekend came from media companies, according to the running sales tally on Apple’s app store. They included a player from the ABC network and newspaper apps from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and USA Today.The most frequently downloaded paid apps include Apple’s Keynote presentation software and Electronic Arts’ iPad version of Scrabble, both priced at $10, and a Major League Baseball app and the Flight Control game from Firemint, both $5.Reviews were favourable, with some exceptions. At Boing Boing, an influential blog on technology and other topics, editor Xeni Jardin said the “iPad hits a completely new pleasure spot”. But another editor of the site urged readers not to buy one: Cory Doctorow said Apple had too much control over what people could run on their machines.Others praised the feel of the device, but said it fell short of what a laptop computer could do.Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and Jonathan Birchall in New York"
388;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-03-31T17:28:42Z;Chinese growth boosts Huawei’s margins;;Huawei, the world’s second-largest telecoms equipment maker, on Wednesday reported a jump in its profit margins for 2009 as it outgrew rivals with a boost in its China home market.Net profit for 2009 was Rmb18.3bn ($2.7bn), up 133 per cent from a year earlier, mainly from foreign exchange gains, the company said. Without the forex factor, net earnings rose 26 per cent on a 19 per cent increase in revenue.While the pace of revenue increase was sharply down on the 40 per cent growth rate in 2008, the company’s growth was still exceptional in a shrinking market last year.Huawei and ZTE, its smaller Chinese peer, both increased their global market shares last year, according to Gartner.Ericsson leads the telecoms equipment sector with 20.8 per cent. Huawei’s share rose from 11.5 per cent in 2008 to 14.2 per cent in 2009, while Alcatel Lucent and Nokia Siemens Networks, its closest rivals, saw a slight erosion in market share.Rivals have pointed to Huawei’s lower prices as a main reason for its market share gains, but its operating margin rose from 12.9 per cent in 2008 to 14.1 per cent last year.“The explanation is that the sales in China had a higher margin than in overseas markets, given the lower cost for Huawei to deliver the 3G equipment in urban areas in 2009, compared with that in rural regions,” said Fang Meiqin, associate director at the BDA telecoms consultancy in Beijing.After China handed out licences for third-generation mobile services in January 2009, its three state-owned telecoms operators cranked up capital expenditure and rolled out 3G networks, starting in major cities.ZTE and Huawei took the lion’s share of orders from China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom for those networks. As a result, China accounted for 30 per cent of Huawei’s revenues last year, up from 25 per cent in 2008.As a privately held company, Huawei does not have to report earnings. The numbers it published on Wednesday were audited by KPMG, according to its annual report. Analysts said this could be understood as another step in the company’s efforts to counter criticism that it lacks transparency.Huawei has rapidly made inroads in many emerging markets and picked up large orders in Europe in recent years, but has struggled to break into the US market, mainly because of concerns that the company is too closely linked to the government or the Chinese military.Ren Zhengfei, Huawei founder and chief executive, is a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army.
389;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-03-29T22:14:20Z;Smartphone boom poised to set tone in US;;Sales of smartphones in the US such as the iPhone, BlackBerry and Motorola Droid will overtake sales of older-generation “feature phones” by the end of next year, according to the Nielsen research company.Smartphone sales in the US will climb steadily over the next 18 months and account for just under 50 per cent of total sales by the autumn of next year, predicts a new report prepared by Roger Entner, a telecom analyst at Nielsen.“We are just at the beginning of a new wireless era where smartphones will become the standard device consumers will use to connect to friends, the internet and the world at large,” he said.Feature phones, which typically include integrated cameras and multimedia capabilities, still account for over 70 per cent of sales, but sophisticated smartphones, which can be customised with downloaded software or “apps”, are closing the gap quickly.“The share of smartphones as a proportion of overall device sales has increased to 29 per cent for phone purchasers in the last six months, and 45 per cent of respondents to a Nielsen survey indicated their next device will be a smartphone,” he said.His comments echo those of other industry analysts at Gartner and IDC and by phonemakers such as Sanjay Jha, chief executive of Motorola’s mobile phone business.“All phones will be smartphones eventually,” Mr Jha said during a recent interview with the Financial Times.Heavy media advertising, coupled with the success of online app stores, especially Apple’s, which now offers over 100,000 free and low-cost apps, has helped fuel the surge in US smartphone sales over the past 18 months.Nevertheless, Mr Entner forecasts further growth. At the end of last year only 21 per cent of American wireless subscribers were using a smartphone compared with 19 per cent in the previous quarter and just 14 per cent at the end of 2008.“If we combine these intentional data points with falling prices and increasing capabilities of these devices along with a explosion of applications, for devices, we are seeing the beginning of a groundswell. This increase will be so rapid that by the end of 2011 Nielsen expects more smartphones in the US market than feature phones,” he said.Analysts expect growth in the US to be matched in other markets.Smartphones now account for 48 per cent of worldwide traffic on AdMob’s mobile advertising network, up from 35 per cent a year ago. AdMob, which serves more of 10bn ads per month to more than 15,000 mobile websites and applications, also notes that Android-based smartphone usage in the US has surged in recent months. Forty-two per cent of AdMob’s smartphone audience in the US are now using Android-based devices, almost the same percentage using iPhones.
390;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-03-24T13:00:56Z;Business technology: a mess – or a thing of beauty?;;"Business technology all too often divides its users: does it bring value to the business and therefore needs tending; or is it out of control and in need of being tamed?Those who use IT in their daily jobs – today, almost all white collar workers – complain that it is slow and restrictive. Complex workplace systems certainly lack the simplicity, and often the power, of consumer applications such as Amazon, eBay, Google or iTunes.Business management, for its part, frequently sees IT as a necessary evil. Even managers who favour investment in IT might have little hard understanding of how IT works in their business.“Our surveys say that CEOs see technology as valuable,” says Mark Raskino, vice president and Fellow at Gartner, the industry research firm. “But when you ask them what IT is doing, you get vague and mushy answers.”He argues that business leaders spend too much time looking backwards at the last generation of technology, such as customer relationship management or business process management, rather than emerging trends such as social computing, mobility and sustainability.At the same time, management teams are often fearful of IT and see change or investment as a risk. As a result, he points out, companies’ core business systems may be several decades old.IT systems have grown through additions, patches, mid-life upgrades and modifications, and the result is often a sprawl of interconnected applications, with duplication and inefficiency – and possibly systems that no one uses.“The current IT wave started 50 years ago with Cobol, but we have yet to have a proper refresh [of many systems],” says Mr Raskino. “Companies change their HQ or factories or even their locations but a lot of core IT has yet to go through its main refresh. It has been in the same data centre for 30 years.”Over the next few years, some companies will have to tear down their old systems and move to an entirely new IT set up. Others, especially newer or fast-growing companies, will move their systems online, through cloud computing.Mr Raskino likens the process of managing IT to gardening. Too often, the metaphor for IT is engineering or architecture, and this suggests a degree of design and permanence that is unrealistic.“IT won’t remain orderly,” he says. Architecture gives you one insight but if you leave IT it gets out of shape very fast. It is more an organic thing that needs constant renewal and refresh,” he suggests.How businesses go about this – without undue risk or cost but also in a way that delivers the capabilities the business will need tomorrow – is a matter for debate.PA Consulting, for example, has helped its clients set up “guerrilla” IT teams to glook at business units. These teams aim to solve a business problem quickly. If a task cannot be completed in three months, the teams will not take it on.Such teams will not fix all of a business’s IT problems, concedes Karl Boone, an IT change management specialist and a member of the firm’s management team. “It is not a long-term fix,” he says. “It will add complexity, but [some] complexity is inevitable.”The key point is for IT to be able to show that it understands the business, hence “embedding” IT staff in the business unit, and that it can deliver incremental improvements at a time when there is little appetite for large, monolithic IT upgrades.Large projects, though, have not gone away and for some businesses they will be the only way either to clear out older IT systems, or move to new ways of working that bring genuine competitive advantage. As the financial climate improves, the challenge will be to manage the transition process.“Almost every business has enormous exposure in operations, production and service delivery to the health of their core IT systems,” says Gary Curtis, co-head of Accenture Technology Consulting.“Today IT is far more than simply the back office: it is embedded either in the product, or the delivery of the product. But the focus on the health of core IT systems has pushed management focus away from optimising business processes. And that will only continue as IT becomes even more critical to the delivery of products.”Yet businesses, Mr Curtis suggests, spend far less time planning and managing IT projects than they do on capital investments in plant, machinery or property of a similar value. This lack of management involvement and due diligence leads both to IT project delays and failures, and to complexity and IT “mess”.“If you take a manufacturing business that is capital intensive, such as auto makers or aero engines, it costs $300m-$400m to build a new plant. That business case is done rigorously and is pressure tested and examined by everyone. But the same companies are not good at doing that with IT. You don’t have the same level of scrutiny, whether it is a desktop refit, or a new financial or ERP system.”"
391;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-03-22T23:57:42Z;Innovation blooms in the desert:Demo Spring 2010;;The Demo Spring 2010 conference kicked off in Palm Desert, California on Monday with a raft of applications, services and products focused on the mobile, social networking and media technology markets.One immediate observation is that mobile apps, particularly iPhone apps, are everywhere – Gartner estimates that the mobile apps market will be worth between $20bn and $30bn by 2013.I particularly liked the very first pitch from Josh Kerr, co-founder of ABJK NewCo who took a baseball bat to an aging fax machine to drive home the market opportunity for Zosh, a $2.99 mobile document application that makes it possible to electronically sign and fax a document from an iphone.Zosh aims to eliminate the need for the ‘fax machine dance ‘ – waiting for a document, signing it and then faxing it back. Instead, Zosh lets users receive documents on their mobile phones and sign them with their finger.If like me, you are wondering how you would fit your name on an iPhone screen using a fat finger, ABJK has you covered. The company has developed some neat technology that automatically scrolls the screen horizontally from right to left to give you more room as you use your finger to sign. Then it enables you to resize the electronic signature and position it precisely on the document page ready for sending via fax or email.I also liked AppWhirl from the company of the same name which “lets anyone make their only mobile application in less than five minutes.” AppWhirl also handles the tedious part of app store development including the submission process and updates. If it really is as easy as it seems, AppWhirl could turn us all into mobile app developers.There are lots of news aggregators around but Genieo Innovation’s Genieo automatically delivers a newspaper-style personalised homepage for users based on filtered content from news sites, blogs and social networks. Genieo dynamically adapts to its user’s reading habits and browsing activities.But unlike many personalised news services, Genieo runs entirely on the user’s own PC – no user information is stored on Genieo’s servers protecting users’ privacy.Meanwhile AirSet is a free or low cost subscription service that lets users easily set up ‘personalised clouds’ for each area of their lives. “AirSet is cloud computing for the rest of us,” said Brian Dougherty, chief executive.For example, users could set up ‘cloud’ groups for work, family and community enabling them to share information and collaborate on projects. Since the service is entirely web-based, no download is required and users can access the service from any browser.Airset, which provides up to 1Gb of free online storage, also provides a range of web-based services for its users including an online calendar, contact lists and shared access to music, photos and other digital content. Users can add up to 20Gb of online storage for $9.95 a month.While it won’t be officially demoed until Tuesday, I also got the chance to play with an innovative new browser called Kylo and a wireless ‘loop pointer’ – a kind of in-air mouse pointer – developed by Hillcrest Labs and designed to make it easier to view and interactively control internet content on a TV from the couch.The Kylo browser and the drivers for the pointer (which looks like a mini-hoop,) run on a PC connected to a TV and make it much easier to read text on the TV screen and select and control the on-screen navigation tools. It seemed to work particularly well with video content in the demo I saw.
392;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
393;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-03-18T16:32:19Z;What are smartphone apps doing in our businesses?;;"I read recently that someone trapped under a collapsed building in Haiti used his smartphone to download apps advising him on first aid to help keep him alive.This extreme example shows the extent to which smartphone apps have moved beyond novelty amusement.The numbers back up this picture of increasing worldwide smartphone popularity: Frost & Sullivan estimates that 190m smartphones were sold globally in 2009 and a further 250m sales are predicted for 2010.Over the past year many new smartphone devices have become available on flexible tariffs for both consumers and businesses. With a blossoming smartphone market, mobile app developers have created apps for anything and everything.Apple said that more than 3bn applications had been downloaded for the iPhone and the iPod Touch, and Gartner predicts Android will overtake the iPhone in 2012, as it forecasts around 100m Android phones will be sold.So what does this “app explosion” mean for businesses?The likelihood is that, with 190m people using smartphones, many workers will already be app enthusiasts. And they won’t be leaving these phones at home during work hours. They will be trying out useful apps to keep them informed about business news, updating their LinkedIn profile and Twitter account, and synchronising business e-mails with these devices.It only takes a glance at the app markets to see there are plenty of apps already available to help companies with marketing, boosting customer service, networking and working productively on the go, many of which are free.For instance, Note Everything lets you make written, audio or visual notes, setting reminders and prioritising important tasks. LinkedIn has developed its own app to allow easy access to updates from the site for busy professionals.Dow Jones has launched Sales Trigger, an app for sales people, which provides up-to-the-minute intelligence about business changes such as management moves and new investments. T-Mobile’s shareAnywhere app helps businesses share information about products and services with customers and colleagues wherever they are.An interesting example of a company that already sees apps as essential to its productivity is A Suit That Fits.com. With its manufacturing based in Nepal and travelling tailorstops across the UK, working on the move is an everyday requirement for the company’s co-founders.The partners run their business on smartphones using Google Apps. They find its instant messaging service useful for real time contact with a dispersed UK workforce and their tailors in Nepal.For relaying fitting information quickly and efficiently to the international manufacturing base, they use Picasa, which lets them annotate photos with word balloons, titles and graphics before sending the pictures directly from their mobiles.As smartphones become more widely used in businesses of all kinds, it is likely we’ll see more companies working with developers to create apps tailored to their needs.Digital installation services company, Firstline Digital, worked with a developer, Alternative Logic, to develop a suite of apps for the Windows Mobile PDAs, which the company’s engineers use. The apps allow the company to communicate data between its engineers and head office on matters such as appointment scheduling, health and safety checks, vehicle location, part ordering and customer satisfaction.As well as producing up to date information, the system stores all the data from the journey, which can be analysed to produce reports, identifying areas where efficiency can be improved.IT directors should be supportive of the potential for apps to change their company’s way of working. The in-depth access to information on the move that apps offer has already begun to change the nature of the way we work.We are now better equipped and more informed when we are away from our office or laptops: sales people have more knowledge at their finger tips when talking to customers; engineers can relay real time data back to head office regarding their appointments; and international teams can communicate in a more effective, visual way with one another.Who knows where this increasingly mobile world will lead us. What is certain is that, whatever we want to do in our working environments and wherever we are, there’s going to be an app for it."
394;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-03-18T16:30:39Z;Sorting out the printing device ‘zoo’;;"Straight-talking James De Watteville doesn’t mince his words when it comes to describing his company’s sprawling estate of printing devices. ”It’s a zoo,” he says, ”and it needs sorting out.”That “zoo” is populated by around 1,000 printers, serving 8,000 people across 22 different sites in the UK. Some of the devices are ancient, some are unreliable. A complex mesh of maintenance agreements and in-house resources are dedicated to their care and attention. It is far too expensive.Mr De Watteville is chief information officer of insurance company RSA (formerly Royal Sun Alliance), and he describes a situation that will sound familiar to many IT bosses, according to Louella Fernandes, an analyst with IT market research company Quocirca.”Many print environments still have a tangled mix of old and new equipment, both over and underutilised, leading to high costs due to the variety of consumables (both storage and procurement) as well as the financial and environmental costs associated with paper, ink, toner and energy consumption,” she says.”Often, management and procurement of the printing infrastructure is distributed across locations and geographies, with no centralised tracking system to monitor and analyse costs.”The true cost of unmanaged printing can startle businesses, she says. Industry estimates suggest companies spend between 1 and 3 per cent of their annual revenues on maintaining printer estates. Analysts at Gartner, meanwhile, estimate that using managed print services [MPS] can reduce that by between 10 and 30 per cent.”Under MPS, a service provider takes primary responsibility for meeting the customer’s office printing needs, including the printing equipment, the supplies, the service and overall management of the printer fleet,” Gartner’s report explain.”The main components provided are a needs assessment, selective or general replacement of hardware, and the services and supplies needed to operate the new and/or existing hardware.”MPS services also extend to the kinds of high-volume printing requirements typically provided by an internal reprographics department or, alternatively, a third-party printing provider, says Carsten Bruhn, vice president of Ricoh Global Service Europe.In a recent conversation with a large organisation in Finland, he was told that materials such as marketing documents were typically outsourced to a third party, who insisted on minimum print volumes for each project. Now, under that company’s MPS deal with Ricoh, it outsources that requirement to Ricoh, which prints as many – or as few – copies as needed, allowing the company to customise materials for customers in different markets. Mr De Watteville at RSA hopes that a newly signed MSP contract will alleviate many of the headaches he and his team face. During the first quarter of 2010, printer manufacturer Kyocera Mita will begin replacing RSA’s printer estate with 375 multi-function devices, reducing the ratio of printers-to-people from 1:8 to 1:21.Kyocera Mita will also take over the management of the refreshed estate, relieving RSA staff of the burden. Mr De Watteville says that, as a result, the company’s spend on printing over the next five years will shrink from £7.5m to £2.5m. At the same time, the new MPS contract will help RSA meet key environmental targets, says Paul Pritchard, RSA’s UK head of corporate responsibility. ”Fewer printers mean reduced energy consumption – but it will help us drive some important behavioural changes in the area of paper consumption as well.”The company’s efforts to encourage staff to print on both sides of paper have only been partially successful, he explains. Some of the current machines don’t even allow it but the new multi-function devices will have double-sided printing as the default option.According to Gartner, MPS have so far only penetrated between 5 and 20 per cent of the target market. Very large organisations are the ones likely to gain most benefits from MPS, they say, ”because they probably have a widely dispersed printing environment with big potential for print optimisation”. But all can benefit.However, companies appear to struggle to choose the right MPS provider, says Gartner analyst Ken Weilerstein. Definitions of the services on offer vary, he says, and MPS providers’ websites typically provide only vague indications of what the vendors do. ”In part [this is] because MPS tends to be more customised than print hardware.”The problem, he says, is getting worse as new kinds of MPS providers emerge, including most of the printer/copier manufacturers and dealers and even office supplies wholesalers. To emphasise its role in the market, Hewlett-Packard has launched a global business unit called Managed Enterprise Services (MES), with a view to boosting its MPS offering. This will be led by Bruce Dahlgren, an HP senior vice president, and draws heavily on resources acquired in HP’s purchase of EDS.HP has also introduced a “Payback Guarantee” for its MPS customers. Mr Dahlgren explains: ”In conversations with customers, we’re hearing that a lack of visibility means that the big costs associated with printers are not being addressed.“ Under the scheme, any company that does not make the cost savings that HP’s consultants project for them within 12 months will be refunded the shortfall.Other companies make similar offers. Xerox, for example, guarantees total cost of ownership reductions within year one of deployment. Unlike other MPS providers, Xerox does not force a refresh of the printer fleet, but will take over management of other manufacturer’s printers if the customer requests it, according to Andy Jones, director and general manager of Xerox Global Services.US-based manufacturer Ingersoll Rand has recently signed a nine-year MPS contract with Xerox to deal with its complex estate of printers that fall into three different categories, according to John Kalka, vice president of deployment in Ingersoll Rand’s Office of the CIO. Some printers are owned by Ingersoll-Rand; some are leased; and some are already under a MPS contract with Xerox.Under the new Xerox contract, printers in the first and last categories will be replaced only on an as-needed basis, while those that are leased will be decommissioned. ”We needed a strategic partner we could make responsible for both quality and cost in a truly variable cost model based on usage,” says Mr Kalka. By bringing their printer estates under MPS, a further benefit is that no document will appear in a printer tray until the person requiring it is at the printer and has authorised it. At RSA, for example, staff will swipe their employee badge on the printer’s reader. Other companies use Pin codes to achieve the same thing. That kind of service is addressing an issue that many businesses continue to overlook, says Graham Long, vice president of Samsung’s European printing operation. Unsecured printing environments, he claims, pose serious risks for European companies that could result in legal action, lost clients and lost revenue – and yet few business are aware of the reputational and financial risks their printing infrastructure poses.In research recently conducted by the company among 4,500 workers across Europe. More than half of respondents (56 per cent) said that they see confidential company documents, printed by someone else, sitting on the printer at least once a month. One in five claim to see such documents every day. "
395;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-03-08T16:46:35Z;Join the revolution – no more servers;;This is going to be a year of change as businesses look for more efficient ways to procure and manage IT, freeing up the time and money needed to focus on innovation.Organisations are tired of managing technology in-house, particularly servers, leading to a shift towards IT outsourcing. Two recent reports from Gartner highlight that ”the future of IT lies outside the IT department” as business demand for IT-driven growth and innovation drives the need for a different skill set, and “virtualisation and cloud computing will transform IT in 2010”.In line with this demand for reducing IT costs and increasing innovation that will ultimately drive market share, there is a growing trend towards Computing-as-a-Service models, such as software-as-a-service, cloud computing and hosting.This enables companies of all sizes to buy computing capacity on a pay-as-you-go basis, being charged only for what they use, without up-front capital cost, and freeing them from the shackle of the server.Gartner estimates that 44m servers are in use worldwide and the great majority of these are deployed internally. New business models mean that instead of purchasing, maintaining, and upgrading these servers, businesses can simply consume computing resources from service providers.A new era of computingThe business case for this consists of zero capital expenditure and minimal incremental headcount. It also takes away much of the risk from projects, since the responsibility for delivering the overall solution is given to service providers.Computing-as-a-Service is going to become the mainstream delivery architecture for corporate computing in the next two years, transforming IT departments by bringing flexibility, security, performance and resilience to a function that has traditionally acted as an inflexible monopoly.Cloud computing, an element of this “no more servers” approach, is currently being used to deliver both new and existing applications. As more solutions are delivered ”cloud ready”, buying and deploying servers in-house no longer makes business sense. For revenue-generating applications, risk can be reduced still further by building the IT infrastructure wholly or partially in the cloud.Computing-as-a-Service can be used in many different ways – it can be a combination of a cloud infrastructure and dedicated servers, enabling companies to benefit from the flexibility and cost savings of the cloud, but also the increased security and stability of managed hosting, depending on the needs of the business.Innovate to get aheadSince the mainframe, innovations continue to extend the availability of computing capacity to more businesses. Each development also increases the amount of computing resource available to business, while driving down costs.But adoption of “new” approaches is often slow. In part this is due to businesses demanding a return on their past investments before adopting a new approach. The larger the firm, the larger the sunk cost, which means the later the adoption.This is why the first beneficiaries of each new computing innovation are typically smaller companies because they have less legacy equipment or bureaucracy stalling progress.And as larger enterprises outsource more, there will be fewer systems to depreciate, decommission, or cling to in the hope of ROI, thus fuelling the process.This year will see businesses demand more from their service providers, as a “No More Servers” approach must come hand-in-hand with excellent customer service and support.Those joining the revolution, from small businesses to enterprises, will be empowered to achieve unprecedented productivity at minimal costs. In an ever-increasingly competitive market, what business couldn’t benefit from this?
396;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-03-03T18:32:31Z;Apple lawsuit wrecks HTC’s quiet life;;HTC, the Taiwan smartphone maker being sued by Apple for patent infringement, has prided itself on being “quietly brilliant”, in the words of John Wang, chief marketing officer.The attitude comes from its roots as a contract maker for brands such as Palm, Hewlett-Packard and T-Mobile, before it transformed itself into a branded group that became the biggest producer of Windows Mobile-based phones.HTC was little known in Europe and the US until it made the first phone using Google’s Android open-source software for T-Mobile in 2008.It has ridden its success with Android to gain 6.9 per cent of the smartphone market, according to Gartner, yet remains largely faithful to its understated way – it launched its first global advertising campaign last October.But any chance of HTC remaining out of the limelight all but disappeared with Tuesday’s lawsuit.Apple accused HTC of violating 20 patents relating to the iPhone’s user interface, underlying architecture and hardware, and asked the US International Trade Commission and a Delaware court to ban HTC sales in the US.The move sent HTC’s Taipei-listed shares down 3.3 per cent on Wednesday to T$319.Analysts say the lawsuit indicates growing competition between smartphone makers as the devices become more popular. The fact that Apple’s case centres on the phones’ user interfaces reflects the importance consumers put on phones’ operating systems rather than hardware.Apple wants to slow down the popularity of the Android platform, says CK Cheng, analyst at CLSA.“Instead of suing Google, it is much easier to go after the device manufacturer …Financially, HTC is much weaker than Google.”HTC says it “values patent rights and their enforcement, but is also committed to defending its own technology innovations”.Google has yet to comment on the case.Whether or not HTC was targeted by Apple as a proxy to hinder Google’s advance, the lawsuit highlights why HTC was able to emerge from a relatively unknown position to be the fourth biggest smartphone vendor.It underlines why it was chosen by Google to make the first Google-branded phone, the Nexus One.When Google unveiled Android in 2007, few phone manufacturers jumped on it because it was a functional, no-frills system, lacking many features that were an integral part of systems such as Windows Mobile.HTC was for months the only producer of Android phones. It took advantage of Android’s clean slate to design features such as predictive typing in Chinese and English and searches that show results across e-mails, text messages and contact lists.Android gave HTC “much greater freedom to make changes and create their own designs in the user interface and the application layer” than Windows Mobile, Mr Cheng says. The fact that some features are alleged to have infringed Apple’s patent shows “everyone is under tremendous pressure to differentiate”.The consequences of losing the lawsuit would be dire for HTC – half of its revenues come from the US – but there may be a silver lining. Jasmine Lu, analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note on Wednesday that “timing-wise, we believe the bringing of this lawsuit may signal that shipments of HTC’s Android-based models in the pipeline to leading US operators could be quite promising beyond [the first quarter of this year]”.
397;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-02-23T22:24:00Z;Mobile handset sales poised to rebound during 2010;;Sales of mobile handsets fell nearly 1 per cent in 2009, their first decline eight years, as consumers cut back on spending during the downturn. However, analysts expect the market to rebound in 2010, with growth of 11 to 13 per cent.Gartner, the technology research company, had previously forecast 9 per cent growth for this year, but increased its numbers after a surge in consumer spending in the fourth quarter. Sales of mobile handsets in the final quarter were up 8.3 per cent on the previous year.“People are being a little less careful than at the end of last year, and there is a bigger variety of phones on the market to tempt them,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner.However, Ms Milanesi warned that average selling prices for phones would remain under pressure because of intense competition in the market. Average selling prices fell about 10 per cent in 2009, and are expected to fall about 4 per cent this year.Samsung, Apple and Google’s mobile phone operating system, Android, emerged as the biggest winners of 2009, making strong market share gains, while Nokia, Motorola and Sony Ericsson all lost ground.Korean Samsung, which has blitzed the market with a huge variety of handsets, saw its global market share increase to 19.5 per cent from 16.3 per cent the previous year. Nokia’s market share dipped to 36.4 per cent, a level last seen in 2006.Sony Ericsson and Motorola both saw their market shares dip below 5 per cent. Ms Milanesi said the companies would be hard pressed to stay among the top five global vendors this year.“There was only a couple of million difference in unit sales between Motorola and RIM in the fourth quarter. Motorola is not too far from being overtaken,” Ms Milanesi said.Sales of smartphones, such as the Apple iPhone, continued to see strong growth last year. Some 172.4m smartphones were sold last year, a 23.8 per cent increase from 2008. They now make up 14 per cent of all handsets sold.Apple increased its share of the smartphone market by 6.2 percentage points, ousting Microsoft from the third place position. Microsoft is trying to make up for lost ground by the launch of a new operating system at the Mobile World Congress trade show this month.Phones using the Android operating system also saw a big surge, moving to 3.9 per cent market share, from only 0.5 in 2008. A majority of these sales came in the fourth quarter.Smartphones based on Nokia’s Symbian operating system were still market leaders, but saw their share slip to 46.9 per cent from 52.4 per cent. This month Nokia and Intel unveiled plans for a new operating system for smartphones in an attempt to catch up with Apple and Google.
398;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-02-23T11:36:58Z;Time to remove IT from the boardroom agenda;;"To suggest that IT be removed from the boardroom agenda might seem counterintuitive, especially as the technology industry has been working for 10 years to raise the profile of IT to make it a boardroom issue.We wanted to ensure that our technology was used effectively and that the board viewed IT as supporting innovation in its business processes, bringing increased efficiency, greater agility, better customer service and stronger customer relationships.Sadly, IT has too often hit the boardroom when things go wrong, such as projects being delayed, budgets overrunning, mission critical systems going down or significant funds being needed to increase the capacity of the IT infrastructure. As a result, many boards view IT as a constant headache that increases costs and upsets not just users but customers as well.Our industry has responded relatively effectively, reducing the cost of IT and increasing its reliability, through the commoditisation of the IT infrastructure. Hardware components have become more reliable and management software has become much better at mitigating, predicting and preventing failure.Adopting virtualisation, as part of a journey to cloud computing, has emerged as a mainstream way to reduce IT complexity significantly and to transform its delivery.Indeed, powerful support came from the recent Gartner EXP Worldwide Survey of 1,600 CIOs (released in January). It shows that their top two business priorities for 2010 are business process improvement and cost reduction. In order to achieve these goals, their top two technology priorities are virtualisation and cloud computing.These closely related technologies are essential for creating a more agile and competitive organisation. One reason that IT has been regarded as such a source of problems is that many organisations today still have a complex, brittle and siloed infrastructure.As a result, more than 70 per cent of their IT budget is spent on running their existing operations, maintaining hardware, upgrading hardware and software just “to keep the lights on”. Only 30 per cent is available to support new strategic initiatives.The current harsh economic climate reinforces the need to reduce spiralling IT costs, eliminate inefficiencies and conserve cash, as well as reduce carbon footprint.Virtualisation can typically increase server utilisation to more than 90 per cent; it can reduce capital costs and energy costs; and it can enable greater agility, which helps to create new business processes, launch new business models and build deeper customer relationships.Each part of the organisation is charged for its usage. Instead of having to procure new hardware and software, business managers merely request the capacity they need for the immediate future from the existing pooled resources.This infrastructure also provides increased availability, business continuity, disaster recovery and security.Organisations that have virtualised the majority of their IT infrastructure are able to deliver IT to the business as a service, through a private cloud. For instance, when Lagan Group purchased Welsh Slate, it migrated all its hardware into the virtual environment in just a week, adding business continuity and disaster recovery along the way.An agile and flexible infrastructure of pooled resources allows parts of the business to scale up and down to meet their changing needs. This is just what the board wants to support new acquisitions, new projects, major new contracts, site moves or entry into new markets or sectors.This could mean that IT problems can be taken off the board agenda. I see this leaving the chief information officer with two major roles.First, he will become a key change-maker, supporting business managers’ strategic initiatives intended to increase the organisation’s competitive position. Just as many boards will not approve anything unless the corporate treasurer has already agreed to provide the necessary funds, so nothing will be approved unless the CIO has already agreed to provide the necessary computing services.The CIO’s role in supporting the board will finally evolve from fire-fighting problems to using IT to help transform the business.The major role I see the CIO playing is custodian of the organisation’s cloud infrastructure, ensuring that it is cost-effective, constantly available and able to supply the computing service needed by each part of the business. Having agreed to an annual budget, their success ensures that IT infrastructure stays off the board agenda for the rest of the year."
399;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-02-15T23:06:04Z;Verizon set to announce Skype partnership;;Verizon Wireless looks set to become the first large US mobile operator to let its customers make free or low-cost calls by using Skype on its network.John Stratton, Verizon Wireless’ chief marketing officer, and Josh Silverman, Skype’s chief executive, are due on Tuesday to announce a partnership between the two companies at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.It underlines how mobile operators are increasingly dropping their resistance to Skype because of a combination of competitive and regulatory pressures.Skype and similar services, based on Voice over Internet Protocol technology, such as Google Voice, will dent mobile operators’ revenues from traditional voice services. This is because the VoIP services enable calls to be made using the data portion of customers’ mobile tariffs.Mobile voice calls generate about $700bn in revenues each year for the operators, and represent the majority of their sales, according to Gartner, the technology consulting firm. Revenues from data services providing internet access are growing quickly, but they still amount to a minority of operators’ sales.“Over time traditional network-based mobile carriers face the real prospect of losing a major slice of their voice traffic and revenue to new non-infrastructure players that use VoIP,” said Akshay Sharma, research director at Gartner.Like many of its peers, Verizon Wireless, the largest US mobile network operator, has until recently opposed allowing VoIP services to run on its network.In October, the company announced a partnership with Google. As well as selling several handsets featuring Google’s Android operating system, Verizon Wireless said it would allow Google Voice.Also in October, AT&T, the second-largest US mobile operator and exclusive network for Apple’s iPhone, agreed that VoIP services could run on its network. Skype has yet to release an application for Apple’s iPhone that can run on AT&T’s network.Some European-based mobile operators have already allowed VoIP services, including 3 UK, owned by Hong Kong’s Hutchison Whampoa.

400;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-02-15T11:40:16Z;Mobile security: Hackers kept at bay by lack of a standard platform;;"There have been dire predictions of a mobile malware epidemic – but disaster may have been averted thanks to the many hurdles standing between hackers and the corporate smartphone.“Mobile malware is frequently spoken of in apocalyptic terms but the truth is that corporate mobile devices are far more likely to slip out of a pocket, be left in a cab or get snatched off a table than be probed by a hacker,” says Craig Heath, chief security technologist at the Symbian Foundation, the organisation that develops and licenses the Symbian operating system used by smartphones from Nokia, Samsung, Panasonic, and others.For a start, the mobile sector is highly fragmented. No single mobile operating system dominates the handset market, so writing a virus that targets a specific platform can only have limited effects, according to Candid Wueest, senior threat researcher at Symantec.“A monoculture is far more helpful to virus writers, so while we’ve seen 4m viruses, worms and trojans attack Windows, we’ve seen only 400 kinds of malware aimed at mobile platforms,” he says.At the same time, he adds, relatively few hackers have the in-depth skills and understanding necessary to create viruses capable of targeting a specific mobile platform.Market fragmentation is unlikely to end quickly, according to a Gartner analysis that predicted the share of the mobile OS market in 2010 will be: market-leader Symbian with 37 per cent, followed by Android (18 per cent), iPhone (14 per cent), BlackBerry (14 per cent) and Windows Mobile (9 per cent).In addition, today’s mobile operating systems are engineered with security in mind, says Mr Heath: they check the digital signatures of downloaded applications; they limit application access to system resources; and they isolate applications from each other better.As long as smartphone users download applications only through authorised, moderated channels, he argues, they can be confident their mobile platform will limit the actions these applications can perform.Some may disagree, however. Recent evidence suggests online application marketplaces that distribute third-party products approved by mobile OS companies might not be completely safe.Symbian itself experienced problems in July 2009 after it authorised, under its “Symbian Signed” programme, a piece of code that contained malware. More recently, banking malware was discovered on Google’s Android Marketplace.Given the increasing popularity of downloadable smartphone applications, it is hardly surprising that companies are taking steps to control what actions users perform on devices holding corporate data.Research in Motion, manufacturer of the BlackBerry, continues to dominate the enterprise smartphone market because of the centralised control it offers over employee handsets, according to Michael Brown, director of product management for BlackBerry Security.The Blackberry Enterprise Server, he explains, enables company IT administrators to apply more than 500 policies to the devices under their care. “These include preventing downloaded applications from using other phone or e-mail services, or blocking them altogether,” he explains.But more importantly, it also gives them tools to take action when a device is lost or stolen, by carrying out a “remote wipe”, leaving the device blank.Forrester Research analysts say that while RIM offers “the gold standard” in remote management and mobile security for companies, Sybase, an information management company, leads for those that use a variety of mobile devices, with its Afaria management platform.The ability to secure devices from multiple vendors is of growing importance in a world where employees bring personal devices into the workplace, says Willie Jow, vice-president of business operations and mobility products at Sybase.“If a CIO can’t be confident about securing a particular device, then corporate data simply has no business being on it,” he says. And while employee demand for the latest device can be deafening, there is a cost to IT departments in supporting, managing and securing new platforms.Afaria, he says, is designed to tackle the full range of smartphone-related security risks, regardless of platform. These include applying the latest anti-malware software and operating system patches, enforcing password policies, applying encryption at file, application or full-disk levels, and remotely locking – or even wiping – lost or stolen devices.Even companies without such centralised management capabilities can do much to lower risks associated with smartphones, says Rik Ferguson, senior security adviser at Trend Micro, a vendor of antivirus tools.“Enterprises need to invest in building a culture of security,” he says. “Employees need to be told that standard safe computing practices apply equally to handsets and PCs: be careful where you click; never respond to requests for personal information; don’t open suspect messages; and don’t disable security features of your mobile device.”Passwords are a must-have and should be changed regularly, he adds, and encryption should be considered for phones containing sensitive corporate data.“Mobile devices should always be viewed as suspicious,” says Tom Carter of PA Consulting. “It is rarely pragmatic to expect a mobile phone to be a trusted citizen on a corporate local area network. The nature of the technology, along with how it is used, presents too many threats to be completely secure,” he says.It is safer instead for IT organisations to think of the smartphone as a “low trust/low reliability” client to their network and to design solutions that balance richness of experience with appropriate access, he advises.All business should be alert, urges Mr Ferguson of Trend Micro: “Mobile malware may not be an epidemic yet, but we observed a significant increase in sophistication and criminal intent last year. By getting the basics nailed down, companies will be better prepared to tackle threats as they emerge.”"
401;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-02-15T11:40:16Z;Does IT work?: Mobile apps making real difference in many sectors;;The market for mobile applications is growing at a frenetic rate. Gartner, the analytic company, expects revenue from applications – across all the main mobile platforms – to grow from $4.2bn in 2009 to $29.5bn in 2013.This growth is all the more impressive, considering that a market for downloading mobile phone applications hardly existed before Apple launched its iPhone in 2007.The vast bulk of those downloads are based around entertainment or personal productivity. But business software vendors are starting to wake up to the possibilities, as chief information officers, for example, become increasingly willing to use mobile business applications and distribute them via applications stores.This is the approach adopted by the French arm of Generali, the life assurance provider. The company approached Accenture, the IT consultant, to write an iPhone application.The app is aimed at self-employed financial advisers who sell Generali products. They can download the software directly from Apple’s iPhone app store and use it to track clients’ portfolios via a 3G or wi-fi connection. The app provides simple graphical representations of clients’ holdings and asset allocations.According to Bertrand Boré, director of internet and distribution strategy at Generali France, a smartphone is simply a better tool to help advisers do business, especially when they visit clients.“We were already quite advanced in providing online information to financial advisers,” he says. “But we were meeting a limit with the need for a wi-fi connection, and to take a laptop. If you are in a meeting with a client, it is not that easy to connect yourself, whether it is in a coffee bar or their office. So we built on the mobile concept to give advisers that information anywhere.”In the US, Nationwide, the insurer, pursued a strategy of developing mobile applications that are not specific to a single platform. The company’s mobile staff mostly use BlackBerrys, but, says Robert Burkhart, head of technology innovation, there are also users with iPhones, the Droid (a phone from Motorola that uses the Android operating system), Symbian and Windows Mobile.“We are now also asking whether it has to be a company-owned phone or whether it could be a personal device. We want to protect our data and our intellectual property, but we also want to ensure that we see the productivity gains associated with giving staff the information they need to do the job,” he says.Despite the extra efforts involved, developing specific mobile business applications rather than relying on web applications pays off in improved functionality and productivity, Mr Burkhart argues.“For the best experience, it is better not to have a web-based version [of the application] but one that is specific, depending on what the user is doing. It is about having right functionality.”It is not just a question of designing applications so they fit on a mobile device’s smaller screen, he says, but providing the right amount of task-specific information to field-based staff. Too often, re-purposed PC or web applications produce cluttered screens, and frustrated users.Paying close attention to mobile workers’ needs also pays dividends in industrial and blue-collar applications.For example, JCDecaux, the outdoor advertising company, developed a field-based app for staff and subcontractors installing billboards and posters. The app allows the installers to photograph when each poster goes up, and provide a GPS location and time stamp via a smartphone.JCDecaux customers can also view the images, taken by the Windows Mobile devices, in near real time, allowing them to track the roll-out of their campaigns.The project, developed with PA Consulting and Vodafone, involved fine-tuning settings on the handsets, in particular to boost performance of the onboard camera in poor lighting, so crews do not need conventional cameras and do not have to load images to a PC before sending them to clients.It is not only custom-built apps being used by business. Chevron, the oil company, is trialling an iPhone-based version of Nimbus Control, a business process management package.This, says Jim Boots, senior BPM adviser at Chevron, will enable the company to deliver up-to-date process information to staff anywhere around its plants. The vast size of oil refineries puts a strain on conventional IT tools and connectivity. Maintenance engineers, for example, will be able to view the latest guidance on servicing or repairs directly from a device.Modern smartphones stand out from industrial devices for their ease of use and clear screens. “We have tended to use heavy-duty devices and there are certain requirements for our environment,” says Mr Boots. “But people already use their phones here without wrecking them.”
402;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-02-09T00:21:11Z;Google prepares Facebook assault;;Google is set to make a fresh attempt to gain a stronger foothold in the booming social networking business on Tuesday as it seeks to counter the growing threat that Facebook poses to some of its core services.The search company is preparing to announce new features for Gmail that would extend the capabilities of the internet-based e-mail service to mirror some aspects of the fast-growing social networking site, according to a person familiar with its plans.However, earlier Google efforts to establish a presence in social networking have failed to gain much traction and analysts said that the company was still likely to find it difficult to turn the tables on Facebook with its latest plan.“Anything Google does with Gmail should be seen as a defensive manoeuvre,” said Ray Valdes, an analyst at Gartner.“In non-work settings, the trajectory favours Facebook. Increasingly, people are staying inside [the social networking site],” he said.Google’s Chat service, which is part of Gmail, already allows users to post short “status updates”, similar to the messages they can post on Facebook or Twitter.Google is planning to give Gmail users a way to aggregate the updates of their various contacts on the service, creating a stream of notifications that would echo the similar real-time streams from Facebook and Twitter, according to reports.All e-mail services will be forced to add such social elements as they seek to counter the threat posed by Facebook as it moves more heavily into communications, Mr Valdes said.Facebook has a messaging service through which users can communicate directly with one another but it remains rudimentary and is not connected to other e-mail systems.According to a report on the tech website TechCrunch, Facebook is planning to upgrade this messaging service to compete directly with Gmail and other internet-based mail systems.Google’s decision to exploit the heavily used Gmail service as the basis for its latest assault on the social networking business partly reflects the failure of earlier stand-alone efforts to enter the sector.Its Orkut networking service, though launched before Facebook, has failed to gain a mass following in most parts of the world, despite success in Brazil, and its acquisition of Twitter rival Jaiku ended in failure after it scrapped development of the service.With more than 150m unique users a month, according to ComScore, Gmail could provide Google with a stronger launchpad into social networking. Along with the status updates facility in Gmail, Google has a number of other elements that, combined, offer a basic alternative to Facebook.
403;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-02-01T19:54:37Z;Semiconductor sales growth expected in 2010;;The global semiconductor industry, worth more than $200bn in annual sales, is expected to return to strong growth this year after a robust end to 2009, according to industry forecasts.The Semiconductor Industry Association reported on Monday that sales suffered less than expected in 2009, reaching $226.3bn, compared with its forecast of $219.7bn.They were down 9 per cent from the $248.6bn recorded in 2008 as the year caught most of the effects of the recession. That year itself had seen a 2.8 per cent year-on-year fall in sales – the first since 2001.December sales were up 29 per cent on December 2008, reflecting both the depths of the recession a year earlier and the strong rebound in the latter half of 2009.The Gartner and iSuppli research firms are predicting growth of 13 per cent and 15.4 per cent respectively in 2010.“2009 turned out to be a better year for the global semiconductor industry than expected,” said George Scalise, SIA president.“A strong focus on inventories throughout the supply chain mitigated the impact of the worldwide economic downturn and positioned the industry for growth as the global economy recovers.”The disappearance of tech companies and collapse in infrastructure demand created a huge inventory overhang for chipmakers after the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2001, when sales fell 30 per cent.In this recession, inventories have remained under control. iSuppli reported last month that concerns about an inventory bubble were unfounded as they had remained lean and well below the historical average. “Suppliers prefer just-in-time fulfilment to capital-constraining shelf stocking,” said analyst Carlo Ciriello. “This has resulted in lower inventories throughout the electronics supply chain.”SIA said sales in the final quarter were supported by healthy demand for PCs, cell phones and consumer electronics.It predicted unit sales of PCs and cell phones, which account for about 60 per cent of chip sales, will grow in the low to mid-teens percentage-wise in 2010. It predicted mid-single digits growth for consumer electronics.“We are also seeing the effects of recovery in the enterprise sector and we believe this trend will continue,” said Mr Scalise.
404;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-01-28T12:26:41Z;Samsung Electronics;;All hail Samsung Electronics. At times, the flagship company of the country’s largest chaebol has seemed to drag South Korea out of its slump all on its own.With a market capitalisation now one-seventh of the Kospi, that’s not entirely surprising. Only Panasonic of Japan and Philips of the Netherlands get anywhere near Samsung’s beta of 1.01 with its local benchmark, implying an almost perfect synthesis between the company and investors’ views of the economy. That could explain why analysts appear to support it with near-patriotic fervour: 36 buys, two holds, no sells. More earnings upgrades should be fed through following fourth-quarter results on Friday.But that consensus masks unease. The pricing of Samsung products, from memory chips to panels or mobiles, has been exceptionally strong because of stiff cutbacks last year. That should remain for at least the next two quarters. Further out, though, prospects are dimmer. Samsung’s successes in recent years have been based mostly on speed and agility, rather than technology leadership. Sony pioneered upmarket LED televisions, for example, but Samsung was first to the mass market. That has helped to buttress overall margins in the telecommunications division, Samsung’s biggest. But in the long run, a lack of genuine innovation hurts profitability. Samsung may be poised to topple Hewlett-Packard as the world’s largest tech company by sales this year, but by returns on equity it barely makes the top 30. By research and development/sales, it’s lower still.It is a long time since Samsung stirred consumers with a product like Apple’s iPhone. The Omnia smartphone, for example, had 3.2 per cent of the global market in the third quarter, according to Gartner, up from 3 per cent a year earlier. New chief executive Choi Gee-sung has inherited a sales machine in Samsung. But what does he do for an encore?Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
405;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-01-26T01:45:13Z;Imitators and fans await Apple launch;;"Technology enthusiasts in Europe and the US are not the only ones eagerly awaiting Wednesday’s launch of Apple’s latest product, widely believed to be a “ tablet”-sized computer.Electronics manufacturers in Taiwan are preparing similar products to catch the wave of consumer interest that the device is expected to generate.Very few details have been confirmed about Apple’s “latest creation”, as the US company phrased it in an invitation sent to journalists last week.But purported leaks from manufacturers and market rumours have pointed to the device being a flat, A4-sized computer with a touchscreen and internet connectivity, on which users can watch movies or read digital books and magazines.Apple’s new product is already set to face competition from similar offerings by other top-tier brands. Acer, the world’s second-biggest PC maker, told Bloomberg it was designing a similar device. “We’re developing something, and we will see what happens,” said J.T. Wang, chairman.Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, announced a “slate PC”, to be made by Hewlett-Packard, at the Consumer Electronics Show this month, while Lenovo announced a “ hybrid netbook”, a computer whose screen can be removed, leaving a standalone tablet device.In contrast to these directly competing offerings, many of the products set to be launched by smaller Taiwanese manufacturers are likely to sell for much less and will be designed to look very similar to Apple’s device, analysts say.Ben Lee, principal research analyst at Gartner, the research consultancy, said Taiwanese companies prepared lookalike products whenever Apple launches a device.“I don’t think it puts any pressure on Apple,” he said. “It creates a new market for people who don’t want to pay as much for a similar device. People who really want to use an Apple device will still wait until it is released in their region.”Asustek, a pioneer in the netbook field, is also working on a tablet PC called the Eee Pad. Micro-Star International, a manufacturer best known for motherboards and graphics cards, said it had prepared several prototypes but was “still evaluating customer responses before we decide whether to put it into volume production.”Gigabyte, another Taiwanese manufacturer, said it was not going to launch its own tablet PC but was “contract manufacturing a device like that for a Japanese brand”.Additional reporting by Chen Yu-ting in Taipeiwww.ft.com/techblog

406;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-01-21T23:26:33Z;Will tablets be swallowed?;;Tablet devices, the small computers with touch screens and no keyboards, have failed to crack the consumer market for the computing industry in the past two decades and face a make-or-break year in 2010.The likelihood of success or further failure should become clearer this month, with many models already unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and Apple expected to launch its version of a tablet computer next week. So far, analysts are divided on whether the category can succeed.Deloitte predicted this week that “tens of millions” of tablet computers would be sold this year. It described them as “the Goldilocks of devices [not too big, not too small]”.The Gartner research firm said it was struggling to find a clear need in the marketplace for “an in-between device that is too big to fit in your pocket and lacking a keyboard”.Shawn DuBravac, research director of the Consumer Electronics Association, positioned “Tablet 2.0” between the IT-centric approach of netbooks and smartbooks, the small-scale notebook PCs, and eReaders, which have focused on content and subscription deals.He saw a battle between competing concepts in the five to 15-inch range of screen sizes. “What can come in and take over is open to question,” he says.At CES, Steve Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, a long time proponent of tablets, showed off three, including the HP “Slate”.However, HP itself did not share further details on the device’s availability and Dell was equally vague about a tablet it previewed at the show.“This emerging category of PCs really should take advantage of the touch and mobility and capabilities of Windows 7, and are perfect for reading, for surfing the web and for taking entertainment on the go,” said Mr Ballmer.Improved hardware and software are certainly helping to make tablets more appealing. Windows 7 supports multi-touch applications, battery life has improved, screens are better and high-definition video is possible with the latest graphics chips and processors from companies such as Nvidia.“2010 is the year of the tablet, this is a category that’s got our name on it,” says Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia chief executive, referring to his chips’ ability to deliver high performance without quickly draining a battery.“We have been weaned on the iPhone with this idea of touch and tablets, all of these kinds of behaviours have been taught to us now and consumers are comfortable with them.”However, many of the new tablet makers are not thinking enough about the consumer experience, according to Geoff Walker, marketing manager at touch-screen supplier NextWindow.“I looked at probably 30 tablets at CES and [their makers] were talking about the hardware – the screen size, the storage, the weight, the operating system – but when I asked them about how people were going to use it, they really hadn’t thought about that,” he says.Most observers are looking to Apple and its chief executive Steve Jobs to define what the consumer experience should be on a tablet and help to drive adoption in the same way the iPhone has changed the smartphone market.“I was in the front row at Steve Ballmer’s speech at CES and the tablet to him was like another piece of hardware that’s running Windows 7,” says Robert Scoble, a popular blogger and former “evangelist” of tablets for NEC of Japan.“I don’t think Steve Jobs is going to do that. I expect him to show off something new and some new interaction that most people haven’t considered yet with the world.”Mr Scoble hopes an Apple tablet would allow textbooks and magazines to be read with multimedia elements and internet content could be served up on a TV by the device.Michael Gartenberg, analyst at the Interpret research firm, says Microsoft has not been successful in trying “to shoehorn PC functionality” into a tablet, but Apple should have a different approach.“Apple understands that for 15 years people have tried making these devices and they’ve all failed and I would hope they would have a different take on what the right functionality might be,” he says.“At the end of the day, these have not become mass-market devices and Apple does not typically look to build for tens of thousands. It is looking for tens of millions in sales.”
407;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-01-21T00:35:52Z;YouTube to test video renting service;;YouTube is to start testing a video rental service in the US on Friday, marking its latest attempt to move beyond its traditional advertising-supported model and open what some analysts say is a new front in parent Google’s rivalry with Apple.While initially limited to five movies from independent producers being shown at this year’s Sundance Festival, a YouTube spokesman said the rental approach would be extended in the coming weeks to some healthcare and fitness videos before being used across a broad range of content.Allen Weiner, an analyst at Gartner, described the rental test as “a salvo that puts them head-to-head with Apple” as both companies race to create broader online platforms for distributing video. The rental move is a first step for YouTube in “an evolution that will eventually involve downloads and rentals and streaming across multiple devices”, he said.The news comes less than a week before Apple is expected to unveil its tablet device, which could extend the reach of its own video platform. Apple offers video rentals through its iTunes store, through which it has a direct relationship with millions of internet users, though it lacks YouTube’s mass-market streaming capabilities.YouTube said it would let video producers decide what price to charge and how long to make their rental “windows”. Four of the Sundance movies would be available for $3.99 each with unlimited viewing over a period of 48 hours. At least 51 per cent of the money collected through the rental service would go to content owners, with that proportion rising to as much as 80 per cent, YouTube said.YouTube’s wide online reach, and the dominant search position of its parent, could put the video site in pole position to capitalise on the viewing interests of internet users, analysts said. Since many people came to YouTube to view movie trailers or visited Google to search for information about new releases, it would be a simple step to offer them a chance to rent the film they have shown an interest in, said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research.However, he added that with competition from a growing number of online movie rental services YouTube was likely to find it difficult to become a significant presence in rentals.
408;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-01-19T16:41:52Z;Valley view: Doubts creep in after fantasy world of Vegas;;I peered through 3D glasses, read the eReaders, stroked the smartbooks and smartphones and touched the tablets. The Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is over for another year – and what a realm of the senses it was.Instead of the usual vapourware, the future was close enough to touch, from smartphone screens to images that leapt out of TV sets.There were real products in every category, available to buy in the next few months. After years of watching unconvincing efforts at 3D, Sony, Samsung and others showed us the real deal on fast-refreshing LCD TVs and vivid OLED screens. There were even 2D to 3D conversions, with technologies such as Toshiba’s powerful Cell processor.Netbooks, the biggest growth area of the PC market, were joined by smartphone-inspired smartbooks. New designs for tablet PCs with multi-touch displays appeared and there were enough eReaders to take up an entire zone of the show.It all seemed to augur well for the consumer electronics industry leading the world out of recession this year, tempting consumers into a buying spree.And yet as I took off the rose-tinted 3D glasses and left the fantasy world of Vegas to return to the Valley, doubts began to creep in.There are question marks over the rate of adoption of these devices and few grounds for a big boost in spending.Beginning with 3D, the technology and the ease of its deployment are now proven but we are still five to seven years away from it being developed to the extent that viewers will get a satisfactory experience watching it without glasses.Analysts at the Gartner research firm argued post-CES that consumers would baulk at paying a premium for 3D, with just the active-shutter glasses for a family of four costing between $400 and $800.Also, 3D is not to everyone’s taste – some prefer the picture to remain inside the TV.There is also the challenge of providing enough content. ESPN, the entertainment company, is promising 25 World Cup matches in 3D, and there will be nature programmes and a growing number of movies and video game content.But the major broadcast networks are unlikely to switch to 3D for years. Like many consumers, they have only just switched over to high-definition and are reluctant to upgrade again and incur more expense.The eReader category seems to be reaching the peak of the classic hype cycle, meaning the trough of disillusionment cannot be far away. There are too many competing devices on the market already and, much as I admire the E-Ink technology that most of them use, it still has failings.Better battery life makes for a dull picture it seems. I find the screens hard to read in many instances due to their lack of a backlight. As well as missing brightness, they also seem painfully slow to turn on and turn pages. They are single-function devices and single-medium ones in some cases – fit only for books.Sony has loaned me its new Daily Edition Reader, which has a 3G connection and downloads eReader versions of the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal for me overnight. But the layouts and charms of the printed papers are sadly lacking in the small-screen Reader with its stripped-down lists of stories and lack of colour.Of course, larger format devices are on the way for newspapers and magazines such as Plastic Logic’s Que with its 11.6-inch screen. But attendees were shocked when the company announced the device would cost up to $800.Smartbooks are defined as small laptops running ARM-based processors, which means all-day battery life. They feature 3G connectivity and Linux-based operating systems.The question is whether consumers will embrace them in the same way as netbooks, with the lack of Windows being a handicap to adoption. However, prices of under $200 or free with two-year data contracts should appeal.Tablets or “slates” were back in force at CES, helped by the launch of Windows 7 and advanced multi-touch interfaces. Gartner is particularly negative about their prospects.“I’m struggling to find a clear need in the marketplace,” says Van Baker, Gartner analyst. “People either want a smartphone or device they can carry in their pocket and use on an all-day basis or they want something with a large display they can do data entry on. We are not too bullish on an in-between device that is too big to fit in your pocket and lacking a keyboard.”Apple is rumoured to be launching its own tablet device next week. If we need a fillip, Steve Jobs promises to be the best antidote to post-CES blues.
409;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-01-14T01:10:41Z;New life for global sales of computers;;The personal computing sector came roaring back in the fourth quarter of 2009, with the number of machines shipped globally jumping by as much as 22 per cent for the biggest yearly gain in seven years.While the last quarter of 2008 was especially weakdue to the financial crisis, the comeback nevertheless gave an unexpectedly strong indication of a broader recovery.Although Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating system came out during the quarter, it “did not create additional PC demand”, said Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa. Instead, the biggest sales driver continued to be less expensive portable machines, including netbooks, which have smaller screens and less processing power than traditional laptops.The average selling price for computers globally in the quarter had been projected to fall to $660, Ms Kitagawa said, “with very strong growth of low-priced systems” during the period. The actual figure is likely to prove even lower. The comparable figure in 2008 was $771. The average selling price in 2009 was $709.Gartner placed the overall unit growth at 22 per cent from the end of 2008, while rival market researcher IDC put the gain at 15 per cent.Both firms had Hewlett-Packard keeping its position as the top vendor by volume, with 20-21 per cent of the market. Acer is second and Dell third, followed by Lenovo and Toshiba.After four quarters of declining shipments, Dell returned to modest unit growth of 5 per cent, IDC said. The Texas company has refused to compete on price as much as its rivals, and has ceded market share instead of profits.Dell had about 12 per cent of the market by volume in the fourth quarter, down from more than 13 per cent at the close of 2008. It remains at number two in the US market.The surge in PCs was most pronounced in the US, pushed by lower prices, said IDC analyst David Daoud.“Once again, the consumer market overcame the weak commercial sector to save the quarter,” he said. IDC and Gartner put US growth at 26 per cent.But IDC warned that an increasing percentage of the computing market was sliding in profitability and quality towards “good enough” computing sold to the lowest bidder.For the first time in three quarters, Europe, the Middle East and Africa combined also showed growth, IDC and Gartner found.Gartner put the increase for the combined area at 3.6 per cent, compared with 44 per cent growth in Asia-Pacific and 43 per cent in Latin America.
410;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-01-13T23:18:08Z;Move to boost Gmail security;;Google has rushed to step up the security of Gmail, its web-based e-mail system, following the admission that hackers based in China had been partially successful in cutting through its security defences.It also sought to reassure corporate users of its online applications that its “ cloud computing” services – applications like word processing that it runs centrally on its own servers – had not succumbed to the attacks.However, the episode could still dent users’ confidence in the security of its web-based services, according to industry observers.The attacks posed a direct challenge to Google’s ability to keep its customer data private and secure and required a strong response from the company, said Sandeep Aggarwal, an analyst at Collins Stewart.“This is a pretty public blow against the security of the cloud,” added Whit Andrews, vice president at Gartner, the research company. The attacks could make some companies think twice about whether to adopt online services but was unlikely to have an effect on individual Gmail users, he added.Google said that the direct attack on its corporate systems had led only to a limited amount of data about two Gmail accounts being accessed. However, it also said that attacks on its users had led to the Gmail accounts of “dozens” of human rights activists being compromised around the world. Those assaults took the form of “phishing” attacks, or attempts to trick users into giving up account details, and the planting of malicious software, or malware, on users’ PCs.In response, the company said it began rolling out an extra layer of security to all users of is Gmail system on Tuesday night, and was now encrypting all e-mails as they travelled between users’ computers and the company’s servers, to prevent them from being intercepted by third parties.It had previously left it to users whether or not they used encryption, since it sometimes slows the speed at which e-mails are transmitted, but has now made this protection mandatory.Gmail had 170m unique users around the world in November, according to research firm ComScore.Writing in a Google blog post, Dave Girouard, head of its division that sells services to companies, denied that the cyber-assaults had been “an attack on cloud computing”. He added: “While some intellectual property on our corporate network was compromised, we believe our customer cloud-based data remains secure.”Some experts said that even if Google closes its operations in China, it will not make its users elsewhere in the world any more secure from attacks like those seen in recent weeks.“The decision to pull out of China will not stop Gmail accounts being phished [attacked] or people trying to get hold of Google’s intellectual property,” said Whit Andrews, an analyst at Gartner. “They seem to be using these incidents as a casus belli.”
411;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-01-13T16:55:47Z;Google hack could hurt cloud computing;;Security experts warned on Wednesday that businesses could lose faith in the security of cloud computing after Google admitted that its web-based Gmail system had been hacked by what it described as attacks originating in China.They said it could slow down corporations’ willingness to put their business information into “the cloud” – remotely-hosted data centres.“This is a pretty public blow against the security of the cloud,” said Whit Andrews, vice president at Gartner, the research company. “It is possible that it will affect the uptake of Google applications.“Most companies that are concerned about security are not considering the cloud at the moment. They might think about it from time to time as a way of making some cost savings, but this could push those decisions back.”However, Mr Andrews said that Google was unlikely to lose Gmail users in any significant amounts over the incidents.He said all companies faced these kinds of attacks. “I can’t identify a company that suddenly looks more responsible than Google on this,” Mr Andrews said.Rival Microsoft, for example, faced security challenges for its Hotmail service 10 years ago, but these had not noticeably slowed growth in user numbers.Security experts said that the threat from Chinese hackers was well-known by the US and UK governments.“The information that we are given is that the UK and US government believe the Chinese cyber attacks are real and aimed at the private as well as the public sector,” said Pete Wood, chief of operations at First Base Technology, an ethical hacking company.“It would be a mistake to assume that Google is any more vulnerable than other providers. Any mail server that we have tested is vulnerable to an attack,” he said.According to Verisign iDefense, the hack attack against Google also targeted 33 other companies, including other Silicon Valley technology companies, financial institutions and defence contractors.It was mainly aimed at stealing source code from the companies, and in some cases was successful.“Sources indicate that they believe the attack is the work of actors operating on behalf of or in the direct employ of official intelligence entities of the People’s Republic of China,” iDefense said.The attacks were similar to an attack last July – also believed to have come from China – which targeted 100 IT companies. iDefense said it was possible that some of these companies might have been compromised since then.Mr Wood said the Google attacks should be a wake-up call for all companies.“There has been complacency in firms. They should be looking at their internet boundaries and how closely they are being monitored. Firms need to be more proactive in protecting themselves. Most of the just don’t know that these attacks are happening,” he said.
412;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-01-11T18:45:53Z;Component shortages set to push up PC costs;;The cost of assembling personal computers will rise this year for the first time in six years because of shortages in some key components, industry analysts have forecast.The cost of semiconductor components in computers has fallen by an annual average of 7.8 per cent since 2000, but they are set to rise this year by 2.8 per cent, according to data from Gartner research consultancy.This is almost entirely attributable to a 23 per cent increase in the price of D-Ram memory chips. Those chips, needed in every computer, make up about 10 per cent of a PC’s overall cost.Ben Lee, principal research analyst, said: “In general, there is a steady drop in the cost of a PC every year. If component prices are flat or even increasing, that means they are outperforming expectations,” .The cost of flat-screen monitors was expected to increase by about 20 per cent this year because of shortages, Mr Lee said. Other components in short supply include hard drives and optical disc drives.The shortages are part of the aftermath of the financial crisis, which led many component makers to delay investment plans. While capacity building resumed late last year, it usually takes at least a year before new factories come on line.This problem is particularly acute in the D-Ram industry, which is in the middle of migrating from second to third-generation chips, called DDR3 chips.Since mid-December, spot prices for DDR3s have risen 23 per cent to $3.01, according to Drame­Xchange.Rising component costs present a dilemma for PC makers, which helped stimulate a recovery in the technology sector last year by selling small, cheap notebook computers to price-conscious consumers. Analysts say PC brands will have to adapt this year by promoting more fully equipped, mainstream computers instead.Additional reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco
413;IT;Gartner Inc;2010-01-05T21:51:10Z;Google makes new push into mobile phones;;Google on Tuesday opened a new front in its push into the mobile phone business with the launch of an online store to sell handsets and service from operators on both sides of the Atlantic.However, it disappointed recent feverish anticipation that it was also about to launch the first purpose-built “Google phone” to compete head-on with Apple’s ground-breaking iPhone.Instead, it revealed a new device made by Taiwan manufacturer HTC which, while displaying the Google brand far more prominently than other handsets, does not break new ground in the company’s involvement in mobile.The online Google phone store will sell the handset with service from Verizon Wireless in the US and Vodafone in the UK immediately, but will quickly be expanded to include more handsets, mobile operators and countries, Google executives said. The early test countries, which also include Singapore and Hong Kong, are only the “first baby steps” in a global push, said Andy Rubin, head of the Google mobile software efforts.Google’s move into online retailing marks its latest attempt to change the ground rules in the mobile business and to stimulate mobile internet use to boost its search advertising business.However, analysts questioned whether its online store would be a hit with consumers. Buyers usually want to try out a new smartphone before buying one, making online sales a small market, said Ken Dulaney, an analyst at Gartner.But Google said it hoped to simplify the buying process for consumers and reduce costs for mobile companies. At present, most mobile phone marketing in the US is backed by expensive TV advertising, and this could be made more efficient if it moved online, Mr Rubin said.The new HTC phone, known as Nexus One, includes new software that Google hopes will build demand for its technology and steal thunder from the iPhone. The features include voice-recognition software.The closely watched launch led to talk that Google was set to release its own handset to compete with Apple, as well as groups such as Motorola that already sell their own handsets with versions of the Google software. Repeating earlier statements that Google was not planning to get into the handset business, Mr Rubin said: “I said Google won’t build hardware. We’re software guys, we’re internet guys.”
414;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-12-30T00:21:15Z;Stage set for Google-Apple mobile duel;;Google will start the new year with a mobile product announcement, setting the stage for what is turning into a showdown with its former ally Apple over mobile computing devices.The search group revealed earlier this month that it had issued employees with a mobile device to test, though it did not give details.On Tuesday it disclosed that it would hold an event at its headquarters in Silicon Valley next Tuesday for a mobile announcement, prompting speculation that the device would be unveiled.The prospect of the first mobile handset in which Google has had a strong hand in the design has caused intense interest in tech circles amid expectations that Apple will also announce its first larger-screen mobile tablet device next month.Apple is planning to make a product announcement of its own in San Francisco late in January, the Financial Times reported last week.There was “almost a land grab going on” among device makers as they vied to be the “gatekeeper” for the latest generation of internet services, said Ashok Kumar, an analyst at Northeast Securities who was among the first to report that Google was planning its own gadget.By announcing a Google phone ahead of Apple’s tablet, the internet company had a chance to steal its rival’s thunder and build a following for its first Google-branded consumer device, Mr Kumar said.However, some analysts warned that if it created a rival gadget, Google would alienate other mobile handset makers that have used its Android mobile operating system in their own products.“If they’re doing their own phone, it’s really a dumb idea,” Ken Dulaney, an analyst at Gartner, said.Rather than produce its own phone, Google was more likely to put its name on the device and have influence over its software, Mr Delaney said.The test, he said, would be whether it took control of the handset inventory, making it the effective producer, or whether it left that with HTC, which is reported to be manufacturing the device.Smartphones based on Google’s open-source Android software, which first appeared 14 months ago, have emerged as some of the strongest challengers to Apple’s iPhone.Mr Kumar warned that unless Google controlled all the elements of a handset, from the hardware design to the user interface, it was unlikely to be able to produce as distinctive a product as the iPhone, and risked losing more ground to Apple.Unlike Microsoft, which sells a version of Windows for smartphones, Google does not charge for the use of Android and so would not jeopardise any commercial relationships by selling its own handset.
415;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-12-27T17:42:50Z;Students power BlackBerry growth;;Young people are becoming one of the largest sources of growth for BlackBerry, as students turn to the traditionally corporate devices to feed their instant messaging and texting needs.BlackBerry’s sudden popularity on university campuses has taken many by surprise, with analysts sceptical that it could shed its close association with business executives.New research by Mobile Youth consultancy found that 2 per cent of university students in the UK had a BlackBerry device.Josh Dhaliwal of Mobile Youth said: “It’s quite a significant sum. That would have been zero a couple of years ago.”In the survey of 1,000 students on November, Nokia was the most popular phone maker with a 30 per cent share, followed by Sony Ericsson with 27 per cent. BlackBerry still has some way to go to catch the market leaders but its growth is impressive given that smartphones are more expensive than traditional mobiles.Carolina Milanesi, mobile analyst at Gartner research firm, saidL: “The perception of the [BlackBerry] device has shifted tremendously. Now you are seen as cool because you have a BlackBerry.”While the iPhone steals most of the limelight for its web-browsing and multimedia functions, it is the BlackBerry’s full “qwerty” keyboard and strength in messaging that holds appeal for teenagers addicted to instant messaging and texting.Research in Motion, the Canadian group that makes the handsets, has been pitching them to consumers as it faces saturation and increasing competition in its core market.More than 80 per cent of BlackBerry’s new connections in its third quarter were from consumers, with more than half of its total subscribers now outside the corporate market. Some analysts are concerned that discounting and the perception of a move downmarket could hit RIM’s margins.RIM’s market share among students has benefited from advertisements targeting consumers over business people and product placement , while celebrities have been spotted toting their product.Rob Orr, RIM’s senior director of product management in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said: “Most studies on the growth of the mobile internet point to social networking as being one of the biggest drivers – which is absolutely where BlackBerry’s key strength lies”.Gartner says BlackBerry users have downloaded 4m instant messaging applications, including MSN and Yahoo’s messaging software.Ms Milanesi says: “Qwerty [keyboards] started out for email use but has now become the IM, SMS addicts’ device of choice.“Particularly in the US, that part of the market is growing faster than the smartphones.”Alongside operator subsidies and cheaper data charges, the BlackBerry has also become more affordable for younger people, especially compared with the iPhone.Ms Milanesi says: “Because of the recession, people have swapped SMS for calls because you are spending less money,”. BlackBerry’s built-in Messenger software is available for a flat fee and so does not eat into voice minutes or texting allowances.Analysts say it still trails the iPhone in web browsing and media consumption. But in turn, other device makers have failed to capitalise on qwerty’s popularity.While Nokia is marketing its E72 as a BlackBerry competitor, Sony Ericsson “completely missed this trend”, Ms Milanesi says.
416;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-12-08T05:00:32Z;Seagate finally goes solid-state with Pulsar;;Seagate, the world’s leading hard disk drive (HDD) maker, has finally introduced its first solid-state drive (SSD) in the shape of the 2.5-inch Pulsar unit.Seagate is late to the game on SSDs – a potential threat to its traditional business – and its first product will be aimed at the enterprise rather than consumer market.Pulsar is designed for blade and general server machines, giving faster access to frequently called-up data through its use of banks of flash memory chips rather than a spinning disk. Its SSDs will have a capacity of up to 200Gb initially.SSDs are more expensive than HDDs and wear out sooner – there is a limit to the amount of times data can be reliably written to the chips.Seagate is therefore targetting the enterprise, where performance is more important than cost, and its use of single-level cell (SLC) technology, rather than multi-level, provides greater endurance and reliability.SSDs are beginning to make an impact at opposite ends of the PC spectrum – in enterprise servers and consumer netbooks – but Seagate sees higher margins for its expertise in the enterprise, with flash memory already a fairly commoditised business.“Nand flash is a commodity consumer product, what Seagate birings to the enterprise is its experience in serving the major storage companies – it’s had about a 60 per cent market share in enterprise hard drives for several years running now,” Joe Unsworth, flash memory analyst at the Gartner research firm, told me.“Are they late to the game? Yes. But have they missed the boat? No. It’s still a very small market – this year we’re expecting about 281,000 units [to ship] but the market we believe will grow to 5.3m units in 2013.”Mr Unsworth says SSDs will eat into Seagate’s high-end hard drive business, but their ability to access databases faster will lead to larger databases overall that need more archival information stored on cheaper disk drives, thereby growing the market for the traditional media.Dave Mosley, executive vice president for sales and marketing at Seagate, says anyone predicting the death of the disk drive at the hands of SSDs is well wide of the mark:“Seagate views the product category as enabling expansion of the overall storage market for both SSDs and HDDs,” he says.“HDDS and SSDs will co-exist for a long time.”
417;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-12-02T22:42:20Z;Yahoo to support Facebook Connect;;Yahoo and Facebook have struck a deal that will allow people to log into Yahoo’s vast stable of sites using their Facebook credentials.The partnership marks a significant milestone for the Facebook Connect service, which is already used by a number of sites including CNN and Yelp.“This increases Facebook’s prominence as a big part of the social infrastructure of the web,” said Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner.Facebook is investing heavily in Connect, which allows its 350m users to log into other sites using their Facebook ID.By allowing users to log into different sites on the web, taking their network of friends with them, Facebook hopes to provide users with an identity they can use across a range of sites.The move is part of a broader trend towards the so-called “social web”.“The social dimension is becoming a key part of the web experience,” said Mr Valdes. “It’s no longer sufficient to connect to content, we also need to connect to people.”For Yahoo, embracing Facebook could mean an influx of new users.Yahoo missed out on the surge in social networking but has pledged under chief executive Carol Bartz to put social tools into many of its websites.It has also attempted to become a more open platform, allowing users to customise homepages with a variety of widgets and applications.“This will allow Facebook feed to be enriched by Yahoo content, and Yahoo to benefit from the Facebook network,” said Jim Stoneham, vice-president of communities for Yahoo.Details of the non-cash deal are still being worked out. Yahoo said it expects to roll out the service in the first half of next year.Already there is an overlap between the two sites’ audiences.According to comScore, which analyses internet traffic, 52 per cent of Yahoo visitors are also visiting Facebook, while 84 per cent of Facebook users also visit Yahoo sites.Yahoo still maintains one of the most popular collections of sites on the web. These include the photo sharing site Flickr, the careers site HotJobs and its self-branded sports and finance pages.The move also represents an attempt by Yahoo to regain its former stature. “They were once a centre of gravity for the web,” said Mr Valdes. “That shifted.”In the wake of a controversial deal that gave Microsoft power over Yahoo’s search engine, analysts said Yahoo could be ceding too much control.“The risk for Yahoo is that they’re slowly giving up control of their user experience to other parties,” said Mr Valdes.
418;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
419;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-11-26T18:04:50Z;Accounting intelligence: Historians asked to become forecasters;;The biggest challenge in accounting intelligence centres upon the mismatch between the data and the changing role of the chief financial officer (CFO).Since the days of ledgers and quills, the accountant’s role has been essentially that of financial historian, preparing reports to present a year-end snapshot of the state of a company’s finances.With the advent of IT, corporate accounting systems were therefore designed to capture data and do the adding up. In recent decades, market demands for more information – statements of cash flow and more detail on liabilities – added to the data crunching task.But the financial crisis has crystallised a fundamental shift in expectations of the CFO’s role: colleagues want the historian to turn forecaster.“For far too long, accounting has been historic,” says Andrew Meade, managing partner for finance and performance improvement UK and Ireland at advisory firm Accenture.“Companies spend too much time sorting out and reconciling their history before trying to sort out future trends …The real value finance should bring to the table is helping businesses look forward.”Bill Fuessler, IBM Global Financial Management Lead for business consulting, concurs: “In the last 10-15 years most companies have put in some kind of financial system for general ledger.“But the past 18 months have pushed the CFO to the forefront – they have shown it is important also to have information about business risk and metrics. People are looking for forward-looking, predictive measures.”In a business environment of unprecedented uncertainty, executives want every clue they can get to likely changes in their operating environment, and contingency plans to respond to possible scenarios.Many of the key unpredictable factors are financial: changes in commodity prices, currency valuations and interest rates, for example.The abruptness of the credit crisis unleashed by the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008 showed that even banks with the most advanced accounting systems, were unable to produce real-time data on fundamental metrics relating to risk and counterparty exposure.Yet business trends have hugely multiplied the scale of risk. Neil McGovern, Director of Product Strategy at financial systems specialist Sybase, points out that “markets have speeded up five-fold in the past 10 years, so they do the same amount of trading in a day that they used to do in a week”.By simple arithmetic, any trading institution that is not therefore checking its value at risk (a measure of the probability of loss) five times more often has seen the VAR increase.The need for real-time accounting data is particularly acute in financial markets. Regulators and risk managers are demanding much closer monitoring of VAR and counterparty risk.Yet data volumes are so huge that until recently, uploading information to accountants in the middle-office only took place overnight.Many corporate accounting systems are also inadequate for showing accurately the state of the business today, let alone providing clues to future performance.Financial data are often stuck in functional silos, cannot be reconciled, and quality is in any case compromised by “sclerosis” – the failure to modernise systems or even simple data definitions, to match organisational changes.A simple example of sclerosis is a failure to attribute new codes to new types of materials purchased, or even expenses claimed by employees, which leads staff to make “approximate” entries under the most-similar existing code, leading to budgets appearing to grow even as real spending on a particular item is falling.As a result of fragmented legacy systems, poor data quality, lack of standard definitions and so on, many companies simply do not have reliable internal financial intelligence available to the C-suite executives, analysts say.Even when the data are there, Nigel Rayner, research vice-president at Gartner, says: “Our estimate is that only about 20 per cent of companies with the capability regularly use business intelligence functions.”Many finance chiefs still rely on old-fashioned spreadsheets to keep tabs on the company’s finances. No wonder providers of business intelligence systems report strong interest from potential clients.Clearly, the first task of boards and IT chiefs is to find ways to make a harmonised and accurate set of data available, preferably in real-time. Then directors have to choose their key metrics and look at how to answer the questions arising about the future of the business.In the first instance, a finance director needs answers to current questions: how much working capital is tied up in the business? How much in the supply chain? How much are we owed, and what are the numbers and trends in accounts payable and receivable?But as James Fisher, senior director of solution marketing at SAP says, as soon as current information is available, directors want forward indicators, from sales, marketing and production, so that they can extrapolate future financial performance.Only once future financial trends in the business are clear, can directors start to monitor indicators and model strategies to improve future performance or react to challenges such as falling customer satisfaction.“You have to include monitoring and build in remediation plans,” says Mr Fisher.“Many organisations are not achieving this closed-loop.”Today, he says, technology enables companies to start posing the question: “What if?” – that is, to model what would happen to sales and profitability if they raised or lowered prices, reduced a product range, or added a new line within a particular price bracket.It is only once data become useful information of this sort, says Accenture’s Mr Meade, that the CFO can really start adding value in the way boardroom colleagues want.With the right financial information, he says, a finance chief could help them make better decisions across the organisation, from reshaping business models to signing tomorrow’s stars in the music industry.
420;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-11-26T16:15:41Z;Introducing the IT Market Clock;;"IT is no longer an emerging set of capabilities and markets – it is a maturing business tool and must be managed as such.Although new capabilities continue to appear in the market, their adoption and use require them to be integrated into a portfolio of existing IT assets, many of which are already mature.Some IT assets are no longer required, or no longer deliver sufficient business value to justify the costs of maintaining them. Usually, working to budget means new IT products and services can only be adopted if existing IT assets are retired or replaced.Every IT product and service has a finite useful life and must eventually be retired or replaced. Correct timing of this retirement/replacement is critical.The second part of useful life, from maturity to obsolescence, must be considered when managing IT assets throughout their whole life cycles. Most organisations require more-holistic mechanisms for planning IT divestment and reinvestment activity.Gartner’s IT Market Clock is a new framework that supports strategic investment and divestment decisions. Tools and methodologies that focus only on technology adoption are no longer sufficient to support the decisions required to manage portfolios of IT assets throughout their full lifetime of use.Gartner’s Hype Cycle for example, which the Gartner Market Clock complements, is a buyer’s decision framework for technology adoption, but its view ends when mainstream adoption begins, which typically equates to an adoption level of between 20 and 50 per cent.Simply, the Hype Cycle supports “technology hunting” decisions, while the IT Market Clock supports “farming” decisions for assets already in use.The IT Market Clock uses a clock-face metaphor to represent relative market time. Each point positioned on the IT Market Clock represents an IT asset or asset class: for example, desktop PCs, packaged maintenance and support services or corporate learning systems.Technology assets are positioned on the IT Market Clock using two parameters. The first is where they currently lie within their own useful market life, from the first time the technology product or service can be acquired and used to the last time it can be viably used.This determines the rotational position of the asset on the Market Clock – each begins at 0 (called ”Market Start”), and moves clockwise round to 12 o’clock.The second is relative level of commoditisation, ie the ease with which the technology product or service can be interchanged with alternatives. Relative commoditisation determines the distance from the centre of the Market Clock; assets further from the centre are more commoditised.Commoditisation is a proxy for the balance of market power between buyers/users and suppliers. For most asset classes, relative commoditisation levels begin low, increase steadily as the market matures and then decrease again toward end of life.The IT Market Clock is divided into quarters, each representing one of four market phases of the useful market life of an IT asset.The Advantage quarter represents the first stage of market life, during which technologies are often proprietary or highly customised and assets provide differentiated technology, service or capability.There will usually be limited supply options and high dependence on relevant skills. Users should focus on benefits received.Choice is the second phase of market life, during which technology assets are subject to increasing levels of standardisation and growing supply options. Users should re-evaluate the level of required customisation, prices and supply choices periodically as assets in this phase offer the greatest scope for cost savings.The Cost quarter is the third phase of market life, during which assets reach their highest levels of commoditisation. Differentiation between alternative sources is at its minimum level and competition centres on price. Users should focus on acquisition and switching costs and ensure minimal skill-set dependencies.Replacement is the final phase of market life, during which assets begin to move towards end of life, usually because they comprise legacy technologies, services or capabilities.Supply choices and access to available skill sets will be decreasing, leading to rising operational costs. Their retirement or upgrade is essential. User organisations need to monitor operating costs for IT products and services in the disfavoured phase of their market life.Operating costs rise toward end of market life, highlighting a growing urgency for retirement or replacement. For example, the skills needed to support and maintain mainframes and business applications at end-of-life are in increasingly short supply.Suppliers and buying organisations can move to offset these issues during the Replacement phase, as, for example, has happened in the UK, with leading financial institutions encouraging universities to place Assemble and Cobol (which is now 50 years old) back on their curriculums.But while such moves can alleviate immediate problems, each initiative to extend useful life typically comes at higher cost.Moreover, as more companies move off legacy technologies, the burden of responsibility for maintaining associated skill sets falls to a diminishing number of organisations. The marginal costs of continuing to use technologies as they approach the end of their useful lives will increase.With a holistic decision framework, user organisations will be able to manage their asset portfolios proactively and determine the right time to adopt and deploy emerging or adolescent technology options, establish road map plans for replacement and upgrade of existing technology assets, and perform reviews with suppliers for best saving opportunities.Although such a framework is focused on technology assets, the same approach could also be extended and applied to any class of business assets."
421;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-11-23T17:01:06Z;2009 PC sales will rise after all, says Gartner;;So Intel’s Paul Otellini was right after all – PC sales should rise this year, according to the Gartner research firm, despite the recession.At the Intel Developer Forum in September, the chipmaker’s chief executive said he thought the market was poised for resurgence and PC units could be flat to slightly up in 2009.Today Gartner changed its forecast from September’s 2 per cent decline in shipments to a 2.8 per cent increase on 2008.In September, Gartner said it would take an exceptionally strong second half for Mr Otellini’s prediction to come true, and this was “possible but…not likely.”Gartner had predicted an 11.9 per cent fall in shipments earlier in the year.Clearly, Intel, with its processors featuring in four out of five PCs sold, would have seen signs of recovery sooner – it can judge shipments by demand for its chips from PC makers as they ramp up for the holiday selling season.“Shipments in the third quarter of 2009 were much stronger than we expected, and that alone virtually guaranteed we would see positive growth this year,” said George Shiffler, research director at Gartner.“We’re anticipating seasonally modest growth in the fourth quarter of 2009, but because shipments were so weak in the fourth quarter of 2008, growth will appear quite strong. This could lull vendors and market watchers into thinking the market is recovering faster than it really is.”The other statistics of caution in the Gartner report are that, while units shipped may rise, revenues should fall around 10.7 per cent on 2008.Mr Schiffler said there had been unprecedented declines in average selling prices this year, with consumers looking for “good enough” PCs and vendors catering to ever-lower price points.Gartner expects the global PC market to be worth $217bn this year and $222.9bn in 2010 – a 2.6 per cent increase as average selling prices remain low.In contrast, it expects 2010 shipments to increase 12.6 per cent from 298.9m units to 336.6m.Gartner expects Windows 7 to have a limited impact on holiday PC sales and only expects business to shift to the new operating system in significant numbers in the back end of 2010.Mobile PC units are expected to increase to 162m units in 2009, up 15.4 per cent, helped by the popularity of netbooks. They are a bigger category than desktop PCs now, where shipments are expected to fall 9 per cent to 137m units.
422;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-11-18T18:45:21Z;Sony to bring PS3 video service to Europe;;Sony will allow PlayStation 3 users in Europe to download movies through their consoles from Thursday, stepping up its battle with Microsoft over games machines.Both companies are beefing up the functions on their consoles to make them appeal to a wider audience, in an attempt to establish them as the entertainment hub in people’s living rooms.Earlier this week Microsoft announced it was extending its Zune video and music service outside the US for the first time, and making it available through its XBox 360 console. Microsoft will allow XBox users to access internet sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Last.fm.Sony is also planning to allow access to Facebook through the PS3. It has offered a video download service in the US since last year, but is now bringing this to Europe.“They are trying to extend the value of the consoles by extending the non-gaming content. The living room is the big target,” said Mike McGuire, media analyst at Gartner.Sony is still trailing behind Microsoft and Nintendo in console sales, with 27m consoles shipped at the end of September, compared with more than 31m XBox 360 consoles and 56m of the Nintendo Wii. However, it said monthly sales had increased by 300 per cent since cutting the price in August .Both Microsoft and Sony are also competing for the living room with Apple, which sells music and videos through its iTunes store. These can be watched on a television screen through the Apple TV set-top box.Analysts at Screen Digest estimate that Apple will account for about 60 per cent of all US online movie transactions this year, with Microsoft accounting for 20 per cent and Sony for 10 per cent.Sony’s entry into the European video on demand market will mean a new challenge for existing pay-TV operators such as British Sky Broadcasting.So far, traditional pay-TV companies have faced little challenge from companies offering movie downloads online. At least 15 such sites have closed down in Europe this year, including the BT Vision Download Store, UK start-up Vizumi and the Free Record Shop in Belgium.Sony is nearly two years behind Microsoft in offering video downloads in Europe, but said it had taken time to line up local European content.The video service will launch in the UK, France, Germany and Spain, with a further roll-out planned across Europe later.In addition to movies from Hollywood studios, Sony will provide films from studios such as Pathé of France and Optimum Releasing of the UK. Movies will start from about £2.49 ($4.17) to rent, and analysts estimate that studios would get about 60 to 70 per cent of these revenues.

424;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-11-12T22:18:38Z;BlackBerry maker takes fight to rivals;;Jim Balsillie, co-chief executive of Research in Motion, has decided to take the fight to its new rivals in the smart phone market.He brought the Canadian company that makes the highly successful BlackBerry to the San Francisco Bay Area this week, home of rivals Google and Apple, for a developer conference with the aim of proving RIM could keep up with its two US rivals in the hottest part of the mobile market.“I think close to 50 per cent of the phones sold in the US this year will be smartphones. Not long ago it was 5 to 6 per cent,” he told the Financial Times in an interview.RIM is under attack from Apple’s iPhone and a host of Google-inspired Android devices but Mr Balsillie believes RIM can stay out in front.“We feel very good about our portfolio, but it’s a hotly contested market and it’s expanding rapidly too. We’re fortunate to be in a leading position but we have to work every day to extend our position.”RIM had a 20 per cent share of the global smartphone market in the first quarter, second only to devices running the Nokia-backed Symbian operating system, according to the Gartner research firm.But Gartner expects the BlackBerry to slip to about 14 per cent by 2012 and a share of third place with the iPhone, as Android phones grow from 2 per cent to 18 per cent of unit sales to occupy second spot behind Symbian.Handsets running the Android operating system are already being favoured by some of the big US mobile operators – Verizon has heavily promoted the new Motorola Droid in preference to its BlackBerry line-up.RIM has also faltered in its response to the touch-screen iPhone. Performance trailed on the Storm, its first touch model, lacking its famous physical keyboard, and it was poorly received by reviewers.The Storm 2, which has just hit the market, has many improvements, but analysts predict RIM will have to add a slide-out keyboard to satisfy its customers.On the software side, BlackBerry devices have lacked sexy interfaces and easy web browsing.It is also way behind Apple in offering new applications for the BlackBerry from its online app store which launched last April.RIM sought to address all these issues at its second annual developer conference this week.Mr Balsillie said carrier billing was on the way, so users would no longer be confined to using Paypal to pay for apps. RIM will also help developers to serve ads in their applications and make the apps aware of the device’s location.Mr Balsillie bridled at the idea that his company was responding from a position of weakness.“We changed the world today in a way where nobody ever, ever, ever has even possibly declared that sense of possibility – and you frame it as catch-up? I’m shocked,” he said.He insists that the BlackBerry is distinct in offering “deep, rich integration” of applications with the phone’s core features. This means, for example, that an Ebay application can automatically add entries to the calendar to remind the user about an auction.The Apple iPhone lacks this integration at present and its rivals are exploiting this. The Palm Pre and Android phones feature integration such as a “social address book”, where contacts lists are also populated with their latest tweets from Twitter or status updates on Facebook.“We think this deep, rich integration is the holy grail. We think that’s the differentiator,” says Mr Balsillie.“Some would argue it’s all about an enormous choice of applications not about their depth of integration, but let the market decide.”
425;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-11-10T02:00:13Z;Samsung to allow independent ‘apps’;;Samsung is seeking to become a bigger player in the fast-growing smartphone market by giving independent developers the tools to devise software applications for its handsets.The world’s second-largest handset maker will on Tuesday unveil “bada”, the South Korean company’s new mobile platform, for which software developers can produce applications.It will be the first time that Samsung has provided developers with the tools to create applications that can run on the proprietary operating system that powers its handsets.Bada means “ocean” in Korean, and Samsung said the name was meant to convey the potential for a huge variety of applications to run on the new mobile platform.The popularity of Apple’s iPhone is partly rooted in the way its smartphone can run tens of thousands of applications by independent developers, such as games and maps.Samsung already manufactures smartphones using operating systems by Nokia, Microsoft and Google.Samsung’s first smartphones using its bada platform will be released in the first half of next year, together with an “app store” that is meant to include at least 1,000 applications.Next month, Samsung will issue a kit to independent developers so that they can produce applications for the bada platform.Mobile phone makers, led by Nokia, are increasingly focused on turning smartphones into a mass market phenomenon.Dr Ho Soo Lee, executive vice president at Samsung Electronics with responsibility for its media solutions centre, said the company’s smartphones using the bada platform would be suitable for emerging as well as western markets.Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner, said Samsung’s bada smartphones were likely to cost between $80 and $220. “Samsung are targeting low to mid-end smartphones, which feels like another kick to Nokia,” she added.Martin Garner, analyst at CCS Insight, said Samsung was contributing to the proliferation of smartphone operating systems and applications, and could encounter scepticism from independent developers.“The big challenge for Samsung is getting a critical mass of developers, and explaining to them why it is a good thing to have yet another platform,” he said.
426;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-11-10T00:29:20Z;Cisco collaboration: nice pieces, where’s the glue?;;Cisco has been on a buying binge as it moves into the collaboration software market. But it has yet to address one overriding question: where’s the glue that will turn an interesting collection of pieces into a coherent whole?The latest evidence of Cisco’s ambition is on display at its Collaboration Summit, which is taking place in San Francisco the first three days of this week. Among the new products it has unveiled: its first Web-based corporate email service (for as little as $3.50 a month per user) and a social-networking portal for employees to connect with each other.All well and good. But how do all the pieces fit together?This is partly, but not wholly, a technology question.Through acquisitions like WebEx, PostPath (the basis of its new email service) and Tandberg (which today was pushed back a few days as Cisco waits for minority shareholders to fall in line), Cisco has an array of different collaboration platforms to try to integrate.The first steps in that direction can already be seen – for instance, in the new feature this week that integrates video from Cisco’s Telepresence system into Webex online conferences.Combining some of the features to devise specific solutions like this, though, still leaves open the bigger question: What is the vision that combines all these things, and makes Cisco a true rival to Microsoft, IBM and – increasingly – Google?As Ken Dulaney at Gartner put it when I spoke to him earlier: What Cisco lacks is a common user interface and underlying data structure for its collaboration services. That is what Microsoft and IBM have, and it means they can keep adding new features to their existing suites of collaboration tools as they expand.Ultimately, Cisco’s push into collaboration looks like a bet on voice and video – it is a communications play. It is trying to add the tools to this that make workers more productive, but it is a very different starting point to the traditional collaboration companies.Of course, even if they continue to be run largely as stand-alone services, Cisco’s collaboration tools will still amount to a collection of powerful, bandwidth-hungry businesses, which is what the company needs to drive its growth. But John Chambers’ ultimate claim is that he can make workers more productive, and that means creating a whole that is worth more than the sum of the parts.As Mr Dulaney says: Cisco needs to lay out a more comprehensive vision for where it is going in collaboration, and how it is going to get there.
427;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-11-03T17:23:47Z;Sony Ericsson unveils Android-powered phone;;Sony Ericsson, the troubled mobile phone maker, on Tuesday unveiled a sophisticated smartphone that it hopes will be a credible alternative to Apple’s iPhone.The X10 handset is Sony Ericsson’s first to be powered by Google’s Android operating system, and will go on sale in the first quarter of next year.The new touchscreen mobile is an important milestone in the turnround strategy of Sony Ericsson, which is a joint venture between Japan’s Sony and Sweden’s Ericsson.Sony Ericsson has been badly hurt by its failure to produce attractive touchscreen smartphones, as well as falling consumer demand for handsets during the recession.Analysts said Apple’s iPhone, launched in 2007, remained the best smartphone, but added that the X10 would mount a genuine challenge to alternative devices such as Nokia’s N97 and HTC’s Hero.Bert Nordberg, Sony Ericsson’s new president, said the reaction from mobile phone operators to the X10 had been “extremely positive”.“We will be rolling out across the world including Japan from the first half of 2010,” he added.Sony Ericsson said the X10 would not be available for the important pre-Christmas sales period because it had not yet produced “sufficient quantities”.Like other handset makers, Sony Ericsson is seeking to capitalise on the popularity of visiting social networking websites from mobiles.The X10 features a software application called Sony Ericsson Timescape, which integrates status updates on Facebook and Twitter in one place, alongside email and text messages.Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner, said things had been getting “pretty bad” for Sony Ericsson because of its lack of touchscreen smartphones that focused on social networking.She added that the Android operating system solved that problem for Sony Ericsson, and brought the company “into the same era” as its rivals.Sony Ericsson started running up operating losses in the second quarter of last year, partly because its ageing range of handsets.In the third quarter of this year, the company’s market share was 5 per cent, down from 8 per cent in the same period in 2008.Dick Komiyama, Sony Ericsson’s president until last month, began the company’s turnround with an aggressive cost cutting programme, and Mr Nordberg is now refreshing its range of handsets.
428;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-11-02T22:03:25Z;Life in an interconnected world;;The Digital Age has bred a new class of information slaves. They process endless streams of e-mail or waste time hunting for information on their hard disks and corporate intranets. Edited and re-edited versions of the same document bounce back and forth on long e-mail threads among co-workers, challenging them to keep up.For the tortuous and time-consuming nature of this work, you can blame some of the world’s biggest technology companies. Much of the “collaboration software” that most workers use to communicate and work together – in particular the e-mail systems that dominate white-collar working life – has barely changed in a decade, even as the tide of messages and documents has risen.“It’s almost been criminal, the lack of innovation on the e-mail client,” says Matt Cain, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm.Even in areas where technology has advanced, many workers are still in the Dark Ages – either because their companies have yet to give them the latest tools, or because they don’t have the time or inclination to try them out.“It’s a constant challenge for us to make people engage with new technologies,” says Stephen Elop, president of Microsoft’s business division, which makes the widely used Office applications.The sheer number of applications that the average worker has to juggle hasn’t helped. These now range from corporate document-sharing sites and web conferencing to Facebook and Twitter, which are starting to encroach from the consumer world.“If you count up all the applications people are being asked to use, it’s probably a dozen,” says Ted Schadler, an analyst at Forrester Research. The result, he says, is overload and frustration.In a survey last month of how 2,000 office workers use their PCs, Forrester concluded that the take-up of collaboration tools has “stalled out”, leaving e-mail as the all-purpose default option.Change, however, is finally in the air. The market for collaboration software, dominated for years by Microsoft and IBM, is now under attack from all sides as other technology companies hunt for ways to make so-called “knowledge workers” more productive.Cisco Systems showed its hand last month with the announcement of a $3bn (€2bn, £1.8bn) agreement to buy Tandberg, a Norwegian video-conferencing company, to add to widening portfolio tools. Google launched a limited test version of its own all-purpose online tool, known as Wave, in September.Undaunted by the coming clash of giants such as these, several start-ups have also set their sights on the market. Typical of the breed is Xobni, whose technology rides on top of the widely used Microsoft Outlook e-mail software and aims to help users find and make use of information in their e-mail inboxes more effectively than Microsoft’s own tools can.Most of these companies have their sights set on the same things: simplification and convergence.One manifestation of this is the growing use of “dashboards” – screens that bring a number of applications together in one view. They are usually centred on the e-mail inbox, with parts of the screen given over to other applications.Designs such as this are meant to help workers complete a task without having to close and open multiple windows on their PCs. They aggregate multiple sources of information and provide a limited amount of information integration.For instance, when opening an e-mail from a customer, a user of Xobni’s dashboard might see information alongside it drawn automatically from the company’s internal customer relationship management system, says Jeff Bonforte, the company’s chief executive. The bigger operators are also moving quickly in this direction, with most likely to announce similar products in the coming months, says Mr Schadler at Forrester.Aggregating and integrating e-mail with other sources of information and applications is only part of the answer. Eventually, to solve e-mail overload, the inbox itself needs to become smarter.“It should be able to aggregate all the sources and recommend priorities,” says Doug Heintzman, head of strategy for IBM’s collaboration software. Research labs at companies such as IBM and Microsoft have been working for some time on the algorithms to do this, but according to Mr Heintzman, a working system is still three to five years away.A second approach to simplification and convergence focuses on ways for workers to collaborate on tasks without having to resort to endless group e-mails with multiple “cc’s” and attachments.Most new approaches revolve around software that keeps information in a central place and lets staff jointly access and work on it. Microsoft, for instance, has devised a way for people in different locations to “co-author” a document simultaneously, though their employers will need to buy the latest versions of its Office and server-based Sharepoint software for this to work.Google is now trying to go one better. If people can communicate in the same place that they create and edit information, it calculates, then many of the complexities caused by current software would fall away.The result is Google Wave, an online application built for both consumer and work use that merges multiple ways of working and communicating. That makes it the Swiss Army Knife of software, and its early reception has been mixed, reflecting the difficulty off such an ambitious undertaking.“It’s the opposite of simple,” says Mr Cain at Gartner, though he adds that it is “really innovative”.“There’s no doubt it will have an impact on the evolution of this market,” he says.For the average information slave, meanwhile, none of this guarantees a quick or sure route to higher productivity and lower blood pressure. Though many of these new ways of interacting have already been tried out in the consumer world – “social” software such as wikis, or co-authored, documents were a staple of the Web 2.0 movement – it will be some time before they find their way into office life.It takes time for experimental consumer services to evolve into the stable, secure applications that corporate IT departments feel comfortable with. Also, the slow upgrade cycle of corporate software feels glacial compared to the red-hot pace of innovation currently seen on the internet.The biggest challenge of all, though, comes from workers themselves. Any collaboration tool that is not adopted widely will, by definition, fail, yet devising software that appeals to a broad group of users is hard, says Mr Heintzman at IBM. “There are so many different work styles, people have so many different roles and come from different cultures,” he explains.They also come from different technological eras: a generation of workers wedded to e-mail is starting to encounter a generation that grew up on social networks and instant messaging. Keeping them all on the same page will not be easy.Learn more at www.ft.com/techblog
429;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-11-02T16:44:02Z;Higher level: IT efficiency drive must begin with basic questions;;"There are key questions an IT department should be asking itself: who are we supporting, what do they do, and where do they do it? Is the way we do things really supporting the business? And how can we remove simple problems through automated tasks or self-service?This is where the IT function should begin its efforts to improve efficiency and effectiveness, according to Adam Collins of BT Engage IT, BT’s IT services arm.“It is a common misconception within most businesses that technology alone will resolve such issues. It is only through the understanding of people, process and technology that we can truly improve the service,” he says.It is therefore fortunate that help is available in the form of Itil, the Information Technology Infrastructure Library. Developed by the UK government’s computing agency in the 1980s, but now recognised worldwide, it marries a series of volumes of best practice in data centre management with a scheme for acquiring professional qualifications.So: follow ITIL to the letter and all your problems will be over?It is not so simple, says Tony Baron, an industry expert who helped to write the Itil manuals: “Many people focus on Itil as the panacea but before you get into it you have to understand the maturity and capability of the department.”Mr Baron warns that putting Itil in the hands of a department with low operational maturity can be a recipe for disaster, drawing an analogy with schoolwork: “You do not learn calculus at six years old; you start with adding up,” he says.“It’s all about managing states. There is the current state – how your organisation is currently configured – and the desired state – where you want to be. Failure is inevitable when people try to move from a state they do not fully understand to another state.”He says a major benefit of the millennium exercise, when many companies froze all IT development while they dealt with the feared repercussions of the date change, was that for the first time they were able to draw a complete picture of the state of their infrastructure and consequently provide a higher level of service.Measurement is key to understanding the state of an organisation’s infrastructure says Kevin Smith, vice-president, products, for FrontRange Solutions, a software group based in California in the US and Berkshire in the UK.He points out that simple incidents such as a broken printer or an e-mail failure can seriously affect a company’s productivity. It was important to measure both the response and resolution time: “The first step is measuring and once you start measuring something, it will generally improve,” he says.He goes on to argue that departments should leverage the best of new technology: “We have a new generation of software applications that IT should demand and not settle for the classic software that they have been using for the past 15 years.”Mr Smith worries that IT often finds itself “siloed” in the organisation, a concern echoed by Karl Havers, head of the European technology centre at consultancy Ernst & Young: “The biggest single issue in all big implementations is not the IT but the people that use it and the business processes that need to change to enable it.“I see far too much silo mentality in many organisations. It is a shocking waste and the pervasive nature of IT means that it is everyone’s problem and opportunity.”Mr Havers’ answer is strong sponsorship from the chief executive and a more positive approach from IT directors: “They know what needs to be done; they often just cannot get it done. Perhaps that is why the turnover of IT directors is so high. They are always looking for that triumph of hope over experience in that next post where the business takes IT seriously,” he suggests a trifle wearily.Where should IT departments be focusing their efforts?Simplicity rather than complexity is the gold standard according to David Elton, IT and change management specialist with PA Consulting Group. He says: “Learning is good; empathy is better; simplicity is the real answer. Never mind the requirements specification and the testing. Think anthropology. If the technology is misanthropic, it will be hard to get it to work. Design it for people and the bumping stops and everyone can get on with more interesting stuff.”Commissioning systems to monitor customer behaviour is critical according to Giles Nelson of Progress Software: “Our research shows that more than two thirds of businesses only find out about problems when customers have flagged them …companies could find themselves in trouble by waiting for their customers to point out weaknesses.”Ewen Anderson of the consultancy Centralis concurs: “First, follow the mantra of simplify, standardise and centralise.“Simplify the problem by removing the link between the applications and client devices and standardise by delivering the applications as a service from a centralised delivery platform.“After those steps, deploy monitoring tools that allow you to set thresholds and benchmarks so that you know when things are not right – and exactly how not right they are – long before the user ever has to put in a call to the IT helpdesk.”It is also vital to staff the helpdesk with the right people. Research by Plan-Net, the services group, found that the majority of help desks were biased towards second line analysts, problem solvers who roam the building and liase with users.The cost implications, according to Plan-Net’s Derek Elphick, are significant. The consultancy Gartner, he notes, prices the average cost for a fault resolved by a first line analyst (one who mans the help desk throughout his or her shift) at between £7 and £25; the same fault resolved by a second line analysts would cost between £24 and £170.“There is no statistical evidence to support the second line bias and no argument based on user experience,” notes Mr Elphick. “So it must be time to move towards a more intelligent, measured, technical service desk. No one is claiming the change will be easy but, as those that have already taken the plunge will no doubt agree, the rewards will be worth it.”"
430;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-11-02T16:44:02Z;Did IT Work? BPM is finally aligning business and IT;;"Ensuring that IT is in step with the business is a constant challenge and any tool that allows applications to be developed for the business quickly, using terminology that line of business managers understand, will find a ready market.One such technology – perhaps the only such technology – is business process management. BPM is not specifically an IT term: rather it is a management practice that sets out to look at how a business runs its processes, improve them, and ensure that the company then keeps running according to that best practice.IT’s role in BPM is most often associated with a set of development tools that translate business processes or workflows into software. Usually these tools work by modelling the business process visually, so that both IT and non-IT people can see how the application will work.Once the workflow has been captured, the BPM tool then produces the code for a the new software application in a semi-automated way. The idea is to speed up development times, and even allow non-IT specialists to develop quite complex business applications.Such is the appetite for business process improvements that companies are continuing to invest in BPM, despite the strictures being placed on other parts of the IT budget.According to industry analysts Gartner, 37 per cent of companies in North America and western Europe are either thinking about investing in BMP, or have already done so.One of the attractions of BPM, says Michele Cantara, vice president in Gartner’s business of IT research division, is that projects do not have to be on a very large scale in order to produce a return on investment. “Half of the companies in our BPM awards broke even in the first year,” she explains. “These are not large, intergalactic projects. In terms of project costs, the budget is usually in the range of $400,000 to $600,000.”Often, BPM projects will be significantly smaller than that. As Ian Gotts, chief executive of Nimbus Partners, a BPM vendor, points out, early stage projects are often in the £30,000 to £50,000 range. This can extend to multi-million pound projects with a two to three year implementation period in industries such as the utilities “where the business case justifies it”.However, both vendors and analysts agree that early-stage BPM works best where the tool is used to capture a structured business flow with well-defined information. It becomes more difficult to model business flows that depend heavily on human decision-making or judgments, or where information is contained in documents or media files rather than databases.“Companies focus on process improvements, and so they look [first] at documented or automated processes,” says Ms Cantara. “They don’t necessarily look at human tasks that are part informal work processes; they don’t necessarily look at processes that are more ‘squishy’, ad hoc or collaborative, that might vary from individual to individual or situation to situation.”None the less, companies are finding that business process management is enabling them to tackle projects more quickly and efficiently than before.“Modern BPM is a tool that enables a different conversation with the business. It is a visual tool that lets you build both complex and simple business processes in very visual way,” says Toby Redshaw, CIO of Aviva, the insurance company.Aviva currently has 23 live BPM projects. One, the “Joiners, movers and leavers” system, tracks staff across their time with Aviva, from both an HR, and an information and systems access, point of view. It was built in less than 12 weeks using BPM tools from Lombardi.“It is an important project from an HR but also a controls perspective,” says Mr Redshaw. “We took a process that is complex and difficult, and we delivered in eight weeks with three weeks testing.”Mr Redshaw believes that development through BPM is, on average, three times faster than conventional development, and business users are more satisfied with the results.“They say ‘you IT monkeys finally sent us people who speak our language’,” he says, although he points out that the effectiveness of BPM really comes from the more visual and iterative methods it forces upon both business and IT teams.BPM was also the route taken by another insurance company, Skandia, when it came to modernising its workflow for handling customer correspondence. Originally, staff would log incoming post into a database, which created work items for distribution to departments. These were then transferred to a number of end user systems.By using BPM, Skandia was able to centralise its processes into a single workflow system and remove a large amount of laborious administrative tasks, freeing up employees to spend more time with customers.“Workflow [a BPM product from vendor Tibco] has automated that,” explains Tim Mann, platform development director at Skandia. “The post is scanned in, and the workflow system knows where to send it. It tells a supervisor [which tasks are waiting] and moves on. It has replaced several end-user systems and human supervision.”Improvements to local workflow methods are saving Skandia £250,000 a year, and rolling the system out to 10 customer services teams equates to £300,000 in productivity savings. Increasing business volumes at the insurer meant there were no job losses, but the business is “doing more with the same resources”.In addition, Skandia expects to save £150,000 annually by reducing its reliance on paper, bringing lower costs for printing and also transport and storage.A further benefit, Mr Mann suggests, comes in the form of improved staff satisfaction. “Staff feel more engaged,” he says. “A lot of the work, when it was paper based, was repetitive. Workflow helps them get through it, and allows them to spend more time dealing with policyholders by e-mail or on the phone. Good customer service is about having good people on the phone; that is where we add value.”Skandia’s experience supports the argument that BPM can work for smaller, more localised projects as well as for larger, business-wide projects. “A lot of it is about streamlining processes, and changing the way you are working, layering technology over the top and making it much more smooth and efficient,” says Mr Mann."
431;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-10-28T22:39:18Z;Bear claws back tech edge;;Headquartered in a nondescript office building in a Moscow suburb, Luxoft, one of the largest software companies in Russia, looks like a university computer science department – right down to the marker boards. Workers are mainly young and dress in the ubiquitous student chic – accent on heavily distressed jeans and mammoth headphones.Luxoft designs algorithmic trading platforms for investment banks, and cloud computing and event management software. It designed the luggage tracking system for a leading airline and an internet service for a new generation of passenger cars.Russia’s economy consists mainly of exporting cheap raw materials but, in addition to producing oil, gas and metals, the country pumps out 70,000 information technology graduates per year.Dmitry Loschinin, Luxoft chief executive, is not short on ambition, and dreams of catching up with the biggest fish in the $70bn-a-year global software offshoring industry. With 15 per cent of the Russian software export market, thanks to revenues last year of $120m, Luxoft is not doing badly, but it lags behind where it wants to be, in the top tier of the global software market, competing with the likes of Indian giants such as Tata Consulting Services, Infosys and Wipro.It is a big task. Ian Marriot, an analyst at the Gartner research group, charitably estimates that the country has 1 per cent of the global total, compared with India’s two-thirds market share. “They [Luxoft] have good scale, they’ve done complex work for a number of blue chip corporations, and are holding their own with some of the leading second tier offshore companies from India,” he says.Mr Loschinin says his main ambition is to “get to the next level”. He does not exclude an acquisition or an initial public offering.Russia’s knowledge economy in general, and companies such as Luxoft in particular, have come to the attention of the Kremlin, which is increasingly concerned that Russia may become merely an exporter of resources and could fall disastrously behind in the global technology boom.For the country that produced the Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin’s first manned spaceflight, being at the cutting edge of the global knowledge economy has become a matter of prestige.This was the message Dmitry Medvedev, the president, delivered this month at a technology fair in Moscow. “For Russia, the main lesson [of the global economic crisis] which has still not been completely learnt is the exit from our resource dependence,” Mr Medvedev said.“Of course, the years which preceded the crisis created for us a relative economic prosperity. But our post-crisis economy has to be based on knowledge, on innovation and technology, and not on the resource possibilities of Russia, however unlimited they may be.”In fact the country has never been far from the forefront of the global tech economy, driven mainly by the quality of Soviet-era science and the calibre of its education system. It has an active space programme and a high-tech weapons industry.Russians often win the world programming competition held every year by the Association for Computer Machinery and sponsored by IBM. At this year’s world finals of the International Collegiate Contest, three of the four top spots went to Russian universities, with the St Petersburg Institute of Fine Mechanics and Optics successfully defending its 2008 championship win.But analysts say the edge Russia inherited from its Soviet days is being eroded by political and economic mismanagement. “Underfunding has led to an erosion in standards,” says Mr Marriot. “It is a potential concern for the future that only 10-20 per cent of the universities are hitting the Soviet-era [levels].”Part of the legacy of Russia’s abundant oil is the massive wage inflation of the past decade. Moscow and St Petersburg are among the most expensive cities in Europe, and programmers’ annual wages average $40,000 to $50,000 – which is two to three times what programmers in cheaper centres such as Vietnam earn. However, it is still less than half what programmers in Silicon Valley make. As a result, many of the top graduates work abroad, mainly in California.Luxoft is one of a few Russian companies that have tried to capitalise on the country’s intellectual potential in spite of the obstacles. The company was set up in 2000 and is still majority-owned by Russia’s IBS Group.Because 45 per cent of its customers are banks, the financial crisis has been hard on Luxoft. Revenue growth in 2008 was 25 per cent, and Mr Loschinin says it will be 15 per cent in 2009.Still, he remains bullish for the medium to long term. “Think about it – if you need something today but don’t want to risk hiring, you take it to a company like ours,” he says. Luxoft’s pipeline of orders is the biggest it has ever had, he says.With a staff of 3,000, Luxoft is not as big as its Indian competitors, but “we offer a better product”. And it manages to compete on cost by hiring programmers in cheaper centres in the former Soviet Union, such as Omsk, Siberia and Kiev, Ukraine where programmers make about $25,000-$30,000 per year. Luxoft is also setting up a division in Vietnam, the world’s cheapest offshoring centre.But Mr Loschinin stresses that its competitive advantage is quality over cost.“[We] can’t compete on cost,” says Mr Marriot. “India, Vietnam and several other places are cheaper. But if you’re going to Russia, you’re not going for the cheapest.”
432;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-10-27T16:34:31Z;Arm sees upturn in semiconductor market;;"Arm provided further evidence of a recovery in
the global semiconductor
market, after the chip designer’s third-quarter sales beat expectations.Warren East, chief executive, said: “The businesses that we deal with are moving beyond restocking, but it is cautious and after Christmas there may be a bit of taking stock.”Although its market capitalisation is just £1.9bn, Arm occupies a central role in the global technology industry. Its designs are licensed to semiconductor companies for incorporation into products such as smartphones, music players and washing machines.Mr East said Arm would “at least” meet rising market expectations for full-year dollar revenue projections. Analysts are expecting the group to achieve revenue of $476m (£291m) for the year, ahead of earlier predictions of about $450m but below Arm’s record of $546.2m in 2008.The semiconductor sector is starting to recover from a severe destocking at the start of the year, when cash-strapped consumers stopped spending on gadgets. Chipmakers such as Intel, Texas Instruments and Broadcom have all exceeded sales expectations.Arm is benefiting from growing shipments of smartphones – its designs are used in the Apple iPhone – and increasing market share in micro
controllers, which regulate battery power.A growing number of devices now use micro
controller chips and Arm has seen a 75 per cent sequential increase in shipments in this segment, albeit at a price. The larger number of lower-value microcontrollers in the mix has pushed average royalty rates down from 5.7 cents in the second quarter to 5.3 cents in the third quarter.Worldwide smartphone sales are expected to grow 29 per cent to reach 180m units this year, according to Gartner. The smartphone trend has boosted the number of Arm chips in each mobile phone, with a global average of 2.1 per handset, against two per phone in the second quarter.Revenue for the three months to September 30 fell 8 per cent to $123m but, in sterling terms, rose 5 per cent to £75.2m. Pre-tax profit fell 2 per cent to $24.3m.Arm was helped by sterling weakness against the dollar, as its US payroll accounts for about half of its costs. On a nine-month basis, revenue rose 7 per cent to £219.8m and pre-tax profits fell 5 per cent to £64.5m. In dollar terms, revenue fell 12 per cent to $349.4m. Arm shares, which have gained 87 per cent over the past year, rose 0.8p to close at 150p."
433;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-10-26T09:20:30Z;Location, location;;Hype about new technologies regularly outpaces companies’ ability to deliver. This is not only true on the internet, where trends such as “twittering” have yet to translate into sustainable businesses. It is also true of phones, where handset makers, software companies and mobile operators are all rushing to capitalise on interest in so-called location-based services.Boosters have been talking for years about the potential for mapping services that allow users of mobile devices to share information about their location. Yet early attempts to capitalise – such as showing ads on satnav devices – never gained much traction. But now such devices are going mainstream: global positioning technology comes standard with Apple’s latest iPhone. Gartner, the market researchers, estimate that 29 per cent of all new handsets will include built-in GPS this year.The opportunity, though, goes beyond mere maps on phones. Imagine a service in which shopkeepers paid to show their advertisements to nearby mobile phone users – much like advertisers already pay to reach web-surfers entering keywords into Google’s search engine. The potential is huge.Google, as usual, is gunning for the lead. Having indexed the world wide web, the internet search group hopes to do the same in the real world. Its Android mobile operating system, now available on phones in 22 countries, provides the way in. But Google faces competition, not least from Nokia, the world’s biggest mobile phone maker. In 2007 the Finnish group paid $8bn for Navteq, a maker of electronic maps. More recently, it bought Dopplr, a London-based start-up that allows travellers to share information about upcoming trips and hopes to develop the world’s foremost index of location data.

434;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-10-25T22:33:50Z;Google’s Android takes on Apple;;The Apple iPhone, which has been setting the bar in touch-screen smartphones, could soon be overtaken by an army of Google-powered handsets.Android-based phones – handsets that use the open source Google mobile operating system – are on the march as non-iPhone carriers look for a rival to Apple’s device.Since its introduction a year ago on one device with one carrier, Android has come a long way. It is used on 12 handsets with 32 carriers in 26 countries.They will be joined by HTC of Taiwan, Motorola and Samsung, which are rushing out models in the US before the end of the year as Sprint and Verizon Wireless join T-Mobile as Android supporters.Verizon has launched an anti-iPhone advertising campaign, satirising the Apple handset and its exclusive carrier, AT&T, teasing viewers with the promise of its first Android phones in November.“iDon’t have a real keyboard …run simultaneous apps …take 5-megapixel pictures …allow open development …have interchangeable batteries,” say the advertisements, ending with: “Everything iDon’t, Droid does.”According to Eric Schmidt this month, “Android adoption is literally about to explode”.The Google chief executive stepped down as an Apple director in August after Google’s phone and operating system ambitions became a competitive threat.Android appeals as a viable alternative for mobile handset makers looking to break the dominance of Nokia, Research in Motion and Apple, which have two-thirds of the US market and an 80 per cent global share.”If I’m a hardware manufacturer who needs to license a smartphone operating system, my choice is [open source] Linux, which doesn’t have much of a UI [user interface], Windows Mobile, which people don’t seem to like these days because the UI is kind of antiquated, or Android,” says Ken Dulaney, analyst with the Gartner research firm.Gartner, the research group, sees Android eating into Nokia’s leading market share and featuring on 18 per cent of smartphones by 2012, up from 1.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2009. That would put it ahead of RIM on 13.9 per cent and Apple on 13.6 per cent.Android will inevitably beat the iPhone, according to Ken Dulaney, a Gartner analyst, if only because it will feature on many more handset models. Apple has only the iPhone and does not license its operating system or technology.Android handset makers are improving on the iPhone’s hardware, while a new version of the operating system and more than 10,000 applications developed for it are providing them with competitive software.Smartphones account for only 14 per cent of the market today, but more than 500m are expected to be sold in 2012 when they are forecast to account for up to half the market for mobile phones.www.ft.com/techblog
435;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-10-23T19:09:54Z;Mobile chip mystery;;Just how big is the mobile phone market? Most analysts believe handset makers will ship about 1.1bn phones this year – down 7 per cent from last year, making this the industry’s first-ever fall in annual sales, but still about one new phone for every six people on earth. Others, eyeing booming sales at MediaTek, a Taiwanese chipmaker, think that number may underestimate the true size of the market by a substantial margin.Little-known outside Taiwan, MediaTek is on track to ship more than 300m mobile chips this year, double the number two years ago. Its sales have raised eyebrows at a time when the rest of the industry is struggling. Gartner, the market researchers, had only expected the group to move about 200m chips this year. Adjust for faulty chips and the use of multiple chips in one handset, and Credit Suisse thinks MediaTek’s numbers suggest the mobile phone market could be 17 per cent larger than previous estimates suggest.Interestingly, of the world’s top-five mobile phone makers, only Korea’s LG uses MediaTek kit. Most of its chips go to phones made by small manufacturers in China and sold in cities where leading phone makers have only a small presence. More chips are also thought to be finding their way to other emerging markets such as India and the Middle East. The boom in MediaTek’s business suggests this generic market has bucked the recession and is growing furiously.That would present a conundrum for handset makers. Finland’s Nokia would hardly relish increased competition in low-end phones as it attempts to rebuild its battered margins, for example. More broadly, handset makers counting on new growth in emerging markets face the unpleasant prospect of entering supposedly virgin territory only to find stronger competition than expected already there.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
436;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-10-22T10:42:46Z;The real benefits of outsourcing – value beyond the one-time cost saving;;"From IT maintenance to CRM and business process automation, outsourcing is firmly ingrained in company culture and is central to the smooth operation of the world’s biggest and most renowned businesses.The benefits are supposedly clear, with cost-reduction typically the number one goal. However, despite vast sums spent on outsourcing contracts each year – more than $42.2bn in 2008, according to Gartner – it appears many companies are failing to keep track of their outsourcing investments and are subsequently missing out on the major benefits of outsourcing.Cost saving, of course, is not the only desired outcome when entering into an outsourcing relationship. According to Gartner research, organisations still outsource for “efficiency, access to skills, focus on core business, innovation, modernisation and even business transformation”.Yet the demand for cost reduction remains high and research recently conducted by Cognizant, in partnership with Warwick Business School, finds that a proven return on investment is required in a very short time.Over half of more than 250 European chief information and chief finance officers surveyed are demanding ROI within the first 12 months of an outsourcing agreement being confirmed. The current economic situation has no doubt intensified this need, with outsourcing providers under increasing pressure to drive more value with their clients and deliver longer-term business benefits.Whether an outsourcing agreement has saved money over the short term isn’t too difficult to measure; in the simplest terms, it boils down to whether the new supplier can do the task more cheaply than it was done previously in-house or with an alternative outsourcing supplier.However, given that many of these relationships can stretch over a considerable length of time – the BBC recently extended one of its contracts for a further nine years – companies expect to profit from the additional benefits outlined above.It goes without saying, therefore, that every business has a solid methodology and auditing process in place to measure the benefits of their outsourcing investment. Or does it?Our research suggests that business leaders are failing to get to grips with measuring the full financial impact of the outsourcing contracts they commission. Perhaps the most alarming discovery is that fewer than half of CIOs and CFOs have even tried to quantify the financial contribution of outsourcing to their business.There is a widespread belief that the long-term value of outsourcing cannot actually be measured. More than a third (37 per cent) admit they do not try to measure the return, while a further 20 per cent do not even know whether they have tried.This is perhaps unsurprising when considered that only 29 per cent believe that the contribution can be properly assessed beyond the one-time cost saving.So what methods are being used to track and prove the value of these huge investments? The CIOs and CFOs surveyed provided several answers and in some cases, it seems the methods are vague at best.Some show a degree of methodology, even if they couldn’t quite articulate what it was. Others amount to little more than “back of an envelope” sums. Examples included “Manual calculation”; “You know what it costs but you don’t really know the value”; “The accountants will use some formula for calculating ROI”.Just 7 per cent of respondents were very confident that they know what they are spending in terms of time and money on their outsourcing arrangements.Companies undertake outsourcing initiatives for a wide range of disciplines. So while a one-size-fits-all method for measuring value may not make sense, it is imperative to have some method to indicate what has been gained and at what price.To measure outsourcing’s impact, businesses require a form of Return On Outsourcing methodology that includes benefits along three dimensions: innovation (the basis of future benefits, valued financially), process optimisation (quantified and valued over time) and total cost of ownership (reflected in IT budgets and IT accountability).Value along all three of these dimensions should be addressed as part of the planning process and tracked through the life of the initiative. This should enable both the client and the vendor to see the business value and cost advantages from the outsourcing investment, understand the operational conditions and best practices that lead to long-term success, and compare projected financial returns with other companies within an industry peer group and beyond.The evolution of an outsourcing project can and should, in many cases, begin with cutting operational costs through labour arbitrage. Over time it should gain operational flexibility, adding and subtracting third-party resources as needed, delivering additional cost savings.As financial performance improves, the cost savings can be reinvested in strategic initiatives that enable even greater operational efficiency and support future growth initiatives.This insight into outsourcing performance is crucial in determining future decisions. The research suggests that C-level executives are making such decisions on future business and outsourcing strategies without knowledge of the financial benefits: 78 per cent of those who cut back on outsourcing last year cited “unclear value for money”.Yet many do not actually have any clear evidence or means to quantify this.Senior executives, therefore, appear to be making outsourcing decisions based upon short-term cost-cutting – which remains crucial – without measuring outsourcing’s impact beyond the initial labour, skills and cost advantages.Key business benefits such as innovation and transformation are being ignored by many. Given that outsourcing should be delivering significant operational flexibility and business process improvements, its true value is clearly being missed by many organisations given the widespread lack of measurement practices.Without clear ways of measuring and monitoring their outsourcing arrangements, company executives could, in effect, be tying up costs that could be released to drive additional initiatives.The practice of outsourcing IT and business processes is mature, yet the research suggests that the way in which companies measure the positive impact of these arrangements needs to be addressed.More on the Cognizant and Warwick Business School research report on attitudes to outsourcing can be viewed at http://www.quantifyingoutsourcingbenefits.com/"
437;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-10-18T21:52:56Z;Cisco to overhaul routers;;Cisco is to overhaul one of its core products for the first time in five years in an attempt to show that it has not abandoned its heartland for flashier markets.The networking equipment maker will on Monday announce it is releasing three new models of routers aimed at small- and mid-sized businesses and branch offices, refreshing a line that brings in billions of dollars every year.Cisco has about 80 per cent of the market for these basic machines, which move data around small networks, making them the world’s most widely sold routers – it has marketed about 7m since 2004.The move should help Cisco to fend off its rivals with cheaper products, notably 3Com, which has been making inroads, particularly in China.Joe Skorupa, a Gartner analyst, said that 3Com “has a credible line of routers and it’s well respected outside of North America”.He added: “They’re moving a lot of iron around the world and Cisco doesn’t want to cede that business.”In addition to market pressure from below, Cisco has faced questions about its focus. The company was built on the back of routers and switches, but in recent years the hardware maker has expanded, mainly through acquisitions.Cisco last overhauled its entry-level routers in 2004 after it had come under attack from start-ups promising double the performance at the same price.“Cisco learnt the last time that waiting seven or eight years was too long,” said Shin Umeda, analyst at Dell’Oro Group.Cisco is, however, still giving its attention and dollars to other projects.In the past month, the company has offered $2.9bn for Starent Networks, which delivers equipment to big wireless network carriers who need it for managing the video glut, and $3bn for Tandberg , a Norwegian video conferencing group, to round out its portfolio of video, messaging and other collaboration tools.But the company says it has improved its ability to integrate the most popular of its acquired technologies with the basic networking tools it sells every day.Tony Bates, senior vice-president at Cisco, said: “The core strategy of the company has been to build great networking products, move into adjacent services, and add them back in.”Mr Bates, who was recently put in charge of equipment sold to big business customers, added: “We did it with voice, adding that to data to make unified communications, and now video is becoming very, very important.”The newest versions of what Cisco calls integrated service routers are three times faster, include multiple network processors and are optimised for video, reducing jitter and giving pictures priority over other types of traffic.The pricing on the three models runs from about $1,600 to $16,000.
438;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-10-14T22:51:30Z;Computer sales rise in third quarter;;Worldwide personal computer shipments increased in the third quarter from a year earlier and snapped a streak of declines going into the holiday season, market researchers said on Wednesday.Inexpensive netbooks or mini-notebooks performed especially well, surging from about 17 per cent of the worldwide total in the second quarter to somewhere between 20 and 30 per cent, said Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa. That means overall PC revenue continued to decline, Ms Kitagawa said.Gartner had been expecting a more than 5 per cent drop in units sold but instead saw a 0.5 per cent increase. A US increase of 3.9 per cent reversed three quarters of decline and joined an Asia resurgence that was already in progress.Rival research firm IDC turned in similar figures, tallying a 2.5 per cent increase in worldwide units shipped during the quarter, ending three quarters of fall-off.Netbooks cost a few hundred dollars, or even less with a subscription to a data plan. No. 1 PC vendor Hewlett-Packard and Acer have been especially aggressive in signing up telecommunications companies to distribute subsidised machines, said IDC analyst Jay Chou.Acer passed Dell for the No. 2. spot in worldwide volume during the quarter, IDC said, as Dell has balked at trading profitability for market share.Mr Chou said he expected netbooks to keep growing rapidly for the rest of this year, accounting for 30m units in 2010. The growth should then slow, he said, because “for the most part, it is something that cannot totally replace the full notebook experience yet.”The reports came a day after leading chip manufacturer Intel trumpeted better than expected quarterly sales. Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating system will hit the market next week, though mass corporate adoption might wait until the second half of 2010.
439;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-10-13T15:37:50Z;Mobile payments: phones as wallets gain critical mass;;"The idea of using a mobile phone to pay for goods and services is gaining a critical mass as people move to smarter handsets and use them in increasingly sophisticated ways.Extra momentum is supplied by companies from Microsoft to MasterCard who are piling in with mobile money initiatives.Several mobile financial services are already available – banking, app store transactions, topping up phone credits, and paying for parking among them – but the big prize is the retail market. Visa, for example, says that face-to-face transactions form 90 per cent of its business in Europe, making mobile point-of-sale services an obvious and potentially lucrative extension of its model.“The mobile phone will eventually replace plastic,” says Dan Salmons, director of payment innovations at Barclaycard, the UK-based payment business of Barclays Group. “By 2012 it will be normal to pay with the phone, and in five to 10 years, it is completely reasonable to think plastic will be relegated to a secondary function.”Cash could be replaced, too, by services aimed at using mobile devices for small purchases.Parts of the world are forging ahead or carrying out trials: in Japan, 30m mobile subscribers already use a payment system called Mobile FeliCa, based on Sony technology and developed by NTT DoCoMo. In Europe, O2 worked with Visa and Barclaycard on a trial in 2007 and 2008 in which 500 people used their phones instead of Oyster cards on transport systems and in place of credit cards in participating retailers.In Austria, Mobilkom operates the second-largest non-cash payment service in the country, after the Maestro card. And Orange has committed itself to rolling out widescale mobile payment services in several markets, including a pan-operator service in France and an exclusive deal with Barclaycard in the UK.All of these projects are for point-of-sale transactions and rely, at least in part, on near-field communications technology: a chip provides a radio signal that acts as a secure bridge between a phone and a payment terminal at a retailer. The handset is waved in front of a machine to make the system work.Typically, transactions should take no more than half a second, says Mary Carol Harris, head of mobile for Visa Europe.But some experts are wondering which way the market will go. NFC chips can also be embedded in traditional cards, and a recent survey from Gartner revealed that consumers ranked mobile payments as one of the least interesting functions that they would want on a phone. They preferred things such as location-based services.“It’s a niche that doesn’t really seem to interest consumers,” says Nick Jones, a vice president at Gartner Research.There is also technical and organisational complexity to be faced. Alastair Lukies, chief executive of mobile banking provider Monitise, says: “You need interoperability across the whole supply chain, but frankly the mobile chain is one of the most complex I’ve ever seen.”On top of a sizable investment in software, the NFC route also requires investment in chips in handsets and special readers at the point of sale. To date, only one large manufacturer, Nokia, has been rolling out NFC-enabled phones; others have scaled back plans.Meanwhile, companies such as Accells and Neomedia claim to offer “NFC-like” services, with Accells using radio technology present in most handsets and Neomedia taking a barcode-reading approach.“In the last 15 years there have been many new instruments and technologies developed for electronic payments, but just a handful of them have actually been deployed,” notes Jan Manten, chief executive of payments provider GlobalCollect.In some smaller markets, successful mobile money initiatives have been implemented already. Mobilkom has made €50m in mobile payment revenues so far in 2009, a growth of more than 30 per cent on the year before. Hannes Ametsreiter, group chief executive of Telekom Austria, says the services have been “very profitable”.The operator offers various payment options from the use of codes, through NFC in handsets where available, to a credit card launched with Visa, called the A1, which allows customers to earn points which can be redeemed against the purchase of new devices and other mobile items. When a transaction is made, users also automatically receive texts of the details to ensure the card number is not getting used without their knowledge.Operators in bigger markets admit they cannot manage m-payments schemes on their own. “Mobile operators are not banks,” says Mung Ki Woo, VP overseeing mobile payments at Orange.Instead, they are seeking gradual approaches into financial services. O2 Money, launched with Visa, is a pre-paid card service: cash is transferred on to the card, which is then used like a credit or debit card. Again, users receive texts detailing transactions.MasterCard, the credit card company, has been rolling out MoneySend, currently available in 19 markets, to enable mobile money transfers; and PayPal and Western Union are active in the mobile money transfer area.The numbers for mobile banking remain small, however: 25.6m people worldwide have used some form of mobile banking at least once, according to ABI Research.Similarly, NFC services are being held back by the retail side. A number of businesses have only just made investments in chip-and-pin terminals, and some analysts say that in the current climate another upgrade could prove to be a hard sell.Payment providers claim there is steady progress in this area, led by larger retailers that focus on heavy footfall in peak times, such as sandwich and coffee shops. “Key brands are rolling out contactless in their networks, and we are in advanced conversations with other well known brands,” says Mr Salmons of Barclaycard.One selling point has been the promise of more innovative reward and loyalty schemes for customers using the mobile channel rather than the highly encrypted financial network.At the same time, retailers are experimenting with alternative methods. In September Starbucks launched an iPhone application that lets customers purchase their lattes and muffins with the click of a button. Using technology from a start-up called Billing Revolution, credit card details are entered once and can then be used for all purchases, including those with other merchants: Billing Revolution claims that a partnership with Authorize.net has now plugged 200,000 retailers into its network."
440;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-10-13T15:20:53Z;Bringing order to a team;;"A question was posed in
a recent blog by Gartner analyst Tom Austin: “Have you ever sent out a Word document [by e-mail] to several people for their revisions, only to then struggle with multiple overlapping edits?”The answer, from most quarters, is likely to be a resounding “yes”.The tried-and-tested combination of Word documents and e-mail remains one of the primary ways people collaborate. But when amended copies are returned, problems begin.Microsoft Word can only compare two documents against each other. “If you want to add a third to the mix, you have to save the result of the first [comparison] and then compare that result to the third document – but only if you have accepted all the proposed changes in the first set of differences,” Mr Austin writes.But he has recently seen a product that could help: TextFlow, a co-authoring tool from Nordic River, a Swedish start-up business.The company describes it as a “parallel word processor” that enables teams working on a document to merge modified copies into the original document, generating a revised page displaying all contributors’ inputs. These suggestions can be accepted or rejected by the user and each suggestion is colour-coded to indicate which team member they came from.But Michael Sampson, a New Zealand-based collaboration consultant and author of two books on how technology can help teamwork, says TextFlow doesn’t allow several team members to work on a document simultaneously and see each other’s changes.For this real-time capability, he suggests, companies should look at Google Docs or at EtherPad from AppJet, an application development start-up established by former Google employees. Other online tools focused on real-time collaboration include Zoho and ThinkFree.But not every team needs to collaborate in real time. Many, especially those in highly regulated industries, need to retain more control over document creation, says David Wilcox, Microsoft solutions director at systems integration company, Dimension Data.These tend to prefer enterprise collaboration platforms, such as Microsoft’s Sharepoint or the IBM Lotus products. “Basic library services, such as document check-in, check-out and version control, help to deliver this element of control, as do workflow capabilities that guide documents in creation through pre-defined approval processes,” he says.Every morning at 6am, Mr Wilcox receives an e-mail from Dimension Data’s Sharepoint systems, containing an update of all recent activity on a range of documents relating to the company’s current sales pipeline, including market briefings, customer proposals and support contracts. “I can see what documents have been added to the repository, which have been amended and which are due to be revisited or approved,” he says.With the release of Microsoft Office 2010, Microsoft will be embedding richer document co-authoring capabilities directly into its office productivity suite, says Peter King, Office Server Group Manager at the company. Groups of workers will be able to create PowerPoint slides, spreadsheets and Word documents collaboratively, with a box on the screen listing who is currently editing the document.Once the reviewer saves their changes, colleagues can look at them and offer suggestions or approval.At IBM Lotus, meanwhile, the focus is on combining collaboration with social networking capabilities, says Jeff Schick, vice-president of social software. “The aim is to facilitate a shift away from word processing altogether to other styles of collaboration, such as wikis [shared web pages] and online meetings,” he explains.Other providers include Novell, which has re-branded its Sitescape acquisition as Novell Teaming; and Cisco, with the recent launch of WebEx Connect.According to Rob Koplowitz, a Forrester Research analyst, WebEx Connect focuses on providing basic workspace capabilities for sharing and collaborating on documents. “While the overall functionality is limited, the core value proposition of a document collaborative workspace is well executed and the user experience is simple and intuitive,” he comments.Enterprise wikis, from companies such as Socialtext, and enterprise content management (ECM) systems, such as those offered by IBM FileNet and EMC Documentum, also offer alternatives to the Word/e-mail combination.As Mr Sampson points out: “With Word and e-mail, you never know who has the most up-to-date version. Redistribution is a pain. And team members can’t see what other participants have said. Eliminating the chaos is essential.”"
441;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-10-06T08:59:40Z;Mostly clear with occasional cloud cover;;That about sums up the outlook for global chipmakers this year and the next, according to Gartner, which yesterday raised its industry revenue forecast for 2009. The US-based research company said at a conference in Taipei that worldwide semiconductor revenues would likely fall 17 per cent this year, less than their previous prediction of a 22.4 per cent drop.Bryan Lewis, vice president of research, said this was due to a “consumer spending spree” on PCs and mobile phones, driven by falling prices and the effects of stimulus packages by governments around the world.The consumer spending spree has translated into a $14bn increase in chipmakers’ revenues in the third quarter of this year compared to the second quarter. Even the weakest segment of the chip industry – D-ram memory chips – is now beginning to climb out of the massive hole it had dug for itself over the past few years.But dangers still abound for sustained growth in the future.While chipmakers had reacted quickly to the downturn, they have started building up inventory again in anticipation of strong Christmas sales. “There may still be a ‘double-dip’, just that the second dip will probably be much smaller [than the first],” says Mr Lewis.A broader worry is that, much like the situation for the wider economy, no one knows exactly how consumers will react when governments turn of the spending spigot. “If governments spend that kind of money . . .at some point you’ve got to stop because you’re creating a bubble,” says Mr Lewis.This would spell trouble for the tech industry, especially if consumers had by then become accustomed to the relatively low prices they are currently enjoying – the average price for notebooks fell 23 per cent in the past year. “It will be awfully difficult” to convince them to return to higher price points, says Mr Lewis, especially given the lack of a clear killer application.Chipmakers could only hope that corporate IT spending – driven by replacement with Windows 7-based PCs – will have returned by then.
442;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-10-01T13:49:46Z;Sharper focus on video conferencing;;Cisco’s $3bn bid for Tandberg has made everyone sit up and take notice of video conferencing. It is only little over a week since HP launched its new SkyRoom video conferencing product for desktop computers. HP’s Halo already competes with Cisco at the high end of the telepresence market, with elaborate camera and meeting room systems which come close to simulating real-life meetings. Now, with the Tandberg acquisition and SkyRoom, both companies are looking to serve all segments of the market from high end to mass market. Microsoft has also developed teleconferencing services similar to Cisco and HP.Video conferencing has suffered a poor reputation for years, after much hype and an often disappointing reality. Early video links were jerky and out of sync, worse than just using a standard, non-visual telephone link. But the technology has been improving and the market has been quietly growing. Video conferencing has been appearing in parts of bank trading floors, and on millions of personal computers in the form of Skype.In the current climate of cutbacks and consciousness about the carbon footprint, video and telepresence are once again looking like serious replacements for a least some business travel. Earlier this year, analysts at Gartner forecast that video telepresence could take $3.5bn a year from the airline industry by 2012, replacing 2.1m airline seats a year.Cisco sees the total addressable market for collaboration products as $34bn, of which video services will take an increasing share. Frost and Sullivan predicts that the telepresence market will grow from $2.5bn today to $4.7bn in 2012.The acquisition of Tandberg leaves one video vendor of scale in the market, Polycom, and speculation will now be rife over whether Microsoft or HP might make a play for this company.
443;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-09-28T17:54:19Z;Smartphones set to become mainstream;;When Apple launched its first iPhone in 2007, eager US consumers had to pay up to $599 for the privilege.Two years later even the cheapest iPhone, a 3G model with 8gb of memory, sells for $99 – which would only be considered cheap if you compare it with other smartphones such as Research In Motion’s popular BlackBerry.Smartphones have until now been positioned as a premium product within the handset market. And such has been the demand for BlackBerrys and iPhones that, even in the global economic downturn, smartphone sales remained one of the few bright spots within the handset market.But over the next few months an array of new models from a variety of phonemakers, including some new entrants, is due to hit the market.The new entrants aim to bridge the pricing gap between smartphones and standard feature phones and bring the more powerful product to the mass market.Mobile operators, who typically subsidise a part of the purchase price for phones, are another source of pricing pressure. Smartphones have helped boost mobile operators’ revenue by encouraging customers to use data and other value-added services.But that gain – and the value in subsidising expensive smartphones – is now limited by the fact that mobile customers increasingly demand flat-fee packages for internet access.According to Anshul Gupta, principal research analyst at Gartner, overall handset sales are expected to shrink by 4 per cent this year compared to last year, while smartphone sales are forecast to grow by more than 20 per cent.The proliferation of cheaper smartphones will further accelerate that growth rate to 43 per cent next year as smartphone sales rise to 250m units from 175m this year, he adds.New entrants are also trying to muscle in on a highly lucrative market.Both Acer and Dell, the world's second and third- biggest PC makers respectively, have announced plans to launch their own smartphones. Acer, in particular, looks set to undercut rivals to achieve its ambitions of becoming a top five smartphone vendor within five years. Its C1 model, for example, is expected to sell at a subsidised price of $40-$50.Analysts say the expansion of the smartphone market will turn a fast-growing but relatively small sector into a more significant contributor to global handset sales volumes. Meanwhile, existing smartphone makers have been able to lower their cost of production since Apple’s initial iPhone thanks to smaller and more sophisticated chips.Also lowering costs is the increasing adoption of Google’s Android platform, which is available as a free operating system for handset makers, says Mr Gupta.Dell’s first smartphone, for example, will run on the Android platform. Motorola this month likewise un-veiled its first Android-powered smartphone.Mr Gupta says: “No one knows how much Windows’ licensing fee is, but there is certainly a cost associated with that”.Analysts believe rapidly falling prices could hurt profitability at traditional phone makers. Smartphone makers now typically achieve 15 to 20 per cent operating profit margins, according to CK Cheng, an analyst at brokerage CLSA.He says only very few companies will be able to maintain that in the future, with others likely to see margins fall to about 10 per cent.As smartphone makers move into the mainstream, other phone makers are also moving upmarket.Korea’s Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, for example, have launched sophisticated phones with touch screens that are virtually indistinguishable from smartphones.Mr Cheng says: “The only difference is that you can download third party applications on smartphones”.Smartphones also face increasing competition for operator support from other internet-enabled devices, such as netbooks and e-readers, he adds.Handset makers say a bigger user base outweighs the cost of setting lower prices.Chang Ma, vice-president of marketing strategy at LG, says mid-priced smartphones will attract a more diverse user base, and “does not necessarily mean we have to sacrifice profits”.Additional reporting by Song Jung-a in Seoul
444;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
445;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-09-18T11:23:00Z;Preparing for a new CIO;;"Very few IT leaders know how to plan for the arrival of a new CIO, in spite of their rapid turnover – an average CIO stays in post for just four or five years.Helping the new CIO be successful is the IT leadership team’s responsibility – and most prepare for this role badly. They take a ”wait and see” view, which puts both the new CIO and the IT organisation at greater risk.Instead, team leaders should actively prepare a thoughtful and accurate briefing for the new CIO that describes the people, the organisation, its key commitments to the business and a plan of support for the first 90 days.This is an important role for the IT leadership team and is critical to ensuring that both the team and the new CIO get up to speed quickly and have a successful transition by preparing the following information.Staff profileThe incoming CIO will need to know basic workforce statistics of the IT team, such as current roles, locations, job histories, last performance reviews and tenure.They will also need insight into turnover levels and reasons, who the team leaders think are their top and bottom performers and succession planning data for key leadership roles.The IT leadership teamAs in the figure below, Gartner has identified 12 core IT management disciplines: leadership, strategy, service management, governance, enterprise architecture, security and risk, asset management, change management, sourcing, performance management, financial management and, at their core, organisation and people.The incoming CIO will need a summary of which ones are available in the IT leadership team and to what extent.‘Is something going to bite me in the first 30 days?’While the new CIO will eventually need detailed background information, they don’t need to review the portfolio as an initial introduction. Instead, for each of the major initiatives, they need to know the existing IT strategic plan and how it aligns with the business; the current status of project owners, stages of execution, client engagement levels and any key challenges; identifiable risks and a summary of the overall portfolio in terms of criticality and riskKey business relationshipsThere are three primary stakeholder groups that IT leaders and new CIOs need to contend with.First, IT delivery organisations and service consumers: this group is primarily concerned with day-to-day IT operational concerns. The new CIO wants to understand to whom and for what they are accountable.Second, senior business leadership: this group is concerned about whether the business is getting good value for its IT investments and whether IT is delivering the timely technological capabilities that are necessary for the business to meet its strategic objectives and goals.Finally, external stakeholders; this includes groups such as outsourced IT partners, outsourced business process partners and IT organisations with which they may be merging. Here, IT’s role is to ensure the seamless integration and operations of business processes – usually at the lowest possible cost and with the least bothersome organisational change implications.Present the budget, or ”Show me the money”The IT leadership team must ensure that up-to-date financial and other resource information is available.Budget information should include: breakdowns for the next four quarters and annual projections for the next three years, reports for the previous three years highlighting major trends, a summary of major historical and planned budget changes and analysis according to categories of run/grow/transform.Legal issues and auditsThe new CIO is personally accountable for facilities critical to the effective and lawful operation of the business such as compliance with relevant legal codes, effective financial controls and impending legal proceedings.They may use external resources to find out; this doesn’t necessarily imply distrust of the incumbent team, merely caution to safeguard their own position.Current and historical view of the organisationTeam leaders should assemble simple information about the IT organisation and how it came to its present size and shape, most of which will be readily available.This includes staff charts, descriptions of responsibility, objective performance goals for all staff, a summary of major changes or transformation over the past three to five years and the IT organisation’s strengths and weaknesses.Learn about the new CIOAs much as the new boss needs to know about the organisation, the IT leadership team needs to do some homework on the incoming CIO.The team should go online and read whatever has been published including press interviews, prior job announcements, case studies that might have been made public, and conferences or events where the CIO may have been a speaker.If possible, look the CIO up on social network sites, such as LinkedIn, Twitter or Plaxo. Much can be learned to enable the team to understand the new CIO’s mode of operation and personal style.About the teamWhile the new CIO is the one that has been hired, in many ways the IT leadership team is also being rehired, and it’s their job interview.The new CIO will have plenty of material regarding the team’s work performance: they will know exactly what mistakes have been made, and how the team is viewed by others inside the IT organisation and among business leaders.Team members must be prepared to answer questions, be able to explain what they have learned from mistakes, what they believe are their key skills and strengths, and how their efforts have delivered value or had a positive impact on both the business and the IT organisation.While new CIOs are excited by the new challenges they face, they also know that building credibility in the early stages of a new role is critical to future success. All members of the IT leadership team are key actors in the future success of the organisation, as well as the success of the new CIO.A new CIO’s success depends on first impressions and, in particular, the first 90 days.Meanwhile, the team owns substantial knowledge about the IT organisation, the business and the IT organisation’s key stakeholders.The role of an IT leader is to help guide the new CIO, accelerate the CIO’s learning curve and promote the key needs of the IT organisation. Waiting for the CIO to come to them is really not an option.The IT leader who doesn’t step up to this opportunity will impede both the success of the new CIO and his or her own role in the organisation."
446;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-09-15T23:41:23Z;Facebook boasts positive cash flow;;Facebook says it now has more than 300m users and that its cash flow is positive, two milestones that re-emphasise its position as one of the fastest-growing internet sites.Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, made the announcements in a blog post on Tuesday. “It’s a large number, but the way we think about this, is that we’re just getting started on our goal of connecting everyone.”Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner, said that while the 300m was a significant figure, he was focusing on the fact that the company has positive cash flow, which means that Facebook is making more money from advertising than it is spending on capital expenditures.“This is a more significant milestone than a raw increase in user population,” he said. “Facebook gains the ability to chart its own destiny. It allows the company to pursue, at least for the near future, Zuckerberg’s vision of becoming a long-lived, dominant player in the emerging era of the social web.”Facebook said in March that it expected to be cash-flow-positive some time in 2010. That the company achieved it about a year ahead of schedule suggests that the company’s ad products are growing in popularity.Facebook reached 200m users in March. To draw an additional 100m active users in just six months is a feat that has been achieved by only the largest and most successful companies in the history of the web.Nate Elliott, an analyst for Forrester Research covering social media and video advertising, said that while the information about free cashflow was good news, the 300m users is the figure he was focusing on. “It’s the user growth that puts them in a position to grow the business and make more money,” he said.Mr Elliot said that Facebook was approaching a scale that makes it very compelling to marketers.With the larger scale, advertisers also have the ability to run more successful targeted campaigns.Facebook is also innovating at a rapid pace. The company is expected to soon announce a voice-over-internet-protocol service that would allow members to talk with one another, putting Facebook into more direct competition with Google.
447;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-09-10T12:20:05Z;The case for the double driver seat: Business and IT;;"The pendulum between “business driving IT strategies” and “IT strategies driving business” has swung back and forth for 20 years. Now more than ever, IT should be in the driving seat – although companies cannot sacrifice one driver for the other. Both IT and business must co-operate to maximise success.Following the bursting of the dotcom bubble, Gartner predicted that companies around the world would loosen purse strings to invest in technology and make their business stronger and more innovative.One analyst said the “dotcom boom was the case of the tail wagging the dog, with technology driving business, but not any longer”. Gartner predicted that technology would be driven by business and Gartner was correct.But we are now exposed by business driving the strategy without taking IT along for the ride.To see the importance of IT’s role in defining a business strategy, you need look no further than the management of a car production line. If the correct equipment, deliveries and parts are not in place at the right time then you might be able to make cars, but it will take longer and cost more. As a one-off scenario this is acceptable, but unless there is a permanent solution, costs spiral out of control and the reputation of the company sinks.With the recent market fluxes, businesses require an agile solution; and that solution should result in IT becoming a more prominent part of the business strategy.With business-end applications under pressure from spiralling volumes of data and demand for more sophisticated analysis, it is the ability of the underlying technology that will dictate if they will succeed, and at what cost.There are two big hurdles hindering both technology and business developments within companies: siloed IT functions and budgets.Silos are a major problem as businesses have required an end-to-end IT solution to meet the business demand checklist. As organisations focused on the end-user tools without taking into account the need for the infrastructure to power it, these silos, and even silos within silos, were created.Silos are a primary cause of slow and outdated data and are too inefficient for business; they result in a direct, negative impact on the larger strategic technology developments. IT simply cannot cope with the business demands in a decentralised environment.However, if IT developed its own centralised strategy to progress the business, then improved, real-time analytics and better decision-making would become a reality.The other hurdle is the IT budget. To meet the requirements of business in the short term, the average budget is split 75/25 in favour of maintaining existing systems designed for either siloed specialist requirements or the business models of five or more years ago.It’s an as-required IT spend and isn’t the most intelligent way to drive a business. By using the IT budget to maintain rather than strategise, C-level executives misperceive it as expensive and an underperforming department.And because of the pressures on IT to meet performance requirements, newer technology developments and spending for the business’s strategy needs cannot be met.Rather than integrating intra-day risk reporting, more in-depth historical analysis for stress testing and product development, IT is merely trying to manage with legacy infrastructure that cannot cope with growing demands.By encouraging IT to help drive the business forward with new innovative solutions, maintenance costs will reduce, technology will provide increased profits and the department will no longer be an expense.For example, one of the biggest issues facing the industry is the upward trend of data volumes, granularity of data and faster response times for the increasingly sophisticated analytics performed.Both IT and business face significant challenges if they cannot identify a way forward. To handle the data explosion and protect themselves and their customers, companies require a newer approach than managing tomorrow’s risk with yesterday’s data.With IT and business working together, a technology-led solution which enables intra-day analysis with real-time position monitoring will help address the challenges by both sides of the business.The pendulum is still swinging between IT and business, but it needs to steady in the middle. As an increasing amount of institutional and private consumers become more aware of the risks involved in the financial markets, companies must provide customers with increased confidence.This confidence will come from greater collaboration between the business and IT allowing both to share the driver’s seat. The more both sides can do to understand each other’s requirements and obstacles, the better – and the quicker they’ll achieve positive results.Business must provide clear requirements and allow IT to research the options properly to ensure a forward looking solution can be implemented.The good news is that some companies are now starting to become aware of how important IT is to the business. Already we are seeing some organisations looking to achieve both efficiency and strategic advantages by taking a more holistic, global view of their infrastructure."
448;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-09-07T18:35:01Z;Abu Dhabi to take on Taiwan’s chipmakers;;"Semiconductor manufacturing, with its multibillion-dollar factories and recurring need to upgrade technology, has never been an industry for the light-pocketed.Abu Dhabi’s state-owned Advanced Technology Investment Company, the latest entrant in the $20bn contract chipmaking industry, is proving it has the capital to back its ambition of making Abu Dhabi a chip industry heavyweight through Monday’s $1.8bn deal to buy a majority stake in Singapore’s Chartered Semiconductor.The Chartered acquisition gives Atic a shot at breaking Taiwanese chipmakers’ dominance of the market.Chartered was the third-biggest contract chipmaker until Atic invested $1.4bn to help AMD spin off its manufacturing arm into a new company named Globalfoundries last October.Chartered and Globalfoundries combined would have a 30 per cent market share of the contract chipmaking industry, roughly the size of number two United Microelectronics Corp of Taiwan, this year, says Tan Kay-yang, principal research analyst at Gartner.While this is short of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s 50 per cent market share, Atic is expected to overtake UMC next year as Globalfoundries’ capacity increases, Mr Tan says.He says “TSMC is taking Globalfoundries very seriously. Abu Dhabi is committed and they have a deep pocket”.Buying Chartered gives Atic exposure to growth in Asia, which Globalfoundries lacked given it only had factories in Europe and the US, and “helps expand their customer network”, Mr Tan adds.Abu Dhabi’s big bet, however, comes as its Taiwan rivals are busy looking to diversify after the industry recorded declining profit margins over the past few years.Both TSMC and UMC have established new business development units to help move into sectors such as green energy.TSMC’s board has approved spending $50m on potential investments in solar energy after Morris Chang, its chairman who is credited for establishing the contract manufacturing model for semiconductors, said the era of rapid growth for the chip industry had ended in 2000 because of intense competition and rising costs of factory upgrades.Ibrahim Ajami, Atic chief executive, who said he “wouldn’t rule out further acquisitions” after absorbing Chartered into Globalfoundries, remained positive about the industry's prospects.He said om Monday: “It continues to be a scale game. TSMC has done very well, and we have a lot of respect for them. They continue to be the market leader, but we believe there is space for another major player”.In spite of a sharp drop in sales since the financial crisis, contract chipmakers are becoming an unlikely long-term beneficiary of the downturn, as many vertically integrated chipmakers become open to the idea of outsourcing their production and focusing on branding and chip design.Japan’s Fujitsu earlier this year outsourced production of its most advanced semiconductors to TSMC in what amounted to a gradual exit from chipmaking.Rival Toshiba said on Monday it was also considering outsourcing some of its chipmaking business, but declined to comment on a report in Japan’s Nikkei newspaper that it could choose Chartered Semiconductor or Globalfoundries.Gartner’s Mr Tan says because of this trend “there are opportunities in high-end manufacturing”.Douglas Grose, Globalfoundries’ chief executive, said in an earlier interview that he was keen to focus on a handful of potential clients that demand cutting-edge technology.Bhavtosh Vajpayee, head of technology research at CLSA, says this means Globalfoundries was unlikely to become a serious competitor to TSMC until its new factory in New York became operational in 2012.he wrote in a research note: “Chartered meanwhile shall fill in the generic mid end capacity”.However, analysts expect Atic’s acquisition to increase pressure for consolidation on other contract chipmakers, such as UMC or China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.The acquisition means “existing players in the second tier are left to play all by themselves,” Mr Tan says.UMC has already said it wants fully to acquire Chinese chipmaker He
Jian, in which it has a 15 per cent stake, but is barred from doing so by Taiwanese law.“Consolidation is afoot in the foundry industry,” Mr Vajpayee says."
449;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-09-03T21:49:19Z;Brussels’ Sun delay leaves Oracle in a quandry;;"How could an open source software project that we hear generates a modest 17m euros a year in Europe have held up a $7.4bn tech industry mega-merger ?Unlikely as it sounds, Brussels has put the Oracle/Sun deal on hold while it takes a longer look at the fate of tiny MySQL, which Gartner reckons has a database market share of around half a percentage point.Clearly, somewhere along the line Oracle has played its cards very badly.For whatever reason, it filed its official notification of the merger in Europe just as Brussels was closing down for the summer. Armed with clearance from the Department of Justice, it seems to have felt confident enough to press ahead to get the deal cleared and finalised before Labour Day. If so, that strategy has backfired.The question now: how substantive could Europe’s concerns over the database software market be?It’s true that MySQL’s current revenues understate its wider impact, given its business model (free download, pay for service). Also, they don’t help in understanding its potential to become a more important disruptive force in future.That might suggest that Oracle would have a strong incentive to kill it in its crib. But if so, why has Microsoft been agitating to prevent Oracle from getting its hands on MySQL? After all, you’d think Redmond would be only too happy to see Oracle put down a potential competitor.This exposes the wider issues at stake in the Sun deal. Microsoft’s interest is in doing all it can to delay or block Oracle from extending its influence over infrastructure software through the control of Java. If the fate of MySQL is the aspect of the deal that resonates most in Brussels, so be it (Java was the reason the DoJ gave for dragging its feet in giving its own approval of the deal, but as we reported last month, this wasn’t an issue that European rival SAP seemed too exercised about).In reality, it would be hard for Oracle to kill MySQL. It doesn’t control the IP, since the software is available under the GPL. Anyone else could clone it and continue their own version – as, indeed, founder Monty Widenius put it when the deal was announced:I don’t think that anyone can own an open source project; the projects are defined by the de-facto project leaders and the developers that are working on the project. If the company loses the trust of these people, they can go away and fork the project and turn it the way they want to.True, Oracle would own the MySQL name. Also, the momentum behind the project would be weakened if the core group of developers were to disband and, as Widenius put it, “spread like the wind”.But with some big Web companies, including Facebook, built on top of the software, it’s hard to believe that MySQL would just fade away.That said, Oracle now faces an invidious choice. It can press its case in the face of Europe’s publicly voiced doubts, but that might only serve to extend the second-phase review into early next year. Even if it eventually prevailed, it would have lost months, Sun’s business would only have been further weakened by the uncertainty.Or it can try to resolve things faster by proposing some sort of remedy to deal with Brussels’ concerns. There’s no assurance even then, though, that it would get a speedy resolution.Second-stage investigations from Brussels often end without the Commission filing a statement of objections. But this is certainly not the position Oracle wanted to be in right now."
450;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-09-03T18:42:54Z;Oracle’s Sun deal snagged in Brussels;;Oracle’s $7.4bn acquisition of Sun Microsystems hit an unexpected and potentially damaging obstacle in Brussels on Thursday as European antitrust officials opted to break with Washington in order to scrutinise the deal more closely.The more stringent stance in Brussels breaks with recent efforts by competition authorities on either side of the Atlantic to align their investigations, and is particularly notable since the deal has already been given the green light by a new US administration that has taken a tougher line on competition issues, particularly in the tech industry.The longer European review, which could extend into early next year, will greatly add to the uncertainty surrounding the struggling Sun and further undermine confidence among its customers, analysts warned.“It’s going to be very damaging to Sun and its whole market,” said Andy Butler, an analyst at Gartner, a tech research firm. “It’s slowly hemorraging their business viability. The only winners today are companies like Microsoft, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.”The controversy surrounding the regulatory delay was heightened on Thursday by the nature of the potential European concerns, which touch on an area of the technology world that only accounts for a very small fraction of Sun’s business.Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, said that Brussels wanted to look more closely at the impact on the database software business of Oracle, one of the leaders in that market, acquiring control of MySQL, an open source database product that was acquired by Sun last year.While it has found a market among large-scale web services companies such as Facebook, MySQL has made little headway in the mainstream corporate database market dominated by Oracle, IBM and Microsoft. According to one person familiar with its business, MySQL generated revenues of only €17m ($24m) in Europe last year, and its roughtly $70m of annual sales make it only the fourteenth-largest database software maker.Despite that, Brussels’ interest echoes claims from some Oracle rivals that the software maker would have little incentive to continue developing a product that could one day prove disruptive to its core business.“Companies are looking for cost-effective IT solutions and systems based on open-source software are increasingly emerging as viable alternatives to proprietary solutions,” said Ms Kroes. “The Commission has to ensure that such alternatives would continue to be available.”Since it is an open-source product, Sun has little control over MySQL, owning only the trademark and employing some of the developers who lead a wider group of volunteer programmers. If Oracle were to stop development, it would have no power to prevent others from taking the MySQL code and continuing the project, Mr Butler and other analysts said.
451;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-08-27T18:40:19Z;Microsoft keeps Sony at bay;;Microsoft acted to consolidate its lead over Sony in the current generation of games consoles as it cut the price of its top-end Xbox 360 on Thursday to counter a similar move last week by its Japanese rival.The cuts come at the start of the busy autumn season, which usually accounts for nearly two-thirds of annual console purchases, and should enable the US software company to maintain its advantage over Sony in what has been a weak year for the industry, analysts said.Microsoft has sold 30m Xbox 360s since 2005, while Sony has sold slightly less than 24m PlayStation 3 consoles, which were launched a year later. Both trail the Nintendo Wii, which has sold more than 50m globally.The latest cuts will reduce the price of the top-of-the-line Xbox 360 Elite by $100 in the US, €50 in Europe and £30 in the UK. That matches the price cut last week by Sony – which brought out a new, slim-lined version of the PS3 with a 120-gigabyte hard drive and which effectively matches the Xbox Elite.It also maintains Microsoft’s pricing advantage over Sony, with the Elite in Europe now priced at €249.99, against €299 for the new PS3 Slim, and €203 for the Wii.“This is all about maintaining the momentum. [Xbox] is the only one that has been selling relatively well over the summer,” said Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm.In the US the PS3 outsold the Xbox 360 in the first half of 2008 but has since fallen behind, with 30 per cent fewer sales than Microsoft in the first half of 2009. The Japanese company has been unable to repeat the advantage it enjoyed with the PS2, when it had access to far more compelling games than Microsoft, analysts said.With many third-party game developers no longer willing to make games exclusive to PlayStation, Sony has also suffered from a lack of hits by its in-house games division compared to Microsoft’s success with its Halo franchise, Mr Baker said.Microsoft is also credited with having developed a stronger online service for its console. All three console makers are also fighting to put the most compelling internet content on their consoles.Microsoft’s Xbox Live internet site, for example, will allow gamers to update their Facebook site or connect to Twitter, as from this autumn.
452;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-08-24T17:06:09Z;Nokia enters PC market with Booklet;;Nokia has launched its first computer in almost two decades, as the world’s largest phone maker aims to broaden its product range in a declining mobile market.Nokia pulled out of the PC market in 1991 after failing to compete with the likes of Dell, the computer maker. But the declining mobile market is adding pressure for Nokia to diversify.The company’s small laptop, or netbook, will have access to Nokia Music Store and allow syncing with Nokia phones. The “Booklet 3G” will come with Ovi Maps and assisted GPS pre-installed, allowing the laptop to identify its location.Selling additional services is a key plank of Nokia’s longer-term strategy. It hopes to have 300m service customers by 2012, from fewer than 60m today.Carolina Milanesi, research director at Gartner, the analyst group, said that bundled services would be a key way to differentiate Nokia in the nascent but already crowded netbook market.“There is so much hype around the netbook form factor,” she said, but that market “has not been proven in its longevity”.Nokia’s decision to launch a netbook came as Gartner said that worldwide mobile phone sales fell 6.1 per cent in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2008. Nokia’s market share fell from 39.5 per cent to 36.8 per cent, as Samsung and LG gained share.Nokia is the leader in the smartphone market, the most profitable segment that saw sales increase 27 per cent in the second quarter. But it faces stiff competition from RIM’s BlackBerry and the Apple iPhone.“We are in the business of connecting people, and the Nokia Booklet 3G is a natural evolution for us,” said Kai Oistamo, Nokia’s executive vice-president for devices.“A growing number of people want the computing power of a PC with the full benefits of mobility.”Lines between different classes of devices are increasingly becoming blurred.Just last week, Dell revealed its plans to enter the smartphone market, along with other computer makers, such as HP and Asustek. Asustek, which pioneered the netbook with its Eee PC, has demonstrated a laptop running Google’s mobile operating system, Android.The Booklet is likely to be sold by mobile operators bundled with a data tariff. Ms Milanesi estimates it could sell for €500-€800 ($716-$1,145), more expensive than most netbooks.The Booklet runs on the Intel Atom processor, commonly found in the small computers known as netbooks, and it uses Microsoft’s Windows operating system.It comes with 3G and WiFi connections for wireless internet and claims 12 hours of battery life.The decision to run Windows, rather than the Linux software it uses in its touch-screen tablets, suggests Nokia is targeting a mainstream market with the Booklet.A release date has not yet been set but the Booklet could be available before Christmas.
453;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-08-12T21:40:16Z;Smartphones;Apple continues to raise the technological bar;Now it gets interesting. Caught on the back foot by the introduction of Apple’s iPhone two years ago, Nokia recently launched its own – albeit inferior – touch-screen handset, the N97. Then on Wednesday the Finnish group announced a deal to install Microsoft’s Office Mobile software on its phones, with the aim of winning over business customers reluctant to forgo Research in Motion’s popular BlackBerry. Microsoft, meanwhile, gets potential access to Nokia’s millions of customers as it squares off against Google in the the market for mobile phone software.The battle is hotting up because this year the smartphone market is the only game in town. Also out on Wednesday were figures from market research company Gartner, showing shipments of phones that allow web surfing, e-mail and run other popular software applications rose 27 per cent in the second quarter – while overall handset sales remain on track for their first full-year decline. Even during the recession, consumers are abandoning dumb phones when, for just a little more money, they can get a pocket-sized computer instead.Competitors, eyeing Nokia’s 45 per cent smartphone market share – more than twice that of RIM, its biggest competitor – are piling in. Motorola, the sector’s longtime laggard, is preparing to launch new smartphones based on Google’s Android operating system. Even Dell, the struggling personal computer maker, is said to be working on some kind of mobile device. Apple, meanwhile, continues to raise the technological bar.Investors can draw two conclusions from all the hubbub. First, as the line between computer and phone continues to blur, software has emerged as the key point of differentiation for handset makers. Second, intensifying competition means the days of fat margins on smartphones – Bernstein puts Apple’s iPhone gross margin at more than 50 per cent – are numbered.Microsoft and Nokia on Wednesday announced an alliance aimed at challenging Research In Motion’s lead in the corporate mobile phone market.The Finnish mobile phonemaker is planning to use Microsoft’s Office Mobile suite of software on its smartphones – handsets that double up as mini computers.The partnership could help buttress Nokia’s lead in the smartphone market.

454;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-08-12T11:10:07Z;Microsoft and Nokia target corporate market;;Microsoft and Nokia on Wednesday announced an alliance aimed at challenging Research In Motion’s lead in the corporate mobile phone market.The Finnish mobile-phone maker is planning to use Microsoft’s Office Mobile suite of software on its smartphones – mobiles that double up as mini computers. Nokia’s E-series of phones, aimed at business users, will be the first to feature the software next year. Later it will be extended to the wider portfolio of handsets.The partnership would help buttress Nokia’s lead in the smartphone market. The world’s largest mobile-phone maker has been losing market share to rivals, led by RIM.“This is about creating a formidable challenge for RIM more than anyone else,” said Kai Öistämö, Nokia’s executive vice-president for devices.Nokia saw its share of the smartphone market decline to 45 per cent in the second quarter of 2009, from 47.4 per cent a year ago, according to figures released on Wednesday by Gartner, the research firm. In the same period, RIM’s smartphone market share rose from 17.3 to 18.7 per cent.RIM has carved out a strong position in supplying smartphones to business people, partly because the Canadian handset-maker’s BlackBerry devices have user-friendly e-mail. Microsoft’s Office Mobile, which offers e-mail, word processing, PowerPoint and spreadsheets that will synchronise easily with desktop PC systems, could boost the appeal of Nokia phones.Microsoft’s popularity with US consumers may also help Nokia in the North American market, where it is struggling.For Microsoft, the deal will be a way to extend its Office franchiseand ensure it remains relevant for consumers as the lines between computers and mobile phones increasingly blurs.Microsoft’s Office suite is under threat from Google, which offers productivity software for free on the internet. Google’s Android operating system for mobile phones is also gaining traction in the market.Microsoft has its own mobile phone operating system, Windows Mobile, but has failed to capture a leading position. Microsoft’s share of the mobile operating system market dropped to 9 per cent in the second quarter, from 12 per cent a year earlier.Putting Office on Nokia’s rival platform appeared an admission by Microsoft that Windows Mobile was struggling, said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner, the research firm.Stephen Elop, president of Microsoft’s business division, admitted it was a big strategic decision for them to move off Windows Mobile, but said: “From a Microsoft perspective, this is a significant strategic evolution. But let there be no doubt about it – Windows Mobile is an important strategic bet for Microsoft.”Despite the competition between Microsoft’s Windows Mobile and Nokia’s Symbian operating system, the two companies have a track record of collaboration. Last year Microsoft and Nokia announced a deal making it easier for the Finnish company’s smartphones to access e-mail running on Microsoft’s Exchange servers.This is also the second big computer-sector alliance Nokia has announced in the last few months. In June the Finnish company unveiled a research deal with Intel, the US computer chipmaker, aimed at developing product bridging the gap between computer and phone. Nokia have also hinted it would like to develop a netbook, or small, low-powered laptop computer.“It could be laying the groundwork for a deeper transformation of the business to something more computer-like,” said Ben Wood, analyst at CCS Insight, the technology consultancy.News of the deal came as a US federal court ruled that Microsoft would have to pay more than $290m in damages to Canadian software firm i4i for infringing a patent. The Toronto-based company claimed Microsoft Word and the Vista operating system violated one of its patents.
455;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Facebook rolls out real-time search;;Facebook has rolled out a vastly improved search engine that returns real- time results and the status updates of members who have chosen to make their information public, putting the site into more direct competition with Twitter.By positioning itself as a real-time search engine where anyone can search what Facebook users are saying, the social networking site could steal market share and potential advertising dollars from Twitter.The announcement came hours after Facebook announced it would acquire FriendFeed, a social aggregation service with features similar to Twitter, for a reported $50m in cash and stock.Twitter has proven its value largely through its search function. By searching for keywords such as ‘Iran’ or ‘election’ during the recent political unrest in Iran, anyone on the web could see what users around the world were saying about the subject.Yet with 250m active members, Facebook is the vastly larger site.Until now, however, Facebook’s search function had been pilloried as inadequate. Results did not include status updates, and finding even basic features like applications or the company pages was tedious. Last week, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer, told the Financial Times: “Our search is not always wonderful yet. We know we need to improve it.”Last year, Facebook attempted to buy Twitter for $500m, but had its offer rebuffed.Since then, it has made incremental changes that have emulated the service. “They would love to have bought Twitter, but that didn’t happen,” said Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner. “So they’ve been adding features to counter it.”The upgrade also aids Facebook’s ambition of making the site more public.“Facebook needs to be more of a public site to stay relevant when it comes to Google and Twitter,” said Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst with Forrester Research. “The more content that is available publicly, the better off Facebook is.”But as Facebook becomes more public, it will test its users’ appetite for exposure on the web. It has begun asking users to re-evaluate their privacy settings, and is encouraging them to make information publicly available. Privacy advocates have expressed concern that some users might not understand their information is being made public.Twitter this year played a crucial role in several public events, such as the Iranian elections, and has been widely adopted by businesses.But with the FriendFeed acquisition and its new search feature, Mr Valdes said Facebook had retaken the spotlight. “Twitter had the momentum for a little bit there,” he said. “But Facebook is taking that back and becoming a one-stop social site.”
456;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-08-02T21:05:28Z;Security experts find flaws in cloud computing;;Demonstrations of new ways to attack corporate data stored with the increasingly popular “cloud” services have added to concerns about the technology.Security researchers at the Black Hat USA security conference in Las Vegas showed how users of Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) services were tricked into using virtual machines that could have included “back doors” for snooping.Another demonstration criticised Amazon and Microsoft for relying on insecure methods for granting access to their sites after users claimed to have forgotten their passwords.The findings follow the embarrassing theft of Twitter corporate documents from Google’s cloud applications a week earlier. Although experts faulted Twitter’s policies in that case, they said the break-in might not have occurred if the micro-blogging platform had kept its files at its own headquarters.The developments help illustrate why off-site computing power, data storage and software have not matured to the level that the largest potential clients would require.John Pescatore, security analyst at Gartner, said: “The security of these cloud-based infrastructure services is like Windows in 1999. “It’s being widely used and nothing tremendously bad has happened yet. But it’s just in early stages of getting exposed to the internet, and you know bad things are coming.”Mr Pescatore predicted that at least until 2013, companies would spend more money on in-house virtualisation, in which software can run several times on the same machines, than on outsourcing their computing functions.By then, cloud computing companies would have not only to be more secure, but to prove that they are.The problem is that many companies offering to host, analyse and process information remotely have business models developed to deal with consumers, not businesses. Most such firms either cannot or will not make millions of users jump through hoops, for example when they have lost their passwords.Some free e-mail services or social networking sites just send passwords to an alternate electronic address, which could be hacked, or ask security questions which have the answers on the victims’ Facebook or MySpace pages. Birthdates can be gleaned from such places as Amazon wishlists.Amazon’s EC2 and Microsoft’s online version of Office have similarly lax password-recovery systems, researchers said. The two companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.● As smartphones proliferate, hackers too are investing more time into methods for breaking into them. Several new techniques were detailed at the Black Hat conference. One would have allowed outsiders to take control of Apple’s iPhone through a series of SMS messages containing binary code. The researcher who developed the attack method warned Apple weeks before the presentation, and on Friday Apple set its iTunes store to update phones automatically with a patch to stop that threat.The broader issue is that people trust communications to their phones more than e-mails to their computers – that trust is now being exploited to an increasing degree.
457;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-07-28T13:44:34Z;Office technology;;"Do more with less. It’s the mantra of the office manager in the downturn – and one that, in theory, should reassure makers of hardware and software designed to improve the way companies work. Investors certainly seem to believe so – technology stocks have outperformed the broader S&P 500 index since markets began to rally in March. Alas, Canon’s 28 per cent drop in second-quarter sales revealed on Tuesday – it makes most of its money from office copiers and printers – suggests the outlook for business technology remains bleak.This is also true for big IT projects, where benefits tend to accrue over three or five years. They continue to be postponed in favour of smaller deals that make the most of existing kit. While sales at Canon and Xerox have shown signs of bottoming out, few expect demand to improve much before next year. Even then, recovery may be modest. IT professionals surveyed recently by Gartner, the market research group, expect average software budgets to increase just 1.5 per cent next year, after sharp falls this year. Hardware budgets are expected to show a similar pattern.The technology sector’s struggles are ironic given its role in providing companies with a window to business performance. This downturn is the first in which business software from the likes of Oracle and SAP – expected to report a 10 per cent drop in sales on Wednesday – have given companies a real-time view of deteriorating business conditions. Companies’ ability to see what is coming at them – and to adjust headcount accordingly – may be one reason US non-farm business productivity rose 1.9 per cent in the first quarter, unlike in previous recessions. In the 1981 downturn, productivity fell 5 per cent as job cuts failed to keep pace with falling demand. Still, it is not all bad news. When conditions improve, real-time monitoring means technology sales should also bounce back faster.Canon eked out a Y15.6bn net profit in the quarter from April to June but said that recovery in the world economy is likely to be slow.“Taking into account such future concerns as climbing unemployment rates in developed countries, considerable time will likely be needed before the global economy realises a turnaround but conditions are likely to gradually ease off toward the end of the year,” the company said.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

458;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-07-21T17:37:44Z;Recession tests Taiwanese chipmakers;;Changes in the technology sector have typically been good news for Taiwan’s chipmakers.Since the government set up Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and United Microelectronics Company in the 1980s, Taiwan’s semiconductor industry has grown to become the world’s chip factory.Navin Shenoy, general manager for Intel in Asia Pacific, says this was largely achieved through “winning in transition”.Taiwan semiconductor groups and their computer makers “were very smart to get on board early” in the shift from desktop to notebook computing.They held on to their lead by continuing to invest even in troubled times, such as the Asia financial crisis in the late 1990s and the bursting of the tech bubble.But Taiwan has suffered its worst falls in exports and economic performance in the past half year, and the economic crisis is testing the island’s chipmakers’ resilience.Taiwan semiconductor vendors’ revenues fell 8.7 per cent last year to $14.89bn, a steeper drop than the global average of 5.4 per cent, according to Gartner.Among the worst hit were D-Ram memory chip groups, which had already been dealing with industry overcapacity.Taiwan’s D-Ram companies are desperately raising capital, while the government has established Taiwan Memory Company to reform the industry.Taiwan Memory, which has chosen Japan’s Elpida as partner, has said it hopes to develop more customised, higher-margin memory chips but has given few details on how it plans to do so.Taiwan said on Tuesday it would extend state funds to local makers of D-Ram chips provided they could demonstrate plans to develop technology with foreign groups and propose restructuring options, such as mergers or acquisitions that would benefit the wider industry.D-Ram chip makers seeking government funds have three months to submit their proposals.The government move follows requests by private sector companies such as Nanya Technology and Inotera Memories for state support.Beyond the memory chip industry, Taiwan’s top chipmakers are scrambling to adapt to industry changes in the hope of emerging stronger from the crisis.TSMC, which managed to remain profitable but suffered its biggest revenue drop in the first quarter of this year, is considering diversifying away from chips for the first time inits 22-year history.Rick Tsai, the former chief executive, was named head of a unit to explore options in the green energy and LED lighting sectors.TSMC, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, has appealed to clients to co-operate on research and development efforts.The company, which will make available some of its research and development to clients, hopes co-operation will help contain the escalating costs of designing and producing ever more complicated chips.TSMC was one of the first big chipmakers to restore investment plans that had been curtailed by the downturn, and is expanding its R&D team.Bhavtosh Vajpayee, analyst at CLSA, said TSMC would also probably benefit from increased outsourcing by integrated design manufacturers.Such companies, which include businesses such as STMicroelectronics and Intel, outsource less than 10 per cent of their production but are expected to do so increasingly given the rising cost and complexity of making advanced chips.Mr Vajpayee said in a recent note: “TSMC’s massive lead in technology and rising competitive leadership within the industry has helped it grab at least 56 per cent of the IDM [Integrated Device Manufacturing] outsourcing shift since 2001, and this is set to grow further”.TSMC has signed an outsourcing deal with Japan’s Fujitsu to produce future Fujitsu chips, allowing the Japanese company gradually to run down its domestic plants and quit parts of the semiconductor business where it cannot make money.Fujitsu’s semiconductor division lost Y71.9bn last year.That has left Toshiba to conduct a more straightforward restructuring, closing its least competitive production lines. Toshiba’s semiconductor arm, one of the world’s largest makers of ’flash’ memory used for storage in devices such as digital cameras, made a Y323bn operating loss last year.Other Taiwan companies have been quick to adapt to the crisis.MediaTek, Taiwan’s largest chip design company, is the biggest supplier of mobile phone chips to China and is helping to establish China’s phone industry as an exporter to emerging markets such as Russia, India and Africa.Additional reporting by Sunita Sue Leng in Taipei. This is the latest in a series on the challenges facing the semiconductor industry.
459;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-07-19T18:10:22Z;Makers of chips seek a wider audience;;The financial downturn has hit the semiconductor industry hard.Orders for microchips came to an almost complete standstill at the end of 2008 as computers and mobile phones languished unsold on shop shelves.Global semiconductor sales fell 2.8 per cent last year and are expected to fall a further 21.5 per cent to $195.6bn in 2009, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, last week reported a sales revival driven by consumers buying cheaper, smaller netbooks but revenues fell in Europe and there were weaker sales recorded with business customers.The semiconductor industry is used to severe cyclical swings. It has seen six significant cycles since the 1970s, caused by global recessions and oversupply.The last one – in 2001 when the dotcom bubble burst – was worse than the current downturn with sales falling 45 per cent.But this time around, strategic issues – including soaring development costs and the intensifying need to innovate – have combined with the effects of the downturn to unleash forces that are threatening to reshape the industry completely.Crucially, the computer industry – one of the driving forces of the semiconductor sector – has been slowing, forcing companies to look elsewhere for growth.PC shipments are expected to decline 6 per cent in 2009, according to analysts at Gartner, the research company.But even without the recession, markets were growing saturated. In developed countries, 80 per cent of computers sold are replacements.In the past, Moore’s Law (see Q&A box) – the idea that the chips double their performance power roughly every two years while cutting costs in half – has driven the semiconductor industry forward.Since the invention of the silicon chip in the late-1950s, faster, cheaper chips have spurred the creation of more sophisticated computers. But as consumers become more reluctant to upgrade, Moore’s Law has become a problem.“If you can get twice as many chips from the same amount of silicon every two years, you need to double the number of computers sold every two years, or find new markets,” said Richard Doherty, research director at Envisioneering, the technology assessment and research consultancy.Intel, which has dominated the market for computer chips, has been eyeing the mobile and netbook markets as potential areas for growth.It is easy to see the temptation. Netbooks were the fastest growing segment of the computer market last year and about 1bn mobile phones are sold each year, dwarfing the 250m computers sold in the same period.Chipmakers are also looking at embedding chips into a range of devices from fridges to blood pressure monitors and television sets that could benefit from being connected to the internet.However, a switch will not be easy as the market for mobile phone chips is highly competitive and requires far smaller, more power-efficient chips than those used in the computer industry.Development costs are also becoming a burden as chips become smaller and smaller.The tiny transistors that make up chips have shrunk from 130 nanometers in 2000 to 45nm, and even 32nm, today.At 45nm, 2,000 transistors can be packed into the width of a single human hair and the cost of developing a chip using these is $20m to $50m. With 32nm technology, the costs can leap to $75m.Three European chip companies recently merged their mobile phone operations into a single group – ST Ericsson – saying they needed scale to keep up with huge research and development costs.Shane Rau, analyst at IDC said: “The manufacture of chips has become very capital-intensive .“Only companies like Intel and Samsung are able to maintain their own fabrication facilities because they have scale.”Many chip companies have closed their manufacturing units and have their chips made by specialist foundries in Asia, such as TSMC, UMC and Chartered Semiconductor.Texas Instruments is gradually leaving manufacturing, especially at the high end, and AMD, Intel’s rival on computer chips, spun out its factories into a separate company last year.Many companies may also be forced to look at a new technology roadmap beyond Moore’s Law.Some may focus on different types of chips – such as radio receivers, power control or sensors – where shrinking sizes are not the key driver.ST Microelectronics, for example, has a small but thriving part of its business making accelerometers.Or they may need to experiment with new materials and work at nano-scale – manipulating chips at the atomic level – in order to continue. Only the very biggest companies will be able to afford the investment this requires.George Scalise, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said: “We are now facing the research dilemma. Will the semiconductor industry lead the transition to the era of nanotechnology – or will we go the way of the vacuum tube manufacturers?”None of the companies that made vacuum tubes for the first computers in the 1940s and 1950s survived the switch to silicon. It is a sobering thought for the sector.This is the first in a FT series on the challenges facing the semiconductor industry
460;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-07-19T18:10:22Z;Case study – MediaTek;;Taiwan’s MediaTek did not attract a lot of international attention when it became one of the biggest chip suppliers for optical disc drives in personal computers in 2002, nor when it achieved the same dominance in DVD players a year later.It took MediaTek’s recent success with supplying mobile phone chips to Chinese manufacturers to catapult it to prominence as the world’s fourth-largest “fabless” chip company – fabless chipmakers do not own their own production facilities but outsource the work.China’s burgeoning mobile phone industry has also made Taiwan’s biggest chip design company a rare winner in the economic downturn.While sales by Taiwanese chip vendors fell 8.7 per cent last year, MediaTek’s revenue grew by 17 per cent, according to Gartner, the research company.Sales in the first half of this year were up 25 per cent from a year ago.Yu Ming-to, chief financial officer, said there had been “almost no slowdown” felt from the global economic crisis.MediaTek’s strategy, in both DVD players and mobile phone chips, was to help hordes of new Chinese manufacturers easily enter the market by providing them with complete chip sets that came ready-made with a variety of functions.This led to the rise of low-cost Chinese manufacturers with little-known brands – so-called “whitebox” manufacturers. “This segment was not served before,” Mr Yu said. “In China and other emerging markets, you either bought a Nokia or a second- hand phone.”Still, breaking into the mobile phone market “was very difficult because people have never heard of MediaTek making mobile phone chips”. But word eventually spread “mainly because our clients were making money”.MediaTek is looking to expand by pulling off a similar feat with more complicated smartphones and will launch its first smartphone chip set later this year.The company is also looking to become a supplier to global brands such as Nokia.Tsai Ming-kai, MediaTek chairman, sums up his company’s ambitions as: “Whitebox today, mainstream tomorrow.”

462;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-07-13T19:49:51Z;DST in Facebook common stock deal;;Digital Sky Technologies, the Russian internet group that has invested $200m in Facebook, will purchase up to $100m in common stock from existing shareholders in the social network, according to a person close to the deal.The deal clarifies Facebook’s valuation, giving its common stock a value of about $6.5bn. This is higher than the rumoured valuations last autumn when a similar deal was considered, but lower than the value of Facebook’s preferred stock.“It reflects continued growth, their track record, the fact they are now num­ber one,” said Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner.In late May, DST purchased $200m in preferred stock from Facebook with a valuation of $10bn, reflecting the additional privileges granted with preferred shares.If fully subscribed, the $100m tender offer will amount to a 1.54 per cent equity stake in Facebook, bringing DST’s total ownership to 3.5 per cent.Details of the deal were confirmed by DST.“I’m pleased that the price DST is offering is much greater than the price originally considered last fall,” said Facebook’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.The tender offer was announced as part of DST’s initial investment in May and is seen as a way to retain employees in the time before Facebook makes its initial public offering, which could be in the next year or two.“Facebook wanted that as part of the deal, because they want to continue to motivate employees and not have them leave for other companies where there might be prospects for an exit,” said Mr Valdes. “It was a good move on Facebook’s part. It will have a positive effect.”Mr Valdes said there was a risk some employees might take this opportunity to cash out. “It’s a risk worth taking, because a lot of people are at start-ups not just for the money, but for a chance to change the world,” he said. “But even though they want to change the world, they also want to make money.”DST has joined a select group of stakeholders in Facebook but it is not one of the largest. A person close to the company said several early-stage investors held much larger stakes. In 2007, Microsoft made a $240m investment that valued Facebook’s preferred stock at $15bn.Facebook is in the middle of a growth spurt. The site has more than 225m active users and is pursuing ways to embed itself on other websites. Revenue at Facebook is expected to top $500m this year.“Overall this was important to both parties,” said Alexander Tamas, a partner in DST. “It’s a good way to acquire more shares.”
463;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-07-13T18:09:12Z;Microsoft in free software assault on Google;;Microsoft on Monday escalated its battle with arch rival Google, reacting to an assault on one of its core businesses with the announcement of a free online version of its widely used Office software, to be launched next year.While likely to take only a small bite out of Office revenues in the short term, the move represents one of the most radical steps yet by Microsoft as it tries to refocus its software business around the internet, according to analysts.Users of the free online Office will be able to create and edit documents, spreadsheets and Powerpoint presentations by using tools they are familiar with from the desktop software. Although only a “lightweight” version of the software, to make it more suitable for use in internet browsers, it would still provide a fuller service than online rivals such as Google Apps, said Stephen Elop, head of Microsoft’s business division.“Google represents a serious threat,” said Tom Austin, an analyst at Gartner, who compared the rivalry between the two companies to the browser wars that shaped the early internet. With the free version of its software, “Microsoft is responding as vigorously as it did against Netscape”, he added.Google already claims more than 15m users of its free suite of applications, although paying customers for the premium version number only hundreds of thousands. By contrast, Microsoft says about 500m people have Office on their PCs, though half of these use pirated copies.The free version of Office will do little to hurt Microsoft’s overall business. Microsoft makes most of its money selling to corporate users and only a relatively small number of home users are likely to abandon the PC version of Office in the short term, said Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, a research group.With virtually all of its sales coming from Office, the Microsoft business division made $12.4bn in operating profits last year, or 42 per cent of the total for the company. Mr Elop said Microsoft would experiment with placing advertising on the online applications before making them publicly available in the first half of next year.In an attempt to boost the attractions of its applications to corporate users, Google last week removed the “beta”, or trial, label from its applications after five years, and has made it easier for workers to sync information from Microsoft’s Outlook software with its service.
464;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-07-09T10:09:15Z;Google to launch PC operating system;;The final element in Google’s drive to reshape the computing landscape fell into place on Wednesday when it unveiled plans for a PC operating system that would compete directly with Microsoft’s Windows.But the fortress that Microsoft has built around Windows is likely to withstand this attack for some time to come, giving the software company room for manoeuvre as it tries to reshape its own technology around the internet, analysts said.Google said a number of low-priced laptops known as netbooks, based on its new operating system, would go on sale in the second half of next year.It predicted that the software would bring benefits to PC users from greatly cutting the time it takes for a machine to start up to reducing the complexity of managing personal computers.Coming in the wake of its Android operating system for smartphones and Chrome web browser for accessing the internet, Google’s planned operating system, to be called Chrome OS, will complete the range of software that the company produces for internet-connected devices.Google makes no money directly from open-source software like Chrome OS.The importance to the company of the software is that it serves as a platform that could eventually drive more users to its web services, feeding its dominant search advertising business. Users will not have to rely on Microsoft’s dominant Windows.The challenge to Microsoft is clear. Some 45 per cent of its $22.5bn of operating profits last year came from the Windows PC operating system, but the software’s significance to Microsoft extends much further.Its second big money-spinner, the Office suite of applications, is tied to Windows.As an open-source system based on freely available Linux software, Chrome OS takes aim at that.Given Windows’s deeply entrenched position in computing, however, most analysts said that Google would find it hard to unseat the software group. “This isn’t going to be something that is going to hurt Microsoft very quickly, it’s going to take some time before it really makes a dent,” said Mike Silver, an analyst at Gartner.More than 70 per cent of the software applications used by the typical company run on the Windows operating systems, he said, making it expensive and time-consuming for companies to consider changing to a new operating system.The Chrome OS might make a much bigger impact among consumers, though even individual PC users have shown a strong preference for software applications that run on Windows, analysts said.Microsoft has already proved adept at fending off a series of attacks on its Windows PC business, leaving it with a market share of around 97 per cent, according to Gartner.
465;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-07-08T19:40:16Z;Google / Microsoft;A trumpet call in a long battle for dominance;"Google and Apple display the corporate equivalent of dark glasses and celebrity insouciance, gaining reams of free publicity with their every move. Yet while Apple need only step on stage with a product ready for sale, Google gets attention for merely mentioning its intentions. Dominance of search, piles of cash and an army of engineers do make it too powerful to be ignored. But there is no clear reason why Microsoft should quake over Wednesday’s announcement that Google intends to launch a free, fully fledged operating system by next year.Google’s web browser Chrome, on which the new operating system will be based, has a mere 2 per cent market share. To make the slightest dent in Microsoft’s control of the PC world, manufacturers of the netbooks at which it will be aimed will have to be persuaded to pre-install the software. As with Google’s Android operating system for mobile phones, it takes time to win allies. Although several manufacturers are developing handsets based on the software, Taiwan’s HTC is the only significant assembler so far with Android-based phones on the market.Furthermore, the long-departed Netscape once hoped to run everything through a browser. And the much-touted shift to running computing through the internet is occurring only very slowly, with Microsoft furiously investing in the change as well. An opportunity exists in the new market for products that combine the best elements of a phone and a cheap laptop but the power of inertia should not be underestimated.Indeed, the business world, which bought three-fifths of all computers last year, according to Gartner, values stability – which is why many IT systems still run ancient versions of Microsoft Windows in spite of other Linux-based alternatives. Google continues to chip away at Microsoft’s business but this latest move is no more than a trumpet call in that long battle.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

466;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-07-08T18:41:38Z;Google’s OS explained;;Q. How will Google’s Chrome operating system differ from Microsoft’s Windows?A. Chrome OS will be a very small, light operating system, designed to not use too much computing power, and to enable people to get on to the internet quickly. This makes it ideal for running on netbooks, or small portable computers. Microsoft’s Windows 7, in contrast, has been criticised for being slow to start up.Chrome OS has also been designed to run on both the standard x86 chips that power most computers, and on Arm-based chips which are used in most mobile phones, as well as in devices such as set-top boxes. Windows only runs on x86 chips, although there is a separate version for mobiles.Q. How big a challenge will Chrome OS be?Chrome OS will not be launched for another year, so Microsoft has time to plan its response.Microsoft has more than 95 per cent of the market for operating systems, with Apple’s Mac operating system taking 2.7 per cent and Linux, the open source system, taking 1.9 per cent, according to Gartner, the research company.Linux has tried to challenge Windows for many years but has failed to take off with consumers. Windows comes pre-installed on most computers, users find the interface more familiar and easy to use, and Linux has struggled to make accessories such as digital cameras and printers fully compatible with its system. Google will need to overcome these hurdles if it is to succeed. It will be especially important to get computer manufacturers to pre-load the software on their machines.If Chrome OS succeeds, it will boost the use of Google products such as the Chrome web browser which Google launched last year, and Google Apps, its web-based business tools. Growing traction for these will challenge Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser and its Microsoft Word, Excel and other applications.Q. What is Linux and what is its connection with Google Chrome OS?A. Linux is a piece of operating system software written in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, the Finnish software engineer. It is open source software which can be used for free, and many software engineers around the world help develop and update the code. Many companies use Linux as a core software on which to build their own technologies. Google’s Chrome OS is built in this way using Linux as a base, as is Google’s Android operating system.Many governments have become keen to use Linux-based software as an alternative to Microsoft.Q. Where does Chrome fit in with Google’s Android operating system?A. Android is Google’s operating system for mobile phones, while Chrome is designed for everything from netbooks to full desktop computer systems.There may be some overlap in netbooks, as some computer manufacturers have experimented with using Android in this area.Google launched Android in November 2007 as a free software programme for mobile handset makers. It was aimed at stimulating the market and getting mobile device makers to create more innovative products in answer to Apple’s popular iPhone. So far it has been used in a handful of devices including HTC’s Magic. Google is trying to develop a market for mobile applications for Android phones, similar to the applications available for the iPhone.Q. Who else should be worried about Google Chrome?A. Apple will be watching this with interest. Devices such as the iPhone are based on Apple’s own integrated hardware and software. If other hardware manufacturers have access to low-cost or free operating systems from Google that work well, they could challenge Apple devices.
467;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-07-08T15:34:44Z;The environment: Businesses are making green moves – but why?;;Is green IT about saving the planet – or saving money? In a recent survey of 620 companies across Europe, the US and Asia-Pacific, more than a third said they expect to spend more than 15 per cent of their IT capital budgets this year on projects they consider to be green IT.But are their motivations less environmental and more economic, asks analyst Simon Mingay of Gartner, the IT market research company that conducted the survey.“The reality of most so-called green IT programmes during the past 18 months is that the business case has been based on cost savings or cost avoidance. The green benefits are usually incidental or, at best, a nice bonus that strengthens the business case,” he says.It is hard to find any organisation “going green for green’s sake”, says Mark Nutt, general manager at Morse, a systems integration company. “Whether or not green IT has become ‘real’ is debatable. I’ve not met many IT directors that are engaged in projects solely under the banner of green,” he says.However, he says it is clear the IT operations of many organisations are becoming greener as a result of cost-saving projects, since they share the common objective of curbing energy consumption.Take, for example, virtualisation projects, where the focus is on replacing multiple and often under-utilised servers with fewer, more energy-efficient, systems.Implemented well, the technology’s main selling point is reduced energy bills, says Fredrik Sjostedt, director of products for the Emea region at VMWare, a virtualisation specialist.“Most IT organisations are running at a server utilisation rate of about 10 per cent. I’ve seen large telcos that use less than 4 per cent of their available server capacity,” he says. “These organisations desperately need to cut their power consumption. They’re also running out of data centre space and facing constraints on the amount of electricity they are able to access from utility companies. These factors are more important to them than cutting carbon emissions,” he says.Even so, virtualisation comes at a price. While costs may be recouped quickly, the expense may be hard to justify when budgets are limited. The environmental impact of manufacturing, shipping and installing new servers also needs to be taken into account.In the UK, for example, the Greening Government ICT strategy is widely expected to tell public sector bodies to extend the lifecycle of existing IT assets, “where such extension will have environmental benefits across the product lifecycle”.Economic and operational drivers, along with such compliance concerns, are weightier factors than corporate social responsibility efforts, says Andrew Lawrence, an analyst with the 451 Group, an IT market research company. Over the next 10 to 20 years, he expects all four drivers – economic, operational, compliance and CSR – to become stronger.Worldwide progress on regulations, however, has been patchy, with most jurisdictions relying on the voluntary efforts of corporate IT departments, he says.That is set to change in the UK in 2010, when a compulsory carbon reduction commitment (CRC) comes into force. At that time, any UK-based company using more than 6,000 megawatts per hour each year across their business will have to demonstrate regular improvements in energy consumption and trade carbon permits if they cannot meet targets for reduction.“Data centre managers have been pretty slow to realise the importance of CRC, but by my reckoning, it will apply to most companies operating large data centres and quite a few with medium-sized ones too,” says Mr Lawrence.It is a growing concern for commercial data centre operators such as hosting company Lumison. “We’re unhappy about the CRC,” says Aydin Kurt-Elli, chief executive. “It’s not a bad thing per se, but it looks like the associated bureaucracy will be substantial – so we will have to pay a fee to prove what we are already doing in terms of our investment in green and low-carbon technologies. Ironically, that looks set to leave us with less cash to invest in those very initiatives,” he says.Regardless of compliance, organisations should be moving to a more sophisticated definition of what green IT entails, one that acknowledges the role IT can play in curbing emissions across the business, says Peter Graf, chief sustainability officer of enterprise software giant SAP.The IT department, he claims, accounts for about 2 per cent of carbon emissions at most companies, but technology can do much to tackle “the other 98 per cent”. That was the impetus behind SAP’s May 2009 acquisition of Clear Standards, a provider of software tools that enable companies to measure and manage carbon emissions, water consumption and energy use.“We miss the point if we continue to view green IT as something separate from the ‘greener business’,” agrees Keith White at management consultancy firm PA Consulting. “The nature of the debate has in itself created a distraction.”Technology vendors have increasingly used green capabilities to market and promote their latest offerings and the majority of surveys on green IT have focused on the data centre as a major user of energy, he adds. “While this has perhaps been beneficial in making organisations aware of the role of technology in supporting green objectives, it has distracted attention from the contribution that a green IT strategy can make to the business and its overall environmental performance.”It seems inevitable that other technology suppliers will seize on the marketing opportunities that a wider view of green IT provides.But companies can also do more simple things: such as simply turning up data centre thermostats, says 451 Group’s Mr Lawrence. “For years, organisations such as Ashrae [the American Association of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers] in the US have been ridiculously conservative in their advice to data centre managers on how cool a data centre needs to be, to run effectively,” he says.In December 2008, Ashrae revised its suggested temperature range from between 68 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit to between 64 and 80 degrees. “For every degree data centre managers turn the thermostat up, they could be saving thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars in energy bills each year,” says Mr Lawrence.What is equally clear is that, as a marketing strategy, green IT will not fade away – nor should it, says Mr Mingay of Gartner.The mid to long-term prognosis for climate change is one that no organisation can afford to ignore.Climate change, he says, makes green IT a strategic priority for enterprises, not “an easily discarded fashion”.
468;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-07-08T15:34:44Z;Changing places: Change at SAP;;Tim Noble has been hired as managing director of SAP UK and Ireland. Mr Noble joins after 15 years at Gartner Group, where he was senior vice-president of global sales.He succeeds Steve Rogers, who takes over as head of business for user and solution sales, reporting to Jose Duarte, president of the Emea region. Mr Noble will lead a team of 1,100 people.The company has also promoted Frederic Arrouays to chief financial officer. He joined SAP in 2000.● Satyam Computer Services (SCS), the Indian outsourcing company, has rebranded as “Mahindra Satyam” in an attempt to put behind it an accountancy scandal this year. In January, the company’s then chairman Ramalinga Raju resigned after admitting severely inflating revenues.As part of the change, CP Gurnani has been named chief executive, while Durga Shankar has been made chief financial officer.● Palm, the mobile handset company, has appointed Jon Rubinstein chairman and chief executive, as Ed Colligan steps down after 16 years leading the company. Mr Rubinstein joined Palm as executive chairman in 2007 to “bring back” innovation to the company.● Colt, a European telecoms company has appointed Tanuja Randery head of global business. She was previously managing director for Colt in Europe’s Benelux countries.● Mamut, a small-business software company, has appointed Bryan Richter to be country manager in the UK. “Ninety-nine per cent of businesses here are SMEs, but most of the IT solutions available are designed for large-scale businesses,” he says.He has 26 years experience in the IT industry, having been vice-president of sales in northern Europe for Chordiant Software. He has also worked at Trillium Software and Stellent.

470;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-07-06T12:12:35Z;The Open Cloud route to joined up government;;"Several governments have mandated that all their departmental technology deployments be based either partially or wholly on open source software (OSS).This spring, Russia announced it was hoping to see all of its government offices running on open source; Germany has long been a proponent of Linux, with more than 500 government departments running open source software. Indeed, the national government even created an official migration guide for departments looking to move from proprietary systems to Linux or other OSS.Nations such as Venezuela have also opted to run government IT systems on OSS, and China and other Asia-Pacific countries have set similar goals.The move towards OSS in government is so prominent, that industry research firm Gartner predicts that by 2011 at least 25 per cent of domain-specific software in government offices around the world will be at least partially open source.The move towards open source is coupled with another new concept – cloud computing. Some large governments are assessing cloud computing – which essentially means that instead of government agencies managing hundreds of large data centres and application infrastructures, more centralised data centres that serve dozens or hundreds of departments over the internet will be employed.This is called a “private cloud”: the department needs nothing but a web browser to connect and access data in the central data and systems repository.The US government has even named Vivek Kundra its new federal CIO to oversee this transformation, among other IT decisions.With governments trying out these concepts, the end result could be an “Open Cloud” environment that government agencies can tap into to provide various benefits. Among these benefits are reduced operating costs and lower risk, greater access to data, and an enhanced interoperability that can span not only government departments, but whole governments.Reduced costs in the open cloudA lot of the early proponents of open source waved the “free” flag too vehemently. There is a huge divide between “free” software and open source. If any organisation is seeking a fully operational and fully supported technology for their agencies, there is a cost.Instead, it is much more productive to focus on how the combination of open source and cloud computing can reduce costs across departments.If an over-arching government can create a cloud-based operations environment – leveraging open source components – it can then push technology tools and features to both its own departments and its citizens over the web. This introduces a number of cost savings.For one, a central, cloud-modeled data centre means that fewer actual hard resources are being used (servers, firewalls, security, databases etc). Through virtualisation and the web as a delivery platform, many offices and departments (and millions of citizens) can be served from only a handful of locations. In traditional models, each department would have its own discrete IT infrastructure, wasting resources and creating needlessly complex IT environments.I see that open source components of cloud environments are much less expensive to maintain than proprietary systems. And cloud environments require much less in terms of personnel costs, since there are far fewer stacks of technology for administrators to monitor.Greater access to dataAn important factor in the Open Cloud debate is the greater access to data this type of environment can provide. Under older government IT models, departments lives in a silo: data cannot easily be accessed by other departments or citizens. Government forms and processes that span multiple departments or databases must be managed manually – again taking time and added costs to complete.But in a government IT model where the cloud plugs many departments into a centralised data centre, a lot of these issues become moot. Citizens could use a web portal, for example, and access information from multiple departments without needed multiple login names or passwords to remember.Government employees could share records and forms across departments, without unnecessary bureaucratic issues popping up and wasting employees’ time.A lot of caveats abound here, mainly surrounding the security risks associated with pushing data into the cloud. However, since the governments themselves would be managing the data access and not relying on third parties as in public cloud environments such as software-as-a-service (SaaS) models, the security risk is not necessarily increased.Moving towards global interoperabilityOne of the interesting promises of the Open Cloud as it applies to government agencies is the idea of greater interoperability. If the Open Cloud can enable citizens and government employees to access data across departments from a single user interface, then the Open Cloud can promote communication across whole government cloud-based systems.While we have seen agencies try to centralise data in a theoretical fashion (such as Interpol and other anti-terror initiatives), very little has been done to create true interoperability across governments.Again, politics can stymie a lot of these types of endeavours. But there are basic issues such as safety and security, natural disaster and disease early warning systems, etc that could benefit all regardless of political leanings.In addition, in a global economy that is now more than ever partially controlled by government agencies, both from a regulatory and nationalised stance, more than just data systems need to talk to each other.Government lending and debt management can be managed across systems through the Open Cloud, making the complex system of monetary flow between governments a little easier to audit and manage. A secure, cloud-based system powered by the web can make this happen.However, the components must be open source to insure that these systems can talk to each other, and that the integrations between government systems can be supported at every integration point – ensuring data flow and system access.Still a way to goWhile many nations are opening up when it comes to their technology stacks, many countries lag behind. The UK is among them.Again, security concerns top the list in many surveys asking why government organisations have been wary of cloud initiatives. But as the concept of the private cloud emerges, coupled with the continuing proliferation of fast, inexpensive and open software offerings – the promise of the Open Cloud powering an integrated, open framework inside and in between government IT systems is a vision for the near future."
471;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-06-29T20:07:28Z;Facebook hires ex-Genentech executive as finance chief;;Facebook bolstered its management ranks on Monday by announcing the selection of a new chief financial officer, a move that could take the fast-growing social networking company one step closer to a public offering.David Ebersman held the same role at Genentech, the US biotech group, and will start at Facebook in September.Mr Ebersman served as Genentech’s chief financial officer for the past three years, and spent a total of 15 years with the company. In March, he oversaw the sale of the final 44 per cent of Genentech to Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company which had been pursuing a complete takeover, for $47bn. Mr Ebersman has not, however, overseen an IPO.“We quickly recognized that David was the right person for Facebook,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. “He was Genentech’s CFO while revenue tripled, and his success in scaling the finance organisation of a fast growing company will be important to Facebook.”Facebook has been without a fulltime CFO since April, when Gideon Yu abruptly left. Mr Yu had preovious held the same position at YouTube, and oversaw its sale to Google. At the time of his departure, Facebook said it would “be looking for someone with public company experience”, hinting at a potential initial public offering.“This gets them out of this limbo that they were in since the previous CFO left,” said Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner. “The departure of Yu was a surprise and it raised some questions. Yu had a pretty serious track record with YouTube and Yahoo. People wondered, how much better can it get for a company run by 20-year-olds?”But Mr Valdes believes Facebook has chosen well. “They now have an industrial strength CFO,” he said. “His skills and experience will be put to good use.”The market for initial public offerings by fast growing technology companies has returned in recent months. Solar Winds, a Texas-based software company, raised $151m in its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in May. Also in May, OpenTable, a website that lets diners reserve restaurant tables, offered shares at $20 apiece, only to see them more than double in the first day of trading.Last week, Mr Zuckerberg told the Financial Times that Facebook was not currently considering an IPO. “It’s not something we’re thinking about right now,” he said. “It’s not the goal. We’ll do it when we think it makes sense.”
472;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-06-25T21:57:34Z;Microsoft reveals discounts for Windows 7;;Microsoft on Thursday unveiled bigger-than-expected discounts for some buyers of its forthcoming Windows 7 operating system, as it sought to stoke up demand for new PCs and put the poor reputation of Windows Vista behind it.In a few countries, including the US, UK and Japan, the group announced an aggressive limited-period offer, with the US price for the software’s most common consumer version set at $49.99, a 75 per cent discount to the list price. “Getting [Windows 7] out fast into people’s hands is important for them to shed the bad perceptions of Windows Vista,” said Michael Silver, an analyst at Gartner.Launched at the beginning of 2007 after long delays, Vista attracted much criticism early on for its failure to work with some other commonly used software, denting the reputation of one of the world’s best-known brands.Other analysts said the more aggressive pricing increased the prospects of a recovery in PC sales later this year. The move will come as welcome news to computer makers, raising the likelihood of increased sales during the important Christmas season, said Sarah Friar, software analyst at Goldman Sachs.The pricing details emerged on Thursday as Microsoft put the final pieces in place for the October launch of Windows 7.In Europe, some PC users will end up paying more to upgrade to the next version of Windows as a direct result of the fight the software company has had with European regulators over internet browsers.Microsoft is to ship Windows 7 there stripped of its Internet Explorer browser, a move that it announced last month in response to the European Commission’s attack on its practice of “bundling” the software together.As a result, it said that users of Windows Vista in Europe would need a fuller version of the new software when they upgrade, pushing the list price of the Home Premium version up to €199.99 ($280) rather than the standard €119.99 upgrade price.To lessen the blow, Microsoft said it would sell the software at the lower price until “at least” the end of this year, though it gave no assurances about extending the offer. One by-product of the concession is that people who don’t already own Vista, and who would otherwise have had to pay nearly €200, will get the benefit of a lower price if they buy the new software this year.
473;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-06-23T19:25:05Z;India to ban replica handsets from China;;India is moving to block millions of cheap copy-cat Chinese mobile phones and accessories from flooding the market that the handset industry describes as “time bombs” for their often dangerously poor quality.“You have many of these phones behaving like little bombs – just exploding because the battery is bad,” said Pankaj Mohindroo, national president of the Indian Cellular Association, the lobby group representing Nokia and other large handset makers in the country.The ICA estimates that of the 4m-5m handsets imported each month from China up to one third, or 1m-1.5m, are cheap replicas produced by small shops in southern China.Many of these include poor quality accessories and components, such as fake batteries, that can blow up on users.The ICA says that many of the phones also do not have an “international mobile equipment identity” number, an in-built code allowing handsets to be traced to prevent their use by terrorists or other illegal groups.The Indian government last week moved to ban Chinese phones that do not carry the number. Analysts said that besides security concerns, pressure from the big handset brands such as Nokia was also a driver behind the ban.According to analyst estimates, 40 per cent of Chinese replica or “whitebox handset” shipments are exported, and India has become their biggest overseas market.The issue comes as India’s emergence as one of the biggest and fastest growing mobile markets – with about 10m subscribers being added every month – has fuelled its ambition of becoming a global base for the manufacture of handsets.Gartner, the research company, estimates India will have more than 771m mobile connections by 2013 from an estimated 452m this year, implying annual compound growth of 14.3 per cent.The ICA is seeking to increase the country’s handset manufacturing capacity from more than 104.5m in 2008, which was up 25 per cent over a year earlier, to about 250m by 2012, which would make India the world’s second largest manufacturer of the units after China.Nokia has set up its largest manufacturing facility in the world by employee numbers in Chennai, southern India, with 8,000 people.Mobile handset sales in India in the fiscal year ending March were worth Rs259bn ($5.3bn), up 7.9 per cent, of which Nokia accounted for about two-thirds of market share.
474;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-06-18T17:42:07Z;TSMC revives investment plans;;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, has become one of the first big technology companies to bet on a recovery by restoring investment planscurtailed only months ago.Morris Chang, TSMC’s founder, who returned as chief executive a week ago, said on Friday the company planned to boost its manufacturing capacity and technological prowess.He likened the economic downturn to a Greek tragedy, with the first act being the financial crisis and the second being the global economic slowdown. “In the end, there must be a third act: recovery,” Mr Chang said. “For our industry, I feel the worst is over. The path to recovery is long and may have some twists and turns …but the trend is upwards.”TSMC saw its biggest ever fall in revenue in the first quarter of this year, but is expecting sales to recover in the second quarter on the back of customers replenishing stocks and on strong Chinese demand for electronics.Speaking at a conference, Mr Chang said TSMC now planned about $1.9bn in capital expenditure this year, around the same amount as last year. The company said during an investor conference in April that it would cut capital expenditure by about 20 per cent this year to $1.5bn.TSMC also aims to increase research and development spending by 20 per cent this year, mainly through expanding its 1,200-strong R&D team by 30 per cent and adding a further 90 people to its design technology team. Friday’s comments came after last month TSMC said it would rehire hundreds of staff it fired during the economic crisis, following angry protests by workers.Capital spending across the semiconductor industry is expected to fall nearly 45 per cent this year to $24.3bn, according to Gartner, the research company. It said in a report this week, however, that equipment spending by chip companies had bottomed out in the second quarter and predicted that capital investment next year would reach $29.4bn, 21 per cent more than this year.“The impact of the economic crisis has hit the semiconductor equipment industry hard, but signs of life are returning,” said Klaus Rinnen, managing vice-president at Gartner.TSMC is struggling with shrinking industry profit margins, which it said had averaged 21 per cent in 2004 but fell to 15 per cent last year. The company has established a new unit to diversify away from chips by investing in “green” energy and LED industries.
475;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-06-17T15:18:37Z;Does business understand technology any more?;;"I don’t read many books, but one I did get through last year was about how a manufacturer was transforming itself into a provider of expertise and services.The book* used a fictional company that made power generators to illustrate how high-speed connectivity and collaboration enabled it to overcome a challenge from low-cost rival manufacturers by creating a network, or mesh, of its entire “eco-system” – suppliers, customers, experts, critics and others.The authors’ conclusions were far-reaching, claiming businesses would shift from the vertical model of “make, sell and maintain” to a horizontal business model based, in this case, on advising clients about reducing energy costs, maintaining reliable supplies, and more.But I was sceptical. The theory might hold for a fictional company – but in the real world?Then, at the turn of the year, I asked a relative how his engineering business was faring. Things were tough, he said, but one sideline was doing well.His description of how he had created interactive websites in order to engage with customers and use their experiences, along with the wider knowledge of the market and his own expertise, could have come straight from the pages of the book.He was not concerned with making these particular machines – they were made by someone else – but instead, he was servicing them, making them more efficient, building accessories, advising on best practice, helping customers choose the right machinery and generally adding value to the process.With fiction seemingly confirmed as fact, I next spoke to Steve Prentice of Gartner, an IT consultancy, in search of the bigger picture. In his view, the picture is big indeed – and very worrying: he believes most businesses no longer understand IT at all.“Company boards don’t recognise what IT is or does any more,” he says. “It used to be a thing that you used to increase productivity or automate processes, but that’s been done. Even chief information officers, who thoroughly understand enterprise IT, have been left behind by social IT – which they can’t control.”Today’s technology is all about communities, he maintains. IT and the internet are now affordable to all, providing universal and easy-to-use communications. Most is trivial and may appear to be of no interest to business. But it is increasingly crucial, as peer respect now comes from online social networking communities, such as Facebook, in which people swap feedback and recommendations.With every business now being a digital business – even a side-street hairdresser will have its customers comparing notes about it online – they have to engage. Yet many banks, for example, still refuse to let customers post comments online because they fear what will be said.I began to see that a successful organisation today needs to operate in a much more refined and subtle way, which for some could mean fundamental changes to business models. It involves more listening, watching, being in tune and in touch, engaging with every interested party, being responsive to communities.This gathering storm is changing the environment in which businesses operate. It will affect them in different ways: the US car industry, for example, might have suffered less if it had tapped into online social networks discussing motoring trends; perhaps the banking sector could regain some public trust by engaging with interested digital communities.Other industries have fought to hold back the tide: music companies, for example, are only now coming to terms with a market that pioneered ideas of connectivity and community.“Information is everywhere and readily accessible, yet business seems to think this has nothing to do with them,” Mr Prentice continued. “The boardroom doesn’t get it. They see IT as a tool. But IT has escaped the toolbox and is affecting their business, in terms of work expectations, channel to market, feedback, and others.“The secret is communities – work out how they work and tap into them. But CIOs are focusing on outsourcing, virtualisation, the cloud, which are all aimed at keeping the organisation the same and avoiding transformation.”Does this equate to companies not understanding IT? They clearly understand IT infrastructure – or digital efficiency – and have created organisations to maximise it. Most clearly understand the competitive edge that creative use of technology can bring through digital innovation.But this third strand of corporate IT – social technology – does seem to fall outside established structures, practices and thinking. This places the emphasis for understanding these changes on enlightened individuals within organisations.I asked Anne Berkowitch, chief executive of Selectminds, a provider of corporate social network software, whether there was a big variation in the way companies were responding to social IT: “Absolutely. There are individuals who get it and if it’s someone senior, they will launch a social networking initiative and show success and then it tends to grow organically.” (Hear her views in our latest podcast at www.ft.com/dbpodcast.)Ian Campbell, chief information officer at Cambridge Assessment (an arm of Cambridge University) and chairman of the UK’s Corporate IT Forum, agreed that understanding is patchy: “You could have two organisations in the same sector, one fully embracing this phenomenon and one saying ‘I don’t get that – what’s the point of it?’“It’s down to attitude – and it goes all the way to the board. They either see it and get it and embrace it or they will resist it – and then they will have difficulties.”Ms Berkowitch is not surprised at this mixed response: “It’s still pretty early in the adoption of these technologies. It’s a convergence of new technology with fundamental behavioural shifts in the business world around openness and collaboration – moving away from command and control into almost serendipitous encounters, with the power base shifting from senior management to individuals.“Technology can make this happen more quickly than managements are comfortable with. They want to be current but their behavioural and cultural evolution is much slower.”Rudy Puryear, a partner with Bain & Company, the consultancy, agrees that change is more likely to spread virally through an organisation rather than from the top down because this is the steep part of the learning curve: awareness is low, business risk can be high, and some of the technology is unproven: “It might be fine for a text message on a Saturday afternoon but not something we want to build a mission-critical business application around.”He says he recently made a presentation to a company’s executive committee. When he mentioned social networking at least three people asked what it was. “As I began to describe it they said: ‘Yes that’s something my grandchildren use – why are we talking about that in an executive meeting?’.“In another 15 minutes it was obvious there were some emerging business applications. A lot of these connection and collaboration techniques are going to be useful to business in a variety of settings.”He says 90 per cent of the conversation in the average boardroom was about getting more bang for the bucks from IT spending.“Most executive committees have an over-simplistic view of IT – they just think it costs too much and takes too long.”But while the board is taking a simplistic view, the technology itself is becoming more complex. As David Elton, an IT specialist with PA Consulting, points out: “The scope of IT now is enormous – from solid processing to deep cultural initiatives at the edge of both technology and organisational thinking. No wonder businesses don’t understand IT any more.“The traditional idea of IT as a box with an application running on it does not reflect the reality of IT today – yet most boards still think about it like that. In fact, you’re talking about a much bigger phenomenon – about how the market now looks and how open the boundaries are between your organisation and the market.“Most organisations still think of their boundaries as very fixed – they don’t see the outside world as part of their organisation. They think it’s far too risky to break down their borders – but there is opportunity in blurring the boundary.”He says research with the London School of Economics had uncovered two banks now using blogs to communicate in a much “softer” way than traditional marketing. “That is blurring the boundary a bit – saying ‘here’s what we’re really like inside’.“Does that help sell the product? It’s hard to say. But does it build a relationship of trust? It probably does.”Could this change the nature of a business?Mr Elton says it could: some quite large companies were already using a “leaky interface” between their organisation and the market to inject innovation into product and service design – engaging people that they did not necessarily know but who were potentially part of their market.Matt Glotzbach, product management director for Google Enterprise, says it is vital for companies to recognise that they can no longer control everything: “You can’t control the message any more.“The ones that get it ask: ‘How can I facilitate the dialogue with my customers’ – not to control it but to be responsive and be viewed as listening and as working with customers.”He believes new applications and collaborative ways of working will have a profound long-term impact on the structure of businesses and the way they think about a product’s lifecycle, supply chain, etc.“You’ve already seen a number of companies challenged: they’ve had to say ‘hmmm – what’s our value-add now in this new information economy?’.”But making changes is difficult, especially for large organisations. Mr Puryear of Bain argues that the complexity of IT in large corporations acts like reinforced concrete, solidifying old ways of doing business: “The average business looks at blogs, wikis, Twitters etc and isn’t quite sure what to make of it. They are intrigued, fascinated and a bit excited – but they’re a long way from sorting out which have true business value.”Should businesses therefore allow staff the latitude to try out new things and experiment?“Yes, as long as it does not involve excessive cost or business risk – so look for a safe way of doing it. Some are using laboratories to test things.”So how does the board get to understand social IT?In his blog, George Colony, chief executive of Forrester, the research company, says the only way is to use it: “Social technology is like sex. It’s fun to talk about and read about, but you can’t truly comprehend it unless you do it.”But this is not easy when the scene is changing so rapidly. As Peter Matthews, a partner at Ernst & Young, points out: “Many executives have chosen to demonstrate their awareness of the new world by joining Facebook, but are then bewildered when their clients, people or teams start talking about new, different communities.”He says the solution is to include a member of the business’s target group (clients, for example) as a board advisor to report on what people are thinking and doing – and be prepared to follow their advice.Or they could follow the example of the many speakers at IT conferences who learn from their teenage children. This generation, dubbed “digital natives” are now entering the workplace, and could force businesses to operate differently and more openly.Gary Curtis, of Accenture, warns business against moving too slowly to accommodate the digital natives. He says: “They have little interest and time for things that aren’t working for them and will quickly leave for jobs elsewhere.”* ‘Mesh Collaboration’ by Andy Mulholland and Nick Earle, April 2008"
476;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-06-16T18:19:28Z;Acer vows to repeat its PC trick with smartphones;;"Acer, the world’s third-biggest PC maker, vowed to be among the top five smartphone vendors in three to five years as it made its first foray into the fast-growing segment.The Taiwanese computer maker launched four smartphones for the Taiwan market and promised a further six by the end of the year.Acer’s move into smartphones reflects the continued convergence between the computing and communications industries, and the fact that computer makers are looking for sources of growth amid a PC market battered by the economic downturn.Few phone makers are switching to computer manufacture, but several of Acer’s rivals, such as the smaller Asus, are developing smartphones, which accounted for 12 per cent of mobile sales in the fourth quarter of last year, according to research firm Gartner.The market is dominated by Nokia, which has a 41 per cent share, followed by BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion, Apple, HTC and Samsung.Aymar de Lencquesaing, president of Acer’s smart handheld unit, said smartphones represented a “very big opportunity” for the computer maker, which expects to have a 6-7 per cent market share and to ship 20m smartphones annually by 2012.Acer appears prepared to undercut its rivals to reach that goal, as it did in the stiffly competitive PC market. The four models Acer is selling in Taiwan range between T$15,000 and T$20,000 (US$455-$607) compared with T$20,000-T$25,000 for HTC’s smartphones and about T$26,000 for Apple iPhones.Acer’s phones, particularly two models it plans to launch in September, aim to “bridge the gap between [standard] feature phones and smartphones”, Mr de Lencquesaing said. The C1, which looks like a standard mobile phone but has a touchscreen, would sell for $40-$50.Apple said last week it would sell an iPhone for $99.Only 300m of the world’s 4bn mobile phone users were using smartphones, Mr de Lencquesaing said. “It’s not at all a question of whether they will shift; it’s a question of when . . . Inherently, the economics of this market is that it’s faster growing than the PC market.”Arthur Hsieh, technology analyst for UBS, said smartphones would reach 20 per cent of the global market in the second half of this year. It was too early to tell whether Acer’s strategy would succeed, he added."

478;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-06-08T20:26:12Z;Apple unveils new version of iPhone;;Apple on Monday revealed a new family of iPhones at the company’s Worldwide Developers’ Conference in San Francisco, including a $99 version of the current iPhone with reduced memory.Its new iPhone 3GS models feature video recording capabilities, improved speed and a 3-megapixel camera, and could dramatically increase the company’s share of the smartphone market.An 8GB version of the current model will cost $99 and is available immediately. The new 16GB version will cost $199, while the 32GB version will cost $299, and all will be available to buy on June 19.“This is the most powerful, fastest iPhone ever made,” said Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice-president and marketing chief. The new device would last longer between battery charges, overcoming one of the shortcomings of the earlier iPhones, Apple said. It would operate on WiFi networks for up to nine hours, compared with the six hours of current models.Apple holds about 11 per cent of the world’s smart- phone market, trailing Nokia’s 41 per cent and Research in Motion’s 20 per cent, according to Gartner figures from the first quarter of this year. The company said on Monday it had sold more than 40m iPhones and iPod Touches.Rival smartphone maker Palm started selling its make-or-break Pre device over the weekend. It could be the first viable competitor to the iPhone, after positive reviews, but supplies have so far been limited.At the time of writing, the conference was still ongoing, and there was no sign of Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive. Mr Jobs has been on medical leave since January, recovering from complications from an earlier bout of pancreatic cancer. Apple has said he would return to work at the end of June, but speculation about his poor health has been rampant.Apple also announced a new line of lower priced laptops and unveiled its new operating system, called Snow Leopard.Additional reporting by Richard Waters in San Francisco
479;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-06-04T23:26:28Z;Apple to launch cut-price version of iPhone;;Apple plans to introduce a cheaper version of its popular iPhone as soon as Monday, in a move that could dramatically increase the company’s share of the market for web-surfing devices, people familiar with the initiative said on Thursday.Analysts said that the company wanted to show off either a $149 phone or a $99 phone, down from the current low end of $199 and still subsidised in exchange for an AT&T communications service contract.“It’s either a $50 or a $100 cut,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Kathryn Huberty.Citing a firm survey of consumers, she said that a $50 price cut could increase demand by 50 per cent and a $100 cut by 100 per cent.Apple sells about 11 per cent of the world’s smart phones, trailing Nokia’s 41 per cent volume and Research in Motion’s 20 per cent, according to Gartner figures from the first quarter. Palm’s Pre was expected to go on sale later on Friday.Apple declined to comment, although the company typically introduces major products at its developer conference, which begins on Monday with a keynote speech by senior vice-president and marketing chief Phil Schiller.The anticipated new phone is likely to start production in July with the third version of the iPhone operating system, also expected to be released next week as a free upgrade for existing iPhone owners. The new software includes the ability to cut and paste text and to search for information inside multiple applications at the same time.An even bigger impact on market share could come with new pricing from AT&T, which remains in an exclusive deal with Apple.Randall Stephenson, AT&T chief executive, said last week that variable pricing for internet use would arrive eventually, charging heavy data users more and occasional users less.Collins Stewart analyst Ashok Kumar said that he expects that to happen in the third quarter. Apple is the farthest ahead in the number of applications users can install on their phones. Most developers are working to create such software either for Apple alone or for Apple and Google’s Android, an open platform being adopted by multiple handset manufacturers, Ms Huberty said.
480;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-06-04T18:42:41Z;Palm hopes rest on success of iPhone rival;;If a single hit product can save a company that has fallen on hard times, then Palm’s Pre smartphone, which goes on sale at midnight Friday in the US, probably has as good a shot as any.Yet, with competition intense and Apple set to unveil improvements to its iPhone next week, odds that the Pre can revive the iconic maker of PDAs from the 1990s still look long.The Pre has added nearly $1.5bn to Palm’s stock market value since it was unveiled this year, salvaging a troubled investment by Silicon Valley private equity firm Elevation Partners, which holds a stake of about 33 per cent.The device has earned favourable early reviews. But catching up with Apple – not to mention other groups crowding into the smartphone market such as Google, Nokia and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry – from a standing start is a tall order. “They’ve taken on an awful lot,” said Ken Dulaney, an analyst at Gartner.Taking its direction directly from Apple’s strategy, Palm has produced its own operating system and hardware from scratch.The company will also shoulder the costs of marketing the device and is building an “app store” to showcase applications from independent developers.It was essential for Palm to launch the Pre ahead of Apple’s next big iPhone announcement to garner attention, said Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering.However, that deadline has hampered its early prospects with production shortages expected to limit availability in the early weeks.Also, Palm only has a test version of an app shop, with a small number of applications, available at launch. The Pre will only be sold at launch by Sprint, third largest of the US wireless carriers, which has struggled to match the network quality and service of its rivals. However, Palm hopes the Pre will find an untapped market among Sprint customers who have not had access to the iPhone.Early consumer reaction to the Pre could make the difference between Palm being able to fund a family of handsets or being forced to seek a stronger partner.“Palm will go on,” says Mr Doherty. But he adds whether that is as an independent company, or as a division of a Nokia, Microsoft, or RIM, “really depends on what happens in the next seven days”.
481;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-06-02T21:20:43Z;Nokia;;"Two years is a lifetime in gadget land. So it says something about Nokia that it has taken the world’s biggest handset maker that long to launch its iPhone-killer. The Finnish group’s newest weapon in the smartphone wars – the touch-screen N97, another attempt at a “mobile computer” – goes on sale in 75 countries this month. Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, chief executive, is counting on Nokia’s marketing muscle to make up for lost time.Good luck. Nokia still dominates smartphones, which remain a rare bright spot in an industry on track for its first yearly sales decline. High-end phone shipments jumped 12 per cent in the first quarter, while overall handset sales fell almost 9 per cent, according to Gartner, the market researchers. But Nokia’s grip on this coveted market is slipping, along with profit margins.The Finnish group accounted for 41 per cent of the 36.4m smartphones sold to consumers in the first three months of the year – more than double its closest rival but down nearly 4 per cent from the first quarter last year. Apple and Research in Motion, the BlackBerry maker, are gaining fast. In just a year, they have expanded their combined market share from less than a fifth to almost a third.Investors, whose optimism about economic recovery has lifted Nokia’s share price by nearly two-thirds from its March lows, should not count on the N97 to stem declining market share. It faces tough competition – not just from Apple but from a clutch of other iPhone pretenders, such as Google’s G1 handset. Nokia views the N97 as the first of several products designed to capitalise on a “tidal wave” of interest in the mobile internet. But so far, late to the game, it has been responding to changing consumer tastes rather than shaping them.Nokia Oyj, the world’s largest mobile-phone maker, on Tuesday began shipping a phone equipped with more software and storage than many low-cost notebooks in a bid to regain market share lost to Apple’s iPhone, Bloomberg writes.“This should not be a niche product,” Jonas Geust, Nokia’s vice president responsible for the N series handsets, said in an interview. “Clearly our ambition is to have a similar success to the N95 family.” The N95 has sold more than 10 million units as of the end of March, according to Nokia.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

482;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-06-02T16:36:50Z;Facebook brings in payment system;;Facebook has begun tapping a new revenue stream with the introduction of an internal payments system, a move that might help the fast-growing social networking website achieve profitability while being less reliant on advertising.The long-rumoured payments system, which is in its early stages, will allow users to purchase Facebook “credits”, then use those credits to buy virtual goods from the third-party applications that run on the site, or from Facebook itself.Facebook hopes that by offering a site-wide currency it will encourage more commerce on the website. By serving as the payment provider, it will capture a percentage of every transaction.“Over time, this will be very significant,” said Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner Research. “Social networking sites have suffered with monetising [their services], but this leverages [the fact that] users are there on Facebook.”Mr Valdes said revenue from its payments system could soon represent one-third of Facebook’s income.Users are increasingly spending real money buying virtual goods and credits on the applications that run on Facebook’s platform. Zynga, the largest applications developer on Facebook, with 42m users of its games, is reported to be nearing annual sales of $100m. Together, developers working on Facebook’s platform are expected to make more than $500m this year – perhaps more than Facebook itself.“Control equals revenue,” said Bruce Cundiff, director of payments research and consulting at Javelin Strategy and Research. “They have that [captive] user base, and they’re going to make it as easy as possible to buy Facebook credits and use them.”Facebook has more than 300m registered users and continues to grow rapidly. Last week, it accepted a $200m investment from Digital Sky Technologies, a private Russian internet investment group, which valued the company’s preferred stock at $10bn.Though the payments system is being tested on just three applications at the moment, it is expected to be rolled out more widely in the coming weeks.The payments platform could position Facebook to become a significant e-commerce player. “Potentially you’re looking at Facebook as a shopping portal and a source for music downloads,” said Mr Cundiff.The question of how Facebook will monetise its significant traffic has dogged the company of late. But last week Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook chief executive, said his company had been profitable before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for five quarters and was expecting revenue growth of 70 per cent this year. He said Facebook would be cash flow profitable sometime next year. Outside estimates put 2009 income at about $500m.Developers have had to cobble together payments solutions to enable commerce on their applications. Using Facebook’s payments system could make it easier for developers to monetise their applications.
483;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-06-02T15:00:21Z;Insight: Hedge funds face mountain;;“There are basically two types of people,” said Mark Twain. “People who accomplish things, and people who claim to have accomplished things. The first group is less crowded.”Hedge fund managers take note. The rapid contraction of their industry over the past year has increased the pressure on firms to prove they can accomplish what they claim. They will have their work cut out: from a peak of about $1,900bn of assets in late 2007, the industry will probably fall to about $750bn of assets this year. That these losses occurred at the same time as major market declines and a global economic crisis does not excuse them, for it is during such times hedge funds are supposed to preserve investors’ money. So what has gone wrong?Somewhere along the way, hedge funds lost sight of their original purpose. When Alfred Winslow Jones set up the first hedge fund in 1949, he had the goal of disaggregating individual share performance from market movements by also shorting shares. But, the industry has seemed to forget the aims of hedging as equity bull markets led to a ferocious appetite for ever- increasing performance and a disregard for risk. The result was a hedge fund bubble that burst when markets collapsed.But bubbles are not all bad. Their bursting can bring positive outcomes. Many managers hope the end of the hedge fund bubble will help create better times ahead.The research group Gartner tried to prove the potentially positive outcomes of bubbles in its theory of the “hype cycle”, in which mass adoption of any product begins with a “technology trigger” that generates significant interest. This leads to a “peak of inflated expectations”. When reality fails to live up to these hopes, the industry enters a “trough of disillusionment” in which many businesses leave. Those that remain continue through to a “slope of enlightenment” in which a more practical understanding of the technology’s potential is reached. The final stage is the “plateau of productivity”.One key factor missing from Gartner’s analysis is capital. The surge to the “peak of inflated expectations” can only occur if capital is cheap and freely available. And this is a key point to remember when analysing the hedge fund bubble of 2008.From 2002 until late 2007, a growing wave of capital, combined with a five-year upwardly trending market, fuelled a massive expansion of the hedge fund industry from about 4,000 funds and $700bn of assets to almost 8,000 funds and nearly $2,000bn of assets. At the same time, hedge funds became highly correlated with equities as many managers relied too heavily on rising markets to generate returns, with disastrous consequences in some cases.However, one should recognise that some hedge funds did profit and meet expectations in 2008. These managers (largely Macro and Managed Futures strategies) had often not been the best performers in the bull market as they controlled risk and correlation and hence were often overlooked. Their time has now come as they have shown an ability to offer clients a non-correlated return which provides important portfolio diversification.So, while 2008 was very painful for most hedge funds, it is unlikely to herald their demise. There will always be investors seeking absolute returns with low correlation to equity markets and low volatility. As the losses incurred by many hedge funds last year show, to achieve all these simultaneously is difficult. However, firms with investment talent, strong research capabilities, appropriate due diligence and risk management are discovering a wealth of opportunities as they develop a better understanding of the financial crisis and adapt accordingly. The positive returns achieved by many hedge funds so far this year suggests a rapid evolution is taking place.The huge amount invested in hedge funds between 2002 and 2007 brought the industry to maturity quicker than expected. This maturity will likely lead to a re-focusing of priorities as funds return to their original purpose of hedging risk and protecting against market falls. Ultimately, that is the method by which they may generate consistent absolute returns.The writer is chief investment director of GAM’s fund of hedge fund business.
484;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-05-29T22:30:51Z;SAP stays buoyant through maintenance growth;;Léo Apotheker, chief executive of SAP, the world’s largest maker of business software, last week said he saw “no significant improvement” in the bleak outlook for 2009. However, the German group – and the likes of US rival Oracle – are riding the downturn better than many old-economy counterparts.Like them, SAP has seen sales of its products slump as its clients have tightened their belts. But business software makers have a second, often larger sales stream that most old-style manufacturers do not: revenues from updating and maintaining old programmes – and these continue to grow in spite of the recession.While SAP saw software licence sales decline 33 per cent to €418m ($590m) in the first quarter of the year, its maintenance revenues climbed 18 per cent to €1.3bn, making for stable overall revenues. It is a trend that SAP says it may be able to sustain all year.Chris Pang, an analyst at Gartner Research, even believes maintenance revenues could still make the €23.5m market for enterprise resource planning applications grow ever so slightly this year. “Maintenance is the life vest,” he said.It seems recession has cast a light on the business software sector’s big secret, one Mr Apotheker seemed unwilling to mention at SAP’s annual meeting last week.Take Luxottica, the Italian eyewear group. It started to install a new, company-wide software system in 2008 with a view to having its 62,000 staff, 6,250 shops and 10 manufacturing sites move from multiple systems to a single IT platform by 2012.Although the company itself will not comment on cost, industry experts believe the project will cost €200m, of which only about 10 per cent will flow to the software’s manufacturer – in this case, SAP.Some €180m, by contrast, is earmarked to flow to technicians and consultants, most of them from third-party companies. With SAP contracted to stress test each new phase of the system before it goes live, the German company can expect its share of maintenance revenues to make up for struggling new license sales.But Carlo Privitera, Luxottica’s chief information officer, said it was the kind of investment many companies were shunning under current conditions – even if new software promises to make business processes more efficient and thus save money.“It’s a huge capital expenditure that does not promise major operating savings within the short-term of a year or two,” he said.Luxottica, which makes Ray-Ban sunglasses and owns the Lens Crafters chain, believes it will reap the full cost benefits of the move only after 2012 when it turns off the last of its old systems.Mr Privitera insists the company would have committed to the project even in a deep recession because Luxottica was primarily looking to improve the way it worked – and faced its customer. “The idea was to improve the customer experience – to serve the customer in Australia, say, from inventory in Europe.”Cutting costs was a secondary, but not an unwelcome, result – although, for the moment, the company is paying 150 in-house specialists and another 150 outsiders to do nothing but set up the system.Not all companies can claim to be so visionary.At Gartner, Mr Pang said many corporate IT heads were simply “hunkering down” as they saw little chance of persuading colleagues of raising present costs in the interests of future benefits.Gartner, as a result, forecasts ERP market growth slowing to 2-3 per cent this year.This is down considerably from double-digit annual increases in the two years before the global crisis but still better than the 15 per cent sales decline predicted for steelmakers this year.Perhaps comparisons such as this have led investors to ignore Mr Apotheker’s caution. Last week, they bid SAP stock back up to €30, meaning that the company has regained half the value it lost when the recession bit in September.
485;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-05-28T20:39:41Z;Mobility: Flexibility is driven from the bottom up;;"The fastest growth in IT and mobile communications is coming from devices that are small, simple, and above all, cheap.Netbooks, simple portable computers that sell for less than $400, are the only technology sector set to post any significant growth in 2009. Gartner Dataquest, the research firm, expects sales to reach 21m units this year, up almost 80 per cent on 2008.The other surprise success has been the USB cellular modem, or “dongle”. Sales of these compact and cheap units that provide mobile internet connections are expected to reach around 25m units in 2009. Although this is a tiny proportion of even 3G mobile phone users, dongle sales are growing at around 25 per cent, year on year.According to Roger Roberts, a partner at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, both companies and individuals are looking for simplicity. “Growth has come from unexpected areas, such as netbooks,” he says.Certainly, it is appealing to have a device that simply plugs in and provides internet access, whether it is via a USB dongle, or a mini-notebook that gives wireless local area networking or even 3G connectivity.Such devices can come into their own in ways IT directors might not expect. When heavy snow caused the transport network in much of southern England to grind to a halt earlier this year, several mobile networks reported spikes in their mobile data traffic, as stranded commuters turned to their 3G devices to connect to corporate networks from home.But the growing interest in small, cheap and simple mobile devices also reflects the wider trend for individuals to buy their own technology, both for personal and increasingly, for work use.This “consumerisation of IT”, as Gartner describes it, could ultimately have as great an impact on businesses’ plans for a more flexible and mobile workforce as technical developments such as 3G, or newer networks, such as LTE (Long-term Evolution of 3G).“It is being driven from the bottom up, by people wanting the technology,” says Carsten Sorensen, a researcher in mobile technologies at the London School of Economics. “It is about small, flexible technologies that are not related to the core business. They are under the radar [of IT], but this can create problems as the solutions are often not scalable.”At the same time, the potential prize for the effective use of mobility – and more broadly, flexible working – is substantial.According to Guido Häring, general manager of customer services and support in the Emea region at Microsoft, his business has saved around 30 per cent of its travel and expenses budget through unified communications.Further savings have come from allowing staff the flexibility to “hot desk” or to work from home. Mr Häring himself, for example, no longer has a permanent desk at any Microsoft site.Of course, Microsoft makes and sells unified communications technologies, so the company would be expected to make use of them.But mobile working is not just about communications. It is also about the ability to access company data and business applications.“From the user’s perspective, it is about application persistence,” says Robert Gleichauf, Cisco’s chief technology officer for enterprise, services and security. “People want to pull together information from a variety of sources; information is now very fluid.“So it might not be as much about the latest shiny gadget, as about having a persistent connection.”For network operators, this means continuing to invest in infrastructure to improve coverage, capacity and connection speeds.As Alan Carr of PA Consulting points out, next-generation wireless technologies such as LTE are more efficient in their use of spectrum and network capacity than 3G.The danger is that the improvements – even based on the industry’s own predictions of capacity increases of between three and five times – will not be sufficient to keep up with growing demand for data services, both from consumers and mobile workers.“The 4G networks carry data better than 3G and can also be used for voice, but we have already seen a dramatic increase in the uptake of data,” he says.Some mobile networks are reporting four-fold increases in data usage over the past year, driven mostly by sales of 3G dongles and laptops with built-in cellular connections. With growth on this scale, the risk is that networks will be unable to improve capacity – let alone improve connection speeds – without significant further investment.For businesses, this also presents a challenge because coverage improvements might be delayed. As a result, applications will need to be smart enough to cope with variable connection speeds and connectivity black holes for some time.Mobile workers, for example, might be unwise entirely to rely on cellular connections might be unwise. Secure Wi-Fi access via a corporate account and a virtual private network is still part of the road warrior’s armoury, and technologies that route calls seamlessly either via cellular or voice over internet (VoIP) systems will be more robust than one that relies on VoIP alone, at least for companies that can afford it.Businesses should also be prepared for rising connection costs. Fees for mobile data could rise as networks use price as a way to constrain demand.Companies have already found that costs for fixed-line connections have risen, as a result of cost-saving initiatives elsewhere in the business, whether it is data centre consolidation, or technologies such as unified communications and video conferencing.“The result of all these initiatives is to put more applications and more bandwidth on to the network,” he says. “There is a case that even when IT budgets overall are being reduced the projects that are being initiated are demanding bandwidth, and some companies have seen demand grow by between 70 and 100 per cent.”Such costs can be offset by the improvements in productivity and effectiveness that can come from mobile working.Companies that have introduced mobile e-mail report improvements in customer satisfaction, as the right staff can respond to queries, even if they are not in the office. Deals can also be closed more quickly, and executives say they are better informed.Putting hard figures against such benefits, though, is notoriously hard.Almost any technology that saves time for an executive on a six-figure salary can be justified, with a payback period of a few months. For blue-collar workers, carrying out structured tasks, companies quickly see the gains from eliminating paperwork or steps in the business process.For the large number of workers that do not fall into either category, the picture is less clear.CIOs and HR directors also have to look not just at the cost, but also the personal consequences of permanent connectivity.According to Mr Sorensen, one Danish company has set up its mobile e-mail system in such a way that staff do not receive messages out of regular working hours, to preserve the separation between work and home life.This is by no means a unique problem. “Remote working is often managed very badly,” says Rob Gear, a mobility specialist at PA Consulting.“You can’t just put a BlackBerry in someone’s hands and tell them to get on with it.“Some people will become very anxious about the idea that they have to respond to an e-mail at 10.30 at night.”Businesses are discovering that, whichever technologies they use, mobility has to be well managed to deliver genuine productivity benefits."
486;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-05-28T20:39:41Z;Overcoming the fear of connectivity;;"Some organisations, fearful of untoward consequences such as reputational damage, ban social networking websites – Facebook and the like – from their premises. Others embrace them enthusiastically and try to persuade others to do likewise.One such is IBM; not the IBM which cowed the computer industry back in the 1970s through a mixture of fear, uncertainty and doubt but a global IT services company with a manufacturing operation attached. It is, in fact, one model of a modern interconnected company.“We are really encouraging our employees to use social software and social media internally and externally to link up with clients and suppliers,” says Gina Poole, the company’s vice-president for what IBM calls social software programs and enablement.“We have thousands of IBMers active on Twitter (the micro-blogging website), tens of thousands who are blogging both internally and externally and hundreds of thousands who are active on social networks like LinkedIn and Facebook.”She explains there are four elements to IBM’s commitment to connectivity. First, internal networking using tools both commercially available and experimental that IBM itself has developed. Second, connections between internal networks and external networks through ibm.com. Third, participation in external social networks; and fourth, moves to persuade IBM’s customers to take similar initiatives.Ms Poole leads an IBM initiative called BlueIQ which seeks to harness the collective intelligence of the company to improve service to customers and partners. A group of early adopters of connectivity, the “BlueIQ ambassador community” spreads the word.Key to successful social networking, Ms Poole argues, are guidelines. They lay down, for example, that IBMers are personally responsible for the content they publish; among other conditions, they have to identify themselves as company employees and are duty bound to correct their mistakes. “We have had no problems,” Ms Poole says encouragingly. “These guidelines reduce the level of risk and liberate rather than inhibit.”No business sector can remain insulated from the spread of connectivity. This month the Gartner Group warned the banking industry that it had to be ready to take advantage of the “new age of social banking” – in which depositing, lending and the connections between depositors, borrowers and financial institutions are transparent and modelled on social networking.Stessa Cohen, research director at Gartner, said such connectivity had been characterised by speed of growth and viral impact: “Ideas are picked up, established and disseminated within short time scales, much too short to allow late entrants to the market to take advantage of the opportunities that will arise. Banks need to be positioned to take advantage of this shift to a new age of social banking.”For many companies the prospect of opening their boundaries to the outside world remains frightening although, as a recent paper from the McKinsey consultancy points out: “Technology now allows companies to delegate substantial control to outsiders – co-creation – in essence by outsourcing innovation to business partners that work together in networks.“By distributing innovation through the value chain companies may reduce their costs and usher new products to market faster by eliminating the bottlenecks that come with total control.”So the case for connectivity and communication in business has been well made. But it remains on the leading edge where ground rules have yet to be set in stone. Some fears are well-founded: Rob Gear of PA Consulting argues that ill-considered openness can lead to competitors learning of initiatives that should be kept confidential.Worse, it could lead to customer expectations that cannot be fulfilled. And customers can be sensitive about the kind of personal information companies would like to collate to help them target their marketing.There has, for example, been an outcry in recent months about Phorm, the company which was collecting the web-browsing habits of some British Telecom and Virgin Broadband customers for marketing purposes. The mistake it made, Mr Gear points out, was not to tell those customers what it was doing.Rob Bamforth of the consultancy Quocirca worries that there is little resilience, little insulation from shocks and changes of direction in a hyperconnected world. In a highly connected business, a shock to one part of the system can cause a disastrous resonance elsewhere: “To my mind, this means imposing some kind of control or choke point.“There is the opportunity to use technology to provide additional layers of social connectivity that an organisation previously has not had. There has always been the ability to telephone someone, but the large enterprise telephone directory does not tell you why you might want to call somebody or who to call in the event of something happening. The connected enterprise can allow that connection to take place.”He warned furthermore that vendors of connectivity tools were concentrating on their own technology at the expense of interconnectivity between tools from different suppliers: “In the real world there is a need for a federation of high level services from multiple vendors. We seem to be at an early stage of that level of interoperability,” he said."
487;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-05-27T01:20:34Z;Facebook gets $200m from Russian group;;Facebook said on Tuesday it had accepted a $200m investment from Digital Sky Technologies , a private Russian internet investment group, valuing the fast growing social network’s preferred stock at $10bn.The investment, which represents a 1.96 per cent equity stake, gives Facebook an additional cash cushion but the $10bn valuation is a come-down.A year and a half ago, Microsoft invested $240m on similar terms but valued Facebook’s preferred stock at $15bn. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, acknowledged on Tuesday that this investment came at the “absolute peak of the market”.Facebook has been fielding offers from investors, though reports have put valuations at $6bn-$8bn. While DST’s preferred shares will grant it additional privileges, the $10bn valuation is higher than others seemed willing to grant.DST indicated it planned to buy at least $100m of Facebook common stock from existing shareholders, allowing current and former employees to receive a payout. Details are expected in the coming months, and the valuation DST gives Facebook’s common stock could put a more accurate valuation on the company.DST will not receive a seat on Facebook’s board as part of either investment.“They’ve had to go far afield for this capital,” Ray Valdes, an analyst at Gartner, said. “I’m sure there are investors closer to home that would be happy to invest in Facebook, but not at that valuation.”DST, set up in 2005, has about 30 investments in Russia and eastern Europe. They include Mail.ru, Russia’s largest web portal. DST sites account for 70 per cent of page views on the Russian language internet.Among its backers is Alisher Usmanov, the Russian metals magnate and billionaire.Facebook has 200m users, but much of its growth is coming internationally where the group is harder-pressed to monetise traffic. Capital costs are growing as it pays to accommodate increased activity on the site.“Facebook has been successful in gaining users, but that has had the unfortunate result that it increases costs,” Mr Valdes said. “As long as they grow, they will need additional capital to build out capacity.”Facebook is projecting substantial revenue growth this year. Mr Zuckerberg said on Tuesday that Facebook had been profitable before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for five quarters and was expecting revenue growth of 70 per cent this year.He said Facebook would be cash flow profitable sometime next year. Outside estimates put 2009 income at about $500m.“Our revenue numbers are up and our growth continues to scale very rapidly,” Mr Zuckerberg said. “This investment is purely buffer for us, and not something we need to get cashflow positive.”
488;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-05-25T20:01:13Z;Obstacles litter road to Bharti-MTN deal;;Only hours after a firework display marked the Johannesburg final of India’s glitzy Premier League cricket competition, India and South Africa managed to conjure up some impressive corporate pyrotechnics.The cross shareholding deal announced on Monday by Bharti Airtel of India and MTN of South Africa would – if it eventually goes ahead – create an emerging market telecom powerhouse, with more than 200m customers and $20bn a year in revenue.Most analysts agree the strategic logic of what could eventually become a full merger is compelling.Bharti Airtel is the biggest mobile operator in the world’s most rapidly growing mobile market in terms of subscribers. The company is the third largest single country operator in the world.MTN has a sizeable share of the more sophisticated higher margin South African market. It has also been increasing its businesses across Africa, a continent where average mobile penetration of 35 per cent is far lower than in the rest of the world – offering huge growth potential. Both businesses, meanwhile, have established a footprint in the Middle East.Growth in those markets has sustained some impressive advances for MTN. In the 12 months to March 31, for example, MTN raised subscription revenues by 48 per cent. The South African operator jumped from 30th to 25th largest operator in the world in terms of revenues between 2007 and 2008, according to data from Gartner, which puts Bharti in 33rd position.William Hahn, telecoms analyst at Gartner says: “It is the first time we have seen a movement like that since the emergence of China Mobile in 2004 and 2005 and they would be even bigger if they were ranked by subscribers”.Yet growth is slowing as some of these new markets become more competitive. Earlier this year, Phuthuma Nhleko, MTN’s chief executive, said revenue growth was likely to slow and that “to maintain our growth, somehow we need to try and find larger markets”.However, there is no certainty that the deal, let alone any further integration, will succeed. After all, the two companies have been in talks before.Just over a year ago, Bharti Airtel and MTN discussed a similar kind of partnership, only for talks to break down, partly – according to analysts – over the issue of control. MTN subsequently held talks with India’s Reliance Communications, but walked away after a dispute between Mukesh and Anil Ambani, the two brothers that control the Reliance group. Even if the two companies agree by the 31 July deadline, regulatory approval is far from guaranteed, not least in South Africa, where there is sensitivity about potential foreign control of local businesses and any potential job losses that might result.Ten days ago, a last-minute court ruling was needed for Vodafone of the UK to go ahead with plans to acquire a majority stake in the country’s biggest mobile telecoms company, Vodacom.Local regulators had surprisingly reversed an earlier decision to clear the Vodacom transaction in the face of union protests that the deal – which also involved the unbundling of state carrier Telkom’s 35 per cent stake in Vodacom – would lead to redundancies.Government lawyers eventually stood behind the deal, although there have been suggestions locally that the new government, led by Jacob Zuma, president, and backed by the trades unions and Communist party, had put pressure on regulators.South African resentment of foreign takeovers is in any case deep rooted. Not surprisingly perhaps, MTN chose to highlight on Monday that the “potential transaction would not lead to any job losses in South Africa”.The company will be hoping too that South Africans find partnership with an Indian group less threatening than if the would-be suitor was from Europe or the US.Cultural connections, centred on South Africa’s sizeable Indian minority population based in Mr Zuma’s home province of KwaZulu Natal, can have only been enhanced by the popularity and commercial success of the cricket tournament.As Paul Theron of Johannesburg-based Vestact, an asset manager, put it: “India is a country that South Africa is keen to do businesses with.”
489;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-05-21T13:08:28Z;Prepare a back-up plan in case your IT vendor starts to struggle;;"The current economic climate means more insolvency and many IT vendors will face financial difficulties. Even financially strong vendors may be looking to rebalance their portfolios to cut less profitable product lines.Technology-rich, but cash-strapped, smaller vendors will make prime acquisition targets. But what happens to their customers? End-user organisations need an early-warning system for potential vendor failure, as well as a back-up plan, in case they lose support.Profit warnings and failure over several quarters to meet earnings targets are overt signs of problems but there may be more subtle indications too.Early warning signs before the vendor experiences financial difficulty may include increased turnaround time for technical support issues, unusually high resistance to discounts in favour of longer-term strategic wins, increased personnel turnover, missed software release dates for upgrades or maintenance releases, failure to comply with terms of service-level agreements and demand weakness for a particular product or service.Organisations should also watch out for acquisitions, which are not always good news and there will be at least some disruption to normal operations. A large vendor with substantial portfolios and financial resources acquiring another large vendor may de-focus the organisation. If relying on a small innovative vendor, end-user organisations should find out at least theoretically which staff they plan to retain.Gartner has identified five steps end-user organisations should take:1. Establish a policy of periodic vendor ”health checks”Periodic financial and technical reviews should be an ongoing part of relationship management with key vendors. It may be appropriate to have protection clauses so that the prime vendor takes responsibility both for its own components and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology.After a vendor has acknowledged financial problems or is acquired, users should expect periodic updates on financial progress and which personnel are staying or going.For publicly traded companies, the balance sheet tells investors how much money the company has, how much it owes and what it has left over for shareholders; the income statement is a record of the company’s profitability and the cash flow statement shows where the company is spending.2. Assess the riskEnd users should establish some criteria for assessing how critical the vendor is to the ongoing operation of their major systems and the daily operation of their businesses – such as the percentage of IT budget spent with a particular vendor, how much revenue it helps generate and whether it is customer-facing.Most of the cost of doing business with any vendor is paid upfront in selection and implementation costs so if the vendor is still servicing day-to-day needs, end users should wait for a month or two before taking any action and use the interim to implement fallback plans.3. Assess the impactTemporary insolvency is not necessarily the end but end-user organisations need to assess four possible outcomes:– The vendor is able to obtain refinancing or negotiate a loan to continue in business.– The vendor is acquired by a third party.– The company may be liquidated to pay off its debts. This outcome does not necessarily mean the end of the technology because this may be one of the assets to be sold.– The company ceases to trade and any software that it has created is, thereafter, unsupported.4. Assess the skills baseNo matter what the eventual outcome, there will be some disruption in the short term. User organisations should assess the ability and willingness of internal IT to support the software and how quickly or easily it could move support to another vendor. If they do not have the skills and rely on the vendor or a third party, they should consider obtaining them through contract labour if available.5. Develop mitigation strategiesWith most technology, the costs to install, train and maintain are more significant than the acquisition costs. The closer to end-of-life, the more feasible it is to keep the software going while it lives out its useful life.An exit strategy should include legal and financial strategies for obtaining source code and a plan and schedule for keeping the software running through an interim. In addition, users should have a list of selection criteria for a replacement vendor and understand the transition responsibilities. Users should create a schedule of expectations for the vendor’s recovery that extends for the next 12 months. If expectations are not met, they must begin to execute the exit plan.End-user organisations have committed hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars worth of their resources, along with critical business data to software vendors.Given the economic climate, it is imperative that they assess the financial health of the vendors in which they have invested the most and whose software and services they count on to run their business. Being left without a back-up plan should one of their vendors fail could put their own operations in danger.http://blogs.gartner.com/debra_logan/"

491;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Does IT work: Shopkeepers need to show their agility;;High-profile retail failures such as Circuit City in the US or Woolworths in the UK, suggest the shopkeeping business is in a downward spiral.Consumer spending figures are flat in the UK and a report by consultancies PwC and Retail Forward published last month predicted that retail sales in the US would be flat, or even negative, this year.The poor outlook has hit capital spending plans. Gartner, the IT industry research firm, estimates that half the world’s top 10 retailers will cut their capital spending plans in half.But at the same time, there are pockets of investment. Again according to Gartner, “cash-rich” companies are poised to make significant investments. And retailers across the board are looking to technology as a way of cutting costs, winning new business or exploiting gaps in the market left by others.“Many retailers have slashed their capital spending by between 30 and 70 per cent,” says John Davidson, joint author of the Gartner report. “They are also scaling back on the number of projects.”There are two challenges for retailers – and especially those with large physical estates.The first is that consumer spending overall is down, and the prospect of deflation in a number of markets is making consumers cautious about parting with their cash.The second challenge is to compete with leaner online outlets with lower fixed overheads, lower staff costs and often, more attractive customer service. So-called “multi-channel” strategies, for example, where retailers allow customers to order goods online but collect them from a store, have tended to add to the shopkeeper’s costs.The challenge is compounded not only because retailers are under pressure to contain costs, but because they have traditionally invested relatively low sums on IT, about 3 per cent of turnover, according to Mr Davidson.Some retailers are willing to increase that spending, even against a background of low growth. But the industry is putting more emphasis on smaller or shorter-term projects, and on work that has an immediate impact on the customer’s experience.Brendan O’Meara, managing director for retail at Microsoft, says: “Retailers are looking at all investments, but the real shift is to a shorter return on investment of six to 12 months. More capital-intensive investments are being put on the back burner.”In the short term, retailers are pressing on with initiatives that they hope will save money. Mr O’Meara points to IT projects such as server consolidation and virtualisation as areas where cost-savings can be made.But retailers are also looking at ways of either saving money by cutting staff costs, or improving service by allocating staff more efficiently. Improvements in areas such as rostering and scheduling can rapidly pay for themselves.“Improving staff productivity is not a glamorous topic, but there has never been a better time to understand the value of the employee cost-base,” says Helen Slaven, vice-president for retail at Torex, a software vendor specialising in the retail sector.“Most retailers’ biggest spend is on staff, so overspending by 10 per cent can be a huge cost on the bottom line,” she says. “Understanding the productivity of staff and how to manage them should be part of the operating plan.”Managing staff at the store level might be efficient for a particular outlet, but it might not reflect demand across the business.In other areas, retailers are focusing on measures that will encourage customers in through the doors or to spend more.Torex has worked with Thorntons, a confectionery retailer in the UK, to cut the time it takes to pay for goods at the till by as much as two-thirds. Such measures shorten queues and can prevent “walkaways”, where customers give up and shop elsewhere.According to Mr Davidson, there is also a renewed focus among retailers on the basics, such as stock availability. “If you don’t have that, it will really hurt you,” he says.But retailers are also investing selectively in information systems, in particular to help staff provide better customer service.Outside the grocery sector, retailers are also investing in systems to support returns – again, as part of a drive to improve the customer experience.Initiatives that reduce the “cost to serve” are also attracting attention, and IT is one of the main tools to reduce those costs, explains Danny Bagge, an associate director at IBM Global Services who focuses on the retail sector.In the medium term, however, retailers face different challenges. One, according to Mr Bagge, is that they have tended to deploy technology in silos, which are neither especially efficient, nor give management a full picture of the company’s operations.But IBM also expects retailers to start to dismantle at least some of the supply chains they have spent so much to create over the last decade. Concepts such as “open to buy” and “vendor-managed inventory” are starting to come back into vogue, as shops look to cut stock levels and reduce risk.“Retailers have these wonderful fixed supply chains, but they now need to be more agile,” Mr Bagge says.That might mean some retailers will be forced to write off significant investments in, at the very least, supply chain systems. It will be a bitter pill to swallow, but for some, there may be no choice.
492;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-04-29T22:53:39Z;ARM and Wolfson hit by consumer electronics slump;;The drop in consumer electronics sales has prompted a fall in revenue at UK chip groups Arm Holdings and Wolfson Microelectronics.However, both companies showed more resilience than investors expected, thanks to the inclusion of their technology in smartphones, a market segment that is holding up well.Cambridge-based Arm, whose chip designs are used in about 98 per cent of the world’s mobile phones, reported a 10 per cent fall in revenue to $120.9m in the three months to April.Meanwhile, Edinburgh-based Wolfson, which provides audio chips used in products such as Apple’s iPhone, saw sales tumble 46 per cent to $25.2m in the first quarter. Both companies have been victims of falling consumer demand and rapid de-stocking by retailers, which has resulted in a overall 30 per cent decline for the industry.Mike Hickey, chief executive of Wolfson, said: “Before Christmas the market ground to a halt and people stopped ordering things. Since Christmas we have seen that normalising, albeit at a reduced level.”Both companies said they were unsure whether demand was picking up.Warren East, Arm chief executive, said: “The de-stocking has gone through and electronics companies are ordering chips again, but there is uncertainty about the level of end-consumer demand.”Smartphones, however, have been the one bright side to an otherwise gloomy market. Wolfson saw revenue from smartphones increase 25 per cent to $11.9m in the first quarter, benefiting from its inclusion in the iPhone and products from Samsung and LG.While global handset sales declined 5 per cent in the last quarter of 2008, sales of smartphones grew 3.7 per cent, according to Gartner, the analyst company. Apple sold more than 11m iPhones in 2008 and mobile phone operators have also been keen to promote and subsidise rival devices.Arm’s pre-tax profits rose 9 per cent to £13.1m, in spite of sterling weakness making its US payroll – about 50 per cent of costs – more expensive. Earnings per share were 0.77p, up from 0.50p in the year-ago quarter.Wolfson fell into a $4.7m pre-tax loss, compared with a $3.1m profit in the same quarter last year. Losses per share were 2.9 cents, compared with earnings of 1.9 cents last time.Wolfson shares on Wednesday rose 13½p to 125p, while Arm shares nudged up 1.32p to 116p.
493;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-04-29T17:30:51Z;Acer aims to topple HP in notebook sales;;Acer vowed to overtake Hewlett-Packard as the top seller of notebook computers, before the end of next year on the back of a range of affordable, ultra-light models.The Taiwanese company has moved into lower-cost products, such as the netbook, which helped it reach a near equal share of broader PC sales with Dell, the world number two.Acer has exploited consumers’ changes in spending habits during the economic downturn, but its market share gains came at the cost of a one-third drop in first-quarter net profits from the same quarter last year to T$2bn (US$60m).T. Wang, chairman, said the shift to cheaper products was inevitable given the global economic crisis, saying: “Under the financial crisis, if you sell at high prices, no one will want to buy.“Some people say Acer is the company that is driving prices down. I don't agree. Our competitors consider [netbooks] junk, but consumers want to buy junk. That’s really ironic.”Gianfranco Lanci, chief executive, expects Acer to sell 10m to 12m netbooks this year, more than double last year’s sales.This would help Acer overtake HP in the global notebook market next year, a year ahead of Acer’s previous forecast, Mr Lanci said on Wednesday. “As for the total PC market, we don’t think that’s our main focus,” he said.Acer moved within 0.1 percentage points of Dell in the broader PC market, with a share of 12.8 per cent by the end of March, according to research firm Gartner.Acer shook up the PC market this month with a range of ultra-thin laptops with long battery life at half the price charged by its competitors. These products, which use an energy-saving Intel processor, will begin shipping this month and will help halt the trend of falling prices for Acer products, Mr Wang said.The Timeline series “is going to set a new standard. Our competitors will come but . . . they will take six to nine months” to replicate the technology used in the computers, Mr Wang said.Acer’s announcement comes as other computer makers in Taiwan also suggested that the worst of the downturn had passed.Compal and Quanta, the two biggest contract manufacturers of notebook computers in the world and suppliers to brands such as Acer and HP, both reported first-quarter results on Wednesday that beat analysts’ expectations.Quanta said it expected shipments in the second quarter to increase by 10 per cent from the previous three months.Acer's Mr Lanci said “revenue and profitability will be slightly better in Q2 than in Q1”.In spite of the growing optimism about business conditions, Mr Lanci said the PC market was likely to see still further consolidation. “We still see too many players in the market,” he said.
494;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-04-28T23:31:08Z;Concern for Sun as sales fall 20% this year;;Sun Microsystems’ sales slumped by 20 per cent in the opening months of this year as the embattled computer systems company saw growth largely evaporate even for its most promising new products.The news came a week after Sun agreed a $7.4bn acquisition by Oracle and pointed to a further deterioration in the company’s market position amid the steep cyclical downturn.It is likely to give customers even more reason to pull back from further purchases while they wait to see whether Oracle will continue to support all of its products, according to analysts.“They aren’t firing on any cylinders at all,” said George Weiss, an analyst at Gartner, adding that Sun’s customer base was now vulnerable to being picked off by stronger rivals like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Dell.“They’re going to have to convince the marketplace that Sun products are still viable,” he said.Meanwhile, IBM responded to the collapse of its own takeover offer for Sun this month with an announcement that it would return more cash to its shareholders instead in the form of a higher dividend and increased stock buy-back plan.News of the 10 per cent dividend increase, to 55 cents a share, and extra $3bn devoted to buy-backs lifted IBM’s shares by 2 per cent on what was generally a weak day for tech stocks.The announcement continues a well-trodden path by Big Blue of paying out a large part of its cash holdings rather than amassing a big war chest for acquisitions.Breaking with normal practice, Sun on Tuesday called off its regular conference call with Wall Street to discuss its earnings, adding further to the uncertainty surrounding the future of its core hardware business as the Oracle acquisition looms.Oracle has pinned its motivation for the acquisition squarely on Sun’s software, raising doubts about its long-term backing for Sun’s servers based on its Sparc processors, as well as other products.On Tuesday, Sun reported that hardware sales had dropped by 26 per cent in the three months to the end of March, to $1.1bn, with the biggest dent suffered by its mature Sparc enterprise server business.However, the company’s smaller, more promising hardware businesses also suffered reversals, with sales of its X64 servers down 22 per cent and sales of its promising “Niagara” line of servers rising 3 per cent.Overall, Sun’s revenues fell to $2.6bn, below Wall Street expectations. Its net loss grew to $201m, or 27 cents a share, from 4 cents a share a year before.
495;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-04-23T20:42:21Z;Oracle faces culture shock in Sun’s open-source world;;Larry Ellison is a famously activist exponent of competitive strategy. An avowed student of Sun Tzu’s Art of War, the Oracle chief executive has long followed an approach that sets Oracle’s interests against those of its main rivals, with Microsoft, IBM and SAP cast as the enemy.With the acquisition of Sun Microsystems, however, he is about to walk on to new terrain where some of the methods that defined Oracle’s traditional approach to strategy no longer apply.Sun’s main software assets – and the jewels for which Mr Ellison said this week that he had agreed to pay $7.4bn for the company – are all closely tied to the open source world: the Java programming language and development tools, which are partly open source, as well as the Solaris operating system and MySQL database.That makes them unlike the roughly 200 software properties that Mr Ellison has acquired in the past. They are made freely available, and rely partly on the efforts of a wider group of developers to extend and support them. Their future success, in fact, relies on a technology community that stretches well beyond Oracle – and includes companies such as IBM, which also relies on Java as a core technology.“Obviously Oracle is going to have to be a lot less heavy handed,” says Kenneth Chin, an analyst at Gartner. “They’ve acquired a lot of open-source assets, and they need to keep the communities involved.”So far, Oracle has had little to say about how it will manage this balancing act. That has left the open source world trying to second guess what Mr Ellison will do next.The focus has shifted in particular to how he will seek to make money from software properties that Sun itself so glaringly failed to “monetise” in the past, and whether his real intention is even to subvert some of the assets he is acquiring to protect Oracle’s existing business model.The future of MySQL – an open source database bought by Sun last year, which has come to be seen as a long-term threat to Oracle’s own core database software business – has become the most immediate source of concern.Marten Mickos, the former chief executive of MySQL, admits that Oracle’s acquisition of an upstart rival has sent a chill through the open-source community, and he likens it to Goliath vanquishing David. However, he also claims that it will still be in Mr Ellison’s own interests to maintain the software: “I think MySQL is cannibalising Oracle anyway,” so Oracle might as well benefit from that process directly, he says.Most observers do not expect the hard-headed Mr Ellison to see it this way. Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust expert, says there is a chance that anti-trust authorities will force him to divest MySQL, but adds: “I think he wins any way you cut it. If he keeps it, he kills it: if he spins it off, who wants it without the top developers anymore?”There are some potential limits. Mitch Kapor, a leading figure in the open-source world, points out that MySQL has a life beyond Oracle’s control: the software has already been “forked”, meaning alternative open-source versions have been created that are outside Oracle’s control.However, stripped of the sponsorship of a big company willing to supply the core group of developers to push the project forward, MySQL could lose momentum as a significant rival to Oracle.Mr Ellison’s intentions for Java have also become the centre of considerable speculation. Created by Sun as a way to counter the growing influence of Microsoft, Java’s power comes from its adoption by a wide group of companies, including IBM. If Oracle upsets this ecosystem it would undermine the value of Java – something people close to the company have been at pains to stress.Yet maintaining Java’s openness, while at the same time directing its future development, will be a delicate balancing act, requiring the exercise of what Bill Whyman, an analyst at ISI, calls “soft power” – not Mr Ellison’s strength.“We always wanted Java’s evolution to be participatory, but fully open would compromise compatibility,” says Bill Joy, the Sun co-founder and former chief scientist. “I believe Oracle shares these values, so am not concerned.”More directly, Oracle has made clear that it plans to make money from Java in a way that Sun failed to do – another source of potential conflict with the rest of the technology world. Besides simply raising the licensing fee, Oracle could try to levy a small fee on every application that runs on Java, according to Gartner – a move that would have particular implications for the mobile world, given that Java is shipped on virtually all mobile phones.
496;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-04-21T15:31:01Z;Cost-cutting and complex IT raise risk of disruption;;Agrowing crisis is threatening ever more businesses, as figures show that last year, 40 per cent of UK organisations faced business disruption as a result of an IT failure.Worryingly, research carried out by the UK government’s cabinet office and the Chartered Management Institute shows the dangers are increasing significantly: in 2002, just 19 per cent of organisations faced similar problems.The UK is just one example of this trend: throughout advanced economies, the number of IT-related interruptions has grown steadily.But the current economic environment is affecting organisations’ business continuity plans in different ways. Some companies, for example, have increased spending on resilience, as any disruption might mean a permanent loss of profits.“IT managers are being forced by the business to ensure that resilience is built into projects. If a system is coming in, it will be classified as critical and will require high availability,” says Bill Broadley, principal consultant at business and technology consultancy Morse. “Most IT providers and IT organisations in banks will have resilience high on the agenda . . . IT directors are being told that they cannot afford any downtime.”But other organisations have actually cut business continuity spending, along with other areas that might lead to disruption, such as IT security, or systems maintenance.Added to this, continuity plans designed and tested in more buoyant times could now be harder to implement, because key staff have left. Job cuts mean there are not enough people available to maintain all business processes after an incident, and not just in IT.“There may well be a higher likelihood of something going wrong and the impact of an outage may be more damaging, because organisations no longer have the right people in place,” cautions Roberta Witty, research vice-president at industry analyst Gartner. “An outage could have a bigger impact [now] than even last summer.”Another factor is that some organisations let investment in continuity fall, even before the economic downturn. In others, spending on resilience has not kept pace with the increasing complexity of IT systems.“In some respects, we have gone backwards when it comes to business continuity,” says Rick Cudworth, head of business continuity and resilience at Deloitte, the professional services firm. “It is partially due to under-investment and partially the increased complexity of IT. Many organisations are not in as good a position [to recover from an incident] as they were five or 10 years ago.”Some IT systems are now so complex that chief information officers responsible for them doubt that they could recover in time from a total loss – such as the destruction of a building or datacentre – to save the business, even if the data itself were fully protected off site. Large banks and government organisations have fully replicated systems, but elsewhere the emphasis has moved from recovery to avoiding failures in the first place.“IT is massively more complex. We have more servers, and more applications that are classed as ‘tier one’,” says Richard McGrail, head of IT at Baillie Gifford, an investment firm based in Edinburgh, Scotland.“The reason we provide replication and incremental back-ups is in case something happens to our building. But the secondary issue is that the safety net is now so complex, it can cause the very problems we are seeking to avoid.”As a result, organisations such as Baillie Gifford deploy what Gartner calls a “layered approach” to business continuity and resilience. The firm uses both a business continuity facility, provided by vendor Sungard, and a Citrix remote environment that allows its investment professionals to work from home.In addition, critical information feeds are located through a “neutral” venue so they can supply data to staff at either the main office or the continuity site.The company’s plan is based around preventing outages and a disruption to trading, Mr McGrail says. “It is about reputational damage, but the biggest fear for us would be if we lost trading data . . . reproducing those sequenced trades would be an operational nightmare. It would distract the company terribly, and that would expose us to even greater risks, as people would effectively be trying to do two jobs.”But it is not just the complexity of IT systems, but their importance to the business, that should be forcing boards to look again at how they protect their key systems. In environments where reverting to manual back-ups is hardly an option, business continuity is giving way to the notion of business resilience.Organisations need to be built to withstand shocks and disruption, and IT systems should reflect this. If budgets are tight, companies might face the stark choice of either building a resilient system, or having a well-resourced and tested continuity and recovery plan.“You need both, but if I had to make the choice I would rather have resilience,” says Paul Kirvan, a US-based business continuity expert and a board member of the Business Continuity Institute. “It is very difficult to get people to make and test a business continuity plan. It is less difficult to build resilience into the hardware, software and network. If I had $500,000 to invest in IT infrastructure, one area I would be looking to improve is the resilience and survivability of some of my key assets.”Business continuity experts stress that prevention is better than cure, as even the best plans can be overtaken by events. More importantly, any recovery plan takes time to implement. That is time when the business will not be able to trade, and will lose revenues.“Even if you can recover successfully, there is always an impact,” says Stuart Anderson, a business continuity expert at PA Consulting. “We are now talking about business resilience and building in that resilience, rather than business continuity planning, or planning to fail. That has had its day.”Instead, companies should be looking at whether their operations can be split or dispersed, and how workloads can be spread between sites, both during day-to-day business or during an emergency.Although companies looking to save costs might be tempted to reduce their number of operational sites, Mr Anderson points out that public sector organisations are increasingly looking at dispersal as a way to “harden” their operations and services against disruption. “The technology is there, but cultural and business change is also needed if you want to make the organisation more resilient,” he cautions. “It is not just an IT issue.”To cope with this, organisations need to have plans that will allow for a staged “invocation” of the continuity plan.A degradation matrix will set out which services need to be recovered and which can be allowed to deteriorate, or even fail.During a short-term outage, such as bad weather, home working might be an option for some employees. But longer-term disruption would need more comprehensive measures, such as the move to a back-up site. For more disruptive incidents, factors ranging from morale to the availability of public transport, catering and even janitorial services will all need to be part of the plan, according to Mr Anderson.“Businesses are planning for more, not less, uncertainty,” he says. “Unexpected events are likely to increase, so it is also about the resilience of your brand, your marketplace and ultimately, the resilience of your investors.”
497;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-04-15T04:18:12Z;Hackers escalate thefts of financial data;;Computer hackers stole more sensitive records last year than in the previous four combined, with ATM cards and PIN information growing in popularity as targets, according to a study released on Tuesday.Organised criminal groups orchestrated nine in 10 of the most successful attacks, with 93 per cent of the 285m records exposed coming from the financial sector.Cybercriminals are boosting their investment on research and development, experts said, allowing them to take advantage as more people perform banking and other sensitive tasks online.The analysis by Verizon of 90 of the worst breaches also showed information technology managers’ mistakes did far more damage than careless behaviour by rank and file employees who might lose a laptop or surf to an unsafe website.“Companies tend to spend twice as much money on security aspects that have to do with end-users, but losses are 10,000 to 1 in the other direction in terms of records lost,” said Peter Tippett, vice-president at Verizon Business Security Solutions.When companies do spend to secure central databases, Mr Tippett said, they tend to focus too narrowly. Instead of testing their main repositories of sensitive material for vulnerability, as is common practice, managers would do better to conduct modest tests of everything connected to those repositories.In a typical assault, a hacker uses default credentials or an improperly configured database to enter a corporate system, then install software to record keystrokes or allow future access.Two other studies released on Tuesday show that even if consumers and low-level employees are not responsible for such giant breaches as those at TJX and RBS WorldPay, they too are being targeted more effectively.Gartner reported that 5m US consumers lost money to “phishing” attacks in the 12 months through September, up 40 per cent from the previous year. The percentage of funds recovered by victims, meanwhile, dropped from 80 per cent in 2005 to 56 per cent in the most recent period.Symantec, the largest security software provider, found that attacks on end users from web pages are the most popular means of intrusion, especially via legitimate sites that have been temporarily corrupted.Experts found more new security holes in the Firefox web browser than in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, and Apple took the longest time to fix new vulnerabilities in its Safari browser.
498;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-03-26T21:41:08Z;Red Hat lifted by increased free use of Linux;;The economic downturn is punishing the technology industry as much as many other sectors, but it is already proving a boon for companies distributing and servicing free open-source software.Red Hat, the top commercial company devoted to the free operating system Linux, this week said revenue for the quarter ended February 28 had jumped 18 per cent to $166m.Red Hat’s shares surged 17.33 per cent to $17.60, their highest since September, by close of trading on Thursday.In its most recent quarter, Linux-related sales at Novell, Red Hat’s best-known competitor, rose 24 per cent.“The potential market for open source is clearly opening up because of the economy,” said Mark Driver, analyst at Gartner. “If I’m a typical IT manager right now, I have to either cut costs or lay off five or 10 employees, so I want to cut costs.”About half of the technology managers at companies that already use Linux said financial worries were prompting them to speed up their adoption of what is now the second most-important platform for servers, after Microsoft’s Windows, market researcher IDC reported recently. Open-source projects, which benefit from the constant tinkering of thousands of volunteers, are also gathering steam from some of the hottest technology trends coinciding with the recession.Social networks and so-called cloud computing – in which big companies or their suppliers store documents and crunch numbers at remote data centres before delivering results – are based largely on open-source programs.Dell, which sells servers and PCs loaded with a choice of Windows or Linux variants, said Windows was still getting picked 80 per cent of the time.“But I see a lot more tyre-kicking” by corporate customers weighing open-source, said Steve Schuckenbrock, who heads the Dell division responsible for selling to large companies.Larger deployments of open-source to firms that already run the technology in a small way might be the most that happens, due to the fact that recessions make IT managers worry about risk. For the same reasons, a recession is not the time to switch a workforce to a new technology.Microsoft is counting on that, while accepting that every leading company will soon be running at least some open-source software.“It’s a heterogeneous world,” said Microsoft’s Sam Ramji. While Microsoft continues to warn about the legal and economic perils of relying on Linux and similar systems, Mr Ramji’s role is to make sure that open-source programs already in use can work in conjunction with Microsoft software.That way, just because a company is using the MySQL open-source database, it will not feel compelled to put it on top of the Linux operating system. By some measures, that defence is working well – Mr Ramji said 56 per cent of MySQL instances were running on Windows.Then again, the easier Mr Ramji makes it for IT buyers to economise by putting open-source in more places, the more they will do just that and undermine his business in the longer-term.
499;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-03-25T11:00:36Z;Nokia sends $70m mobile payment to Obopay;;There are signs the mobile payments market is really taking off at last with Nokia announcing a substantial investment in service provider Obopay today.The amount, understood to be in the region of $70m, is being put in by Nokia itself rather than its venture arm and gives it a minority stake in the Silicon Valley company.Obopay operates in the US and India. It allows those signing up for its service to fund their account with cash or by linking up their credit card or current account. They can then send money to any text-message enabled cell phone. The receiver can either sign up for an Obopay account or have the money transferred directly to their bank account.Obopay charges 25 cents to send any amount up to $1,000 and nothing to receive it.The company says it will use the cash injection to extend its product suite and enhance its global presence. Teppo Paavola, head of corporate business development at Nokia, is joining Obopay’s board.Carol Realini, Obopay chief executive, quoted me Gartner figures predicting just 6m users of mobile payments worldwide in 2009, but the number exploding to 100m by 2011.She thinks this rate of growth is possible:“You have places like India – when we started doing business there about two years ago there were 100m phones in the country, but by the middle of next year there will be 500m phones,” she said.“Traditional banking and payment services don’t work that well there and you have the mobile network and these solutons emerging, so it’s expected to drive growth in those markets.”Gerhard Romen, head of NFC market development at Nokia (NFC is the Near Field Communication contactless payments technology) , says phones have become easier to use over the past five years for payments.“Security has got better, display capabilities and storage has improved as have the networks. The market is picking up speed and there are new entrants, so we have an interesting time ahead of us,” he said.Other major companies looking at cashing in on mobile payments include Vodafone, which struck a deal with Western Union in December, and eBay’s Paypal, which joined the GlobalPlatform standards body this month.
500;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-03-23T10:46:59Z;Location, location, location: the future for mobile operators?;;During times of economic turbulence companies must do what they can to maximise their resources in order to survive the downturn.This challenge is being faced by mobile operators in particular who must seek new revenue from existing resources.As legislation seeks to curb the charges operators can charge customers, traditional revenue streams are being strained. Europe’s big mobile network operators are now lobbying the European Commission for a delay to new regulations on setting mobile termination rates [the charges one operator makes of another operator when calls go from one network to another].According to the commission, average mobile termination rates are currently nine times higher than fixed termination rates. The new regulations could lead to a reduction in mobile termination rates of up to 70 per cent within a few years. It is therefore vital that alternate revenue streams are realised soon. Could location-based services be the answer?These services use knowledge about where a device is located using several technologies, most typically the Global Positioning System (GPS) which now comes as standard for most wireless enabled devices.It is anticipated that location will be a key asset for wireless operators in establishing their place in the mobile ecosystem, enabling value added services that could attract new customers as well as reduce churn and thereby increase the average revenue per user (Arpu).The proliferation of hand-held and travel devices with in-built GPS now available means there is a sizeable market and analysts seem confident there will be a growing appetite for them.A report by Gartner last year estimated the number of subscribers toLBS would reach nearly 300m and revenue from them would top $8bn in 2011. An even more optimistic report by ABI Research suggests worldwide mobile LBS revenues will reach $13.3bn by 2012.Yet the issue for operators and their partners is how to make them profitable.Location is expected to be key in two areas: advertising and social networking.Mobile advertising can make use of knowing where a user is. Location-based technology will play an important role in behavioural targeting – that is, enabling businesses to identify interested users on the basis of information they reveal on their social networks.Advertising would then be of increased relevance to the end user within their vicinity. For example, a potential customer might be more likely to use a discount voucher sent to them by text if they receive it while walking by the store in question.With retailers struggling, services that allow the user to opt in and receive information about special offers and promotions could help retailers improve in-store traffic and invigorate consumer spending.In social networking, location is an integral part of the mobile roadmap. The Netherlands, which leads Europe in adoption of mobile technologies, is already addressing the growing interest among consumers for LBS.Hyves, the Netherlands’ primary social network, boasts around 50 per cent market penetration in the country, or 8m members. It found that users typically updated their status four times a day via mobile handsets compared to twice a day via computer.The community created a “Buddy Finder”, a location database which enables mobile users to find fellow members of the social community on a map, similar to Google’s new Latitude service, through a combination of GPS, cell ID and Bluetooth, accurate to within 400 metres.Eventually, Hyves will offer the application across all platforms, including iphone, Java and Android. The popularity of this opt-in service is expected to lay the foundations for similar services in the near future from other social networks and communities.KPN, the leading Dutch operator, is already investing in similar technology to create its own social network.One of the barriers to the adoption of LBS has been concerns about privacy. It is essential therefore that services are strictly on an opt-in basis. This will be vital to win trust and ensure the services are efficiently executed.It remains to be seen how operators will make these services profitable. Selling the services to retailers and communities is an option. The “app store” model, made popular by Apple and replicated by other players in the telecoms field, is another.This is quickly dividing into free applications and those that are considered premium and must be purchased. As a model in its early stages there is still a lot of potential to develop premium applications and services that, while not based exclusively on location, certainly leverage that capability. This is evident at present with a number of top-selling iPhone apps.Yankee Group, the analyst house, predicts that the next three years will see location-based services becoming mainstream and with high profile events such as the London Olympic Games in 2012 taking place in this time frame there will be plenty of opportunity to test these services on a large scale.
501;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-03-20T18:44:23Z;Sony Ericsson;;"Mobile phone makers have taken such a beating lately that investors should be numb to bad news. They are not, and the latest warning from Sony Ericsson was grim enough to spark a sector rout. The world’s fourth-biggest handset maker by sales said it expected to ship just 14m phones in the first quarter – down 37 per cent from the year before. Shares in Ericsson, which owns 50 per cent of the company, plunged almost 9 per cent. Finnish rival Nokia fell more than 6 per cent. Suppliers suffered too. Infineon, one of the world’s biggest makers of the chips used in mobile phones, at one point fell more than 13 per cent.Handset makers were under pressure well before the recession bit consumers. After all, everybody’s got a phone now. And as long as the old phone keeps working, most people have little reason to buy a new one – especially now that the credit crunch is squeezing household budgets. In this sense, mobile phones are a bit like cars.Like carmakers, most mobile handset makers don’t sell directly to consumers. They sell to dealers – distributors such as Brightpoint, for example, or retailers such as Best Buy and Carphone Warehouse. Resellers typically carry inventory equivalent to six-eight weeks of mobile phone sales in stockrooms, to ensure a steady supply. But now, just as many auto dealers have stopped new factory orders to concentrate on selling the cars sitting on their lots, phone sellers are slashing inventories to reduce carrying costs. Handset makers sold 297.3m handsets to resellers in the fourth quarter, according to Gartner, a research group. But resellers sold 314m phones to consumers. The difference – some 17m phones – came straight out of their inventory.Gartner reckons this destocking will continue until the second half. Yet once it stops, in another parallel with the auto industry, demand will remain weak due to excess capacity. Investors should brace for more disappointment.Sony Ericsson sparked a rout in shares of mobile handset makers and their suppliers on Friday after it warned about plunging sales and a bigger than expected quarterly loss.Shares in the world’s third-biggest handset maker fell more than 8 per cent, while shares in archrival Nokia fell more than 5 per cent.Sony Ericsson and other handset makers, already struggling against a longer-term trend of slumping sales, have been hit hard by the recession, as fearful consumers delay new purchases and phone retailers cut inventories.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

502;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-03-16T19:30:58Z;Cisco plans to cross over to server market;;"Cisco Systems, the networking company, on Monday announced a move into the server market, posing a threat to IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Sun.John Chambers, Cisco chief executive, said Cisco’s “unified computing system” would provide the next-generation platform for data centres, the vast computing areas that store corporate data. Cisco is offering an all-in-one box that combines its networking strengths, the latest computer processors from Intel and access to
storage networks.It is also co-operating with VMware to include money-saving virtualisation techniques that can divide servers into different virtual machines to complete tasks.“No other company in the market can do what Cisco is doing. The gap between this and the rest of the market is measured in years,” said Bob Beauchamp, chief executive of BMC Software, another Cisco partner.An IBM executive had described earlier talk by Cisco of a move into servers as “crossing…the demilitarised zone between networking and data centres”.But Tim Stammers, analyst with the Ovum consulting firm, said IBM and HP were already challenging Cisco on its networking territory, with HP’s Procurve switches and IBM’s co-operation with Cisco’s smaller rival Juniper.Analysts say Cisco is entering a lower margin, more commoditised market, but would be able to charge more for its combination product.Server sales are also experiencing sharp falls in the economic downturn.Gartner, the research firm, reported this month that server shipments declined by 12 per cent and revenues by 15 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared to the previous year.IBM had a 33 per cent market share, followed by HP with 30 per cent, Dell with 11 per cent and Sun on 10 per cent.Cisco can point to growth in the “blade” server segment of the market that will be part of its offering. Blade servers are thin computers that slide into a chassis which can contain multiple units, packing capacity into a compact space.Rob Lloyd, Cisco’s executive vice-president designate of worldwide operations, said the emphasis on virtualisation, where tasks can be consolidated on fewer
servers, would also appeal to companies seeking efficiency savings.Rick Becker, vice-president Software and Solutions at Dell, questioned whether companies would want to buy an all-in-one product.“Chief information officers aren’t looking for proprietary point products because they drive up total cost of ownership and create more complexity,” he said.Additional reporting by Maija Palmer in London"
503;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-03-13T15:33:08Z;Using mobility to combat recession;;Companies’ reliance on technologies that can produce cost savings is greater than ever, yet corporate IT budgets are being cut, leaving IT managers searching for products that will add value and achieve good returns on investment.It means more businesses are exploring the advantages of mobilising their workforce.In years past, the use of mobile enterprise applications tended to be limited to industries such as manufacturing, energy and finance, where companies relied on them as an essential component of day-to-day business operations.But across all sectors, mobility tools can allow field workers to complete tasks as they happen, instead of having to find a place to connect a laptop, disrupt a colleague, or return to the office.As this realisation has grown, the market for mobile business applications has gone from strength to strength, fuelled by significant advances in smartphone technology, as well as continued reductions in the cost of mobile data services.According to Gartner*, the enterprise mobility market is set to grow dramatically over the next few years, maturing into an integral part of overall IT strategy.Implementing an enterprise mobility strategy offers immediate, quantifiable advantages – savings on time and cost, streamlined processes, and improved overall business agility.Companies can increase their productivity by reducing the gulf between field workers and their office-based colleagues, giving mobile workers real-time access to information wherever they are with web-based mobile applications that are actually designed to be as intuitive as possible – even mimicking workers’ existing paper-based processes.By automating these business processes, organisations cut out the reliance on time-consuming paperwork, enabling staff to achieve more while out of the office, while also minimising the risk of human-error. For instance, by using mobile applications field workers are able to perform processes such as invoicing, ordering stock and sending/receiving job updates or cancellations electronically, as opposed to the manual methods previously adopted.As well as lowering costs and increasing profits through improved productivity, the use of mobile applications can also assist administrative and financial procedures. Field workers can accurately track travel time and expenses, while accelerating payment cycles thanks to faster billing processes, by automatically delivering this information via their mobile devices. In the current economic climate, keeping on top of customer billing and payments can be valuable.From a management perspective, mobile applications also provide far greater insight into the status of current and outstanding tasks – managers can dynamically route their field workers to new jobs, based on location and importance, the experience or skill set of the worker, and the inventory or parts they may have with them.These updates can be rolled out on a group or individual basis, cutting out the need for a succession of phone calls, or the reliance on a pre-arranged schedule, highly susceptible to change.Although IT departments have long recognised the potential benefits of enterprise mobility, those at board level have not always been so enthusiastic, citing IT and staff upheaval, storage concerns and inflated prices as drawbacks.Furthermore, uptake has been limited by the reluctance of mobile carriers to move into the mobility market, as traditionally, carriers offering business applications have been required to store their customers’ data themselves – substantially raising their IT network infrastructure costs.Thankfully technology has moved on and, using advanced mobility platforms, carriers can now deliver business data to customers’ mobile devices without physically removing it from each customer’s IT system. With these carrier-hosted mobility services now a viable option for businesses, it is clear that enterprise-wide mobility deployments no longer have to be time consuming and laborious.Of course, deploying their own on-premises mobility platform remains an option for companies. However, it is often fundamentally easier for some organisations – SMEs, those with limited IT resources, or even large businesses with an immediate mobility need – to forgo the hassle of day-to-day management and maintenance, as well as the upfront hardware expenditure, by taking the carrier route.By exploring the possibilities offered by reliable mobility solutions, there is an opportunity to prosper during these tough economic times. Providing that companies take into account specific employee requirements and equip field workers with intuitive and easy-to-use business tools, there is real potential to advance in both productivity and profitability, enabling companies to stay one step ahead of the competition and take customer satisfaction to new levels.*Gartner predicts 2009: Mobile and wireless continue to mature – Ken Dulaney, Tole J. Hart, Nick Jones and Monica Basso – 05 December 2008.
504;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-03-12T11:33:56Z;MTN expects buying opportunity in Africa;;MTN, Africa’s biggest mobile telephone operator, almost doubled its number of subscribers last year to 90.7m and has amassed cash as it anticipates a wave of consolidation in the telecoms sector on the continent.Analysts have been eager to discover how the Johannesburg-based company, one of the success stories of post-apartheid South Africa, plans to continue the stellar growth which it has delivered by entering big but potentially difficult emerging markets in recent years.Unveiling a 44 per cent rise in profit after tax to R17.1bn ($1.7bn) for the 12 months to December compared with the previous year, Phuthuma Nhleko, chief executive, said the group was eyeing opportunities in Africa and further afield but that it would also ratchet up capital expenditure on its existing network. Last year’s revenue rose by 40 per cent to R102bn, broadly in line with its own forecasts.MTN reduced its gearing – the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – from 0.5 to 0.3 and has R27bn in cash, R10bn more than a year earlier.“This is a business that operates on economies of scale,” Mr Nhleko told a results presentation on Thursday. “That leads to us continuing finding ways of consolidation in the region where we operate and also on a global scale.”He added: “Given the number of new players that are now coming to the market there has to be some sort of consolidation.”While Africa is often regarded as virgin territory for communications companies, many countries on the continent already have crowded telephony markets. Analysis by Gartner, the industry consultancy, suggests that all but the first two entrants in each market struggle to secure more than a 10 per cent share.Mr Nhleko said he would like to increase MTN’s North African presence. Like his rivals – primarily South Africa’s state-owned Telkom, Vodacom, a subsidiary of the UK’s Vodafone, and Zain of Kuwait – he coveted lucrative licenses in Angola and Ethiopia, he added.The chief executive also said he would be keen to establish a foothold in southeast Asia, following the collapse of talks on tie-ups with Indian giants Bharti Airtel and Reliance last year.Half of MTN’s revenue last year came from operations in west and central Africa. Its largest market is Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, where MTN subscribers increased by 40 per cent to 23m and where its market share went up by one percentage point to 44 per cent.The group hopes to add another 22.6m subscribers this year. That would represent a 25 per cent growth – significantly slower than last year’s – and would raise the pressure on Mr Nhleko to break into new markets and win battles for market share.The shares rose 1.1 per cent to R92.50 following the announcement.
505;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-03-09T17:20:37Z;Satyam kicks off auction for 51% stake;;India’s Satyam Computer Services has launched an auction for a 51 per cent stake in the scandal-hit company.The sale will test international appetite for India’s outsourcing industry.The country’s fourth-largest information technology services company invited prospective bidders to register their interest by Thursday, and set conditions, including proof that they would have access to minimum funds of $290m.“There are a whole slew of companies in Europe that missed out on the offshore paradigm and have been in furious catch-up mode,” said Partha Iyengar, India head of research at Gartner.“For them, Satyam could be a leg-up if they are able to handle the not-insignificant challenge of integration.”Satyam would once have been considered a desirable acquisition for foreign strategic investors because of its leading position in one of India’s fastest-growing and most internationally important industries.But the company’s true worth is unclear after its former chairman, B. Ramalinga Raju, confessed in January to fixing the accounts, including inventing a cash balance of $1bn in what is considered India’s biggest corporate scam.Satyam’s new government-appointed board has yet to reveal the true financial condition of the company, saying it will take weeks for the group’s new auditors, KPMG and Deloitte, to complete a restatement of its accounts.Satyam said on Monday that it would issue new equity of 31 per cent to the selected bidder.Under Indian regulations, the acquirer would then be obliged to make an open offer to the public for a further 20 per cent of the enlarged company.In spite of the uncertainty over the company, which is also facing investor lawsuits in the US, a number of prospective suitors have expressed interest.The suitors include Indian engineering and construction firm Larsen & Toubro, which is already Satyam’s largest single shareholder with a 12 per cent stake, India’s Spice and Hinduja groups and software firms HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra.Few foreign companies have yet openly shown an interest. But analysts believe Satyam might be a good fit for large European IT consultancies that have yet to build a convincing outsourcing presence in India.Satyam’s new board of directors has said in the past that it is looking at a valuation of $1bn for the IT firm.SP Tulsian, an independent equity analyst in Mumbai, pointed to Satyam’s reported sales of $2.1bn in the year ended March 31, 2008. Allowing for a heavy discount to account for the scam, a valuation of $1bn could be reasonable.
506;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-03-06T14:53:49Z;Regulator approves Satyam sale;;Shares in fraud-hit Satyam Computer Services jumped nearly 20 per cent on Friday after the market regulator approved the board’s request to sell a majority stake.The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s decision will enable the sale of Satyam, which is at the centre of a $1bn fraud probe. However, several suitors said they needed greater clarity on the bidding process before making an offer.The chairman of Spice Group, an Indian conglomerate, said his company was ready to make a bid for 51 per cent of the IT outsourcer.Indian engineering group Larsen & Toubro, which hired Citigroup to advise them on a potential Satyam offer, said it had not decided whether to make an offer.IT Analysts said the regulator’s decision would be welcomed, although they stressed that, due to the probe, the IT outsourcer remained a risky buy.“Satyam is still a dodgy buy, but news from Sebi is positive as it will give a new management power to fully control the company …that will attract good potential buyers,” said Diptarup Chakraborti, a research analyst at Gartner.Satyam shares closed up 19.9 per cent at Rs42.10 on Friday, boosting the overall market value to about $550m, a fraction of the $7bn it was worth at its peak at the end of May last year.As part of a two-phase sale process of Satyam, the suitor would acquire newly issued equity shares to a maximum of 31 per cent in the IT outsourcer and then make a public offer to buy a minimum of 20 per cent more, as required by Indian law.If the investor fails to acquire 51 per cent even after the close of the open offer, it would be able to subscribe to additional equity shares, said Satyam.The government-nominated board also announced that bidders need to have more than $150m in net assets. The successful bidder will not be able to sell any shares for three years after the acquisition.Satyam’s board has appointed Goldman Sachs and Avendus, an Indian investment bank, to identify strategic investors.
507;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;America’s first CIO heading for a clash of technology cultures;;Vivek Kundra, just named the first US chief information officer, is going to have his work cut out.As profiled by The Washington Post, he sounds like a human whirlwind. At 34, and with less than two years as CTO of Washington DC, he’s clearly got ahead by shaking things up and asking the tough questions.He also has a feeling for how to use new technologies to make government work better. That includes turning to YouTube to help explain how contractors can apply to handle DC services, and proposing Facebook as a way to collect parking fines (though that hasn’t happened yet).But grappling with the monster of Federal technology would stretch the ingenuity of even the most energetic Young Turk.As the rather static new Whiteshouse.gov website proves, it’s very hard to apply the social media technologies used so effectively during the election campaign to the operation of government.Also, the big Federal agencies are circumscribed by all sorts of laws and regulations governing everything from how they maintain and protect their data to the very formalised processes they have to follow when hiring contractors.Still, Kundra seems to have the instincts of an iconoclast. And in the Obama White House, he clearly has a strong backer. The main issue, as Andrea Di Maio at Gartner says, will be to make an early and careful calculation of which battles he has a chance of winning, and not to get consumed by fighting the many-headed Hydra.
508;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-03-03T17:43:49Z;Motorola risks drop from handset top five;;Motorola, the troubled US mobile phone maker, could this year lose its status as one of the world’s top five handset manufacturers, according to Gartner, the research firm.Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner, said that Motorola could be replaced as the world’s fifth largest handset maker in the fourth quarter of 2009 by Canada’s Research In Motion or ZTE of China.Gartner published research Tuesday showing that Motorola’s market share of mobile unit sales fell to 6.9 per cent in the fourth quarter last year from 11.9 per cent in the same period of 2007.The deteriorating performance meant Motorola was the fifth largest handset maker in the last three months of 2008.During the 1990s, Motorola was the largest handset maker, but its performance has slumped following a profit-draining expansion into emerging markets in 2006.Motorola looks likely to become a niche participant because it plans to focus on selling mid to high-priced mobiles in the US, Latin America and China.Ms Milanesi said there was a “strong possibility” that Motorola would no longer be one of top five handset manufacturers by the fourth quarter of 2009.She added that much would depend on Motorola’s plans to sell mobiles based on Google’s Android operating system.“Unless Motorola really gets Android right I don’t see how they can continue to stay in the top five,” Ms Milanesi said.The largest mobile makers, led by Finland’s Nokia, are braced for falling unit sales in 2009, which would be the first annual decline since 2001.The downturn is prompting consumers to replace their mobiles less often, both in developed and developing countries.Gartner is estimating that mobile unit sales will decline 4 per cent in 2009, with a return to single digit growth in 2010.Nokia retained its position as the largest handset maker in the fourth quarter of 2008, though its market share fell to 37.7 per cent from 40.4 per cent during the same period of 2007.Samsung and LG, both of South Korea, increased their share to 18.3 per cent and 8.9 per cent respectively.Samsung has piled on sales with its touchscreen mobiles offering access to the internet while LG is enjoying success in the US at the expense of Motorola.Sony Ericsson’s market share fell to 7.5 per cent, partly because it has significant sales in western Europe, where consumers started the trend of buying new mobiles less often.For 2008, Nokia retained its position as the largest handset maker, with a share of 38.6 per cent, followed by Samsung.Motorola was third, but its share of 8.7 per cent was only just ahead of LG and Sony Ericsson.
509;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-03-01T23:37:34Z;Rogue code led to Gmail shutdown;;A rogue piece of software, which triggered a cascading failure through Google’s data centres around the world, led to the shutdown of its Gmail system last week.The failure, during routine maintenance at one of the company’s European data centres, was an unforeseen side-effect of a software program that was written in-house, said Nelson Mattos, vice-president of engineering.“We’re not perfect, we make mistakes,” he said.But experts said that anticipating how software would behave in circumstances such as these was something that even corporate IT departments with far less engineering sophistication than Google were expected to master.“That’s just not acceptable,” said Matt Cain, an analyst at Gartner, the IT consultants. “It was poor thinking-through of a code change. In a corporate environment, you can’t just tell your CEO it was bad luck.”The glitch that led to the first global shutdown of Gmail since August began on Tuesday, during routine maintenance. Data were moved to a back-up centre while the work was being done.However, the relocation triggered a software program that is designed to direct data to the centre nearest to where users are based, a measure that improves the response time for online applications.As it unexpectedly set to work on the new mass of data, the code greatly increased the workload on the reserve data centre and triggered an overload, causing data to be pushed automatically into a third centre.That in turn led to another overload, eventually triggering a series of failures that toppled Google’s data centres like falling dominoes.Despite the high-profile problem, Mr Cain said the overall reliability of Gmail was still superior to the in-house e-mail systems that most companies run.
510;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-02-27T00:29:03Z;Yahoo finance chief departs in reshuffle;;Yahoo, the internet company beset by a raft of executive departures, on Thursday announced a new management structure under Carol Bartz, its recently appointed chief executive.The much-anticipated news came as Yahoo also revealed Blake Jorgensen, its chief financial officer, would be the latest member of top management to leave.Ms Bartz, who took over from Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang six weeks ago, took a similar approach of clearing out executives and reorganising at her previous company – software maker Autodesk. However, there had already been a heavy bleeding of executive talent from Yahoo under Mr Yang.In her first entry on the corporate blog, Ms Bartz explained the need for change: “There’s …plenty that has bogged this company down. For starters, you would be amazed at how complicated some things are here,” she said.“So today I’m rolling out a new management structure that I believe will make Yahoo a lot faster on its feet.”Yahoo’s “notorious silos” were gone, she said, without giving details. A Yahoo spokesperson later explained the company’s Tech and Products groups were being combined in a single Products division run by Ari Balogh, chief technology officer. Yahoo would also be organised under two regions – North America and International, compared to four in the past.Yahoo has often been criticised for slowness in its execution and taking decisions. Allen Weiner, analyst at the Gartner research firm, said the changes should mean a more efficient operation.“There will be people in mobile and product development who report directly to Carol whose butts will be on the line. The level of accountability is going to be significant,” Mr Weiner said.In a separate regulatory filing, Yahoo said Mr Jorgensen would be leaving the company and a search for a chief financial officer had been initiated.Mr Jorgensen joined Yahoo from Thomas Weisel Partners in June 2007 and was close to Sue Decker, Yahoo’s president.Ms Decker had been the top internal candidate for the chief executive job, but the company announced at the time of Ms Bartz’s appointment that she would be leaving Yahoo.Yahoo shares rose 50 cents or 4 per cent to close at $12.98 in New York on news of the reorganisation.www.ft.com/techblog
511;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-02-13T18:01:42Z;Microsoft to open chain of shops;;Microsoft on Thursday hired a former Wal-Mart executive to open a chain of shops, establishing another front with Apple in the battle for consumers.The move is an echo of a shift into retail by Apple this decade that has added to its sales, though analysts warned that it involved risks.“To open their own stores is a big about-face,” said Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner. Microsoft would “definitely incur some ill-will” from electronics that stocked its products, he added, though: “It’s not like the retailers can say, ‘We’re not going to carry your stuff any more.’”Efforts by other companies to establish a high street presence have often foundered because of a lack of experience, though Mr Baker said Microsoft’s decision to hire a retail expert should minimise the risk.The number of shops to be opened and the range of products they should carry would not be decided until later, Microsoft said.The hiring of David Porter, a Wal-Mart veteran who has spent the past two years at Dreamworks, is the latest sign of an upheaval in Microsoft’s senior ranks and organisation as it tries to break into more markets.Mr Porter will report to Kevin Turner, Microsoft’s operating chief and a former Wal-Mart executive. That puts him outside Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, which until now has managed its retail initiatives, such as a plan to create “stores within a store” inside electronics retailers.Microsoft said its aim was to create “better PC and Microsoft retail purchase experience for consumers worldwide through the development and opening of the company’s own retail stores”.In a statement, Mr Turner said the aim was to “transform the PC and Microsoft buying experience at retail by improving the articulation and demonstration of the Microsoft innovation and value proposition so that it’s clear, simple and straightforward for consumers everywhere”.The stores would be a showcase for products including the Windows 7 operating system, Windows Live internet services and Windows Mobile software, he added.They might just sell software products and have demonstration centres [for hardware], Mr Baker said. “They may end up being more like Sony stores, which promote the products but sell very little.”
512;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-02-05T18:17:01Z;New Satyam CEO unlikely to impress investors;;Satyam Computer Services, the Indian IT outsourcer at the centre of a $1bn fraud inquiry, on Thursday appointed as its new chief executive a loyalist of B Ramalinga Raju, the former head who admitted to manipulating the company’s books.A.S. Murty, who was given the top job by Satyam’s government-appointed board, used to be the chief delivery officer of the IT software outsourcer. “I have no misgivings about the enormity of the task in front of us but, together with my colleagues, I am confident we can accomplish the impossible,” said Mr Murty, who joined Satyam in 1994.The appointment of a new chief puts an end to the leadership vacuum left a month ago by Mr Raju’s resignation. However, the move is likely to disappoint the market and raise investors’ eyebrows, as they expected an outsider to lead the IT group.“He [Mr Murty] comes as a surprise to the industry. [Investors] might have wanted somebody without Satyam blood on his hands,” said Diptarup Chakraborti, a research analyst at Gartner.Ganesh Natarajan, chairman of the National Association of Software Services Companies, the IT industry’s lobby, welcomed the move. “It is good…as the company will get [the] respect of customers because customers will see continuity.”The chief executive’s priorities will be to retain customers, consolidate the group’s financials and to shore up investors’ confidence, as Satyam’s shares have dropped more than 70 per cent since mid-December, following the aborted acquisition of a company owned by Mr Raju’s family.The new leadership will also have to decide whether to sell the IT outsourcer, which has hired investment banks Goldman Sachs and Avendus to talk to potential buyers. Larsen & Toubro, the Indian engineering group, has become the front runner to take over the company, after it trebled its stake in Satyam to 12 per cent.Honi Khusrokhan, a former director at Tata Chemicals, and Partho Datta, a chartered accountant, who were widely expected to become the chief executive and financial officer, respectively, were appointed special advisers Thursday.“In our interactions over the past few weeks, we are convinced that Satyam needs an internal leader to steer it at this critical juncture and ASM (Mr Murty) has the required bandwidth and support,” said Deepak Parekh, a prominent Indian banker and board member.Satyam stock fell 7.3 percent to Rs46.45 at the end of day’s trade at the Bombay Stock Exchange, before the announcement. Satyam’s overall market value has dropped to about $800m from a peak of $7bn at the end of May last year.
513;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-02-05T04:25:45Z;India’s outsourcing growth seen to slow down;;The growth of India’s IT outsourcing sector, which contributes to about 25 per cent of the country’s total exports, is expected to slow down sharply this year following a drop in demand due to the global financial crisis, India’s software industry lobby predicted.National Association of Software Services Companies (Nasscom) said export revenues are expected to grow about 17 per cent, compared to the previously estimated 21 per cent, generating $47bn in revenues in the year ending March 2009.India’s domestic market is expected to grow nearly 20 per cent with revenues exceeding $23bn, according to the industry body that represents about 1,100 IT groups – including Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro.The revised growth outlook highlights the difficulties facing a sector whose reputation has been tarnished recently by news of an alleged $1bn fraud at Satyam Computer Services. The IT outsourcing industry contributed about 5.8 per cent to India’s gross domestic product and has been recording 30 per cent growth year-on-year during the last decade.“In the second half [of 2008] we have seen a rapid decline,” Ganesh Natarajan, Nasscom chairman, said. “We are hopeful that the government … will stimulate investor confidence and growth by extending fiscal incentives to this industry.”However, some analysts said that the growth slowdown could be more severe than Nasscom predicts, as many western economies enter a period of recession and companies are forced to cut costs.“Nasscom’s growth figures are a little too optimistic,” Diptarup Chakraborti, a research analyst at Gartner, said.“The IT services sector is heavily dependent on demand from the US and Europe, which are currently going through a deep recession. This is going to have a strong negative impact on Indian IT groups,” he added.In spite of lowering the industry’s growth outlook, Nasscom said it was optimistic that the sector would continue to expand at a sustainable rate, with foreign companies predicted to continue to outsource in an attempt to cut costs.Sudin Apte, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that he expected growth in the IT outsourcing sector to pick up again in the second half of 2009.Analysts said that the problems surrounding Satyam are unlikely to have an impact on the overall growth of the industry, with most clients expected to keep their outsourcing operations in India.
514;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-01-27T16:52:16Z;Stumbling into a minefield of regulations;;The ostrich gambit – head in sand, backside exposed – can be a risky one in the regulatory jungle.French Caldwell, senior analyst with the Gartner Group recalls talking to a European company’s chief information officer shortly after the Sarbanes-Oxley act hit the statute books in the US. “He said: ‘I don’t have time to deal with that. I’m going to ignore it.’ Well, he is no longer CIO of that company and his successor has implemented a stringent compliance regime.”Mr Caldwell could not guarantee that the two events were related, but today it would be a foolhardy CIO who would try to ignore the torrent of rules and regulations with which modern businesses are expected to comply.Sarbanes-Oxley, which is now seven years old and designed to protect investors in the US in the wake of a series of financial scandals, is just one of 50 or so regulations that US public companies must observe. The UK has roughly the same number in place, with the rest of Europe not far behind. Global companies face global compliance.“These occupy a lot of a CIO’s time,” Mr Caldwell says. “Many see compliance as a distraction from their primary jobs.”So is this extra burden really necessary? “Regulations really constitute a substitute for morality,” says Mike Small of Computer Associates, the international software group.“If everyone operated in an ethical way, you would not need regulation. History tells us that people, either through stupidity or cupidity, will do things that they should not, leading to fraud and theft. Regulations balance the scales, so people are obliged to operate in an open and honest way.”CA has sponsored a global report on the status of IT compliance processes, carried out by the US research group GMG Insight, which concludes that even large organisations are struggling in the compliance stakes.The report says: “It would seem reasonable to expect that most large organisations would have optimised processes and adopted technology solutions to reduce the organisational burdens of re-occurring compliance mandates and quarterly or annual audits. Surprisingly, that is not the case.”It argues that in spite of rising costs associated with compliance and the severe penalties that can come from non-compliance, organisations are still managing down to a “just enough to get by” strategy.The report says: “In our opinion, this strategy cannot be sustained. Organisations face exponential growth of regulations, and systems affected by those regulations must be monitored,” warning that an ad hoc approach carries with it significant risk. It concludes: “Recognition of the organisational risk and the growing costs will ultimately drive the adoption of broader, enterprise-wide compliance management solutions.”The burden of compliance with any regulation can be heavy. For example, Brian Pennington, business development manager for Dimension Data UK, says there are 12 separate requirements in the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which secures cardholder transaction and personal data.He warns: “Although the DSS is clearly structured, there is no doubt that organisations may find it challenging to interpret how they match their overall security roadmap and also previous investments in technology and processes. A single violation of any of the requirements can trigger an overall non-compliant status, resulting in fines, suspension and revocation of card processing privileges.”Neil Fisher, head of global security solutions for Unisys, says difficulty is no excuse: “It is understandable that many companies will blame regulatory complexity for evading compliance but they will also be most vunerable to data loss, compromised digital records and issues with data recovery.“Any of these could result in unnecessary panic when vital information cannot be retrieved, the confiscation of essential computer systems and even protracted criminal prosecutions.”Even the darkest regulatory cloud can have a silver lining, however, as Lynn Collier, solutions director for Hitachi Data Systems in Europe, makes clear: “Smart organisations are preparing for compliance, but the smarter ones are aiming beyond this and actually looking to drive business value out of necessity. If approached strategically, compliance is not a burden but an opportunity.”It is a view which will have many hard-pressed CIOs casting their eyes skywards, but Ms Collier’s optimism is supported by a study from the Economist Intelligence Unit which, while warning that regulatory risk is now the greatest concern for risk managers, there are important benefits from implementing effective regulatory risk management.It says: “Aside from the obvious advantage of keeping the business out of trouble, respondents [to the EIU survey] point to a number of key outcomes.“Chief among these is the ability to improve the efficiency of overall business processes. A second benefit is perceived to be competitive advantage from implementing best practice which suggest that, for many companies, effective compliance can serve as a gold stamp to attract and reassure customers and investors.”Such reassurance may be sorely needed. Michael Evans, a partner in the law firm Davenport Lyons, notes that the digital era has made possible excesses that have labelled the IT sector as the “new, lawless Wild West”. Data protection, unheard of 20 years ago, is now a principal bulwark of the regulatory regime.But, he says, IT directors should argue that compliance with most of these regulations should not be their responsibility. “These are human resources issues, and sales and marketing issues, rather than narrow IT problems. But the IT directors are the people who must deliver compliant systems, who control the on-switch, the data input and storage systems, passwords, firewalls and flash drives.“The solution,” he says, “requires the company as a whole to ensure that responsibility for compliance rests where it belongs – not just in the lap of the person who happens to hold the key.”Technology has a powerful role in creating an efficient compliance regime. Generic management software is used to monitor workflow and documentation. Control software is specific to particular industries such as finance or IT.Daniel Foody of the US group Progress Software says any IT approach must lower rather than increase overall costs, improve the efficiency of project teams rather than create barriers to delivery, and put the enforcement and policies in the hands of compliance experts, not project teams.“The right IT governance tools centralise the creation and management of security and compliance policies and provide managers with visibility of critical processes while decoupling compliance work from any individual IT project,” he says.Karl Havers, head of Ernst & Young’s European technology centre, adds a dash of cold water: “If businesses listened to all the siloed advice they received on compliance and enacted it without thinking about it, they would grind to a halt.“Too many businesses rely on the stick of regulation to get things done, when what is needed is to run their business in a competent manner.“Millions of pounds and dollars are wasted on compliance that is ineffectively managed, and often like the proverbial sledge-hammer cracking a nut.”But then, echoing Mr Small of CA, if all businesses operated in an ethical manner, there would be no need for their managements to tackle the regulatory jungle.
515;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-01-26T11:58:24Z;Perspectives: Darwinian tips to adapt and survive the downturn;;"Unless you have been living in another dimension these past few weeks – Second Life perhaps – you will have been unable to avoid the hoo-hah surrounding the fact that 2009 is the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin’s iconoclastic theory of the origin of species by means of natural selection.It is an event well worth celebrating. Darwin’s theory may well be the single most important idea in the history of science, the notion that natural but random processes drive the adaption of living organisms to their habitat to the extent that those best adapted survive, eventually forming new species, while the less favoured perish.Has Darwin’s idea anything to say about business and IT today? While it is always dangerous to draw comparisons between the natural world and the man-made world of commerce, today’s gloomy business environment – a random catastrophe, perhaps equivalent to the shrinking of the African forests 6m years ago which led to the evolution of modern man – suggests a parallel or two.Most large living organisms are composed of many millions of cells organised into tissues and organs; organisations employ numbers of staff organised into departments and divisions. The comparison is not exact. In general, the cells all pull in the same direction to ensure the overall health of the organism (cancer cells being a notable exception).Humans are more complex. They may have varying degrees of loyalty to the parent organisation. The quality of work can vary between individuals – and in single individuals – on different days and weeks. If made redundant, the damage they can do to the organisation is sometimes reflected in corporate policies which demand the surrender of laptops, memory devices and the like and the immediate denial of access to corporate data.Individual departments play an important part in the overall performance of the business. A well-run finance department can help to compensate for the shortcomings of other parts of the organisation. An excellent IT department can give the company an advantage over competitors in much the same way that a sharp beak gives a bird the ability to crack nuts denied its blunt-beaked fellows.So how does a good IT department become excellent and an excellent department improve?By preparing for the unexpected, according to Gartner Group, the US consultancy, in a list of “Ten CIO resolutions” it offered this month.Mark Raskino, vice-president and fellow, said: “It may seem like a paradox, but it is possible to prepare better for the unexpected. It is important to challenge and develop the thinking styles and frame of reference of your leadership team as well as yourself. We advise CIOs to find people to join the discussion who don’t fit the existing mould and perhaps even deliberately choose people who will irritate the majority.”In other words – my words, not Gartner’s – build in an element of random change, something capable of doing a bit of damage to the DNA of the organisation, to promote adaption to circumstances which may be the most challenging that many CIOs will ever have experienced.Among Gartner’s other suggestions are ways to maintain a pool of experienced staff with legacy skills by establishing a semi-official company of former staff with its own web page and “bounty schemes where staff are paid for the recruits they bring in”; and the visible use of social systems, arguing that CIOs need to start using social networks themselves to kick-start participation from other staff.The idea is to enable “better internal communication while rebuilding brand confidence externally, energising the company culture and developing ideas and solutions”.It also endorses the adoption of “cloud computing” – a notoriously fuzzy concept which includes utility computing, software as a service and web services.It thinks the cloud will be the basis of much corporate IT delivery in 10 years: “CIOs need to start leading their organisations safely in this direction or risk being sidelined by its progress,” it argues, underlining the argument that organisations which do not adapt will find it hard to survive. E-book readers, Google Chrome and YouTube are recommended as ways to stay in touch.This may be unwelcome advice for CIOs already under pressure from the business to do more and better with less. Nature and business, however, are never less than red in tooth and claw and only the sharpest beak in the nest can hope to make it through to the other side of the downturn."
516;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-01-21T01:03:16Z;IBM upbeat on 2009 profits forecast;;IBM gave the flagging technology sector a much-needed boost on Tuesday as it registered an unexpectedly strong bounce in fourth-quarter earnings and issued a bullish forecast for 2009 profits, in spite of pressure on its revenues from the global slowdown.The news came amid a fresh round of pessimism about the impact on technology companies from falling corporate IT spending and weak consumer spending, with tech stocks among the hardest hit on Wall Street.“They have a global structure that allows them to shift pretty quickly to changing conditions,” said Carl Claunch, an analyst at Gartner.In the final months of last year, IBM turned away from Europe as customers there suffered the worst effects of the credit crunch, benefiting instead from relative strength in the US and continued higher growth in some emerging markets, he added.IBM’s results also benefited from its shift in recent years into software and services, which are both higher margin and typically more resilient in a downturn than its traditional hardware business.This had left the company much better able to withstand the recession than it had been at the bottom of the last slump in 2002, said Mark Loughridge, chief financial officer.As a result, IBM was able to boost its overall profit margins without resorting to widespread cost-cutting, though he said that a longer-term focus on expenses had lifted underlying productivity 2 per cent in the quarter.The more resilient business model and greater flexibility also led Big Blue to offer a relatively optimistic forecast for 2009, with earnings per share of “at least $9.20”, up from $8.93 in 2008 and above the $8.80 Wall Street has projected.Not all of IBM resisted the downturn. IBM’s hardware division, the business for which it is still best known, fell to a new low of only 9 per cent of total revenues, as revenues (excluding currency effects) dropped 16 per cent.Profits from the company’s mainframe business, which was the subject this week of a complaint to European competition regulators, helped to offset the worst of the decline seen from the more competitive industry-standard servers business, as well as a slump in chip sales.Overall, IBM’s revenues slipped 6 per cent to $27bn, a bigger drop than Wall Street had expected, though they would have been down only 1 per cent had it not been for the stronger US dollar.Net income rose 12 per cent to $4.4bn, or $3.28 a share, ahead of the $3.03 a share that had been expected.
517;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-01-19T23:32:38Z;Regulators set to renew a mainframe battle with IBM;;It is 40 years to the week since the US government filed its last official antitrust complaint against IBM, and more than 50 years since it reached a landmark consent decree with the computer maker to open up the early computing industry.Yet some technology monopolies never die. The market for mainframes – the heavy-duty, monolithic machines that dominate the high-end of the computing market – once attracted the attention of companies including General Electric to Honeywell.As recently as the 1990s, the mainframe industry attracted competitors such as Hitachi and the Fujitsu-owned Amdahl.Today, though, it is once again the almost exclusive preserve of IBM, with whose name it has become almost synonymous.That is now set to come under renewed scrutiny, with European regulators preparing to blow the dust off a case history that dates back almost as far as the computing industry itself. Armed with its big 2007 legal victory over Microsoft, the European Commission now believes it has the precedent to dig further into some of the tech world’s most entrenched markets.Ironically, the renewed attention to IBM’s historic mainframe monopoly comes at a time of rampant innovation in the type of high-powered computing that powers corporate and government data centres.New technologies such as multi-core processors (chips that can run several instructions simultaneously) and virtualisation (software that turns a single computer into a number of independent “virtual” machines) have given customers new, lower-cost choices in how to handle their most intensive computing tasks.“IBM’s [profit] margin is nowhere near where it used to be – they’ve had a lot of competition” from these new computing architectures, said John Phelps, an analyst at Gartner. “People do have the options of moving off the mainframe, and they are doing it.”However, legacy computing systems such as the IBM mainframe often have a surprisingly long life. With its biggest customers having written billions of lines of software code over the years to run on the machines, the cost of switching to new systems can be substantial. That is particularly true for governments, banks, retailers, healthcare companies and others in transaction-intensive industries with large numbers of customers.To get around this barrier, companies such as T3 have come up with techniques to “trick” software applications into thinking they are running on a mainframe when in fact they are actually installed on lower-cost standardised servers based on chips from Intel or AMD. This technique, known as “emulation”, relies on software that can only be produced with the approval of IBM, since it uses some of Big Blue’s patented mainframe technology.This touches on the central issue at stake in the latest complaint against IBM in Europe. Though it used to license an earlier generation of the necessary technology, the computing giant has dropped that practice with its latest generation of 64-bit mainframe software, leaving potential rivals with no way to produce machines that are compatible with IBM’s.IBM has accused rivals of infringing its patents by trying to produce their own mainframes, and maintains that mainframes are not a monopoly since it faces competition from many other high-end computing systems.Yet one sign of the significant potential in the mainframe market was the powerful list of backers that lined up behind Platform Solutions Inc, a Silicon Valley start-up launched by several former Amdahl engineers to take on IBM (Amdahl, along with Hitachi, backed out of the market in 2000 after deciding they could not sustain the investment needed to follow IBM into the new phase of 64-bit computing.)Microsoft, Intel and Goldman Sachs all put money into PSI. However, after fighting a legal battle with Big Blue and lodging a formal complaint with European regulators a year ago, PSI agreed to be bought by its giant rival, effectively putting an end to the case.The support that PSI won from some of IBM’s biggest rivals suggests that the T3 case now before Europe will become the centerpiece for a duel between industry heavyweights.Had PSI been successful in pushing through its case against IBM, it could have been of particular benefit to Hewlett-Packard, according to Gartner. HP has been the main supporter of Intel’s Itanium chip, a processor that was once seen as a significant rival to IBM’s mainframe business but which has largely remained a computing backwater.Microsoft’s interest in fostering an IBM rival also points to potential opportunities for its own software in high-end computing.
518;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-01-01T22:33:24Z;Nokia to rely on top position to weather crisis;;Nokia is looking bruised. In November, the world’s largest mobile phone maker issued a profit warning for the fourth quarter after seeing a sharp cutback in spending by consumers on handsets.The Finnish company had already shocked investors in September by revealing its market share of mobile sales would fall in the third quarter, partly because of aggressive price-cutting by competitors. It was the first year-on-year decline in three-and-a-half years.Nokia is predicting that the handset industry’s sales will decline by 5 per cent “or more” in 2009 compared with this year because of the economic downturn.It underlines how the world’s leading mobile manufacturers are seeing almost 15 years of uninterrupted hyper growth come to an end. The only other decline in handset sales was in 2001.In an interview with the Financial Times, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, Nokia chief executive, insists that the company is better placed to cope with the downturn than its competitors.In handset-making, economies of scale are crucial and Nokia has them.According to Gartner, the research firm, Nokia sold 118m mobiles in the third quarter of 2008 – close to the combined sales of its four nearest rivals: Samsung, Sony Ericsson, Motorola and LG.Such dominance enables Nokia, for example, to have superior purchasing power with suppliers of components for its mobiles.Mr Kallasvuo says: “When times are tougher, people who have stronger positions fare relatively better than the competition …So, overall, I believe many of our competitors will have limitations here in terms of their ability to do things.”He also highlights the strength of Nokia’s brand and its solid balance sheet – the company had net cash of €2.9bn ($4bn) at September 30.Such is Nokia’s confidence in its prospects that it has a target of increasing its market share of mobile sales in 2009, including smartphones – handsets that double as mini computers. Nokia has had a weaker range of smartphones for much of this year because it did not have handsets using touchscreen technology but the company is now addressing the shortcoming.Nokia’s goal of increasing its market share in 2009 may also be assisted by the trend of consumers “trading down” to cheaper mobiles.The company’s enduring strength has been in low to mid-priced mobiles and Mr Kallasvuo says: “The fact that we are commercial in all price points will give us the possibility, if the trade down happens, to sell another device, which is not always the case with competitors who have a more limited portfolio.”Given the downturn, Nokia could well find it hard to persuade consumers to pay extra for the services it is starting to offer on mobiles. These range from digital maps and music to games, and Nokia is predicting they will generate €2bn of revenue for the company by 2011.Mr Kallasvuo insists Nokia’s relations with the mobile phone operators – its most important customers – have not been damaged by its foray into services. Most of the operators have their own mobile services and therefore Nokia’s foray could jeopardise some of their revenue.This possibility may partly explain why the big four mobile operators in the UK – O2, Vodafone, Orange and T-Mobile – chose not to sell Nokia’s flagship Comes With Music service in their shops following its global launch in Britain in October. Consumers who pay a premium for Nokia mobiles featuring Comes With Music get unlimited access to music by bands from all leading record labels. Mr Kallasvuo says there is “so much consumer interest” in the service.One person familiar with Nokia’s Comes With Music service in the UK said initial sales had been “OK, but not earth shattering”. The person, who declined to be named, said some consumers were reluctant to pay extra for a mobile with the service – sold through Carphone Warehouse, the mobile phone retailer, and 3, the smaller mobile operator – given how piracy meant they could get the music free on the internet.Nokia is seeking to consolidate its grip as the leading maker of handsets for emerging markets by launching mobile services relevant to developing countries in Africa and Asia. These include, for example, information for farmers about the market prices for their crops.Mr Kallasvuo plays down the idea of more large deals to enhance Nokia’s capability in mobile services. Last year, it completed the $8.1bn acquisition of Navteq, the digital maps company, and Mr Kallasvuo says Nokia does not have “any big pieces missing” in its services portfolio.Nokia may be well-placed to ride out the downturn but Mr Kallasvuo avoids saying whether it can eventually improve its profit margin. In 2007, Nokia said the operating margin at its devices and services business should be 20 per cent in 2009. Last month, following the profit warning, Nokia said the margin would in “the teens” next year.Mr Kallasvuo will only say: “We will continue to combine market share and margins in the right way in order to maximise the bottom line.”
519;IT;Gartner Inc;2009-01-01T22:33:24Z;Nokia vows to exact revenge on rivals;;Nokia is insisting that its belated roll-out of mobile phones using touchscreen technology will enable it to wreak “vengeance” on competitors in 2009.The Finnish group is seeking to become the world’s largest maker of mobiles with touchscreens this year after unveiling handsets that will compete with the likes of Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Omnia.Such a feat would provide Nokia with some good news – the world’s largest mobile maker is predicting that handset sales by all manufacturers will fall in 2009 for the first time in eight years.Nokia has been slow to respond to Apple’s 2007 release of the iPhone and its touchscreen technology.During the third quarter of 2008, the popularity of the iPhone turned the US technology group into the world’s third largest maker of smartphones – mobiles that double up as mini computers with users able to play music and surf the internet.Nokia is the largest maker of smartphones, followed by Canada’s Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry.But Nokia recorded its first fall in sales of smartphones in the third quarter of 2008, according to Gartner, the research company, partly because of its lack of handsets with touchscreens.Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, Nokia’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that Nokia had wanted to develop touchscreen technology suitable for several different handsets.He accepted that Nokia had therefore seen some competitors get ahead of it with touchscreen mobiles. “If you talk about touch, we have been a follower, yes,” Mr Kallasvuo said. “But we are now coming with a vengeance.”Apple’s iPhone was released in June 2007, and its touchscreen technology was praised for introducing a better user experience, for example when browsing the mobile internet. Nokia last month unveiled the N97, a touchscreen smartphone that will compete with the iPhone. It will go on sale in the second quarter of 2009. Nokia began selling its 5800, another touchscreen smartphone, in the fourth quarter of 2008. The handset is less sophisticated than the N97 and costs less.The touchscreen smartphone market is becoming more competitive as new participants enter. The GI handset, made by Taiwan’s HTC and using Google’s Android operating system, was released in October.Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner, said Nokia’s goal of becoming the world’s largest maker of mobiles with touchscreens was realistic, though it would have to expand its range beyond the 5800 and N97.
520;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
521;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-12-26T18:15:13Z;Spam, spam, spam;ISPs could try to cut spammers off. But the time and cost of explaining to customers why they must clean their machines is a powerful disincentive;"Few people are genuinely interested in “male enhancement”. The group that might actually buy such a product in response to an unsolicited e-mail is even smaller. So why on earth is there so much spam?The reason is that spammers have to deluge inboxes to get a hit. Researchers at the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley and the University of California San Diego took control of a small part of a spamming network this year. In 26 days they sent 348m e-mails, producing 11,000 visits to a fake pharmaceuticals site but just 28 “conversions”, or attempted purchases, worth about $100 each. For those hawking pills, that suggests revenues of about $3.5m a year.Given that virtually all spam is sent by 10-15 spamming networks globally, that does not suggest a great deal of cash for an activity that creates more than 80 per cent of the world’s e-mail traffic. But spammers do profit from renting use of their networks to advertisers – including fraudsters who want to “pump and dump” penny stocks. Meanwhile, companies with the skills to identify and cut out junk enjoy a lucrative market of their own. The e-mail security market had sales of $1.2bn this year, according to Gartner. Mail filtering typically costs between $3 and $20 per user annually.The authorities occasionally catch a spammer, but the serious operations are usually safely ensconced in less vigilant locales. The problem now is that unwitting spammers are everywhere. Their networks are created by “bots”, computer viruses that infect PCs and set them to spamming. A typical network comprises upwards of 200,000 infected machines. Internet service providers could try to cut spammers off – infected machines can be spotted by their frantic e-mailing. But the time and cost of explaining to all those customers why they must clean their machines is a powerful disincentive. Spam is here to stay.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

522;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-12-26T17:20:08Z;New threats to online security;;Internet security has deteriorated markedly this year as a new generation of invasive computer attacks, often masterminded by criminal gangs, has reached a heightened level of sophistication, according to the latest studies of online threats.“It’s getting worse year after year,” warned Pat Peterson, chief security researcher at Cisco Systems, who blamed the deterioration on the fact that computer “hacking” is quickly turning into big business. “Capitalism is working against us,” he said.“It’s a step back after things had gotten better,” added John Pescatore, a security analyst at Gartner.In particular, computer security experts warn that so-called botnets, or networks of “slave” PCs whose owners do not know their machines have been infected, have become both more prevalent and sophisticated.By planting a piece of software on an unguarded PC, criminals are able to assemble large networks of machines to carry out tasks for them, such as launching attacks on other internet users.PCs that are part of botnets, some of which span 1m or more machines, have become harder to identify and root out in recent months as the rogue software has burrowed deeper into the machines, said Paul Wood, a senior analyst at MessageLabs.Botnets have also become more dangerous as their controllers have learnt how to repurpose the slave networks to carry out different tasks, Mr Peterson said. One network that was originally used to steal users’ passwords and send out spam was given an overhaul this year so that it could attack legitimate websites, according to Cisco.A second big new threat that has become notable this year has been the commandeering of legitimate websites and e-mail accounts to spread malicious software. Rogue software is used to scrutinise public websites and “inject” code into those that are found vulnerable, so that later visitors to the sites can be infected.The setback for internet security follows several years in which the biggest online threats were successfully held at bay or, in some cases, pushed back. The use of the internet to exploit vulnerabilities in millions of PCs first emerged as a significant threat in 2001, after an outbreak of fast-spreading computer viruses and worms.Those threats were largely thwarted after a concerted effort by Microsoft and other software makers to plug flaws in their code, and after anti-virus software became more widely used. A subsequent wave of spyware that emerged in the middle of this decade was also pushed back.However, the prospect of making large amounts of money by stealing sensitive information from millions of users, such as their passwords or financial data, has led to a new and more insidious outbreak of mass internet attacks.
523;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-12-22T18:57:33Z;Year of the iPhone;;"In the technology business, sometimes it is not the big changes but the smaller, incremental moves that matter the most. In 2007, gadget-lovers swooned as Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone, Apple’s much-anticipated foray into the mobile handset market. But it wasn’t until this year, with the launch of a faster, 3G version of the Apple handset and the unveiling of the iPhone “App Store” – which lets customers browse and install thousands of games and tools directly from their mobile phones – that the handset came into its own.Boosted by the iPhone 3G’s launch in 20 countries in July, Apple took the number three spot in the global smartphone market in the third quarter, according to Gartner, the market research group. In less than 18 months, iPhone sales have eclipsed those of smartphones using Windows Mobile, the mobile operating system that Microsoft has been working on for the better part of a decade.Until now, Apple has enjoyed being the first mobile phone maker to hit on the winning formula for a touch-screen handset. But competitors are racing to catch up. Research in Motion with its Blackberry Storm, and Google with its G1 phone based on the internet search group’s Android operating system, already have touch-screen alternatives of their own. Nokia’s response to the iPhone – its touch-screen N97 – is set to hit store shelves next year.Apple, meanwhile, has thrown substantial marketing muscle behind the iPhone’s App Store. It is betting that just as it took the combination of the iPod and iTunes to make Apple a leader in digital music, the success of the iPhone will revolve at least as much around software as it does around hardware. History is on Apple’s side, but the company’s shareholders – stung as its shares halved this year in spite of the iPhone’s gains – are no doubt hoping for an even better 2009.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

524;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-12-02T15:58:32Z;Editor’s note: Blue sky thinking on the cloud;;"Let us poke our heads once more into the gathering cloud that is about to revolutionise IT – or perhaps not.I asked readers for thoughts on the phenomenon, which involves services being accessed via the internet rather than from a PC’s hard drive, at the end of my note in the last edition of Digital Business (November 19) and several of you responded.Gartner helped out with a neat description: “A style of computing where massively scalable IT-related capabilities are provided ‘as a service’ using internet technologies to multiple external customers.”Then Lindsey Armstrong, EVP international field sales at salesforce.com, pointed out a couple of its benefits: “Cloud computing achieves a quicker return on investment than the traditional ‘on-premise’ approach to enterprise IT, while removing much of the management overhead that detracts from time more meaningfully spent delivering innovation and driving the business forward.“It offers businesses low up-front investment and the flexibility to scale up or scale down as business needs dictate.”So far, so positive – a tone maintained by Willy Chiu, an IBM vice president in its “on-demand solutions” division. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he is persuaded the cloud’s a good thing, too: ”A more mature cloud computing will emerge in 2009 as an enabling force behind an increasingly interconnected world. Data centres will become factories for industrialised services, allowing consumers to use technology in simple, elegant ways.“Underpinning the pervasiveness of cloud computing will be industry standards driving interoperability, and rigorous security at all stages of the operation, building confidence that cloud computing can be an effective way to connect the world.”And Russ Daniels, vice president and chief technology officer for Cloud Services Strategy at HP, chipped in with: “The internet is evolving into the cloud – the vast data processing infrastructure through which everything can be delivered as a service, on-demand. Understandably, many technologists are busy dispelling the hype, but just because it’s over-hyped, doesn’t mean it isn’t going to change the world.“With the cloud, we will witness another explosion, this time in services – from computing to business processes to personal interactions.”Surely, this could not go on. It took a lawyer to sound a note of caution. Andrew Scott, a partner at Dickinson Dees: “The problem with cloud computing is its lack of transparency. Aspects of the cloud where businesses will need to pay close attention include the location of the customer’s data, which may be relevant either to determine where a given activity is undertaken for legal purposes or where an activity must be undertaken in order to be compliant; competent authorities, such as regulators and taxation authorities may have audit rights, and the customer may be required to know where data is kept; and data protection – depending on the nature of the service, the customer is the data controller and so remains liable for compliance (among other things) with security requirements, and to ensure the processing of the data satisfies the adequacy principle.”John Bullard of IdenTrust agreed there were concerns: “Handled correctly, it will be an enormous benefit to all; handled incorrectly and it will be a mega-storm. One of the most critical success factors of cloud computing will be the whole issue of access – being able to vouch for, validate and authenticate people and organisations into these ‘clouds’ and for what applications. Knowing your counterparty and being able to do two-way digital handshakes is going to become even more vital than it is today.”On the technical front, Robin Ellis and Matthew Munson, the director/owners of Blue Square data, say that achieving the aims of ”the cloud” is more difficult than it seems, largely because the technology is at a point where only small applications can be handled. The complexity of the number of connections required for large applications is just too great.“Our view is really that cloud solutions, at least for the next few years, will be confined to applications that are not mission critical. In fact some of the technical problems may yet prove to be impossible to overcome,” they said.So what might the cloud mean? Will there eventually be just a single version of each program, tool, song, etc in the world that everyone can access? Is that not all we need – assuming the doubts of Mr Ellis and Mr Munson can be overcome by a pipe fat enough to enable us all to reach what we want instantly?Probably not. I fear it more likely that data centres will proliferate, countries and big companies will each demand their own, and the cloud will, for some time, sit heavily on top of everything we already have."
525;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-11-18T23:19:29Z;Yang backs out of limelight;;“All of you know that I have always, and will always, bleed [Yahoo] purple,” said Jerry Yang, in a memo to “All Yahoos” on Monday, announcing he would step down as chief executive.Whether the blood-letting of his departure came from falling on his sword or a knife to the back, there was general agreement yesterday that his 18-month reign was being brought to a necessary close.“History should be kinder to Jerry Yang,” said Allen Weiner, managing vice-president at the Gartner research firm.“He took on an unenviable task, like a leader taking on the throne amid great turmoil. Given what he had, he did what he could, and I think the best thing he did was to set things up to allow him to move on.”Others were less kind: “We think even though Yang meant well for Yahoo, his departure from the CEO role is overdue, following what we believe have been multiple corporate failures since he assumed the top job at the company,” said Scott Kessler, S&P IT analyst, in a note.Mr Yang gave the impression in his memo that he had been reluctantly thrust into the limelight, saying he had “accepted the board’s request” to become chief executive in June last year.With his co-founder David Filo, Mr Yang had been happy to take a back seat as Chief Yahoo ever since the company appointed Tim Koogle as chief executive in 1995, a year after it was launched.Mr Koogle was comparable to Eric Schmidt’s appointment as Google chief executive – he was an engineer, there to supervise two talented founders and provide the business smarts.His replacement by Terry Semel, a former Warner Bros executive, in 2001 saw Yahoo take a disastrous turn as it focused on entertainment, according to Mr Weiner.“Jerry Yang is a stand-up guy and he would never say he came in to clean up a very large mess, but he stepped in because he had to – they were losing ground to Google,” he said.However, once in place, Mr Yang lacked any radical strategy to turn things around. He fell back on the philosophy that Yahoo should be users’ “starting-point” for the internet.“The component that makes a starting point for the net back in 1994 is vastly different than in 2008, where the biggest thing is search,” he said.Mr Yang was also slow to act when he took charge. It was months before a restructuring programme and layoffs were announced and this had to be followed up by a 10 per cent cut in the workforce last month.Mr Kessler said in a Financial Times interview that Mr Yang’s deep-seated connection with the company had served as a massive hindrance to him making tough decisions.The Yahoo chief has pushed ahead with easier technical goals of putting Yahoo on a more open platform that is helping to build a developer community and introducing a new advertising platform, which holds promise for future revenue growth.But his tenure will be remembered for his failure to consummate a deal with Microsoft and the collapse of a search advertising agreement with Google. There have also been significant executive defections under his leadership.“Whether it’s his indecisiveness or his inability to get business deals done or instill confidence in managers, there are a lot of things I think he will even admit he could have done much differently and much better,” said Mr Kessler.And yet, his successor is not facing the same mess as he did, according to analysts.“I think it’s a very salvageable company, it still has the core assets of a very large audience that you can serve up a variety of content and services, it hasn’t lost audiences as dramatically as AOL,” said David Card.“There’s a little bit of him being a victim of circumstances,” said David Card, analyst with Forrester Research.“Initially, Yahoo suffered in comparison to Google and it ends with a recession around his ears.“Clearly, Yahoo has not been able to exploit social media or prove the case that leadership in display advertising and being number two in search advertising is a synergy business.”This was the same idea he had when Yahoo was founded, but back-to-basics did not necessarily apply, said Mr Weiner.
526;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-11-07T15:37:46Z;Crunch time for CRM systems;;Customer relationship management looks set to be one aspect of IT that companies may not be able to afford to cut back on in these tough times. Keeping customers is critical and guaranteeing an optimum customer experience can be the secret to survival.There are also other reasons for companies to revisit CRM infrastructures and question whether the systems in place really deliver business benefit. Some CRM solutions have now reached the end of their life cycle and now is the time for businesses to invest in different solutions to make more intelligent customer decisions and remain competitive.Across many industries consolidation and mergers have created companies with broad product and service offerings. Customers can be faced with a wide choice from numerous suppliers with little price differentiation. Therefore, how they interact with companies, how they are communicated with and how they are billed becoming increasingly important.Analysts are predicting growth in CRM software despite the downturn. In reports published earlier this year, Gartner expected European revenues to increase from $2.6bn in 2007 to $3.9bn in 2012. AMR Research assessed the 2007 market as the strongest since 2000, and predicted that today’s experience economy would see CRM as an enabler in times of tight budgets.But with ageing systems, complexities around the impact of multi-channel marketing, cleanliness of data and implementation difficulties, many CRM systems may be failing to deliver the value companies expect.Many corporate CRM systems were updated in the early part of this century to support new demand for online customer interaction. Today, many of these systems are struggling to cope with the volume of data collated from diverse sources (e-mail, phone, web). The original premise of CRM helping to draw together customer data from various places is becoming too simplistic, as there is increasing need for integration with multiple other aspects of business operations – not just marketing or customer service management.Many CRM projects suffer from a lack of integration between the needs of the business as a whole, as opposed to the needs of the call centre or the IT department. With older systems, rather than taking a joined up approach, companies often deal with each channel of communication individually. This can lead to detrimental inequalities in customer care and a flawed understanding of a customer’s profile. In some cases a customer contacting the company through one channel, such as the web, may have a totally different experience to another customer contacting the same company through the call centre. The business’s need to keep, nurture and grow customer relationships cannot possibly be pursued in that situation.Companies that do not have a joined up approach and a robust CRM system that can collate and manage data from multiple sources often work with unreliable data and fail to keep an accurate history of customer contact from all channels. As a result, information regarding previous interactions via one channel may not be available to call centre operators or other channels when a customer makes further contact with the company. Data cleanliness issues can lead to erroneous billing and invalid customer contact while failure to keep a track of historic data can lead to poor customer service and ultimately revenue leakage.With the advent of new, more advanced means of customer contact, including social computing and mobile web communications, companies with disparate CRM approaches risk creating negative reputations and alienating customers.When renewing or upgrading any IT system it is also vital to plan their implementation. Like others, CRM projects are frequently delivered late or in a piecemeal approach, creating tactical solutions that do not ultimately deliver the business benefit that is sought. Businesses should ensure that they bring in the right resources to manage project delivery, not just focus on their technical selection criteria and eventual supplier.At expw: consulting, I have experienced some significant benefits from the Agile approach to project delivery because it tends to give useable functionality earlier than other delivery methods by managing implementation in short, tightly managed spurts with integral checks and balances.At a time when business focus is clearly going to need to remain firmly on the customer, it is crucial that companies evaluate their CRM systems and their delivery approaches to ensure that they are helping the business deliver the best possible customer experience. CRM systems that do not capture and manage customer data effectively need to be reviewed as a matter of urgency. However tough the current economic times may be, industry simply cannot afford to be without seamless CRM systems that help them maintain and grow business.
527;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-11-04T16:17:33Z;How to survive an IT squeeze;;Only a year ago, “agility” was the watchword, as information technology departments tailored their systems to support dynamic change. Today, with the threat of worldwide recession, businesses are chiefly concerned with survival and maintaining market position, aware that some competitors might not make it.“The knee jerk reaction is to pull back into the comfort zone, press the pause buttons and cut costs,” says Brian Murray, technology strategist for the consultancy, Morse Group. He says such a tactic can be a false economy.For some, the ordeal has started. Jean-Philippe Courtois, president of Microsoft International told the Etre technology conference in Stockholm last month that he had been asked for help by the chief information officer of an (unidentified) large European company, who had been told to cut his IT budget by 30 per cent immediately.Mr Courtois identified a source of savings with which many CIOs will identify – too many servers – and prescribed a dose of virtualisation: running more applications per server. For many, this is the most effective cost saving measure available today.Others have yet to feel the pain. David Brakoniecki, CIO of the insurance broker Xbridge, said he had not yet been affected by the downturn. IT, however, was critical to the company’s business: “We are trying to prepare for the way trading conditions might change over time. We believe that preparation for the bad times begins in the good times. For example, we try not to staff up massively when things are going well only to make them redundant in a downturn.”The overall picture is complex, exacerbated by the speed and depth of the downturn. Most companies were taken by surprise: “They just tore up the budget that was barely two weeks old and were starting from scratch” – a statement attributed to a Gartner Group client.IT spending trends are confusing. Don Brown, chief executive of Interactive Intelligence, the communications software group quotes a Forrester Research survey that indicates that 43 per cent of large US and European businesses have cut their overall spending on technology products and services this year, adding that despite economic uncertainty, many companies are still running outdated legacy systems that must be updated or replaced.On the other hand, research commissioned by Tata Consultancy Services in the US and UK suggests that only 3 per cent of senior managers and boards have reduced IT budgets now, compared with 28 per cent last year. For every two companies willing to cancel IT projects, there is another willing to increase its IT spend to counter the effects of the downturn, it claims.A straw poll of IT experts, both consultants and vendors, suggest that wholesale slashing of IT budgets would be neither prudent nor practical, given the extent to which IT underpins most companies’ operations.Peter Sondergaard, global head of research at the Gartner group, says IT is too deeply embedded in the organisation and too critical to business performance for swingeing cuts. “In the worst-case scenario,” he says, “our research indicates an IT spending increase of 2.3 per cent in 2009, down from our earlier projection of 5.8 per cent. Although the brakes are being slammed on, we are not coming to a halt.“But there is no question that the age of conspicuous consumption is over and the age of conspicuous frugality has just begun,” he adds.He points to virtualisation, green IT, and multi-sourcing as examples of technologies and services that should be brought into play: “CIOs’ ability to balance these priorities will be critical to their future success and the ability of their organisations to weather this financial storm,” he says.Some CIOs would argue that they have been fielding demands for tighter budgets and more innovation for years now. They are running lean, mean operations with little surplus fat to cut away.However, David Elton, a senior consultant with PA Consulting says that most companies have IT departments that are larger than they need to be: “CIOs need to look at the things that are driving cost in their departments rather than looking at line items and saying ‘Can we take that one out?’.“One of the big ones is performance management. Are staff being appropriately motivated to achieve the output the business is looking for. Can you identify and reward the good people and work out what to do with under-achievers?”Mark Lewis of the US-based wide area networking company Riverbed Technology says: “A lot of the costs associated with IT today are all about the distribution of computing, the complexity of the ever-growing amounts of storage around offices, around the globe and the continual maintenance and management of that infrastructure.” He argues that cost-savings can be made through site consolidation and bandwidth optimisation.“In a recession you have to invest in new technology. You have to speculate to accumulate. We have customers today who spoke to us a year to 18 months ahead of when they were planning to speak to us simply because they can foresee the pressures on them as a business to reduce the costs of infrastructure.”Many observers feel that the situation, dire though it may seem, offers CIOs the opportunity to rationalise and refocus their objectives.Charles Andrews of Celona Technologies argues: “Scarcity of capital will generate increased competition for the cash that is available. Consequently it will be even more important that businesses do everything they can to make sure their existing customers stay with them and keep spending, that they are extraordinarily tough on driving out unnecessary internal costs and that they spend to innovate and win new market share from less agile competitors.”That word “agile” again, meaning a faster, less hierarchical way of systems development. Can a company cope with the downturn and yet apply agile principles?Chris Steel, head of IT consulting for PA Consulting in the US, says that if IT departments have done their jobs well over the past few years, they should have little room for manoeuvre on costs. He argues they should now “concentrate on building agility and capability into their organisations, emphasising an agile approach to emerging business needs which will complement their work on cost and efficiency.”According to Gavin Williams, a director at Avanade, the Accenture/Microsoft joint venture, CIOs should take three critical steps: rationalise their IT infrastructure, sweat the “human assets” by ensuring employees are equipped with effective tools – and the training to use them – and introduce unified communications to wipe out unnecessary telephone calls and travel costs.Unified communications means the integration of most channels so that people can communicate anywhere, any time on any device. The IT solutions provider Dimension Data found that companies using unified communications on average achieved general cost savings of 10 per cent, improvement in customer satisfaction of more than 20 per cent and productivity improvements of more than 10 per cent. Travel costs, time wastage and carbon footprints were all cut by more than 10 per cent.The need to cut costs, however, is only one burden on the IT department in times of financial stress. The business itself is likely to be looking for cost savings through redundancies with serious implications for the integrity of the company’s security.Gary Haycock-West, chief executive of the security group Blue Cube, points out that in a serious downturn, organisations such as banks might want to make staff redundant in their tens, hundreds or even thousands.“Are they prepared for such a volume of redundancies”, he asks. “If you are making whole departments redundant, human resources staff are often not prepared to close all the points to which the former employee has access.” (see Security Matters)If there is one message that emerges from these various viewpoints, it is that managing IT in a recession is very much easier if preparations have been made well in advance. To echo David Brakoniecki, preparation for bad times begins in good times.This recession, however, took most companies by surprise and found them comparatively unprepared. It could be an uncomfortable few months or years before equilibrium is restored.

That compares to Intel’s 80.8 per cent overall share of microprocessor shipments.
IDC says overall demand looks weak and it will be lowering its unit forecast for 2009.The Gartner research firm lowered its forecasts today for the semiconductor industry in 2009.It reduced its revenues prediction by $25bn from 8 per cent growth over 2008 to just 1 per cent growth, due to a weak economic environment.“In a recession, it’s important to remember that there will not only be a potential reduction in the number of systems sold, but also a move to lower-cost systems with less semiconductor content,” said Bryan Lewis, research vice president at Gartner.In other words, the low-cost trend only reinforces the impression that Atom is Intel’s biggest hedge against recession."
529;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-10-29T15:34:32Z;Are we heading for an IT train crash?;;IT departments are fraught with short-term thinking. Too often, the conversation is dominated by what tactical step to take next, what projects to do next, status of existing projects and talk of maintenance efforts, and as a result they’re missing the ever-worsening bigger picture with respect to IT modernisation.Gartner sees the potential for an upcoming train wreck as a convergence of trends that, if ignored, will leave many organisations unable to respond effectively to business demands. We have identified the following top indicators that a potential IT train wreck is coming.Skills shortageMany companies worry about finding employees with IT skills for older systems, rather then replacing those systems with ones that have more readily available skills. Replacing systems such as Cobol, aged databases and discontinued hardware should be a priority as part of the application strategy and IT modernisation effort.Vendor/product consolidation/supportThe IT industry is consolidating, especially in areas such as enterprise applications. As this happens the acquired vendor’s products age and are retired by the acquiring company and taken off support status. The result is increasing maintenance charges with little incremental functionality to show for the maintenance spending.However, companies often depend on these applications, and switching to a new one can require resources some IT groups don’t have. Companies therefore work harder to maintain more-outdated but mission-critical applications.Agility metrics decayAgility metrics for making a business change are decaying as systems become more brittle and the ”piling on effect” worsens. The number of things that need to be ”touched” to make a business change increases and therefore the cost of change continues going up. This means quality can become a problem, as business change can often lead to ripple effects, which could be negative. As a result the business cannot afford to change because the IT organisation can’t support the changes, which leads to a loss of business agility.Operation expenses escalateOperation expenses become a larger portion of the total IT budget as the piling-on effect worsens. As maintenance becomes a more important aspect of the portfolio, it takes on more of the IT budget. The result is that there is no money, people or time to work on anything new.Agility technology portfolioThe ageing technology portfolio drifts further away from the desired ”future state” architecture standards. The technology vision laid out by the enterprise architects becomes impossible to achieve and results in an increasingly outdated set of systems and infrastructure that becomes the source of more problems.Difficult to access informationAs data structures age, information becomes much more difficult to access and analyse. As the data becomes more out of date, less accurate and more difficult to access, the business is forced to work without required information to make decisions.Legacy capacity at riskLegacy capacity needs increase as new interfaces drive up transaction volumes, resulting in greater spending on traditional processing and storage.An example of this is what has happened in the travel and airline industries in the past decade. New websites help people make shopping comparisons for flights, hotels and rental cars. These websites – that often show schedules, availability and prices from the four major reservation systems – along with the comparison shoppers, have forced the traditional reservation systems to upgrade capacity.Regulatory compliance issues/risks increaseCompliance is an issue even in traditional, lightly regulated industries. Legislation such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the Basel II Accord shows that any company may be at the mercy of outdated systems that can’t meet the needs of increased regulations.IT costs increase, agility decreasesDirect business purchasing of IT-related services drives up central IT costs and drives agility downward. The waves of innovation coming from investors are aimed at services that can be sold directly to business budget holders. Most of these investment vehicles come as forms of software as a service (SaaS) or business process outsourcing (BPO).Integrating with external vendors means that business changes will need to take into account additional external suppliers that work at a different pace than internally delivered services, making changes potentially more difficult to apply. Today, these SaaS and BPO initiatives are mostly small and at the edges of the portfolio, but they are already causing budget and agility problems to IT organisations that lack architectures to adopt them.Green ITCIOs are likely to have a target that will involve substantial changes in the infrastructure to achieve green IT objectives that will inevitably carry some significant implications for the application portfolio.So, what should a company do to avoid this so-called train wreck?• Put IT strategic planning at the heart of the CIO management agenda• Develop an application strategy• Fund a modernisation programme• Focus on retiring older systemsIt is easy for companies to turn a blind eye to changes in the IT application landscape but these systemic changes are unavoidable, and companies that ignore the signs will have problems with their application strategies.Scott Nelson is a managing vice president at Gartner, responsible for Gartner’s research on application strategy and governance.
530;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Mobility diary: Pace of change is hotting up;;For 10 years, Symbian, the operating system developer that dominates the market for feature-rich mobile devices, has been closely identified with smartphones.But the landscape is changing: entrants from the consumer world, handset manufacturers from Asia, and a wave of new technologies are chipping away at its leading position.Symbian phone shipments grew in the second quarter of this year but its market share fell to 57.1 per cent from 65.6 per cent a year earlier, according to Gartner.In response, the company said earlier this year that it would ditch its proprietary approach to software, become a foundation and go “open source”, and that Nokia, which already held a 47.9 per cent stake, would take full control.“The for-profit business model has served us well, but now it’s time to look at what else we can do to make sure phones are running on Symbian, from the smart devices right through to those being sold in the developing world,” says Nigel Clifford, Symbian’s chief executive.Mr Clifford believes the open source model will reduce the barriers of entry for developers, both in terms of royalty costs and complexity.The idea is that this will result in more applications running on the Symbian operating system (OS) and this, in turn, will attract handset makers to develop more devices using the platform. This is good news for mobile workers who will, in theory, have access to many more applications and, potentially, less expensive handsets.Because even the most basic phones now come with added bells and whistles, Mr Clifford thinks proprietary operating systems will struggle to match the pace of applications development at their open source rivals. “I would imagine the strategy teams at the proprietary mobile operating systems providers are sitting there scratching their heads, trying to make a business out of something that used to be competitive a year ago and is now significantly challenged,” he says.Proprietary operating systems should not be ruled out, however. The Gartner study that noted a decline in Symbian’s share also saw a decline in Linux, also an open source system, while there were market share increases for proprietary platform makers such as RIM (maker of the BlackBerry), Microsoft, Apple and Palm.Mr Clifford says partners were very much behind the move to open source. “For them it was not about the money,” he says. “It was about time to market and innovation: how do we get the most developers freely experimenting with this code?”However, there are a number of challenges. Mr Clifford says one of the biggest will be to maintain a single platform that will work in a range of markets and meet their individual demands: for example, in Japan the phone is increasingly a wallet, whereas in Europe it is promoted as a consumer entertainment device.And although new entrants’ sales figures are still small, they are setting the agenda for what users will expect handsets to do.Symbian is also lagging in the US. “Until 2008, the US was a sleeping giant and the only use of smartphones was in the enterprise,” says Mr Clifford. “But we’re seeing that change.”However, it may not reap the benefits. “It will be about a US brand with a US device and bringing it to a US public,” says Mr Clifford. AT&T is a foundation board member, which Mr Clifford says indicates a commitment to its interests.On the operating system side, Nokia is hedging its bets. It will continue to release handsets based on the Symbian OS, but it is also using Linux, which is the basis for Google’s Android mobile OS. Nokia has a Linux-based operating system in its internet tablets.Mr Clifford is more sceptical about cloud computing. “It’s interesting but probably not relevant for 90 per cent of humankind,” he says.“When do you think cloud computing will be affordable and available in Rwanda? Not for a while.“Standalone intelligent devices, accessing applications on the device, and using data connections when needed are going to be with us for a long time.”
531;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-10-20T08:06:26Z;From marketing vision to enterprise mission;;"I speak to many organisations that are striving to become more customer-centric. The challenges they face are all too familiar. Silos of customer information, a less than holistic view of the customer and individual departments that cannot or do not co-ordinate customer contact.There is no silver bullet for customer centricity. It’s a long process that will likely involve changes to business processes, company culture and technology.However, in my experience there is a common starting point that is shared by many of the organisations that have successfully embarked on this journey – the measurement of customer profitability and lifetime value as the foundation for a Customer Equity Optimisation strategy.Years ago Gartner* reported that “Customer Relationship Management (CRM) refers to the concept of moving ownership of the customer up to the enterprise level and away from individual departments and channels. These departments are responsible for customer interactions, but the enterprise is responsible for the customer.”Customer centricity has to be an enterprise level strategy. Frontline employees and departments have their own specific responsibilities and priorities. It is the enterprise’s responsibility to provide an environment – culture, technology and information – that enables employees to serve their customers in a way that acknowledges the customer as a whole.Companies that are now practising enterprise-level customer management are enjoying dramatic success. Their executives understand, track and articulate the value of their customer equity and know how their business is optimising customer equity.It all starts with an executive commitment to increasing the value of each customer relationship to the business with every interaction – while also increasing the value of the business to select customers. This commitment must be backed by accurate and timely information. Enterprise profitability analytics encompass every dimension of customer management, including behaviours and transactions as well as expenditures and business activities across the enterprise.By integrating customer lifetime value calculation tools with analytical CRM, there are tremendous opportunities to understand and grow customer equity. However, only with an effective and comprehensive customer profitability model and analytics can a company understand which of its customers are contributing, how much and why.Customer profitability should not be viewed as a gauge of the customer’s value; instead, it is a measurement of the value of a company’s customer-business interface – how well a company understands, informs, serves and profits from its CRM efforts.To interact effectively with each customer at any given touchpoint you need to understand what customers actually value. From a humanistic standpoint, successful firms understand customer needs and desires and meet them with relevant and timely offers. Analytical CRM can provide an understanding of the economic drivers and variables in each relationship and, therefore, useful clues to customer needs.It was not until recently that technology tools were developed to measure and optimise customer equity at a deeply detailed level on an enterprise scale. Working together in the late 1990s, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Teradata developed a data warehouse-driven value engine which accurately measures and tracks customer profitability. Since then RBC has used profitability analytics and event-driven customer relationship management to optimise customer equity and increase shareholder value.RBC had already been experimenting with customer profitability measurement. The key lesson learned was that truly useful customer profitability models had to begin with detailed, accurate, account or customer level activity-based costing information. A substantial challenge as it required close co-operation between finance, marketing, and IT. However, all parties recognised the value of the effort.The bank found that profitability rankings changed by at least two deciles for 75 per cent of customers, highlighting the improved accuracy. Further, RBC realised that customer profitability calculations were not enough. It came to understand that customers can be both profitable and have the potential to be profitable, and that the bank needs both kinds. Customer lifetime value tools, using historical profitability information, enabled RBC to determine which customers had high potential to be profitable in the longer term.Once the bank had the tools and processes in place to determine customer profitability and lifetime value, it included those measures when making customer decisions. This encompassed customised marketing campaigns, alignment of pricing discretion and service levels based on relationship depth (products held) and potential (lifetime value).The insights gained from RBC’s deep access to detailed customer information are used to guide organisational strategy and structure as well as daily decisions made by thousands of customer-facing employees. RBC is uniquely successful among customer equity-optimising companies because it incorporates a deep understanding of customers into all of its day-to-day operations. Employees are given the freedom and latitude to use the value of customer focus in nearly all their actions.This “scientific” marketing focus is increasingly going to become the rule rather than the exception, as the value of customer relationships is understood as the key driver of a firm’s market value. The practice of customer equity optimisation is important for more reasons than its impact on shareholder value – but that in itself seems reason enough to take it seriously.Ronald S.

532;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-10-16T18:43:17Z;Nokia profits suffer as rivals cut prices;;Nokia reported a sharp fall in third quarter profit on Thursday after being caught by competitors slashing their prices and consumers cutting spending.The world’s largest mobile phone manufacturer said net income fell 31 per cent to €1.09bn ($1.46bn) in the three months to September 30 against the same period last year.Gartner, the research firm, responded by cutting its growth forecast for the number of mobiles purchased by consumers in 2008. It said sales of handsets made by Nokia and its competitors would increase by 8 per cent from 2007, down from a previous forecast of 11 per cent.It is the first time in three-and-a-half years that Nokia has reported a year-on-year decline in its global market share of mobiles shipped to customers. The company’s shares closed down 4.2 per cent at €11.30.Nokia’s market share was 38 per cent in the third quarter of 2008, compared with 39 per cent during the same period last year. In the second quarter, Nokia’s market share was 40 per cent.Nokia became the world’s largest mobile maker by carving out a leading position in emerging markets, but Samsung and Sony Ericsson are fighting back by cutting prices. The number of Nokia mobiles shipped to Latin America fell 28 per cent in the third quarter compared with the preceding three months, and 8 per cent in Asia-Pacific.In the US and Europe, where the effect of the financial crisis is seeping into the broader economy, consumers are buying fewer mobiles to replace handsets.However, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, Nokia’s chief executive, urged investors to retain confidence in the company. “The basic virtues of Nokia – scale, brand, global position – are, in more difficult times, even more valuable relative to the competition,” he said.Nokia expects its market share to be flat or slightly up in the fourth quarter ­compared with the preceding three months, even though the last part of the year is by far the strongest period because of sales over Christmas.Mr Kallasvuo said the guidance reflected Nokia’s focus on maximising its “bottom line”, although he added the fourth quarter could also be “slightly muted” because of the economic downturn.The company reported ­revenue of €12.2bn for the third quarter, down 5 per cent, and operating profit of €1.5bn, down 21 per cent.Richard Windsor, analyst at Nomura, said Nokia’s profit margin should improve in the fourth quarter as it starts selling its latest smartphones, including its first device with a touch screen.
533;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-10-16T16:45:58Z;MicroHoo 2: Just when you thought it was safe to get back in the water;;"If you’re a journalist, you have to love Steve Ballmer. Something quotable always seems to be falling out of his mouth. In public, he is a mixture of loud-mouthed bully, bumbling reasonableness and calculating shark.So which persona was responsible for his comment today at a Gartner technology symposium in Florida? According to a Bloomberg report, the Microsoft CEO said that a deal with Yahoo “may still make economic sense for shareholders of both companies,” though there are no talks going on at the moment.That has been enough to push Yahoo’s shares up 12 per cent on what is another very iffy day for the stock market.Mr Ballmer’s handlers are already trying to play down his comment: it was made in response to a question, it doesn’t signal any change in Microsoft’s stance towards Yahoo, it’s the view he’s held for some time, etc etc.The reality, though, is that public comments like this have a purpose. This is Ballmer as bully, bumbler and shark combined: a clear message to Yahoo that if things get much worse (and they just might, with the display advertising market heading south and the Google advertising pact hanging in the balance) Microsoft might – just might - be tempted back to the table.Update: The plot thickens. Microsoft has now put out with this statement:Our position hasn’t changed. Microsoft has no interest in acquiring Yahoo!; there are no discussions between the companies.That “no interest” is pretty strong.So what was Ballmer up to? The “bumbling reasonableness” case is that he was simply responding to a hypothetical question (indeed, it may still make economic sense.) But if he really has no interest, it seems highly disingenuous to allow himself to be led down a blind alley like this.That leaves the “calculating shark” explanation. With Yahoo and AOL trying to reach a deal, it’s not a bad time for Ballmer to put down a marker about Microsoft’s continuing (hypothetical) interest. It certainly doesn’t make life any easier for Yahoo board members, who already face enough difficult choices deciding where to turn."
534;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-10-14T22:29:01Z;Intel needs seven weeks to assess damage;;In a sign of the current economic uncertainty, Intel is bringing back mid-quarter updates on its financial progress after a three-year absence.The last one it issued was in the fourth quarter of 2005. After that, Paul Otellini, chief executive, said it was abandoning them because they were “increasingly irrelevant” to the company’s long-term growth.Now, the technology sector is in such an unpredictable state due to the credit crunch and financial turmoil that Intel is finding it hard to forecast more than a few weeks ahead.On its third-quarter earnings call, Mr Otellini said Intel had noticed softness in the corporate sector in September and “consumer traffic” had become light, despite “healthy interest” in notebooks and netbooks.He said it was clear the financial crisis was creating signs of stress and announced Intel would deliver a mid-quarter update on December 4.In related news, Gartner, the market researcher, put out its latest PC figures today, writes Kevin Allison. They show a 15 per cent jump in PC shipments in the third quarter. That decent headline figure masked signs that the economic crunch has begun to hit the PC business, however.While growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa was strong, US growth lagged at just 4.6 per cent. China was also slower than usual.Gartner analyst Mika Kitagawa says the typical back-to-school sales spike did not materialise this quarter in the US as price cuts failed to stimulate sales as much as some computer makers had hoped. That is bound to be troubling news for companies now focused on the holiday shopping season.One additional surprise in the Gartner data was the fact that Acer passed HP to become Europe’s leading PC maker by shipments in the period – the first time HP has lost the top spot since its merger with Compaq six years ago, and to an Asian competitor no less! The Gartner figures showed that Acer accounted for about 20.6 per cent of PCs shipped in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the third quarter, putting HP in second place with 18.7 per cent of the market. Acer, which is based in Taiwan, has been carving out big market share gains in recent quarters, but this is a real feather in its cap.
535;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-10-08T16:12:16Z;HTC Touch Pro smartphone;;"Windows Mobile phones lag behind Nokia and Research in Motion’s BlackBerry in terms of market share, but Microsoft’s platform is catching up fast.Gartner calculates that sales of Windows-based smartphones were 20 per cent higher in the second quarter of 2008 than a year ago. One reason is the efforts of handset makers to combine more attractive, easier to use designs with the business functions of Windows Mobile.Handset maker HTC’s latest business phone – the Touch Pro – shows just what can be done when those elements come together. The Touch Pro combines TouchFlo 3D, the touch interface first shown on the Touch Diamond handset with a slide-out physical keyboard.TouchFlo is not quite as intuitive as the iPhone’s touch interface, but it works well enough for managing the phone’s basic functions, such as making calls, light web browsing or looking up calendar entries or contacts. Features such as the cute weather page and clock, carried over from the Touch Diamond, make the touch interface fun to use.The phone has plenty of business features, too, such as support for high speed, HSDPA web browsing, GPS, Wi-Fi, out of the box support for Exchange e-mail synchronisation and the improved security features of Windows Mobile 6.1.On the downside, the Touch Pro doesn’t feel all that responsive. Touch commands could be quicker. It also takes a few seconds before the phone registers that the keyboard is extended and it allows you to type.The fact that HTC includes a stylus with the phone serves as a reminder that the Windows menu system is alive and well under the TouchFlo skin: all but the most casual users will use the stylus quite a lot.The screen is high resolution, but relatively small (2.8 inches), so navigating those menus can be challenging. The Touch Pro is much more pocket friendly than many earlier Windows Mobile phones, but after a few hours use, a larger device might actually feel more comfortable.Sometimes a larger, lower-resolution screen is easier to use, for example in poor light. Nor is battery life on the Touch Pro – two days at best – good enough to persuade this writer to give up his BlackBerry.The HTC Touch Pro is one of the best Windows Mobile smartphones yet. But in trying to upgrade a consumer handset to business class, HTC has produced a good smartphone rather than a true wireless PDA for the road warrior. Heavy e-mail users who do not need to run Windows Mobile applications could also look at Nokia’s E71 or the new, 3G, BlackBerry Bold.HTC Touch Pro: £475 + VAT; available in Europe now and the US later this quarter."
536;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-10-08T16:00:46Z;"Green data centres are an oxymoron; eco-friendly data centres are not";;Two of the US’s largest online businesses recently relocated their data centres close to a hydroelectric dam. After employees, their largest operating cost was electricity.The move towards what are eco-friendly data centres that draw on renewable energy resources is expected to reduce power consumption dramatically and save considerable sums of money. In the UK, the average cost of running a data centre is about £5.3m a year. This is predicted to double to £11m within five years, according to the BroadGroup consultancy. One of the main reasons is the spiralling cost of power.Gartner, the IT industry analysts, have pointed out that IT managers are running out of the power required to run their data centres. Illustrating this, new data centres and expansion of existing facilities in the City of London has been blocked. Companies are restricted from adding more computing equipment because the required power is not immediately available. Energy suppliers are attributing this to the need to prepare for the surge in demand that the 2012 Olympics will bring.The UK government’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has acknowledged the deleterious impact of surging power consumption. It currently estimates that the IT industry accounts for 4 per cent of UK CO2 emissions. In the next two years, this is set to grow by 180 per cent. In a bid to head off the damaging consequences a raft of new standards are emerging to inform best practice energy-efficient data centre design.However, company CIOs can set the agenda, too, by providing quotas to their departments for energy-efficiency or carbon limits. This particular dynamic, when harnessed to investor driven carbon reduction targets, can be extremely powerful in creating a climate for the development of eco-friendly data centres. Another route rapidly gaining popularity is awarding bonuses for meeting energy-efficiency targets.However, as evinced by the two US companies, the drive towards eco-friendly data centres is well underway, informed by an acute sense of the benefits of energy-efficient operations. In fact, it’s fair to say that all new data centre building, whether in China, France, Holland or anywhere else is now being carried out to high eco-friendly standards, such as Leadership in Environmental Energy and Design (LEED) and the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) and incorporating a wide range of energy-efficient technologies.The measures that can be taken vary from region to region. For example, Hitachi data centres in Yokoyama have incorporated simple roof gardens that reflect the sun’s heat, lowering the internal heat by several degrees. This in turn substantially reduces the amount of power required to cool the data centre internally.Power usage efficiency (PUE) is a metric used to measure the energy efficiency of a data centre. Most data centres are currently running at a PUE of 3.0 which means if a server demands 500 watts then the power from the utility grid needed to deliver the 500 watts to the server is three times that amount, or 1500 watts. This figure alone illustrates the enormous energy consumption of data centres, relative to their output. Most new data centres today are targeting a PUE of 1.7, but a PUE of 1.6 is certainly achievable and there are some data centres under construction aiming for even lower PUEs.PUEs are important because they also provide clients who use hosted data centre services with an indication of energy consumption. In the near future, they will be used by potential clients as a deciding factor as to which data centre service to use.Data centre site selection is a complex art as organisations adopt a multi-data centre estate. Basell II accord and business continuity requirements are driving organisations to separate their data centres from business operations to mitigate risk. Additional organisations are assessing energy market volatility and energy supply risk in their risk assessments. While primary data centre selection is driven by proximity to customer market, secondary and disaster recovery sites may be located near to alternative energy sources such as bio-mass power plants and hydroelectric power stations, dramatically reducing energy consumption.Eco-friendly data centre design is also driven by new energy efficient building regulations in the UK that demand by 2010 that 10 per cent of the energy supplies for new buildings must be generated at site location. At the moment, only 5 per cent of the total amount of energy generated in the UK comes from renewable sources. Not only has this energy source been bagged by forward-looking companies, there is also a waiting list. To compound difficulties for some, London’s former mayor Ken Livingstone, stipulated that London-based companies must ensure 20 per cent of energy comes from renewable sources.Organisations affected by this “London-ruling” and those not yet ready to build new data centres, can benefit from technologies and processes that reduce power consumption, such as data de-duplication and turbine units that create refrigerated air for cooling the data centre by drawing on free external air.While data centres cannot be green in the true sense of the word because by definition they draw enormous amounts of power, there are business demands and government regulations that require that they adopt an eco-friendly design. That is, far more energy-efficient than they are today.To achieve this requires just a little forward-thinking and investment that, in the face of spiralling energy costs, will deliver a relatively quick return on investment.Alec Selvon Bruce is eco solutions champion for Hitachi Data Systems UK, a provider of technology storage solutions
537;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-10-08T15:12:16Z;Implementation: The long and the short of measuring carbon footprint;;Calculating the supply chain’s carbon footprint and monitoring the effect of actions to reduce it is still evolving. There are a number of standards and software approaches.“Carbon calculations are still almost at the back of an envelope stage,” says Martin Christopher, chairman of the Cranfield Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management. “There is not yet even total universal agreement on the carbon impact of different modes of transport.”The first step is to assess the internal operations that the organisation controls, such as inbound and outbound transport and site processes, using existing information. The next stage is to extend the process up and down the supply chain.“There are some relatively simple no-cost or low-cost opportunities that can save 20 per cent of the energy cost base, such as staff awareness and training, process changes, better maintenance, equipment upgrades and insulation,” says Euan Murray, a senior manager at The Carbon Trust. “The main gains are often outside the organisation’s direct control, which can have a bigger impact than doing the next internal project.”The necessary calculations can be made using a spreadsheet, but Allan Behrens, a director at Cambashi, a manufacturing management consultancy, advises talking to existing suppliers of software, especially core business applications and engineering. “Find out what capabilities they have within the application to measure the carbon footprint through the supply chain,” he says.Companies such as Access Accounting, Infor and SAS have dedicated carbon modules. Supply chain simulation and optimisation tools are also being extended, such as Ilog LogicNet Plus.The Carbon Trust uses PRé Consultants’ SimaPro and PE International’s GaBi. Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail management consulting firm, uses Cast from Barloworld Optimus and Supply Chain Guru from Llamasoft.Other packages include CarbonView from Supply Chain Consulting and Spective from Maersk Logistics.“The planning models used to determine what to make, where and when to make it and where to locate inventory are focused on profit or revenue maximisation,” says Simon Mingay, research vice-president at Gartner, the analyst. “However, they can be extended to include carbon emissions, which means that business decisions can be made with the knowledge of their possible environmental impacts.”Judy Blackburn, head of the UK logistics team at Kurt Salmon Associates, says the benefit of using software is that many different scenarios can be modelled relatively quickly. This identifies the trade-offs between cost, service and carbon emissions, helping to define the best solution for the company’s objectives.Whichever package is used, it is important that the information is integrated into the organisation’s reporting systems, particularly performance management systems based on business intelligence software. This is able to take in data from all operational systems and make any necessary conversions and calculations to produce emission-related key performance indicators.“You will never get all processes into a single application,” says Ambuj Goyal, general manager for information management software at IBM. “The supply chain needs internal financial, distribution and logistics data, as well as data from partners. You need to populate the performance management system with cleansed data from hundreds of applications to create trusted information for analysis. One tool will not solve the problem.”Giles Hutchins, head of sustainability solutions for Atos Consulting, advises that rather than just measuring the immediate carbon cost, sustainability should be embedded into the DNA of the organisation. Performance management systems help to communicate internally, to drive behaviour change, and externally to shareholders, pressure groups and consumers.The problems of measurement should not be underestimated, as there are a number of difficult questions that the standards* are trying to address. Does the carbon footprint of a machine include the cost of the operator driving to work or washing their work clothes? How do you allocate the running costs of a truck or factory energy over the different products? What is the difference between shipping rail freight pulled by diesel-electric or pure diesel?“Transferring or collating information through the supply chain is very tough,” says Mr Behrens at Cambashi. “Everybody has different systems and nobody wants to open up their internal infrastructure to connect them together, although some supply chains enforce it.”Dwight Klappich, research vice-president at Gartner, says that although carbon footprint is the primary focus today, in the future users will need to consider other factors that affect their environment. These might include direct operational emissions of other pollutants, energy consumption and waste generated.Sound advice comes from John Lockton, managing director at LCP Consulting, a supply chain management consultancy. “The most effective way to approach carbon management is to apply business principles to the environment,” he says, “not environmental principles to business.”* The ISO 14000 group of standards provides a guide to environmental management principles, systems and supporting techniques. It dates back to 2004 and is being built upon in the fast-track, publicly available standard, PAS 2050. This is by BSI British Standards, at the request of the UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and The Carbon Trust.The Carbon Trust is heavily influenced by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a partnership between the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, a global association of companies. The Global Reporting Initiative has produced Sustainability Reporting Guidelines for economic, environmental and social performance, together with sector supplements, including one for logistics, and national annexes.

It says:“Some of the world’s best known mobile operators, PC companies and chipset providers are uniting to pre-install Mobile Broadband onto a range of notebook PCs that will be ready to switch on and surf straight out of the box. The 91-country initiative is the first step in the GSMA’s vision to create a new world of always-connected devices.”The GSMA says it will also unveil “a new global service mark” that will be used to help consumers identify Mobile Broadband ready devices.“The Mobile Broadband service mark will simplify buying decisions, especially for consumers.”So it could come down to a battle of the branding – Intel WiMAX Inside versus Mobile Broadband.Still, there seems to be a big enough pie in the oven to share. Gartner estimates 200m mobile broadband users in 2009 and Informa estimates 1.3bn by 2012.
539;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Challenge to iPhone heats up;;The battle to dominate the mobile smartphone market is about to heat up with the launch of long-awaited handsets by Google, Nokia and Sony Ericsson.On Tuesday, Google unveiled the first smartphone powered by the internet search company’s Android operating system.Next Tuesday, Sony Ericsson is due to launch its X1 smartphone with Nokia poised to unveil its first smartphone with a touchscreen facia two days later. All three handsets will compete with Apple’s iPhone.Some industry analysts say the new smartphones will struggle to match the iPhone. “The bottom line is that the iPhone will remain in a different class,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner.The Google smartphone, called the G1, has been made by HTC, the Taiwanese mobile manufacturer. It will be available with T-Mobile, the mobile operator owned by Deutsche Telekom, Germany’s leading telecoms company. The G1, with Google’s Android operating system in its guts, has a large touchscreen facia. A qwerty keyboard slides out of the handset’s side for tasks such as typing e-mails.Similarly to Apple’s iPhone, users of the G1 will be able to customise their handsets by downloading software applications capable of running mobile internet services.T-Mobile’s US subsidiary is expected to start selling the G1 next month for $199. That price will put it on a par with Apple’s iPhone. The G1 is likely to go on sale in the UK in November, and in Germany early next year.Sony Ericsson’s X1 smartphone is intended to improve the mobile maker’s small market share in the US, but the handset launches first in the UK, Germany and Sweden on September 30.Given the popularity of Apple’s iPhone, Nokia has been criticised by some analysts for not producing a touchscreen smartphone sooner. Nokia’s touchscreen smartphone will be available with the company’s new music offering. Nokia’s Comes With Music service will offer consumers unlimited access to music by the world’s leading music companies for a year.
540;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-09-16T15:53:29Z;Security matters: Every piece of data lengthens a digital shadow;;According to the computer industry, the amount of data stored on IT systems is doubling roughly every 18 months to two years. Industry watchers believe that the total size of the worldwide digital archive stands at just short of 10m petabytes.Much of that data is being generated by businesses, in the form of e-mails, PowerPoint presentations and the output from enterprise IT systems. Another large chunk of data comes from the move towards digital storage and distribution of music, TV, photographs and even books.A large and growing amount of this digital data is either about, or generated by, individuals, quite possibly without their knowledge. Internet users might post personal information on blogs or on social networking sites such as Facebook or MySpace, or business networking sites such as LinkedIn.But we also hand over personal data whenever we interact with a website, either by logging on to carry out banking and other financial transactions or, in the case of many e-commerce sites, simply by searching. Amazon.com, for example, remembers what you searched for last time you visited the site and also lists items bought by other shoppers who entered similar search terms.Such shopping hints can be fun and even useful. But, as Jannis Kallinikos, professor of information systems at the London School of Economics cautions, it also leads to a build-up of an alternative, online persona or “digital shadow”.Professor Kallinikos describes the digital shadow as a series of traces, left by individuals each time they do something online. “What can or should become of our growing digital shadows is destined to become a contested and probably bitter economic and political issue,” he says.The growth of the digital shadow raises questions about both privacy and security. Some internet users – especially the younger generation – might not mind if their searches or transactions are recorded and, if that information is then used to offer shopping hints or promotions.Others, though, might not be so sanguine. It is easy to see how even something as innocent as an online search for books could become a privacy issue: you might not want details of searches about a sensitive medical condition, or still less a subject such as marital infidelity, to show up the next time someone visits that site from the family PC.Often, individuals will have little or no control over such data, or how it is used. Ownership of data is typically held by the online store in question, according to Kelly Dempski, director of research for Human-Computer Interaction at Accenture Technology Labs. But younger internet users appear to have few qualms about divulging information, even to commercial organisations.“I have a member of staff working for me who is in his early 30s and he has pictures of his son on [photo-sharing site] Flickr,” he says. “He has established his own rules about what he will share: anything he doesn’t want his grandmother to see, doesn’t go online. He believes that the benefits of sharing information outweigh the risks.”Nonetheless, some social networking sites, such as Facebook, have moved to enhance the security and privacy settings on offer to their members. But, as Mr Demski points out, social networking sites have to strike a balance between allowing members freedom of expression, protecting their privacy and keeping sites convenient to use.“There are question marks about implementing security controls in a way that is easy to use and easy to understand,” he says. “If you confront someone with 15 different options, they won’t know how to set it up.”The need for individuals to control their digital shadow is becoming more pressing, however, as evidence grows that cybercriminals are targeting social networking sites for information that can then be used for identity theft and other forms of fraud.“There is a problem that, not just online, but throughout your life, you give away information that you consider personal and secret,” says Ken Silva, CTO of security technology company VeriSign. “For Americans, the social security number is given out so many times, to so many people, that it cannot be considered a secret. My date of birth and my mother’s maiden name are not secret …people give away an alarming amount of information, for very little in return.”There is a real risk, according to some information security experts, that cybercriminals will start by “harvesting” information from publicly-available websites such as social networks or even genealogy sites. Such harvesting could make it far easier for criminals to find the personal information they need to, say, operate a stolen or cloned credit card. In the wrong hands, even someone’s home address could be sensitive data.The problem is made more serious still, by the tendency for banks and other organisations to rely heavily on personal and biographical information to verify individuals’ identities, not just when they apply for accounts or services, but when they operate them. Password reset requests, for example, are all too often verified by asking personal questions such as someone’s mother’s maiden name.“We are granting credit or carrying out transactions on the basis of very weak information,” says Jay Heiser, research vice president at industry analysts Gartner. “Rather than finding stronger means of authentication, we are wrapping more after-the-fact protection around something that is already broken.”The answer could lie in moving to more robust forms of authentication, for anything from online shopping to banking services. Such measures could mean introducing either tokens, which generate one-time codes, or using biometric information. “There is no static information that can be kept secret for a lifetime,” says Verisign’s Mr Silva.However, the logistics of operating large-scale strong authentication systems might point towards the need to set up shared authentication services, to make the measures both convenient and cost effective. Relatively few such services exist.“There is already plenty of use of tokens and two-factor authentication in online banking and there are some innovative technologies being deployed, such as measuring the rhythm of your keystrokes,” explains Mike Maddison, leader of security and privacy services at Deloitte, the professional services firm. “But we are not yet seeing much in the way of outsourced authentication.”But if such measures were to become a reality, they would have an additional benefit: personal information would be personal, rather than the basis of security. Internet users would then be free to disclose whatever information they chose.
541;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-09-16T15:53:29Z;Personal view: ‘Markets set free by open source’;;"A quiet revolution is underway, led by the world’s most rapidly developing economies. Barriers to global trade have never been lower, nor has communication ever been simpler, driving political reform, cultural transparency, social progress – and a tidal wave of wealth creation.What’s driving that progress? The internet, of course.But look a little closer and it’s also attributable to an overwhelming endorsement of technology freedom, which is especially enthusiastic in developing markets.The word “free” has multiple meanings – in the land of technology, it describes a philosophy that rejects the proprietary dependencies typically exported by technology monoliths in developed nations. “Free” embraces collaboration, openness and standards – the latter without royalties or risk of patent litigation.Once the domain of uber-geeks and idealists, such open and free technology communities have taken root everywhere, and today affect the technologies used to write and archive legislation, to record and distribute news and entertainment and even how procurement is managed for massive federal agencies.It is no longer only student activists driving technology freedom, legislatures across the world are promoting the future of their political systems, the evolution of their media markets and their capacity to build wealth for their citizens by means of the global network. They have realised progress rests with their willingness and ability to take a position on technology standards, and open source software.Gartner, the research firm, projects that by 2012, 90 per cent of the world’s companies will be using open source software. If you look to the developing world today, our view is that the use of such software is already ubiquitous: companies across India, China, eastern Europe, and South and Central America are predominantly using open source software to create enormous wealth.But this is not just a corporate trend. Take Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, for example: eager to bridge a perceived technology gap between Brazil and wealthier economies, his government spearheaded a countrywide movement toward open standards, alongside free and open source software.The results: more than 70 per cent of Brazilian enterprises use open source software, a robust domestic software economy, and tens of millions of Brazilians getting involved – opening online bank accounts, creating internet businesses, and engaging in the political and electoral process, many for the first time.There are more than 1m software developers in China and India alone. Many cannot afford punitive technology licence fees, so they turn to open source equivalents, with names such as MySQL, Ubuntu, Linux, OpenSolaris, Java and OpenOffice.org.Using these resources, the global market is open to them for jobs and also for the businesses they can create using the same technologies that power Sun Microsystems, Google and Amazon.To give a sense of the numbers involved, OpenOffice.org is a free office software suite used by approximately 100m users across the world, with concentrations among developing nations. Many governments, including South Africa, India, and Malaysia embrace the open document formats at the heart of OpenOffice (known as ”Open Document Format” or ODF), helping them bring costs down and ensure all citizens will have equal access to important material years from now.But who on earth can build an entire business, or even economy on open source? As the reach of the internet spreads, so open source is becoming the foundation of the world’s most sophisticated (and lucrative) business models. From free search (Baidu) to free social networking (Xiaonei or Minglebox), free news (Sina.com) to free software (Sun Microsystems), free and open is a two-way street. There is a reason we are all so appreciative of the words free and open when we append the word “market” to them.The largest markets in the world are emerging before us – making use of free and open technologies and driven by those with the least to spend and the most to gain from global expansion. To that end, this Saturday has been declared International Software Freedom Day – representing not only the ideals of openness and freedom, but also the direction in which world economies are heading.Whether you are a business, developer, professor, student, consumer or government leader, the internet allows you to participate directly in broadening economic opportunity, speeding social progress and driving market efficiency. Opportunities are everywhere. Join in.Jonathan Schwartz is chief executive and president of Sun Microsystems; his blog can be found at blogs.sun.com/jonathan"
542;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-09-16T15:50:45Z;The interface: Gestures will force the mouse into retirement;;"At almost 30 years old, is the computer mouse ready for retirement? Certainly, a growing band of human-computer interaction (HCI) specialists believe so. The crude language of “point and click”, they argue, seriously limits the “conversations” we have with our computers.Among them is Bruce “Tog” Tognazzini, a veteran HCI expert who joined Apple in 1978 as its 66th employee and founded the company’s Human Interface Group during his 14 years there. These days, after spells at Sun Microsystems and online healthcare company WebMD, Mr Tognazzini is a respected consultant, author and speaker with usability company, the Nielsen Norman Group.“In many ways, our continued reliance on the computer mouse reduces us to little more than cavemen, running around pointing at symbols and ‘grunting’ with each click,” he says. “A revolution is long overdue, because we need more sophisticated tools that will allow us to increase our vocabulary way beyond that caveman grunt.” Plus, the link between the computer mouse and cases of repetitive strain injury (RSI) are hardly an argument in its favour, he adds.Luckily, he says, those “more sophisticated” tools are right in front of our faces and we already know how to use them. They are, in fact, our fingers.“Look at the facts: we’ve typically got 10 of these ‘tools’; they move in a multitude of different ways; and gestural language, which came long before verbal language, is an established and intuitive form of self-expression. Even primates can be trained to express needs and intentions using their fingers,” he points out.What has historically been lacking, is the ability of computers to read and understand our gestures – but that is changing very quickly. In fact, real-time video interpretation and inertial sensors are already being used to recognise facial expression and physical movement in a number of consumer technology devices, says Steven Prentice, an analyst with IT market research company Gartner.He traces the roots of this migration to two recent events: the launch of the Nintendo Wii games console in 2006 and of the Apple iPhone in 2007. Through clever use of accelerometers and optical sensor technology, the Wii Remote (or “wiimote”) is already enabling millions of people to practise their golf swings, play rock guitar or swordfight with imaginary enemies. And since the iPhone was launched, strong sales and high user satisfaction have reinforced just how powerful and intuitive a multitouch interface can be.These early announcements have been followed by a string of others in consumer technology. In recent months, Panasonic, Sony and NEC have all demonstrated applications that use facial and movement recognition. These include, for example, video displays from Panasonic that can identify users from their faces, serve up content choices based on their individual preferences, and that allow screen control by hand gestures.It’s easy for business leaders and chief information officers to dismiss such trends in consumer preference as minimally relevant to enterprise computing – but that’s a “dangerous oversimplification”, warns Mr Prentice. “Not all consumer-targeted technologies find their way directly into enterprise IT environments,” he concedes, “but the growing adoption of these technologies by individuals in their ‘personal infrastructures’ is leading to increasing frustration and dissatisfaction with constraints and restrictions the corporate IT environment often imposes on users.”Fortunately, it’s not just the consumer technology firms that have their eyes on gestural technologies. At Accenture Technology Labs, research director Kelly Dempski has a long track record in exploring how they can be used in business applications, most recently concentrating on building multi-touch, interactive display walls.Accenture has installed such walls, for example, in O’Hare International Airport in Chicago and John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. Consisting of multiple screens housed in giant custom frames, they use graphics and touch-screen technology to allow passengers to check the weather at their destination, read the latest news from CNN, or find out how their team scored while they were in flight, by simply touching areas on the screen.This technology, says Dempski, could have equally valuable back-office applications, presenting vital internal data from back-end enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to employees in a control room at a utility firm, for example. “The aim is to create a mode of interaction that requires zero training but offers a high degree of interactivity,” says Mr Dempski.At Microsoft, meanwhile, researcher Desney Tan is taking HCI to new levels: muscle-computer interaction. Mr Tan and his colleagues, alongside researchers from the Universities of Washington and Toronto, have developed an armband worn on the forearm that recognises finger movements by monitoring muscle activity. They have called it MUCI, which stands for muscle-computer interface and its aim is to make controlling computers and gadgets easier in situations where the user is otherwise engaged – for example, when driving a car or in a meeting.“The human body is a prolific signal-generator,” he says. “My work is focusing on the potential of tapping into the electromagnetic signals that the brain sends to muscles, which has the potential to harness a whole range of subtler movements than simply a press or a pinch on an interactive screen.”MUCI currently works extremely well in situations where major arm movements are constrained and finger gestures are made on a flat surface, he says. Tests on volunteers have shown that after calibration, the system can recognise the position and pressure of all 10 digits with 95 per cent accuracy.“Where we want to take this research next is to capturing gestures made in three-dimensional space,” he says, adding that the ability to do that and still recognise gestures with a fair degree of accuracy will start to open the door to a huge range of potential applications – even recognising and translating sign language used by deaf people.Naturally, applications based on gestural computing place a huge strain on underlying hardware, which is forced to process a larger volume and wider range of more subtle signals. Among chip manufacturers, this is forcing a shift in focus from traditional central processing units [CPUs] to the graphics processing units [GPUs] that, up to now, have primarily been used in gaming and virtual world environments.In essence, a GPU is a dedicated graphics rendering device for personal computers and games consoles that is very efficient at manipulating and displaying computer graphics.More important, the ability to process information in a highly parallel way makes GPUs far more effective at handling a large range of complex algorithms than CPUs, which process them in a linear, one-at-a-time fashion, explains Richard Huddy, worldwide head of developer relations at chip company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).“Say you’ve got an application that uses a webcam to capture shots of a human subject and analyse their gestures. It will need to figure out the relationship between each frame and its predecessor in, perhaps, one-sixtieth of a second, and there’s a lot of maths involved in doing that in a smooth and uninterrupted way. A GPU will do that much, much better,” he says.In order to get its slice of the gestural computing market, AMD is already locked in a pitched battle with rivals Intel and Nvidia to deliver advanced GPU capabilities to hardware manufacturers as soon as possible, with a slew of new product announcements planned for 2009.All this means that businesses need to be prepared. No one is predicting the instant demise of the computer mouse, and certainly not of the keyboard as a text-entry tool. “Despite the many disadvantages of a design nearing its centenary, nothing else currently comes close to the functionality of the conventional tactile keyboard,” says Mr Prentice of Gartner.But there will be a “strong and unstoppable” trend towards a control interface for technology that is based on simple human gestures, rather than on indirect manipulation via physical objects such as a mouse, he predicts.He says that revolution is three to five years off for mainstream business, but it’s not too soon for business leaders to “suspend their natural scepticism” and start to think about how gestural computing might be used to address their organisations’ most intractable user interface issues.“The phrase ‘paradigm shift’ is an overused one, but it’s not often that such fundamental elements of the computer interface change, and the opportunities for enterprises able to capitalise on these changes will be substantial,” he says."
543;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-09-12T16:57:43Z;The chip that changed the world;;The 50th anniversary of the integrated circuit is being celebrated today with Texas Instruments announcing Kilby Labs, a centre that will focus on further semiconductor breakthroughs.TI new employee Jack Kilby demonstrated the first IC to management on September 12 1958, after spending his first summer there developing a circuit on a single chip made of germanium.Robert Noyce, Intel’s co-founder, is credited as a co-inventor in coming up with the same idea shortly afterwards at Fairchild Semiconductor, except basing it on a silicon chip.Noyce died in 1990 and Kilby in 2005.TI said Kilby Labs would be based in Dallas and bring together university researchers and TI engineers to develop new chip advances. It has also recreated Kilby’s original lab at its headquarters as “a visual reminder of the power of science and technology.”Jim Tully, Gartner analyst, said in a note:“The integrated circuit is the engine of the information age. It has been a catalyst for the democratisation of knowledge and changing global social structures. It facilitates mass communication through mobile phones and large-scale access to information and entertainment through the Internet.”According to Gartner, sales of ICs have been growing at about 10 per cent annually for the past several decades and around $270bn worth of ICs will be sold globally in 2008.Not a bad outcome for a one-man summer project.
544;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-08-27T17:47:28Z;Emerging markets setback for mobile phones;;Mobile phone sales in emerging markets will be lower than many manufacturers hoped this year, according to new research, as rising inflation squeezes consumers there.Publishing its mobile sales statistics for the three months to June 30, Gartner, the research company, said on Wednesday that it had identified evidence of lower-than-expected purchases by consumers in emerging markets during the second quarter.In the first quarter of 2008, the economic slowdown had only impacted negatively on mobile sales in western Europe and the US.Carolina Milanesi, Gartner research director for mobile devices, said many consumers in emerging markets were choosing not to upgrade their first handsets to more sophisticated devices because of the inflation-driven squeeze on household spending.Gartner cut its 2008 forecast for global sales of mobile phones because of the slowdown in purchases by consumers in emerging markets.Previously, Gartner was estimating between 10 and 15 per cent growth in mobile sales in 2008 compared with 2007. It is now estimating growth of 11 per cent.Mobile phone sales reached 1.2bn in 2007, up 16 per cent on 2006.Gartner’s predicted slowdown in 2008 sales in developing countries will affect leading mobile phone manufacturers such as Nokia, Samsung, LG and Sony Ericsson.However, Ms Milanesi said Nokia and LG were better placed to withstand the problem than Samsung and Sony Ericsson.This is because Nokia and LG make mobiles for first-time users in emerging markets, which typically cost $25-$40.Because hundreds of millions of people in developing countries do not yet own mobiles, purchases by first-time users will ensure that handset sales continue to increase in emerging markets in 2008.The slowdown in sales in developing countries is focused on more sophisticated mobiles, which cost $60-$80. People are offered these devices as an upgrade from their starter mobiles.Samsung and Sony Ericsson have been seeking to increase their sales in emerging markets by providing upgrade devices to consumers.Gartner’s second-quarter research found that global sales of mobile phones reached 305m in the second quarter, up 12 per cent on the same period last year.
545;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-07-18T17:47:56Z;Sony Ericsson to slash staff numbers;;Sony Ericsson is slashing up to 17 per cent of its workforce, as the handset manufacturer announced disappointing second-quarter results.The company – a joint venture between Ericsson of Sweden and Japan’s Sony – reported a slide in second-quarter pre-tax profits to €8m ($12.7m), down from €327m in the same quarter last year and €193m in the first quarter of 2008.Dick Komiyama, president, said the company had too many similar products and needed to “sharpen its portfolio”.But with falling sales in Asia – the one area of global growth in handset sales – and a gloomy economic picture in Europe, he admitted that the third quarter would “not drastically improve. But there’s always Christmas”.Mr Komiyama emphasised the company would not be copying Nokia’s approach. “We will define our own strategy,” he said. But he admitted that “there is a lot of work to be done”.A new product launch is planned for Tuesday. According to a spokesperson, it “will have something to do with music”, probably as part of the Walkman range. Further details were not available.Carolina Milanesi, a Gartner analyst, thought that there was “a tone of defeat” coming from the company about the rest of 2008.“Talk of taking it day by day is not enough. [Sony] Ericsson need to refresh their products, but they must make sure that they don’t damage their brand.”The results were in line with a profit warning on June 27, when the company said it would only break even because of disappointing European handset sales.Sony Ericsson sold 24.4m units in the second quarter of 2008, down 500,000 from the same quarter last year. The average selling price dropped 7 per cent to €116.However, the company forecast growth in the global handset market of about 10 per cent, with demand coming from emerging markets.Sony Ericsson’s focus on high-end phones has left its handset sales exposed to a global slowdown, in contrast to Nokia, whose diversification into emerging markets and lower-end phones has helped it increase market share and lift sales.Shares in Ericsson closed up 3.6 per cent at SKr72.30.
546;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
547;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-07-17T00:03:41Z;Do not be fooled by these seemingly rosy PC shipments figures;;Gartner and IDC released their latest PC shipments figures on Wednesday, showing computer shipments up either 16 per cent or 15.3 per cent in the second quarter, depending on who you ask.Given the uncertainty in the global economy, it’s tempting to view the numbers – which were better than expected – as a sign that trouble in the financial and housing sectors has yet to spread to the IT sector. But do not be fooled: beneath these rosy headline figures lie clues about an impending slowdown.IDC said growth in computer shipments in Asia was slower than expected during the quarter- a situation it blamed on rising energy prices and other inflation concerns cutting into IT spending there. If true, that would undercut one of technology bulls’ key arguments heading into the current downturn – that robust sales in Asia and other fast-growing emerging markets should help offset weakness in the US.Adding to the clouded outlook, Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa says that the rise in the number of computers shipped masked steep declines in average selling prices, particularly in the US and Europe. While it is common for PC prices to fall from year to year, steeper than expected price cuts could hit PC makers’ profit margins, and prolonged price pressure could put the squeeze on smaller PC makers. Ms Kitagawa says the industry “could ultimately see a significant wave of consolidation if stronger vendors continue to press their pricing advantage.”So what is the bottom line? Unfavourable economic fundamentals mean that “demand could remain depressed in the coming quarters if economic pressures continue, even with sustained price decreases,” says David Doud, an IDC analyst.
548;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-07-16T02:33:23Z;Fibre roll-out to speed UK broadband;;According to Ofcom, UK customers enjoy an average download speed of 4.6Mbps. Anyone who has logged on at 6pm on a weekday would probably laugh at that figure.With some customers several miles from the local exchange on old copper wire, and many sharing connections with up to 50 households linked to one streetside cabinet, such speeds, let alone the advertised 8Mbps, are the stuff of dreams.That might not matter too much if you are checking your e-mail, but as internet protocol television catches on the slowness will grate – streamed programmes can freeze and downloads can take hours rather than minutes with a super-fast connection.The UK has a high take-up of broadband – 58 per cent according to Gartner research – the same as France, and ahead of Germany (49 per cent), the US (54 per cent) and Japan (55 per cent), but behind South Korea at 93 per cent.But it is the speed of connection where the UK falls down the world league table, and where BT’s fibre roll-out – orchestrated by Ian Livingston – will help.Japan has the highest fibre-to-the-home connections, with 9.7m subscribers as of 2007. NTT offers a 1 gigabite per second service, which is the fastest widely available connection in the world. South Korea is the world leader when all broadband figures are taken into account: the highest penetration rate, 100 per cent availability and more than 4.5m homes on fibre connections offering 50-100Mbps.In France, the fibre launch has begun in several big cities, with a target of 1m connections by the end of this year, concentrating on fibre-to-the-home.Deutsche Telekom in Germany has argued with European commissioner Viviane Reding over giving competitors wholesale access to the VDSL2 fibre-to-the-cabinet network it is launching with speeds of up to 50Mbps.In the US, Verizon has launched FiOS, a 50Mbps fibre-to-the-home service that accounts for 1.8m of the 2.9m US homes that are connected to fibre.
549;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-07-14T18:16:04Z;3G iPhone sales hit 1m during opening weekend;;Apple sold 1m 3G iPhones during the handset’s opening weekend, the computer maker said on Monday, as customers in 21 countries rushed to get their hands on the new version of the popular touch-screen device.Steve Jobs, chief executive, hailed what he called a “stunning opening weekend” for the new device.News of the performance sent Apple’s shares up 1.1 per cent to $174.52 in New York.Apple’s announcement came in spite of software problems that plagued the 3G handset’s initial launch on Friday, after a flood of new users overwhelmed Apple’s iTunes servers, leaving many customers unable to activate their new handsets.In spite of these problems, the handset’s opening weekend should put Apple on track to pass its goal of selling 10m iPhones by the end of the year, said Tom Smith, an equity analyst at Standard & Poor’s.“It’s a strong number for an opening,” Mr Smith said. “Clearly there’s a wave going, and Apple should be able to make its target, if there was any doubt.”While Apple’s 1m sales figure for the new iPhone was impressive, it represented only a fraction of the total number of mobile handsets sold around the world each year.Nokia, the world’s biggest handset maker, sold 115m mobile handsets in the first quarter, according to the latest figures from Gartner, the market research group. Total handset sales were 294m in the period.The 3G phone’s launch comes as Apple is attempting to turn the iPhone into a new type of platform with appeal to both consumer and corporate users.Apple said on Monday that its iPhone applications store, which sells software designed to run on the handset, had logged 10m downloads since Friday.With the launch of the 3G device, Apple and its partners have tried to remove barriers that limited the appeal of the original iPhone. Most significantly, Apple and its mobile partners have abandoned the relatively high upfront price in favour of the subsidised price prevalent in Europe and the US.The result is a faster handset available for $199 in the US with a two-year contract – a fraction of its original $499 price tag.Read more on the iPhone at the FT’s Tech Blog
550;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-07-13T13:55:18Z;Speak nicely and I’ll tell you who you are;;Allied Irish Bank (AIB) had an all-too-familiar and costly problem two years ago: its employees kept forgetting their passwords. The bank’s service desk had six full-time employees dedicated to dealing with 160,000 requests for new passwords a year. At peak times, the number of staff increased to eight.Today, head office employees can reset their passwords at any time of the day and need not queue for up to three minutes on the phone: their calls are answered straightaway.The dramatic turnround was the result of implementing a voice biometrics system that identifies the voice of the person phoning in. The bank is one of a growing number of companies to use voice biometrics systems. Its use goes beyond helping employees change passwords, however: it is increasingly being deployed by financial services companies in the battle against fraud.The system is relatively easy to set up. At AIB, its 10,000 head office employees enrolled in the system by calling a number and repeating some words, which enabled the VoiceVault biometric system to capture a “voice print”: a digital representation of the unique characteristics of the caller’s voice. After that, resetting passwords is automatic.While AIB has seen rapid returns on its investment by reducing the number of hours its help desk spends resetting employees’ passwords, the biggest interest is coming from businesses that want to use voice biometric systems to authenticate the identity of customers.According to Steve Cramoysan, a research director at Gartner, the research firm, current authentication methods on the phone are inadequate.“The standard practice is to ask a series of questions: they ask for name, account number, address, date of birth and social security number. All those things are discoverable, and sometimes people don’t like giving out all that information.”While voice biometric technology has been around for a long time, it is only in the past year that its accuracy has reached a level that makes it feasible for use with customers.The other main technical development driving adoption, says Martyn Eley, chief executive of VoiceVault, is the increase in computer processing power: “We have processors now which are running 10 times faster than they were four or five years ago. So we can implement algorithms that would have taken 10 seconds to run in 2000, but now take one second to run, and can be used commercially.”Accuracy can now be very high: Mr Eley says that, in a trial with a UK bank, VoiceVault managed to achieve an error rate of below 2 per cent. Modern systems can differentiate between identical twins and correctly identify someone even if they have a heavy cold. The most common difficulty arises if there has been a long period (say, two years) between someone registering on the system and using it: the voice can age during that time, and the user may need to re-register.And there is an inevitable trade-off: most banks would rather reject a handful of bona fide callers than let through a fraudster, so there will always be a small proportion of genuine callers who will need to be put through to an operator for verification.Organisations generally combine voice biometric technology with another security measure. When bank ABN Amro piloted a voice biometrics system with external customers, those people, after dialling in and giving an account number, heard their own voice asking them a secret question, such as: “What is your mother’s maiden name?”The technology has another potential security use: in the US, the health provider Wellpoint has adopted voice biometrics as a way of generating legally binding digital signatures. “When you speak, we can generate a biometric signature from your voice which would be associated with the transaction. When the agent has completed your health application over the phone, you can “sign” it using your voice, so you don’t have to sign the documents when they come through the post,” says Mr Eley.So far, voice biometrics implementations have been small scale, says Mr Cramoyson. But he is confident of their future. “It’s difficult to say that now is the tipping point but we’re getting close.”
551;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-07-08T15:33:09Z;Staying connected: Technology on holiday;;The temptation to throw the laptop and the BlackBerry in with the suntan lotion, sunglasses and bathing costume is irresistible for many business people – even when the trip they are about to take is supposed to be holiday rather than work.But packing the laptop along with the mask, snorkel and flippers could actually be a very good idea if you need to stay in touch with the office, colleagues or customers while on vacation. At the very least, it may make corporate “re-entry” after a spell on the beach a little easier.“From a work-life balance perspective, having access to corporate e-mail is a double-edged sword,” notes Leif-Olof Wallin of Gartner, the IT consultancy. “Some employees might feel less stress if they know that nothing important is in their inbox while on vacation while others regard it as stressful to check e-mail while on vacation.”Either way, he says, “we see more and more people bringing along a notebook on vacation”.So what options does the vacationing business traveller have for staying in touch with the office? Staying connected while on holiday has become easier in recent years thanks to the expanding range of portable hardware devices and the growing penetration of wireless e-mail and data services including cellular and Wi-Fi-based services.Hardware options range from the “thin and light” laptops now found in most PC makers’ product portfolios to smartphone devices such as Research in Motion’s BlackBerry family. But most consultants sound a note of caution, pointing out that consumer-grade equipment is not designed for relatively hostile environments like the beach or the pool, where sand and water can do serious damage.At the very least, they suggest, it is worth considering investing in protective bags, cases and covers for delicate electronic devices including smartphones and iPods. Several manufacturers including Otter Box (www.otterbox.com) offer a range of waterproof cases for electronic gear while Zagg (www.zagg.com) sells a super tough and scratch proof transparent “skin” called Invisible Shield designed to protect many types of handheld device.Another option is to choose rugged equipment such as Panasonic’s range of Toughbook laptops or Motorola’s family of enterprise digital assistants, including the MC75, which incorporate technologies and design features intended to protect them from day-to-day knocks.The choice of what hardware to travel with is an important consideration, but arguably ensuring connectivity while outside the office is even more crucial. Fortuantely the spread of Wi-Fi hotspots and the advent of 3G broadband wireless services have made this easier.At the most basic level, advances in technology mean there is no reason today to pay the inflated telephone fees most hotels charge, or incur the exorbitant international roaming charges that wireless carriers often impose.Mobile phone owners can use one of the new internet-based mobile VoIP (voice over internet protocol) services such as Jajah (www.jajah.com), Yeigo (www. yeigo.com) or Rebtel (www.rebtel.com) to cut call costs, or use a PC with an internet connection, Skype software and a headset or USB phone to make a call.For international travellers with access to a Wi-Fi connection – for example in a hotel room – another alternative is to carry a Skype-based Wi-Fi handset, now offered by a handful of network equipment companies including Netgear (www.netgear.com) and Cisco’s Linksys unit (www.linksys.com).Most network equipment makers and others including Apple also offer portable Wi-Fi routers which can be plugged into a hotel Ethernet connection and enable the user to set up an instant and secure in-room Wi-Fi “hotspot” that can be used for data or VoIP voice communications.If you already carry a 3G cellular wireless data card for use in a laptop, you can also add a wireless datacard mobile router such as Kyocera’s KR2 (www.kyocera.com). This clever device enables users to create an instant Wi-Fi hotspot anywhere there is a 3G signal simply by plugging a 3G datacard or USB device into the box.A growing number of corporate laptops including models from HP, Dell, Toshiba and Sony also come with built-in cellular wireless data modules in addition to their now standard Wi-Fi capabilities.Generally, analysts note, GSM-based mobile phones, smartphones and datacards provide the maximum connection flexibility when travelling overseas (because of the global reach of GSM-based networks) but travellers who are going way off the beaten path may want to consider a satellite-based voice and data service such as those offered by Inmarsat.Sometimes though, corporate customers want to sign up for an integrated package of connectivity services. “The best solutions combine fixed and mobile, voice, data and multimedia services into a single integrated, secure, and effective service that will fit the profile of multinational organisations,” says Yvan van Welden, director of outsourcing services at Hewlett-Packard, Europe.Mr Van Welden explains: “A piece of robust software resides on the user’s notebook or Tablet PC and PDA that will select the best possible available connection. All this happens behind the scenes as far as the user is concerned, although if they want, they can still select their preferred connection. The VPN (Virtual Private Network – a connection tunnel to a corporate network) happens automatically and invisibly to the user.“For the CIO and IT Director this solution can help wipe out management complexity as they can monitor everything through a web portal for online reporting and any change management for application and security policy,“ Mr van Welden says. “It also means they can avoid cost control headaches for widespread misuse of mobile phones or hidden costs from exorbitant hotel Wi-Fi bills.”Another option for corporate IT departments (or individuals) trying to manage the cost and complexity of providing access to a corporate network while travelling is to sign up for a service such as iPass.Among its offerings iPass has developed the iPass Mobile Office software suite which provides a convenient single interface enabling users to access the world’s largest virtual network of Wi-Fi hotspots, international 3G mobile broadband, Ethernet broadband, satellite and dial-up connections.More generally, Wequas Azad, a product manager with Belgacom’s Telindus UK unit, believes that enabling allows users to stay connected to the corporate network via their mobile device while on holiday poses several challenges that need to be addressed by corporate IT departments.Mr Azad argues that people are happier to “be available” for important issues while on holiday if they have a degree of control over how they assess this important information. “The use of technology to provide this control of their personal time will enable staff to accept a degree of working in their own time and therefore be of greater benefit to all parties.”But even more crucially he argues that IT departments need to address the issues of manageability and security that arise when travelling employees connect back to corporate networks.“With an increase in geographical coverage of information and devices, it is challenging to enforce corporate security policies and easily manage the devices and information on them,” he says.One possible solution he suggests, is to ensure that mobile devices (phones, laptops, PDAs, etc) can be centrally managed and administered “over the air”. “Using mobility management applications, the corporate HQ can remotely enforce security policies on mobile devices as well as provide centralised device management,” he says. “By allowing these devices to be remotely updated, locked or wiped, enables greater confidence in organisations to empower employees to work from anywhere at anytime.”And that includes the beach.
552;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-07-08T15:33:08Z;Outsourcing: Board supervision is vital close to the core;;In the past two decades, outsourcing IT has transformed the landscape of many enterprises and public-sector organisations. In some industries, outsourcing is now the norm.As author and commentator Nicholas Carr predicts in his recent book, The Big Switch, buying rather than building IT services could become the norm for most organisations as a result of outsourcing, software as a service and utility computing.Other research backs this up. According to Claudio da Rold, a Gartner analyst, business spending on IT services, including outsourcing, is already above 30 per cent and will continue to grow at 6.4 per cent a year. Outsourcing will grow more quickly, with Gartner predicting compound annual growth of 7.4 per cent.“Today, businesses are spending more on external IT services than on internal IT resources, such as people, hardware and software. The only element that costs more is telecommunications,” he says. Even telecoms spending will be outstripped by external services by 2011.And, according to Mr da Rold, such spending patterns are likely to continue, even if the worldwide economy stalls.“External spending has grown during periods of boom and, historically, through periods of ‘bust’. There is no indication that during the next phase of the economic cycle this fact will be any less relevant,” he says.Vendors are also reporting strong and growing interest in outsourcing. HP, which recently announced its intention to acquire EDS for $13.9bn, says it is seeing 14 per cent year-on-year growth in this area.Vendors such as Infosys, IBM and TCS also report strong order books. “As the economy gets more challenging, outsourcing is coming to the fore, as people put more emphasis on their core business,” says Andy Mattes, general manager of HP’s outsourcing services business.Outsourcing is also attractive in a tougher business cycle, as businesses can use it, not just to lower their total IT spending, but also to tackle fixed costs. “If you invest money in assets and hire people, you have created a significant fixed-cost base,” says Mr da Rold. “In general, external services tend to be more flexible.”On the whole, businesses have been successful at using outsourcing to drive down the total costs of their IT operations. According to the 2008 outsourcing report carried out by the management consultancy arm of Deloitte, 83 per cent of companies achieved a return on investment of more than 25 per cent.Among client companies, cost reduction remains a primary reason to outsource, but other factors, such as a desire to focus on core activities, a shortage of IT capacity or skills, a need for greater flexibility or for IT transformation all play a part.According to Deloitte, although most companies were happy with the financial performance of their contracts, only 34 per cent said they had gained from either greater innovation or IT transformation.“If you have your own staff and assets, you have fixed capacity as well as costs,” says Neville Howard, a partner in Deloitte’s consulting practice. “If demand increases or diminishes, you cannot accommodate that. But if you want flexibility, you will have to pay for it.”The issue is complicated further when organisations turn to outsourcing because they want to transform their IT systems, or because they need to make significant investments in technology, but do not want to tie up capital expenditure.“A company might have grown through acquisition and have a plethora of systems. The solution is often to turn to an outsourcer and ask them to ‘do my mess for less’,” says Mr Howard.IT transformation is a common goal for so-called next-generation outsourcing contracts.Early outsourcing contracts, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, tended to involve the transfer of entire IT departments, including equipment, facilities and staff. Contracts were also long term, with 10-year deals commonplace.Such arrangements can work well for organisations that want to maintain existing service levels and current systems. However, they are less able to adapt to change.CIOs frequently cite higher-than-expected costs, service level shortfalls and – especially – missed deadlines as the drawbacks of longer-term outsourcing contracts.Organisations in the public sector, have also found other downsides to first-generation outsourcing contracts.In particular, if a supplier failed to deliver adequate service, negotiating a contract termination and switching to an alternative company was costly and risked service disruption.As a result, more CIOs are now using multi-sourcing as a way to reduce risk, tap into specialist know-how and to create competition between suppliers.“There is [more of] a trend to smaller deals than there used to be,” says Barry Matthews, head of the IT advisory service at Alsbridge, a specialist outsourcing consultancy.“Organisations are prepared to outsource different services to different suppliers: application development to one, support to another. Clients want more flexibility. We still see one or two mega-deals, but not as many as we used to. Customers are becoming more mature [in their use of outsourcing].”But a switch to multiple suppliers calls for a different approach to contracts and changes the role of the “retained” IT organisation and ultimately, the CIO.According to PA Consulting, around half of companies have a strategy for sourcing – not just for IT – and among those, only half again manage sourcing strategies at board level.“Sourcing is often done on a functional basis,” says Jonathan Cooper-Bagnall, a partner at the firm.“As a result, clients build their business cases at a departmental level. IT might be letting a contract, and HR and finance might be doing the same thing.”Supervision at board level becomes critical when companies start to outsource processes close to their core business. But CIOs also need to look at their own capabilities and those of their teams.A technical CIO with years of experience building and managing internal IT resources might not have the skills to manage multiple external suppliers.Even when he or she does, IT executives report that they need to retrain or hire staff for their new roles.This is so important to the success of an outsourcing deal that IT services vendor Infosys Technologies, provides its outsourcing clients with consultancy to ensure the “retained organisation” has the right capabilities [to run the contract],” says Suketu Patel, the head of strategic global sourcing at Infosys.“We go in, at the CIO’s direction, and look at the skills and roles of the management team. “We look at which parts of the organisation should be retained, and how to incentivise people.”But the toughest decision of all for the CIO might be whether to stay and adapt to the outsourced world, or to move on to pastures new.
553;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-07-08T15:33:07Z;Personal view online: A wealth of experience in financial services;;"With power comes responsibility, says Neville Howard, a partner with Deloitte.He writes in the second Digital Business Personal View Online series: “We are going through a banking crisis in which technology played a part.“To move forward, the financial services industry needs to ensure that the business drives technology and that the right people, with the right skills are retained to ensure that governance and controls can be put in place.”Mr Howard’s views on IT in the financial services sector, along with those of 14 other industry leaders and experts, are expressed in a collection of articles that can be read at www.ft.com/digitalbusiness/itfinancialservices.A feature by Peter Redshaw of Gartner comments on the tendency for IT portfolios in financial services institutions to swell faster than any chief information officer can chip away at them, and he warns: “Making subtle tweaks to the IT portfolio achieves very little and certainly isn’t going to make a trailing bank suddenly competitive.”Jeremy Badman of Oliver Wyman agrees: “At some point, many companies are forced to stop the incremental improvements to their current technology landscape in favour of starting from a clean slate to build a 21st-century technology infrastructure.”Other contributors to the wealth of experience now gathered at www.ft.com/digitalbusiness include Devin Wenig, chief executive of Thomson Reuters Markets; Julian Johnson, an SAP senior vice-president; Greg White of Symantec; and others representing companies including Sage, PA Consulting, Ernst and Young, and Bain and Co.The third Personal View Online debate, on Web 2.0 Strategy, is currently nearing its conclusion, which means there is already a wealth of expertise for readers to learn from, with several more articles to be published on FT.com by the end of this week.After a break for August, the next series of features will discuss security, starting on Monday September 8, to be followed by articles on Green IT from September 29.For all these topics, including the present one on Web 2.0, we invite anyone with knowledge of the subject to submit a feature of between 500 and 900 words by e-mail to digitalbusiness@ft.com, where it will be considered for online publication."
554;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-07-08T15:33:07Z;Adding IT to the SME toolkit;;"The past few years have seen a marked change in the marketing of software and services. Vendors such as SAP and Oracle, which had previously confined their attention to the giants of the business world, have begun to court small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with a cornucopia of new products.“So many companies that have traditionally focused on large enterprises are now going into the SME market. It is amazing. Everything is about SMEs,” says Joslyn Faust, principal analyst specialising in the SME market for Gartner, the consultancy.But, she warns, it is not necessarily to everyone’s benefit. “Many of these vendors do not understand that it is a totally different business model. Service, support and pricing are all very different. The products need to be very simple and they all need to work together. SMEs are worried that the IT they are offered will prove to be too complicated, too costly or that the vendor will consider them too small for proper support,” she says.Buying consumer-grade technology is one answer for very small firms.Eilert Hanoa, chief executive of Mamut, a European provider of integrated software and internet services for SMEs, shares Ms Faust’s concerns: “There is a misconception within the SME sector that technology is expensive and that it is a luxury a small business cannot afford. Most SMEs have few people to turn to for technology advice and this has led to an abundance of fear, uncertainty and doubt when buying IT.“This sorry state of affairs has been compounded, and in some cases encouraged, by an IT sector that has done the SME sector a disservice by downsizing enterprise applications for the SME market without addressing their need for less complexity.”SAP, however, one of the world’s largest software groups, has seen a significant change in its mix of customers over the past 10 to 20 years. At one time it was a provider of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software only to large corporates, it now estimates that 70 per cent of its customers – about 35,000 globally – are SMEs.Simon Etherington, head of the SME division for SAP in the UK, says the sector is covered by a three-product family: Business One, an out-of-the-box business management system for companies with less than £30m-£40m in turnover; Business by Design for larger groups; and Business-all-in-One for vertical industries. These products are generally marketed to customers via channel partners who can offer technical help and business advice.Are there any companies too small for an SAP offering? “If there are, we haven’t found them yet,” says Mr Etherington.But he warns that IT is no magic bullet. The customer, he says, must have a clear vision of what it wants to do, where it wants to go and how it thinks IT can support its objectives.He says that SMEs may have an advantage because they see their business processes – essentially what the business does – more clearly than bigger enterprises. And any IT investment must be treated as a business project rather than an IT initiative, he counsels.Dawn Baker, head of marketing for the small business division of Sage, the UK accounting software group, concurs: “Small businesses have to make monthly decisions based on cash flow. So an owner may be faced with the dilemma of whether to take £100 ($197) extra as a bonus or use it to buy a piece of software.“Another option, especially for businesses at the upper end of the SME sector is to look into hosted versus on-premises software solutions, as this might provide a higher degree of flexibility with less up-front investment. Either way, any investment in IT should be linked to a business plan.”Big-ticket technologies such as ERP are not alone in being reconfigured to fit a smaller customer. Virtualisation – running a number of operating systems and application packages on the same server – is becoming increasingly attractive to small companies, not simply because of savings on the cost of servers but because of disaster recovery and business continuity.Martin Niemer of VMware, a leading vendor of virtualisation software, says that companies with only four or five servers and fewer than a dozen staff are virtualising their servers as a protection against downtime, “which could cost them a huge amount of money”.Typically, VMware consolidates applications from 10 machines on to a single server. The latest servers can run as many as 30 virtual machines.So how do we define an SME or SMB (small and medium-sized business)? Definitions vary geographically. In Europe, a small company might have 10-49 employees and a medium-sized one, 50-250. In some regions, 5,000 people might still constitute a medium-sized company.Smaller concerns are generally seen as more flexible and agile than their larger competitors. Simon Devonshire, head of SME marketing for O2, the mobile operator, says small businesses are typically quicker to adopt new technologies than large corporates.“This is largely the consequence of a difference in the attitude towards technology in small versus larger businesses. In large corporations, new technologies such as the latest handheld mobile device and laptops are often viewed as a privilege, restricted to senior management.“Small businesses are more likely to recognise the business benefit that a new technology will bring as opposed to seeing it as a status symbol.”Again, the technology cannot be deployed unthinkingly.Michel Robert, managing director of the European hosting group Claranet warns that SMEs must be sure their investments will move the business on. “Most SMEs don’t care if the technology is the newest or the fanciest or the quickest. They care about reliability and about whether it will take them in the right direction. SMEs cannot afford to experiment and get it wrong.”He points to the dangers of growing complexity, which SMEs may be ill-prepared to deal with. He recommends outsourcing the bread-and-butter operations: “This will allow you to focus the technical resources you have on the future and on innovation and on aligning IT with the business.”The impact of the internet on SMEs has been particularly strong. While a couple of decades ago, an SME might be considering what accounting package to buy, today it is chiefly concerned with connectivity.Chris Stening of Easynet, part of the BSkyB group, says the company has seen an exponential demand for broadband from SMEs driven by e-mail, web traffic and online applications.“The internet has changed the way small businesses think about themselves,” he says.A company can use a cleverly designed website to make it seem larger than it really is: equally, a failed internet connection can quickly cost a small company more than it can afford.A survey carried out among UK SMEs by Quocirca, the consultancy, for Easynet Connect, the company’s SME network, says connection has become vital for many: “While a quarter of companies could work for days with no internet connection, most companies require failures to be fixed inside a day. For one in four, time to fix is even tighter at less than an hour and for some no break is acceptable.“In such critical situations, a second redundant connection has to be worth considering,” Quocirca recommends. The survey shows that from a simple web presence and e-mail, SMEs are selling online, using internet protocol telephony and networked video. Almost half use the network for remote back-up and disaster recovery.Are there simple guidelines that SMEs should follow in their adoption of IT? Joslyn Faust of Gartner suggests that potential buyers should not focus on price too strongly. “Free or almost free does not mean stress-free,” she says, adding that new additions must work with existing equipment if the company is not to have problems as it grows.She also says it is important to make sure that the vendor understands the customer’s business. “Too many do not understand these vertical markets, which leads to frustration for their customers as they get up to speed.”There are heartening signs, she says, that vendors are working towards the idea of “one-stop shopping” for SMEs. “That is what SMEs have always wanted but what they have not been able to have because of the state of the market. It takes a few years for vendors to get it right.”"
555;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-07-08T15:33:07Z;IT going green: Temperature rises push heat up the agenda;;A rack of computers in a data centre uses the same amount of electricity as a giant electric oven – “an oven cooking about five turkeys,” says Steve O’Donnell, senior vice-president of IT for First Data, and author of thehotaisle.com.Heat is a big problem for data-centre operators, especially as temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere’s summer. But to remove it with air conditioning is expensive and uses more power.“As the thermometer level increases, so does the headache for the IT director,” says Osca St Marthe, principal consultant at technology consultancy Morse.“Power costs are coming on to the radar of the board – some people have seen electricity costs double,” he says. “All technology operates within certain temperature parameters and as the temperature increases, the efficiency of your systems decreases.”“People are finding they can’t get enough power into the data centre and are, therefore, worrying about adding more air-conditioning units. In fact, at one data centre I visited people were worried that plugging a phone charger in might tip the balance, let alone more air-conditioning units.”Research in 2006 from analyst Gartner said 50 per cent of data centres would soon have insufficient cooling capacity, and the way data centres are being managed is beginning to change.Virtualisation – a technology that creates several “virtual” servers in one physical server – is one of the more popular ideas, as it cuts down on equipment. Insulation between hot and cold isles, or using curtains around equipment, is also proving effective, as is fresh-air cooling.But there are other ideas, too. The likes of HP and IBM have attempted to introduce “cooling liquids” into the data centre, while hosting companies such as Ultra­Speed are using “diskless” servers, which have no hard drive – the hard drives are kept in one place to manage the heat.Peter de Schulthess, a marketing director at OnRelay, says: “Companies are looking for ways to separate power conversion from computer processing.”“The delicate processing equipment can be kept physically separate and is easier to cool. The power conversion equipment that is now integrated into racks can be run from separate warmer rooms.”“Larger data centres can be far more efficient. They can adjust cooling and processing capacity in a more cost-effective way for a large pool of hardware.”These days a growing amount of IT equipment is designed to use less energy and in some cases operate at higher temperatures.“Not all equipment can operate at high temperatures though,” adds Mr O’Donnell. “Intel tells me its processor can reliably operate at more than 100 degrees Celsius, but surrounding systems and components start failing.”“If you choose your equipment properly, you can run it at quite hot temperatures. You can also put more kit in a room just by opening the windows. Lots of modern data centres use fresh air cooling. There is misconception that high-density cooling is the way to go.”“The best thing to do is rent an aircraft hangar in the middle of the countryside and fill it with fresh air to cool your equipment – even in the summer, unless you’re somewhere like the Sahara.”Mr O’Donnell says that the reason so many data centres today are sealed is that 20 years ago much of the equipment was sensitive to heat and dust. This is not the case today for a lot of machinery.He also argues the IT industry has inherited out-of-date guidelines from vendors. “When the brochures get printed, the marketeers use the same specs as the last box in the product series. That might say, ‘operate between 20 and 24 degrees Celsius’. No one challenges them and says ‘well, why can’t we say 30 degrees for this box?’.”According to a report by the Global Action Plan, “1,000 PCs running 24/7 without energy saving modes activated can consume as much as £70,000 ($138,404) worth of electricity in a year. For every unit of electricity consumed by computers, another half unit of electricity is required to dissipate the heat given off.”The heat issue is focusing attention on the role of IT and how to measure its effectiveness and efficiency.“The general approach is to compare the energy used by physical processing components with the much higher energy used to ensure reliable operation. It’s things such as temperature, power, and humidity,” says Mr de Schulthess.“Most hardware combines these. In a PC, the same box contains the heat-generating power supply and the CPU that must be kept cool.”“But mobile devices are much more efficient. In these cases, the business requirement lines up with the environmental benefit.”
556;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-07-08T15:33:07Z;Valley view: The IT world pokes its head in the cloud;;Mixed with the usual fog rolling off the Pacific into San Francisco at this time of year, there has been a heavy haze and distinct smell of smoke caused by more than a thousand fires burning in northern and central California in the tinder-dry conditions.The atmosphere is being recreated in the tech world with a smoky haze hanging over the rolling concept of cloud computing – just a buzz phrase or perhaps the biggest thing to happen in computing since e-commerce?In a report published two weeks ago, Gartner, the research firm said cloud computing heralds an evolution that is no less influential than e-business.On the same day, Yahoo announced a reorganisation that included “developing a world-class cloud-computing and storage infrastructure” and Microsoft said cloud computing was behind its acquisition of MobiComp, which offers back-up technology for mobile data.Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the Structure ’08 conference discussed how the internet infrastructure needed to be renewed for cloud computing, and start-ups were told the technology offered them pain-free scaling, as they grew into the next eBay or Facebook.If cloud computing sounds a bit nebulous, here are a couple of definitions.Gartner defines it as “a style of computing where massively scalable IT-related capabilities are provided ‘as a service’, using internet technologies, to multiple external customers”.Merrill Lynch, which published a 90-page report on “The Cloud Wars” in May, describes it more simply as “delivering personal and business productivity applications from centralised servers”.Sounds familiar? Yes, this is Application Service Providers (ASPs) and the Software as a Service (SaaS) model that we’ve been talking about for years.But cloud computing does not appear to be a new label pasted on an old bottle to generate fresh sales. What seems to be different this time is the far greater scale that is being attempted. Big companies are involved and they are offering not just services but platforms on which they are encouraging developers to create services and applications.What is being planned is expected to encompass everyone from major enterprises to small start-ups and individual consumers. Hardware companies will vie for the business of equipping massive data farms around the world, while fearing for their PC businesses.Merrill Lynch says the shift harks back to the days of centralised mainframe computing, implying the retreat of its successor, the client-server model.While it is easy to imagine enterprises replacing employees’ desktop PCs with dumb terminals running applications from the cloud, there are also signs of how consumers will opt for this model. Look at how everything can be done in the browser now and stored in the cloud, from e-mail to word-processing and photo and video editing and storage.Nicholas Carr, in his book The Big Switch, compares the rise of utility computing with electrification in the 19th century. Power production switched from in-house generating plants to centralised utilities.Google, with its web-based services and massive infrastructure, seems certain to be a cloud-computing leader, but there are also less likely candidates. The online retailer Amazon has shown others the way in cloud computing, selling its expertise in infrastructure through its Amazon Web Services for the past two years and developing its Elastic Compute Cloud, Simple Storage and database services.Gartner says a company such as Wal-Mart, with its supply chain expertise, could lease its core competencies as a cloud-computing service in similar fashion.Merrill Lynch says the economics are compelling, with business applications made three to five times cheaper and consumer applications five to 10 times cheaper. It sizes the market opportunity at $95bn for applications, with another $65bn coming from online advertising.Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, believes a super-group of technology companies will dominate cloud computing. He expects his company to be one of them. It has its own twist on the concept with Live Mesh, where cloud data is synchronised with every kind of device.Apple, too, hinted at its cloud ambitions when it unveiled the new iPhone last month and a MobileMe web-based service.Merrill Lynch says that only Microsoft and Google have offerings in all three core categories of infrastructure, platform and applications, but other significant players in one or two are Amazon, EMC, IBM, NetSuite, Salesforce.com, Sun and Yahoo.Then others such as Akamai, Dell, HP, NetApp and VMware are enabling cloud technologies with their hardware and software.Fears about reliability, security and performance levels remain as barriers to adoption by businesses.They are likely to be the main arguments used by IT departments to justify their continued existence and to warn their bosses not to put their heads in the clouds too soon.
557;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-07-02T17:11:35Z;Virtual worlds, after the hype;;"Technology and hype – with all its connotations – go hand in hand. We saw it with the internet in the late 1990s, arriving on a wave of excitement and meeting with subsequent cynicism. We’ve seen it more recently with social networking sites such as Facebook and virtual worlds such as Second Life.But excitement and early success in any field inviting a degree of disillusionment from the media is nothing new. In fact the notion of a technology “hype cycle” as outlined by analyst house, Gartner, becomes something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. However it would be wrong to assume that criticism – or even that “difficult second album” syndrome – equates to failure. For all its detractors, social networks will still be huge in a few years and so will the virtual worlds that serve all kinds of groups and interests. Along with marketplaces such as Amazon, they epitomise the long tail as places that allow thousands of niche interests to flourish.As with the nascent days of the internet, as virtual worlds grew, so came the commerce and marketing dollars. After all, if you build it they will come, right? But the early gold rush was rife with experimentation and people finding their feet. Any suggestion that virtual worlds should have been born fully mature is unrealistic.But stories of digital property tycoons and a vibrant, profitable trade in virtual goods captured the imagination of the world’s business press. Bricks and mortar companies and IT powerhouses alike began exploring 3D virtual platforms, helping catapult usership and corporate experimentation in everything from marketing activities to 3D, virtual collaboration.What emerged from these initial forays however, were some fascinating insights.Residents of virtual worlds weren’t just spectators, they were active participants. They want to touch, hold, customise and feed back on.So while a virtual billboard perhaps meant next to nothing, a customisable, virtual automobile certainly did. The most successful marketing engagements brought something fresh and experimental to the table – a virtual mystery and accompanied manhunt, a modifiable virtual product that encourages user creativity. Interactions weren’t measured in impressions, but rather minutes – minutes! – of brand engagement. Rich, 3D virtual environments allow marketers not only to inspire dialogue with quality content, but to build and maintain truly interactive communities.It’s clear that we’re at the very early stages of knowing how best to interact in a marketing sense within virtual worlds. One thing is certain however – virtual environments will play a significant role in the enterprise in the not too distant future. And while corporate marketing presences have driven much of the mainstream news on the subject, brand and product marketing represent only a fraction of the platforms’ ultimate potential.The web as we know it, in its 2D, text heavy form, makes the consumption of information extremely efficient. One only has to look to Google to see the importance of simple text in a networked environment. The addition of rich media capabilities such as online video, the development of which I helped pioneer as CTO of Real Networks, helped bring even more sophisticated levels of content online. It pulled the PC not just into the boardroom, but the living room, networking all facets of society in ways previously unseen.In 2008, we’ve reached a point where the intersection of Moore’s Law – the idea that computing processing power doubles every 24 months – with the basic economic utility of the Net has led to an explosion in the global hunger for information. With nearly 1.1bn individuals online globally, the web has emerged as a central pillar in modern society, enabling change on a sweeping scale.But in some important ways, the web in its current form has not reached its full potential – we still spend our time alone, reading text in our own language, following links from static web page to static web page, and not taking full advantage of the multimedia technologies at our disposal. Most of us still consume information without creating any. Imagine the barriers created by language alone.What I envision is a future in which networked, social technologies continue to gain momentum; in which web ecosystems that encourage collaborative user-generated content and open source principles flourish; and where 3D, immersive environments become even more impactful than the internet is today. Virtual worlds take the internet’s ability to bridge international boundaries and adds a sense of place – a global creativity suite in the ether.With professors leading immersive architecture courses to classrooms of students hundreds of miles away, and organisations such as the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) using Second Life to simulate catastrophic weather events, it doesn’t take a huge leap to see the potential these platforms hold.Just this month Japanese scientists demonstrateded a brain computer interface that enabled a quadriplegic man to control his Second Life avatar using only thought. As technologies continue to integrate, hardware and software adapt and creative horizons expand, we’ll see a depth of virtual engagement beyond anything we’ve seen thus far.Imagine a common, shared meeting space integrating the visual and inter-personal dynamics of the real world. Imagine that much of this environment would be 3D immersive and always full of other people, radically dropping the barrier for entry to new users from all over the world. It would usher in a new, egalitarian era of computing – one in which the users are fully able to take control of their digital destiny.This is how I see the future of the Net: universal standards, 3D immersion, openness and empowerment – a global process of re-creating our entire world using the same principles that have so effectively shaped the web."
558;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-06-27T18:37:56Z;Fresh profit warning from Sony Ericsson;;Sony Ericsson warned on Friday that it would only break even in the second quarter because of disappointing European sales of its mid and high-end mobile phones.The profit warning – its second this year – demonstrates the Japanese-Swedish joint venture’s continuing problems, but also indicates how mobile phone sales are suffering from the global economic downturn.In the first quarter Sony Ericsson reported a 47 per cent year-on-year fall in pre-tax profits to €193m ($304m) on sales down 8 per cent to €2.7bn.The mobile phone maker indicated at the time that its second-quarter results would also suffer, but investors were still surprised by the warning. Ericsson’s shares fell 11 per cent on the news, but recovered to close down 8 per cent at SKr60.80.Sony Ericsson’s warning has dashed any remaining hopes that global handset sales might bounce back this year. According to research firm Gartner, global sales fell 16.4 per cent in the first quarter year-on-year, the first recorded annual fall.Sony Ericsson said it would ship about 24 million handsets in the second quarter with an average selling price of €115. In the first quarter it shipped 22.3 million handsets for €121 each.It blamed moderating demand for mid to high-end phones and shipment delays on new models. It said these “continued market challenges” would impact sales and profit in the second quarter, with gross margin expected to decline – year-on-year and sequentially – while it would attain break-even at the pre-tax profit level.Sony Ericsson slipped to fifth place this year behind LG of South Korea among the world’s largest handset markers as sales of its mid- to high-end phones suffered more than the lower-priced handsets of its competitors. In the first quarter it had a market share of 8 per cent, down 1 percentage point.Sony Ericsson has also been plagued by component shortages that have led to shipment delays of the new mid-priced phone models.In Europe, the economic slowdown, together with longer mobile phone operator contracts, means consumers are replacing their handsets less frequently.Sony Ericsson has been more affected than its rivals because the phones it produces are more expensive, leaving it exposed to a weak European market. “It’s highly exposed to western Europe, which is the hardest hit region,” said Martin Nilsson, an analyst at Carnegie Investment Bank in Stockholm.In emerging markets, where prices are falling, Sony Ericsson’s sales have also suffered. Competitors such as Nokia, the market leader, have weathered the downturn better because sales of their low-end phones are still robust.
559;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-06-12T23:42:47Z;Yahoo put in tight position with Google deal;;Yahoo management Thursday tried to walk a fine line between placating shareholders and complying with regulators as it announced a search advertising deal with Google.For the impatient holders of its stock, Yahoo had to convince them it had struck a big deal that would lift its share price back towards the $33 offer that the group had spurned from Microsoft.For the antitrust authorities, it had to make the deal sound not significant enough for them to intervene and possibly block it.For shareholders like Carl Icahn, the activist investor who has bought a 4.3 per cent stake in the company, nothing that Yahoo could say was likely to please him.Mr Icahn had stated that any deal where Yahoo sold just its search business to Microsoft would in effect be a poison pill, killing the prospect of the full Microsoft acquisition he so desires.But the Yahoo-Google deal may have the same effect.“This is certainly not what he was looking for. Clearly he wanted something more substantive,” said Andrew Frank, research vice-president at the Gartner research firm.On the face of it, shareholders in general will not be satisfied with a deal that is expected to add an extra $250m to $450m to revenues in the first year.By confining Google ads to the US and Canada and making the deal non-exclusive, Yahoo is throttling the potential boost to revenues but giving the Department of Justice less cause for concern as it reviews the arrangement.Shareholders will be able to voice any displeasure by voting in favour of Mr Icahn’s alternative slate of directors at Yahoo’s annual meeting on August 1.Class-action lawsuits by Yahoo shareholders dissatisfied with the board’s handling of Microsoft’s takover offer are also likely to rumble on.“Litigation is still a thorn in Yahoo’s side, they will have to resolve that in some way,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.The news of Yahoo ending all talks with Microsoft and striking a deal with Google was not expected by some analysts.“We are surprised, because Microsoft has apparently pursued Yahoo for the better part of two years and Carl Icahn was pushing the companies together,” said Scott Kessler, IT analyst at Standard & Poor’s.“Our sense is that Microsoft wanted better value than Yahoo was willing to offer and was wary of potential morale and retention issues.”Yahoo made clear in its statement that this was not another case of Jerry Yang and David Filo, the two founders, meeting Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer in a last-ditch attempt at a deal, as happened in May. Then Mr Ballmer upped his offer to $33 a share, but the founders asked for $37. Later in the day, Microsoft called off talks.“The conclusion of discussions follows numerous meetings and conversations with Microsoft regarding a number of transaction alternatives, including a meeting between Yahoo and Microsoft on June 8 in which chairman Roy Bostock and other independent board members from Yahoo participated,” the company said.Microsoft’s comments on the ending of talks may enrage shareholders. Microsoft suggested a partial deal to buy Yahoo’s search business would have delivered value to shareholders in excess of the full acquisition that had been offered.“In the weeks since Microsoft withdrew its offer to acquire Yahoo, the two companies have continued to discuss an alternative transaction that Microsoft believes would have delivered in excess of $33 per share to the Yahoo shareholders,” it said.“This partnership would ensure healthy competition in the marketplace, providing greater choice and innovation for advertisers, publishers and consumers.”The implication is that shareholders would have reaped a dividend from the sale while retaining their Yahoo shares.As those shares sank 10 per cent to close at $23.52 Thursday, any major dividend from Yahoo’s latest move seemed a distant prospect.
560;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-06-09T22:58:10Z;Apple set to slash iPhone prices to lift sales;;Apple on Monday sought to boost the limited appeal of its acclaimed, but modestly selling, iPhone as it announced that new models would sell for as little as half the price of the first version.The drastic cuts, which will bring the price of an 8-gigabyte model down to $199 and a 16GB version to $299, largely reflect subsidies from mobile operators who hope to make money from selling data services with the handsets, according to people familiar with the arrangements.Operator subsidies could reduce prices in some countries below the prices set on Monday by Apple. In the UK, 02, the only British mobile operator selling the iPhone, is expected to offer the 3G version free to customers who sign up to its most expensive monthly tariff.For Apple, the move signals a reversal in tactics compared to the iPhone’s arrival a year ago. In an attempt to overturn the normal economics of the mobile communications industry, Apple originally sold the 8GB handset for $599 and persuaded mobile operators to give it a share of revenues from data services.On Monday, Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple, conceded that the iPhone needed to be “more affordable” to reach a wider audience. He said Apple had sold 6m of the phones since they went on sale at the end of last June, implying that sales had reached little more than 2m so far this year. A long way short of the 10m target he had set for 2008.The lower prices should bring the iPhone into more direct competition with smartphones from Nokia and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, analysts said.“They have made a bid to eventually become the number one cellphone maker at some point,” said Ken Dulaney, an analyst at Gartner.Apple has partly financed the price cuts by allowing mobile operators to subsidise the handsets, in return eliminating or reducing the share of data service revenues it receives, according to people familiar with the arrangements.Executives of AT&T, which is the exclusive distributor in the US, acknowledged on Monday that the switch from the revenue- sharing model with Apple to what they described as “a more traditional” subsidy model would impact on earnings this year and next and reduce earnings per share by between 10 and 12 cents a share in both years.While AT&T is expected to account for the bulk of global iPhone sales, the shift to the subsidy model is also expected to hit other carriers including Spain’s Telefónica, Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile, Vodafone Group, France Telecom’s Orange and Japan’s Softbank.Mr Jobs said the new models of the iPhone, which will operate on faster 3G networks, will go on sale in 22 countries on July 11.Reporting by Richard Waters and Chris Nuttall in San Francisco, Paul Taylor in New York and Andrew Parker in London
561;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-06-02T17:05:03Z;The basics: Mobile phone operators revolutionise cash transfers;;Interest among mobile phone operators in using their technology to deliver basic banking services is intensifying.Nick Hughes, Head of Mobile Payments at Vodafone, reckons 60 operators worldwide claim to have some kind of independent payments platform.A study by Gartner, a technology research group, of related security issues estimated mobile phone payment systems could be available to 15 per cent of the world’s 3bn unbanked people by the end of this year.But Coenraad Jonker, who is responsible for the development of banking solutions for emerging markets at Standard Bank of South Africa, adds a cautionary note.“The challenge of mobile phone banking is really not about technology,” he says. “It is about providing solutions people are emotionally comfortable with that enable them to bank cheaply and do what they need to do in their community.”In partnership with South African mobile operator MTN, Standard Bank set up a 50-50 joint venture, MTN Banking, which launched full-service banking by mobile phone back in 2005.But uptake has been slow, which explains why Mr Jonker is running a series of community-based trials involving 2,000 people to find a business model that the unbanked welcome.Vodafone, meanwhile, has signed up 2.3m subscribers in Kenya for its M-Pesa mobile phone payments service, just 14 months after launch. That’s an “astonishing take-up”, says Mr Hughes, but the product is far simpler. And M-Pesa, which originated as a demonstration project funded by the UK Department for International Development, is much simpler than the micro-finance loan management system originally envisaged.Customers “want very simple propositions”, says Mr Hughes. Most Kenyans use pre-paid calling cards. To use M-Pesa, they go into an agent of Safaricom, Vodafone’s part-owned local operator, and show their identity card. The agent activates an M-Pesa account for their mobile, and the system adds a transaction menu to the phone.Money is added or withdrawn from the account by passing cash to the agent or collecting it from him. You can also send money from the account to anyone with a mobile phone. If they do not have an account, they get a text message that includes a four-digit pin number that can be used to withdraw cash from another agent.It is a good way for an urban worker to send money to relatives in other parts of the country, or to store cash. The system now handles, per month and over long distances, several million transactions typically worth €5 ($8) to €15 and costing €0.30.Because no deposits are taken or interest paid, it does not need a banking licence. Vodafone has also partnered with Roshan, the biggest mobile operator in Afghanistan, to launch M-Paisa, in partnership with a local bank. The aim is to disburse micro-finance loans, and collect repayments, as well as handling transactions.MTN Banking goes further, offering individuals a way to pay utility bills, and companies a payroll mechanism.But Mr Jonker is trying to match technology to consumer needs from the bottom up.Mobile technology has the potential to offer cheap no-frills banking, at low risk, because transactions are monitored in real-time, on widely-used, high-quality infrastructure, he says.In communities without electricity, he has set up a terminal, connected to the mobile network, with an informal-sector retailer supervised by a community banker.The retailer photographs the person opening an account and their ID book and transmits them to a call-centre where they are verified.The account holder gets a swipe-card for transactions “because these are emotionally very acceptable in this market”. The banking product has four carefully-selected elements: a basic account, funeral insurance, a school fees saving plan – which attracts a government contribution when paying fees – and unsecured loans for informal businesses.Efforts to use voice-recognition technology meet consumer resistance, he says, because background noise can confuse the computers.But fingerprint recognition holds promise, and phone-to-phone transactions might work in other markets.Basic banking promises extra revenue and product differentiation for mobile operators and banks in emerging markets. But creating a product that meets customer needs takes time and effort.
562;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-06-02T11:45:41Z;IT in Financial Services: Modernising – innovate or hibernate?;;"The IT department in a financial services institution (FSI) is a difficult place to be right now. Just as it’s being asked to do more than ever – enabling more personalisation, faster time-to-market, greater agility and tighter compliance and risk management – the sub-prime crisis erupts and its IT budget gets slashed. So the emphasis shifts to efficiency and how it can run ever larger volumes of electronic transactions, for less money, on a creaking infrastructure of legacy applications. Inevitably, the prospect of modernising that old IT portfolio is raised again.The problem is that there is so much of it and it is all tangled together in a Gordian knot of home-built IT. For many years, the conventional approach in this industry has been to chip away at it a little bit at a time. That approach can work in other industries, such as manufacturing, retail or utilities, where they may eventually rationalise and consolidate their IT portfolios.However, the trouble with an FSI and its intangible assets is that IT is at the very core of everything it does and part of every customer contact. It is what defines its products and processes, the customer experience, the communications and distribution. Increasingly it is how it innovates. Hence, the tendency is for the IT portfolio at a bank to swell faster than any chief information officer (CIO) can chip away at it and the legacy application set remains stubbornly rooted in its operations.The alternative “big-bang” approach to IT modernisation is usually dismissed as too risky. IT tends to be even more conservative than the trading or asset management activities it supports. But the barriers to modernising IT at an FSI are mostly nothing to do with IT – the barriers are to do with people, culture, politics, bureaucracy, and so forth. It is much more about project management issues, job security and incentivisation – how many CIOs are sufficiently encouraged to take on risk or to break up their own empires?Making subtle tweaks to the IT portfolio achieves very little and certainly isn’t going to make a trailing bank suddenly competitive. If a CIO is saddled with a risk-averse culture and a heavily regulated industry (that insists on the banking equivalent of emission controls and crash safety tests), is it really worth modernising IT at all? After all, most banks are still making lots of money, even after the impact of the credit crunch.IT modernisation needs to address two key issues: one is that simply running-the-bank soaks up about 70 per cent of the IT budget at a typical FSI, and the other is that poor IT hits profitability. High operating expenses mean that very little IT budget is left for innovation, and that means differentiation is being eroded. Poor IT means that product margins are also getting squeezed and that customers show less loyalty, which diminishes the bottom line.What a CIO needs to do to turn this around is to develop much more sophisticated financial models for calculating the economic value added to the FSI, replacing the current models for calculating the return on investment that technology X offers over technology Y. They need to be able to see if a big-bang approach would radically reduce their cost/income ratio or transform their return on equity. Without a radical boost to shareholder value, why change?The net result of this would be to polarise the current continuum into two opposite camps – the dichotomy of “innovate or hibernate”. The innovate camp is at the leading edge of technology and embraces the big-bang approach, while the hibernate camp adopts the ultra-conservative approach that avoids IT change until absolutely necessary.Innovate has developed accurate cost-benefit models that link IT changes to business metrics, so that it can quantify benefits and justify the radical transformations it encourages. Meanwhile, hibernate concentrates on using the “oil-can” by keeping its systems running for the absolute minimum cost (maybe through offshore outsourcing) while building up a war-chest of cash with the money it saves. Ultimately this must be a short-to-medium term approach; hibernators must constantly monitor the market and be prepared to buy up small, smart, innovative FSIs (that may have had the luxury of a green-field start) and then use them as incubators. The hibernator can then gradually migrate its customers and its data over to its protégé once the local contextualisation and scalability is in place.These are not easy options – the innovators must find the tools needed for more sophisticated financial modelling of IT and the hibernators must efficiently manage global sourcing and spot their potential acquisitions. The vital thing is to avoid the worst-case scenario which for an FSI is to sit in the middle between these two extremes. The in-betweeners will fritter away their IT budget on incremental modernisation for little gain. Far from being fast followers – as they might like to think of themselves – they will be ditherers and laggards."
563;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-05-29T16:32:52Z;Response to Alastair McAulay, Phill Robinson and Malcolm Carrie;;Years of hype about utility computing have made it a contentious subject with many in the industry now treating it with extreme caution bordering on skepticism.In his Personal View article, Alastair McAulay of PA Consulting Group points out that, although “It was only five years ago that Gartner was predicting that by 2008 utility computing…was going to be in the mainstream”, this has not yet happened, despite the considerable industry hype. He goes on to discuss the potential benefits, limitations and impact of such a model in the future. In contrast, Phill Robinson of Velocix says that we are already “very much in the throes of the software as a service era.”Whilst Robinson feels that SaaS, “is already here and has been for years,” Malcolm Carrie of the Corporate IT Forum is more conservative, suggesting that “Some applications are now approaching utility status”He uses webmail services as an example. Robinson points to Salesforce.com, which is frequently held up as the poster child for successful SaaS, though McAulay feels it is an example of a fairly limited kind of business function that “can be sensibly commoditised and handed over to an IT utility service provider”.In actual fact, there is a huge range of applications already being offered and deployed as hosted services, including e-commerce, partner management, collaboration and ERP tools. The adoption of SaaS has been an evolution, not a revolution and we now see ever more vendors recognising the demand for a model that offers myriad benefits, most notably the straight-forward one that businesses only pay for what they need and this is exactly what they receive. In the pre-existing IT model, where businesses host applications themselves, they have to invest in server and networking hardware, datacentre equipment, operating systems, infrastructure software, administration personnel and support services before they can even think about buying the specific application they want to run.With the SaaS model, this underlying infrastructure is no longer owned by the end-user business and they only have to pay for the actual application as and when they use it, which is a much simpler and more efficient way of working. It is not hard then to understand where the demand for SaaS comes from. What is more surprising is that the model has not been more widely adopted. However, when you consider that the burden of the underlying technology infrastructure would instead be passed on to the application vendor, it is easy to understand why SaaS has taken a while to become more widespread.Offering SaaS has traditionally meant vendors would need fundamentally to restructure their business models and architecture. However, on the whole it does not make sense for application vendors to try and offer all the IT elements a business needs. The answer, then, does not lie in a single vendor environment but rather in software vendors working with service providers to find a workable approach to meeting customer demand for hosted applications. The service providers provide the infrastructure to underpin the application delivery and, because they can take advantage of economies of scale, the costs are not prohibitive.You might ask why this model could not have been deployed five or ten years ago. There are numerous reasons but a crucial factor was that service providers could not sweat their infrastructure hard enough for the SaaS model to make financial sense. This has changed in recent years with developments in virtualisation and automation technology. By using virtualisation to consolidate the thousands of servers they need to run, hosting companies can make their hardware far more efficient and the SaaS proposition less costly to set up and operate. Virtual servers can be very quickly provisioned to meet customer demand, and automation tools can be used to reduce the management headache and simplify the process. Taking advantage of such tools, hosting companies can work with multiple vendors to offer businesses real value from integrated IT solutions.The future of SaaS is in the more complex value chain. Application vendors should continue to focus on what they do best: developing business logic in the form of applications, but these should be built to suit the on-demand model of SaaS. Hosting companies should focus on perfecting the infrastructure to deliver these applications as services. By working with vendors, these service providers can become the primary channel for applications for an enterprise.
564;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;E-mail security addressed by software-as-a-service model;;"Sometimes a technology or idea takes a while to find its niche. It’s a little-known fact that the fax machine was invented before the telephone; the Victorians and their immediate successors could see the value of transmitting a document but talking to someone without seeing them seemed simply peculiar.A similar thing has arguably happened to utility computing. Invented in the late 1990s it was launched with a bang when suddenly – nobody noticed.Utility computing is effectively using a computer as an appliance that receives your applications and information from a larger computer elsewhere. This makes sense in the abstract; it is what a telephone does by taking signals from elsewhere, it is what a tap does by taking a water supply from a supplier who can organise the logistics. Computing did not go that way; the impression people had was that information and applications needed to be held on site.The concept is now widely understood to have morphed into Software as a Service (SaaS). Particularly in the US, the “new” service is essentially the same as the old one with the advantage of fast internet, so users have the feel of their own computer but they are using someone else’s system.The emphasis, if it is done properly, should be on “service” because of the complexity of a large network of computers. Fortunately the benefits can be huge. For example, an organisation with 1,000 licences for Microsoft Office that has a need for 50 temporary workers for three months of a year, would have to buy 50 more licences using a standard computing model. Under SaaS it would simply hire the extra licences while the operatives were on site.Likewise, if a major upgrade became available, or a security patch were deemed essential, a company would handle its own upgrade and roll it out across a workforce in its own time if it was using the most common form of software purchase. The SaaS model allows this to happen automatically. There is a fortune to be saved in costs if an organisation opts for SaaS, but as a true service.Security SaaS is now a major issue. The Gartner Group, a respected organisation, predicted that by the end of the year that 75 per cent of organisations were going to be infected with financially motivated malware that got straight past their defences. Gartner also predicted that the affected companies would be unaware of the intrusions due to the nature of the infections.In addition, E-mail documents are potentially commercially sensitive and subject to regulation just like any other company documents. There are new risks to manage and new threats to control; and e-mail is often outside existing control mechanisms.An important aspect of e-mail management is content filtering, which should form an important aspect of any SaaS model. Manual inspection of e-mail is impractical but a rule-based program can inspect the contents of an e-mail, detect specific user-applied labels (such as “Highly Confidential”) or particular authors, roles, originating departments or recipients and act accordingly (perhaps by encrypting the message, or refusing to transmit it). You can even detect potentially pornographic images – even if a single image slips past the heuristics, you will soon identify someone downloading hundreds of illegal images from the internet.So SaaS can mean that you get what you pay for, with low cost of entry and exit; it means suppliers host the hardware and software, achieving economies of scale; and, it offers low management overheads because your supplier employs security specialists and spreads the cost over all its customers.SaaS has moved on. It addresses e-mail management quickly and cheaply (there is no software or hardware to buy), and you are not reliant on in-house expertise, which may be out of date. And, if you don’t like the service, you can cancel it cheaply and find a better provider.SaaS should let you concentrate on the services you need to function effectively, within the law; instead of on the technical minutiae of e-mail management.Outsourcing an infrastructure – or software as a service, or utility – is a clear opportunity to do just that as long as it is handled professionally by experts rather than someone whose mission is simply to pipe data back and forth. It looks as though utility computing has finally come of age."
565;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-05-28T13:20:31Z;Cable and Wireless makes approach for Thus;;Cable and Wireless has made an informal offer for Thus, a smaller telecoms rival.C&W’s approach, made on Wednesday, could lead to much-needed consolidation among telecoms providers serving companies rather than consumers.Richard Lapthorne, C&W’s chairman, held talks in London with Philip Rogerson, his counterpart at Thus, about the indicative offer.Thus shares rose 28½p to 138½p, valuing it at £253m ($501m), after C&W confirmed its approach. C&W fell 4½p to 158.7p.C&W said it had made a “preliminary approach to the board of Thus in relation to a possible offer”. C&W is interested in Thus’s customer base, which includes Scottish Power and Johnston Press.Thus responded by saying it was “confident in its future as an independent group, which offers an attractive combination of strong growth and future cash flow generation”.C&W’s UK operations are midway through a turnround that is based on serving companies rather than consumers. Its UK operations have been in decline since C&W lost its fixed-line duopoly with BT in 1991, but last week the group reported significant progress with the turnround.C&W said its UK operations would be cash flow positive in 2008-09, adding that revenue growth had been restored in the second half of 2007-08.C&W had net cash of £243m on its balance sheet at the end of March, and John Pluthero, head of UK operations, signalled he was willing to consider acquisitions.Thus, which was spun out of Scottish Power and floated in 1999, last week reported a maiden operating profit of £4m for 2007-08. It generated revenue of £576m, up 8 per cent.Neil Rickard, an analyst at Gartner, said C&W would gain valuable scale by combining with Thus, allowing it to compete better with BT, its biggest rival.“The main advantage for C&W is scale,” he added. “This is a positive step in competing with BT.”At least 15 fixed-line telecoms providers are serving UK companies, and they are struggling with fierce price competition.Thus’s shares have fallen more than 40 per cent in the past year, and Jonathan Groocock, analyst at Investec, said that C&W’s approach was “opportunistic”.Mr Groocock said the company might be able to justify paying a 30 per cent premium for Thus, or 180p a share. That would give Thus an enterprise value of about £360m.He estimated that C&W, by combining with Thus, could achieve savings of £30m to £40m in capital and operating expenditure, and so boost core earnings by £20m to £30m.However, Mark James, an analyst at Collins Stewart, said the company should return cash to shareholders rather than buy Thus.…………………………………………………………..C&W coy about demerger plansAt its 2007-08 results last week Cable and Wireless was coy about the timing of an eagerly awaited demerger of its UK and international operations, writes Andrew Parker.The C&W management declined to confirm that its plans would be set out at the company’s interim 2008-09 results in November.Simon Weeden, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said a C&W move to buy Thus, a smaller rival, should not cause a “material delay” to any demerger.Lawrence Sugarman at Dresdner Kleinwort said that if the company finalised a deal with Thus it should still be able to work towards a demerger announcement at the interim results.Many investors expect a demerger to take a classic format.C&W’s shareholders would get two shares: one in its UK operations and another in the international businesses.But some investors think C&W could make disposals among its 33 international businesses.The most attractive businesses are likely to be those in the Caribbean, where C&W has been competing with Digicel, the telecoms company run by Denis O’Brien, the Irish tycoon.America Movil, the leading Latin American mobile phone company, is also entering the Caribbean. Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire, controls America Movil.C&W’s management has been incentivised to prepare for a demerger through the company’s long-term incentive plan.The plan could pay out more than £20m to John Pluthero, head of the UK and international operations.
566;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-05-28T00:27:35Z;Mobility diary: Mobile content makes a bid to get serious;;Mobile content today refers mainly to services focused on entertainment: social networking portals, video and music downloads and streams, ringtones, news and gaming.But there is a growing interest in seeing how mobile content can cater to the business market, too.That trend will be fuelled by the growth in smartphones over the next few years. Gartner predicts that by 2011 smartphones – that is, devices with multi-functional operating systems such as Symbian or Windows Mobile built into them – will represent 75 per cent of handsets shipped in Europe.That kind of critical mass will get things moving and “better browsers will mean better applications”, says Nick Jones, a vice president of research at Gartner.Yet the earliest use of business mobile content will not involve financial information, or online trading sites, or the kind of B2B services that proliferated on the internet during the dotcom boom.Instead, business users will appropriate consumer services, largely around the explosion in social media.Mr Jones says that in a recent survey he asked enterprises whether they would consider using consumer mobile applications for business purposes, and 30 per cent of respondents said yes. He says he has heard of a number of business people using Ovi, the consumer mobile content portal developed by Nokia, to share images of products for sales purposes.It may have its roots in informal usage, but some big companies have also made moves. RIM and IBM are to offer social networking tools to enterprises, integrating IBM’s Lotus collaboration software into the BlackBerry platform.In January, Microsoft said it would buy Norwegian enterprise search company Fast for $1.23bn, with the intention of incorporating some of its functionality into its SharePoint Server. One of Fast’s main areas of business is mobile search.The move into enterprise-focused mobile social media services follows a bigger trend of investment in Web 2.0 for business users. Forrester predicts that enterprises worldwide may spend as much as $4.6bn on Web 2.0 technologies by 2013, using them to communicate better within organisations and also with customers.Tying mobile content growth to applications already being used on PCs will be a model followed by smaller players, too. Video Arts, which makes corporate training videos, says that mobile is a small but growing part of its business. “A classroom is still a big part of it but it’s also about being able to tailor just for you and also the principle of ‘just enough’ and to fit in with your schedule,” says Martin Addison, managing director.Much of the initial opportunity seems to be focused on the small and medium enterprise sector. “A lot of SMEs don’t have fancy SAP applications, but they do use mobile e-mail,” says Mr Jones at Gartner. “There is a clear opportunity to take this a bit further and provide web tools so that applications could be customised and work both on the web and on the mobile.”Of course, this is not to ignore a much bigger market for what Mr Jones calls “classic” mobile enterprise applications: those geared toward field force automation, sales, and basic office tasks such as e-mail and calendars.These typically have a return on investment of six to 18 months, and will continue to dominate mobile enterprise data investments for some time, he says.Indeed, there are a number of initiatives under way from vendors to try to facilitate even more mobile application development and usage.In May, RIM announced further collaboration deals with IBM (beyond the Lotus announcement) and SAP, as well as a $150m venture fund with Thomson Reuters and the Royal Bank of Canada to invest in BlackBerry-friendly services.RIM says there are now “hundreds” of companies developing applications to run on BlackBerry devices. Meanwhile, Cisco this week is launching Cisco Motion, a central platform that helps control devices, networks and applications for wireless enterprise deployments.But there is still a long way to go, even for business software that works well on PCs, let alone mobiles.A recent global survey of enterprises by business applications company IFS noted that only one in five respondents said that business applications were easy to use, citing problems with learning new modules and navigating around different programs as some of the chief time-wasters.This could even reinforce the case for more mobile internet applications for businesses. One of the conclusions the company reached was that business software needed to mimic internet sites more closely.“Bringing features and functions common in consumer websites into the business world was a technique respondents identified that would save time,” says Alastair Sorbie, IFS chief executive. “Business software buyers should be looking for applications that have incorporated such features into their application design now.”
567;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-05-16T21:59:30Z;Chipmaker’s TV connection;;Hopes of creating a UK broadcast network capable of serving up television programmes on mobile phones took a step forward on Friday.Qualcomm, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of microchips for mobiles, emerged as the successful buyer of radio spectrum that could be used to put live TV on handsets.Live TV on the mobile in the UK has failed to take off. Only 0.6 per cent of the UK’s 47.5m mobile phone users say they watch broadcast TV each month on their handsets, according to research by media analysts M:Metrics. Last year BT shut its broadcast network that enabled Virgin Mobile to offer live TV to its customers. Virgin Mobile attracted few customers for its TV services partly because it offered only five channels and handsets were clunky.As a result, in the past six months mobile operators have shifted their attention from video to music services on handsets, according to Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner. In the US, however, AT&T and Verizon Wireless, the two largest US mobile operators, have used Qualcomm’s MediaFlo technology to stream live TV to mobiles and are now offering more than 10 live TV channels on handsets.In 2006 Qualcomm conducted trials of MediaFlo in Cambridge in conjunction with British Sky Broadcasting, which Ms Milanesi said were successful. The key question now is the strength of consumer demand.Qualcomm paid £8.3m for the radio spectrum at an auction on Friday organised by Ofcom, the telecoms regulator. Andrew Gilbert, Qualcomm executive vice-president, said it would initially be used for research and development and the company had not yet decided how to use the spectrum, although MediaFlo was a possibility.Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm’s chief executive, told the Financial Times last month that he was confident MediaFlo would be rolled out in Europe, adding the company was eager to work with mobile operators.02 said it was interested in hearing more about Qualcomm’s plans, adding: “MediaFlo is a technology well suited to providing TV to mobiles. As always, it’s about having a good range of handsets and getting the customer experience right.”The BBC said it was interested in mobile TV and talked to all the main players. “We are watching the current situation with interest.” The case for Qualcomm creating a dedicated broadcast network capable of serving up TV on mobiles may only become compelling when the activity is popular.
568;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-05-13T22:01:40Z;HP shares hit by $14bn move to buy EDS;;"Shares of Hewlett-Packard fell 7 per cent on Tuesday, adding to a slide of 5 per cent on Monday after the world’s biggest information technology group agreed to pay $13.9bn for Electronic Data Systems, the IT services company.The fall in HP’s stock price wiped out several billion dollars in market capitalisation, suggesting that Wall Street was taking a sceptical view of Mark Hurd’s biggest deal in three years as HP’s chief executive.If approved by EDS shareholders, the deal would more than double the size of HP’s services business, challenging IBM’s leadership in one of the technology industry’s most lucrative markets.But it would also add a relatively low-margin, low-growth business to the sprawling IT conglomerate.The deal would be HP’s biggest acquisition since its controversial $19bn merger with Compaq, a rival PC maker, in 2002.“This is the biggest deal we have ever seen in IT services,” said Ben Pring, an analyst at Gartner, the market research group.Mr Hurd defended HP’s rationale for the acquisition in a conference call on Tuesday. “Today’s decision is comp­e­lling commercially, strategically, and financially.”But the HP chief gave few details about the cost savings HP expects to gain by combining its $16.6bn services business with that of EDS, which was founded in 1962 by US billionaire Ross Perot. EDS makes money by managing other companies’ computer systems and performing other computing tasks, like payroll management and order processing.HP’s $25 a share offer represented a premium of about 30 per cent to EDS’s stock price on Monday just before news of the deal broke.Under the deal, HP will fold much of its $16.6bn services business into EDS, which will continue to operate from its Plano, Texas headquarters. Ron Rittenmeyer, EDS chairman and CEO, will run the business, reporting directly to Mr Hurd.Together, HP and EDS last year accounted for 5 per cent of global services sales. IBM will remain the market leader following the deal, with its $54bn in services re-
venues accounting for 7 per cent of the highly fragmented services market last year.The deal’s success could hinge on whether Mr Hurd is able to avoid the integration problems that dogged his predecessor, Carly Fiorina, after HP’s merger with Compaq six years ago, according to Mr Pring at Gartner.“It’s going to come down to how well they execute,” he said. “EDS are deep in the heart of Texas, and although they’ve tried to dilute that style over the years, it’s still tie-wearing, command-and-control type model. It’s like chalk and cheese.”Mr Rittenmeyer said a relatively low degree of overlap between the companies’ services customers should help smooth the process, while access to HP’s cutting-edge technologies should help EDS provide better services. “It is going to make our customers have a much broader reach,” he said.Cost cutting is likely to be a priority for the combined group. In spite of an ongoing restructuring that has seen EDS renegotiate some less profitable long-term IT contracts, profit margins of the company remain well below those of IBM’s services business.HP’s shares fell 7.2 per cent on Tuesday to $43.46. EDS’s shares rose 1.5 per cent to $24.43, following a 27 per cent jump on Monday after news of the deal broke.● News of the EDS deal came as HP raised its full-year sales and profits forecasts. The revisions did not reflect the impact of the acquisition. They came as HP reported preliminary second-quarter results ahead of most Wall Street estimates."
569;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-05-12T09:24:21Z;Will it live up to its billing second time around?;;From reading the latest vendor announcements telling us that Software as a Service (SaaS) and cloud computing are going to transform how IT is provided to the enterprise, it is easy to forget recent history.It was only five years ago that Gartner was predicting that by 2008 utility computing (a broadly similar concept) was going to be in the mainstream. At the time, there was a huge wave of publicity from the big vendors about how utility computing was going to transform the way IT services were provided.Plainly, utility computing has not yet become a mainstream proposition. So what has happened to it in the past five years, and will things be different this time round?Five years ago, many of us in the industry were working with clients, helping to set up some of these utility computing sourcing deals. It soon became clear from the fine print that on-demand services were only available under certain circumstances, such as with applications hosted on mainframes. That was hardly earth-shattering when you consider that mainframe technology has allowed virtualisation and charging-per-use for decades.Of course, there were differences. But fundamentally, the deals were never as exciting as they were hyped up to be. A large part of this was due to the fact that the necessary virtualisation technology was not mature enough to allow the foundation IT infrastructure to be run as flexibly as it needed to be for true on-demand services.This time round, the vendors are playing a subtly different tune. They seem to be saying: “With virtualisation technology, such as the near-ubiquitous VMWare, now fully mature, we really can deliver utility computing. Trust us.”However, we are finding that while businesses are more than happy to use virtualisation technology within the boundaries of their own organisations for its flexibility and efficiency gains, they are not really paying much attention to utility computing, be it SaaS or cloud computing or whatever its being called this week. Indeed, according to silicon.com’s recent CIO Agenda 2008 survey, utility computing was languishing at the bottom of the wish list next to Vista and RFID.But let us set this indifference aside and, for the sake of argument, assume that we trust some of what the vendors are now saying, and that we are disciples of Nicholas Carr, author of “Does IT matter?” and believe that IT can be purchased as a utility. So what should we do now?The first thing to do is to add a word to the title of Mr Carr’s 2003 Harvard Business Review article to make it “IT doesn’t matter …sometimes”. The challenge therefore becomes working out what “sometimes” is. There are three steps that need to be taken to define this IT strategy for the real worldStep one is to recognise that within most organisations of more than 100 people there are unique business requirements where the IT involved does have to be tailored to individual circumstances. This may be because of unique regulatory and security requirements that strictly stipulate where data is stored and processed (eg, the public sector).Perhaps more significantly, it could be because IT can be used in innovative ways to provide a competitive edge. The big banks, for example, will put a lot of effort into running their proprietary risk models quicker than their rivals – even down to developing their own hardware. In these instances adopting a utility computing model and migrating on to processors and storage somewhere or other in the world is not going to be viable.The second step is to acknowledge that there may well be cases where legacy information systems are working pretty well. Typically, this is IT that was installed around five years ago (and we have seen 15-year-old systems that continue to work well). All the painful deployment wrinkles have been ironed out and if you take care of the underlying hardware, the systems more or less run themselves. Why bother replacing when the cost and pain of moving the system to a new utility computing platform is not going to achieve the payback within a sensible timescale?The third and final step is to identify where there really are areas that IT can be sensibly commoditised and handed over to an IT utility service provider.These are likely to be areas that do not have an unusual business process, that are not sensitive to user response times, where there are not legal implications for data storage, and where availability is not super critical (Amazon’s much publicised “Elastic Compute Cloud” gives 99.9 per cent availability – which translates into more than a minute of downtime a day).We can also say from PA’s own experience of using the Second Life platform that businesses should make sure any scheduled downtimes – designed to minimise impact for Californian business – do not disrupt you too much.Given the above, you may well conclude that for now you can use utility computing to do some one-off business data analysis that requires a burst of server and CPU resource, or you may decide that your sales team can easily be supported by the Salesforce.com service without risk to the business.Being a cautious early adopter is not a bad place to be with utility computing. Despite the rebranding exercises and the continuing hype, this time around there may well be some benefits available, even when the real world constraints are considered.However, it would be a very foolish CIO who bet the business on a major shift to the utility computing model. That would mean ignoring why IT still does matter to the business, and will still do so in five years, when we are calling utility computing something else again.Alastair McAulay is a senior IT consultant at PA Consulting Group
570;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-05-11T17:14:12Z;Penguins offer safer surfing;;"The founders of Club Penguin, Lane Merrifield, Lance Priebe and Dave Krysko, are possibly some of the nicest guys in the internet business. They give millions of dollars a year to children’s charities and are fierce advocates of family values.Mr Merrifield looks more like a kindly primary school teacher than an executive, the kind of man you might trust to look after your children. This is what parents are, in effect, doing as they let their children join Club Penguin, the virtual online world for six- to 14-year-olds.What started out as a sideline project in the sleepy holiday town of Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada, is rapidly growing into a global phenomenon.Club Penguin has 20m users and analysts estimate up to 10 per cent of them have persuaded parents to pay about £4 a month for souped-up access to the site. Stephen Prentice, senior analyst at Gartner, notes: “Kids’ virtual worlds are the success story. If you exclude online games, around nine out of 10 virtual world users are probably under 12.”Club Penguin became so successful that last July it was bought by Disney for $700m. It is now building an international presence with Disney’s backing, beginning with the opening of a UK office earlier this month. It is also hiring a marketing executive for the first time since it was founded in October 2005.There is some irony in the fact that the Club Penguin founders now find themselves owned by a big US company. All three originally moved to Kelowna to escape the corporate rat race. And, they had started the site in order to create an advertisement-free zone for children that also offered entertainment.The site’s popularity – it made a profit within four months – showed the founders they had found a gap in the market.Safety features were a big selling point from the outset. Mr Merrifield’s wife is a clinical psychologist specialising in childhood and helped shape the site; his sister and mother, both teachers, also offered advice.Virtual Worlds Management, which tracks networking sites and virtual worlds, estimates that there are more than 100 youth-focused virtual worlds either live or in development, with 52 of them aimed at children under seven. Disney alone is understood to be developing up to 10 virtual worlds aimed at children.The fact that many of these sites are associated with commercial brands such as Barbie, Beanie Babies and Bratz worries parents concerned about their children being exposed to too much advertising online.Safety is also a problem. A recent survey by Ofcom, the UK communications regulator, found that nearly half of all British children have a profile on a social networking site, including a quarter of all eight- to 11-year-olds with online access. These children are theoretically too young for Facebook, Bebo and MySpace, which have minimum age limits of 13 or 14. However, many find ways round the age restrictions. Given that last summer MySpace alone detected and deleted 29,000 convicted sex offenders on its service, parents concerns are real.Their search for safer online alternatives – sites that are more closely monitored and where children cannot reveal personal information – plays to Club Penguin’s strengths. It employs more than 100 moderators who monitor the site for unsafe behaviour. They are trained to spot bullying, or attempts to share contact details.Pictures cannot be posted on the site. Instead, children are represented by a colourful penguin. Filtering software prevents phone numbers being published.Club Penguin’s culture of niceness is key to its success. But how well it can continue to walk the fine line between wholesomeness and commercial pressures is unclear. Mr Merrifield says that Disney has been very hands-off with the company and lets it do things its own way.Mr Merrifield admits the company could create soft toys based on its virtual penguin characters but he pledges this would only be done with careful consideration. “It will be very purposeful. It will be based on what the audience want,” he says.The question is: which audience is he talking about? Eight-year-olds do not mind commercialism – they love toyshops. It is parents who resent it, and Club Penguin will have a tricky balancing act to please both sets of customers.www.clubpenguin.com"
571;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-04-17T14:53:36Z;Nokia flags slowdown in mobile market;;The global mobile handset market will shrink in value in euro terms this year for the first time, industry leader Nokia warned Thursday. This unexpectedly bleak assessment sent its shares nearly 13 per cent lower.The world’s largest mobile phone company reported a 25 per cent rise in net profit to €1.22bn ($1.94bn) for 2008’s first quarter but said the value of the overall global mobile device market would drop in euro terms in 2008 compared with last year because of the weak dollar and slower global economic growth.Rick Simonson, chief financial officer, told a conference call that 50 per cent of Nokia’s sales were in dollars or dollar-linked. “There is growth in this market in volume and value if you knock out this crazy currency,” he said.Olli Pekka Kallasvuo, chief executive, insisted Thursday a combination of slower growth and rising labour and raw material costs would have little impact on demand for mobile phones, which he described as “necessity items”. Nokia still expects the number of phones sold industry-wide to grow 10 per cent in 2008 but these sales are expected to generate less revenue for vendors as average sale prices per phone fall.Despite Nokia’s confidence and strong profitability, analysts have been fretting over Texas Instruments’ comments on 3G order cancellations and Sony Ericsson’s recent warning on handset sales, among other factors. In addition, analysts have expressed concerns over Nokia’s product cycle, particularly its high-end handsets, which face intense competition from Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Apple’s iPhone, according to Citigroup. Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner, said: “Falling revenues will put more strain on handset vendors. They will have to focus on making low-end devices at a profit and this is not easy. Only Nokia seem to be able to do it at the moment. Samsung have been talking about low-end products but it takes time to learn to cater to this market.”Companies such as Motorola have struggled in the emerging markets because they have not been able to get their production costs down low enough to make low-cost phones profitably.For the quarter, Nokia reported that net sales rose 28 per cent to €12.7bn, compared with the same quarter last year. The operating margin rose year on year from 13.6 per cent to 14.7 per cent but dropped from 15.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week.

The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing.

573;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-04-17T00:32:03Z;PC shipments: A mixed bag;;Along with positive earnings reports this week by IBM and Intel, the latest figures on PC shipments pubslihed on Wednesday by Gartner and IDC should offer some relief to technology investors who have been trying to assess the likely impact of a US slowdown on sales of IT equipment.Both groups found that the US slowdown had begun to hit PC shipments in the US. But they also found that slower US growth was more than made up for by a stronger-than-expected preformance overseas.Still, investors would be wise not to breathe a sigh of relief just yet. For one thing, it’s likely that PC makers were forced to cut prices significantly to counter sagging demand in the US – a move that is likely to eat away at the industry’s already thin margins. We’ll know more about that next month, when the big PC companies report their latest results.In the meantime, investors trying to sort out their investment strategies will have plenty to chew over, particuarly when it comes to Dell and Hewlett-Packard, the world’s biggest PC makers.Gartner’s latest figures showed that HP’s US shipments shrank in the first quarter. The decline was a slight one, but potentially worrying given a strong improvement by Dell, which is a year into its own turnaround.Unfortunately for investors, it’s unlikely that the PC industry’s muddled picture will clear up anytime soon.
574;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-04-16T22:24:03Z;Solid growth in PC shipments, reports show;;More evidence of the technology industry’s resilience in the face of the US economic downturn surfaced on Wednesday after two reports showed strong growth in personal computer shipments in Asia and Latin America offsetting weakness in the US market.New quarterly PC figures from Gartner and IDC, the market research groups, showed healthy growth in PC shipments in the first quarter, with strong demand for laptop computers in emerging economies helping to offset anaemic growth in the US.US shipments grew just 3 per cent in the period, according to Gartner, indicating that PC makers were beginning to feel the effects of the slowing US economy. The IDC figures showed a similar pattern.“The US market is softening and this can potentially hasten downward price pressure and further intensify competition for the rest of 2008,” said Mika Kitagawa, a Gartner analyst.The report came a day after Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, issued a reassuring forecast for the current quarter, saying it expected demand for PCs to remain solid in spite of recession concerns.Concerns remain, however, with some industry-watchers questioning whether overseas markets will remain immune to US economic weakness, particularly if the turmoil associated with the US subprime mortgage crisis moves beyond the financial sector to hit broader corporate and consumer spending.Dell, the world’s second biggest PC maker, notched some of the best shipment growth during the first quarter, according to the Gartner study.Gartner said Dell’s PC shipments grew 21.8 per cent in the first three months of the year – a growth rate second only to Acer, its fast-growing Taiwanese rival, and ahead of arch-rival Hewlett-Packard.HP shipments grew 17.5 per cent worldwide but the computer maker struggled to increase shipments in the US, where shipments fell 0.2 per cent year-on-year.Intel shares rose 5.8 per cent on Wednesday ahead of the report, which came after the close. HP rose 2.8 per cent while Dell rose 2.4 per cent.
575;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-04-15T17:16:56Z;O2, Carphone Warehouse slash iPhone price;;O2 and Carphone Warehouse have cut £100 from the cheaper model of Apple’s iPhone, fuelling speculation that a 3G version of the device will be released this summer.From Wednesday, the eight-gigabyte version of Apple’s mobile device will be available for £169 until June 1 2008.The 16GB iPhone, released in February, will remain priced at £329. Customers buying either model are still required to sign up to an 18-month contract with O2, paying at least £35 per month.An Apple spokesperson described the offer as an “O2-led promotion” and said that Apple would continue to sell the same model for £269 in its own retail stores.The move by O2, the UK mobile operator owned by Spain’s Telefonica, follows discounting by T-Mobile, owned by Deutsche Telekom, in Germany earlier this month, with France Telecom’s Orange expected to cut its iPhone prices soon to clear stocks ahead of a much-rumoured 3G device.O2 denied that the discount reflected poor sales of the 8GB iPhone, adding that the “majority of the demand” has been for the cheaper model.“Most people who wanted an iPhone have got one,” said an O2 spokesperson. “We want to extend the reach of iPhone and let even more people benefit from the experience it offers and we know that price is an issue for some.”But Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner, an IT research group, said that the discount may reflect a more “cautious” consumer in the mobile phone market. Ms Milanesi added that Gartner was expecting first-quarter mobile phone sales to be weaker than the same period in the past two years.In that context, the iPhone’s lack of subsidy from O2 may have been a barrier to sales, with similar-capacity mobile phones, such as Nokia’s N95 8GB and Sony Ericsson’s W960i, available for free when bought with a new contract.O2 described the price cut as “very much business as usual”. “We are constantly looking at all our products and services to ensure they remain competitive in a fast changing market. This special offer will help us to sustain momentum for the iPhone beyond what has been a very successful launch period.”Apple does not reveal sales of the iPhone and said it “does not comment on future products”.
576;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-03-30T21:57:48Z;Dongle dangles threat in broadband war;;Have dongle, will travel. Thanks to the latest gadget, mobile phone operators are offering wireless broadband speeds and prices that are challenging their fixed-line rivals.Devices nicknamed “dongles”, modems that enable wireless access to the internet from a laptop computer, are proving to be a significant success. The advent of the dongle means mobile internet access is no longer painfully slow, in theory making a fixed-line internet connection unnecessary.“We have definitely seen some customers taking mobile broadband as an alternative to fixed-line,” says Kevin Russell, chief executive of 3 UK. More than 20 per cent of 3’s new customers who sign up to monthly contracts are purchasing dongles.Dongles are proving to be popular in particular with people living in rented accommodation, such as students, because they enjoy the flexibility of internet access that can move with them. Telecommunications analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that 50,000 people are buying the devices each month in the UK.Besides speed and cost, the third factor driving the dongle era is the technology’s “plug-and-play” format, according to Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner.Mobile operators have been supplying wireless modems to businesses for several years, but these devices can be difficult to set up. The dongle, by contrast, simply slots into a standard USB port.Last autumn, 3 began deploying upgraded, third generation mobile technology that accelerated its broadband download speeds tenfold. By January, the company could offer speeds of up to 3.6 megabits per second to 89 per cent of the UK population.In reality, however, the average speeds enjoyed by 3’s customers are 1.2–1.3 mbps. The connection slows down when many people are using their phones and dongles at the same time. Speeds increase if the user is close to a radio base station transmitting the wireless signals.But the same thing holds for fixed-line internet providers. Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, says fixed-line operators were offering download speeds of up to 4.6 mbps last summer. Actual speeds could be significantly lower, at around 1 to 2 mbps, depending in part on how close people lived to BT phone exchanges.3 and rival T-Mobile are investing in additional upgrades to 3G mobile technology that will increase download speeds up to 7.2 mbps from this summer. Average speeds should then increase to more than 2 mbps, Mr Russell says.Vodafone can already offer download speeds of up to 7.2 mbps in central London and at 15 airports, and will extend that capability to six more cities this summer.Vodafone halved the cost of its basic wireless broadband deal to £15 in January to match 3 and woo consumers. Previously, Vodafone had focused its wireless broadband packages on business customers.Nick Read, chief executive of Vodafone UK, says it is too early to tell whether people will ditch their fixed-line internet access in favour of mobile broadband.He adds that some better-off people are likely to retain fixed-line internet access at home and have a dongle for when they are on the move.Christopher Fremantle, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research note last month: “Vodafone’s products are now cheaper than BT’s …with similar speeds and mobility…The strategic threat to BT is clear.” He predicted that in the medium term people would increasingly swap fixed-line internet access for wireless broadband.But if fixed-line operators invest in fibre optic cable, they will offer customers much faster speeds. Fibre should deliver download speeds of up to 100 mbps, which mobile operators cannot match.Moreover, fixed-line broadband is often provided as part of a bundle. British Sky Broadcasting, for example, sells a “triple play” of satellite television, fixed-line broadband and phone services. This means reports of the death of the fixed-line connection are much exaggerated, Ms Milanesi says.…………………………………………………………….Operators seeking high notesWhile mobile operators are tapping into an expanding new market for dongles, they are still experimenting with music strategies after encountering limited appetite for downloads, writes Andrew Parker.Four years after Vodafone launched its music download service, it is still casting around for the best way to gain revenue from the service.Earlier this month 02, the UK’s largest mobile operator, announced a partnership with online music store Napster, marking the end of 02’s attempts to develop its own music store.Downloading over fixed line networks to computers remains the dominant means of obtaining digital music. Mark Mulligan, analyst at Jupiter Research, estimates there were 120m track downloads to computers in 2007, compared with 12m to mobiles. Apple’s iTunes, with its 6m plus tracks, is the leading online store, with an estimated 70 per cent market share.But many analysts believe that mobiles will become an important medium for music now that wireless internet is becoming a user friendly reality and phones are turning into mini-computers.The increasing importance of music to Vodafone was underlined this month by its announcement with Warner Musicthat Vodafone customers could download tracks from Madonna’s Hard Candy album ahead of its global release on April 28. Seven tracks will be available for download from April 21, released at one per day.Vodafone is also offering customers the chance to subscribe to an “all you can eat” download service. Its partnership with Omnifone, a music company working with mobile operators, means customers who pay £1.99 per week can download as many tracks as they want.Nokia, the world’s largest handset manufacturer, is planning handsets later this year that will include access to the entire back catalogue of artists with Universal Music.Vodafone, like other operators, is expected to consider selling these “Comes With Music” mobile phones.
577;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-03-28T09:47:15Z;Low-cost laptops;;Captains of industry like to point out that their kids are at the cutting edge of technology trends. It is apt then that a laptop initially aimed at children may come to shape the direction of the PC market.Last year ASUSTeK Computer, a Taiwanese electronics company that makes a third of the world’s motherboards, launched the Eee. At $400 it comes with a 7-inch screen and barely any memory. But it is an internet-centric device that has the same wireless capabilities of more expensive laptops.Initially aimed at the education market, its pared down functionality has proven to be a worldwide hit. Demand far outstrips supply – the Eee was one of the “most wanted” Christmas gifts on Amazon.com – and after selling 350,000 units in the fourth quarter, the group is gearing up production and expects to ship between 3m and 5m during this year.Admittedly that is still a fraction of a market that is itself growing at a breakneck pace – 107m laptop computers were sold worldwide in 2007, according to the technology consultancy Gartner, more than double the number shipped in 2004. But the budget range from ASUS is rapidly expanding, as are the numbers of similar products from competitors.Meanwhile, tasks such as e-mail, storing files such as photos and even running applications can increasingly be performed online – Google Docs is one internet-based potential alternative to Microsoft Office. Consumers just wanting to browse the internet and send e-mails do not need more computing power. And, given the low cost of pared-down laptops, some may use them alongside more expensive machines.Perhaps, perversely, Apple, with its slick design and marketing, may be unintentionally helping to reinforce these trends. Its new $1,800 MacBook Air offers a lower specification than other products in a similar price range. Apple is instead trumpeting the benefits of the Air model’s portability and wireless connectivity. But for consumers worried about a recession, the asceticism of a cheap little Eee may better fit the spirit of the times.Post and read comments on this Lex
578;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-03-19T00:29:41Z;Security matters: Printing can be data security’s Achilles Heel;;"Since January 2005, more than 218m records involving sensitive personal information belonging to US citizens have been exposed by security breaches.Drill down into the data, collected by US lobbying group the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, however, and it is clear that it is not only electronic media that are to blame.Last year, more than a dozen serious data protection breaches resulted not from the loss of a laptop, a disk or memory drive but from printed data.Some of the breaches resulted from errors in bulk or commercial printing houses, such as inadvertently printing customers’ social security numbers on envelopes or labels. But others were the result of employees printing sensitive data, which was subsequently lost or stolen – often because the paperwork was in the same bag or case as a laptop targeted by thieves.The true number of cases of data loss from paper documents could be far greater. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse only monitors US cases, and only cases where personal data are exposed. Businesses, though, should be as concerned with the loss of commercially sensitive information, either accidentally or through industrial espionage.According to Pete Basiliere, a research director at Gartner covering printing technologies, several of the more serious cases have involved bulk or contract printing. “CIOs need to keep an eye on print and mail, where there are not as many controls as there are in the office environment,” he points out. “There have been cases where letters have been mis-folded, for example, so that an individual’s social security number was visible through the envelope.”Improved procedures for passing data to contract print houses and monitoring their jobs will go some way to solving such problems. But it is in the office where there is an even greater onus on IT managers, and company security officers, to look at printing arrangements.Organisations need to consider who has the authority to view sensitive data, and whether that authority should automatically bring with it the permission to print files. IT departments should also review how print traffic moves across the network and even how print job data are stored on servers and printers.The move from standalone analogue copiers to digital, multi-function devices has brought some specific security challenges. Almost all high-end copiers and printers now contain hard discs, and security professionals are concerned that such discs – often containing full copies of sensitive documents – might fall into the wrong hands.This has led device manufacturers to build encryption into their devices: Xerox, for example, now encrypts almost all the hard discs in its high-end printers using the AES protocol, and equipment is Common Criteria certified. “These products have evolved from peripherals to platforms providing a lot of functionality,” explains Dave Drabb, security expert at Xerox and a former FBI agent.Building better security measures into printers and muilti-function devices will go a long way to prevent a hacker accessing information held on a printer’s cache disc or use a printer as a back door into a corporate network. But they will not solve some of the more common security problems around printing, such as unauthorised employees printing sensitive data, or staff leaving confidential documents on a printer which then fall into the wrong hands.Samsung is one of a number of manufacturers that hopes to solve this problem by requiring staff to authenticate themselves at the printer in order to pick up a job. At the most basic level, this means entering a PIN; alternatives include swipe cards or near field communications (NFC) contactless smart cards to “pull” the print job to the nearest printer. Such systems have the added advantage, Samsung says, of cutting waste and making it easier to analyse printing costs.Researchers at the company have developed a system that encrypts print jobs on their way from PC to printer. In a recent demonstration, staff from the company showed the ease with which hackers, armed with just a laptop and some easily obtained software, could “sniff” a local area network for printer traffic and then recreate the documents on their own machine.Encrypting the data, using technology based on the PGP protocol, prevents such attacks. Amid growing concerns about identity theft and commercial espionage, such security measures look set to become more widespread.Information security officers are also looking more closely at business applications that store and process sensitive data, to see whether security needs to be improved. Some large businesses and government departments have disabled USB ports or installed software that prevents data being written to memory keys, but such measures will be undermined if staff can still print unauthorised documents.The best way to prevent this, suggests Ken Allan, technology security and risk services partner at Ernst & Young, is to build security into the application. However, this represents a significant challenge for organisations running many applications from a multitude of vendors.Companies also have to balance the need for additional security measures with the inevitable impact on productivity. Often, the simplest way to protect data from unauthorised printing or copying is to set strong policies, and to monitor use, rather than remove functions. Analytics software might alert senior management, for example, if a member of staff accessed more sensitive data than would be expected, based on their usual role.“Restrictions can be designed into applications, or [policing use] can be done as a monitoring activity,” says Mr Allan. “Companies are turning to analytics to monitor what users are downloading, but it is control by detection, rather than by prevention. Really, it is a stop-gap approach.”But, he suggests, such measures – as well as technical innovations such as encrypting printing traffic – will only be successful if they are used in tandem with strong policies.“Rather than focusing on the media, the hard drive, the memory key or paper, companies need a set of policies about data use and awareness to back those policies up,” says Mr Allan."
579;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-03-17T19:05:27Z;EU backs single standard for mobile TV;;Mobile television on Monday edged closer to becoming a serious commercial reality in Europe after regulators backed a single standard for the technology.The move to endorse the Nokia and Motorola-supported DVB-H format could finally turn much-hyped mobile TV into a flourishing industry, Brussels believes.Mobile TV allows customers to receive shows such as live broadcasts, news and sports on their phone handsets and other hand-held devices, for a charge.But Italy is so far the only EU country where commercial operations are in place.Viviane Reding, EU telecoms commissioner who is behind the regulatory push, claims that mobile TV could soon become a multi billion euro market.But consumers are wary of paying for the service, industry members say.Carolina Milanesi, analyst at research firm Gartner, adds that surveys show customers prefer to access music, rather than TV, on their phones.A planned overhaul of the radio spectrum regime is also needed to ensure mobile TV succeeds, analysts say.Access to this resource, which is becoming available as the EU moves from analogue to digital television, is required to offer widespread mobile TV services.Mrs Reding said: “For mobile TV to take off in Europe, there must first be certainty about the technology.”“An EU-wide adoption of DVB-H will provide industry with the necessary market scale to launch mass mobile tv services across the EU.”She argues that DVB-H is already the most widely use standard for mobile TV in Europe and is “between trials and commercial launch in 16 countries.”Rival systems to DVB-H include Mediaflow, provided by US group Qualcomm, and DMB, widely in use in South Korea.Critics say that Mrs Reding has failed to present enough evidence to justify backing a single standard.The UK was among countries that opposed the decision, arguing that the market should be left alone to develop.Under the move, the union’s 27 nations must promote the DVB-H standard over other systems for mobile TV.The clash over mobile TV underlines tensions over the expansion of the union’s electronic communications sector and the intense debate about how far regulation is needed to promote new services.
580;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-03-12T09:19:28Z;Nokia and internet services;;Downloading Christina Aguilera videos to your mobile phone is so, like, old. For Nokia, a Mumbai car pooling service powered by text messaging may be a far more telling glimpse of the future.Mobile phone users are increasingly using their phones to surf the net and send e-mail. Yet in the developed world, telecom operators, rightly, see phone maker Nokia’s move into services such as music downloads and maps as a threat.However, there may be a greater opportunity for the Finnish phone maker in the developing world. In many areas fixed infrastructure is lacking – fewer than one in every hundred Bangladeshis has a land line. So for many the first experience of the internet is likely to be through a mobile phone. This suggests a significant market for basic services like e-mail, as well as one for localised information services, such as finding fellow commuters, or checking prices at nearby markets.Nokia dominates many emerging markets, claiming about two-thirds of handset sales in India and more than 40 per cent in China, for example. Subscriber growth – Gartner, the technology research company, expects penetration rates in Africa to jump from 30 per cent last year to 45 per cent by 2011, for instance – means inexperienced operators may be more prepared to work with Nokia. Having spent more than $8bn on acquisitions in the last two years to build up its service and software division, it can pitch itself as a partner with ready-made services for operators to sell, in return for a share of revenues.This will take time. Fast networks are needed, and even in China the issuing of 3G licences remains more expectation than reality. But if a sizeable chunk of the next billion users to access the internet do so via Nokia, the rewards will be significant.Post and read comments on this Lex
581;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-03-09T20:32:03Z;Apple unveils iPhone grand plan;;Steve Jobs and two of his top lieutenants spent just over an hour last week outlining their plans to allow software makers to create programs custom-built to run on the iPhone, Apple’s innovative mobile handset.The move could mark the beginning of a new phase in the development of mobile software, as programmers build programs that are not limited by the physical constraints – such as fixed buttons and small screens – that plague many other mobile handsets.The iPhone’s break-through touch screen means that Apple’s mobile handset is a virtual blank slate, and the ability to write mobile software free from the usual constraints is likely to have software geeks salivating.“You’ve got the ultimate in flexibility in user interface,” says Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner.“That, combined with a big, high resolution screen, makes it an intriguing platform in the mobile space.”John Doerr, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, underscored the excitement around the iPhone’s potential to emerge as a powerful new software platform on Thursday.Taking the stage at Apple’s headquarters immediately after Mr Jobs’s presentation, Mr Doerr announced a new $100m venture capital fund dedicated to backing companies that are building software for use on the iPhone.Mr Doerr said Apple’s software plans could lead the iPhone to emerge as the “third great platform” for software makers after the personal computer and the worldwide web.“In your pocket, you have something that’s broadband and connected all the time.“It knows who you are and where you are. That’s a big deal. It’s bigger than the personal computer,” he told the cheering crowd.In spite of such excitement, Apple will need to overcome several challenges if it is to succeed in its bid to shake up the mobile software market.First, Apple needs to follow through on plans to make the iPhone more competitive against the BlackBerry and other smart phones in winning business customers.Apple devoted a large portion of its presentation on Thursday to describing its plans to make the iPhone compatible with Microsoft Exchange, one of the leading business “push” e-mail services. It also plans to roll out a host of new security features designed to appeal to corporate IT departments. Once these features are in place, Apple can work with its mobile partners, which include AT&T in the US and Orange, Vodafone and T-Mobile in Europe, to woo big corporate customers.“Apple has to work successfully with AT&T to penetrate the enterprise market, because they don’t have an enterprise sales force,” says Mr Baker at Gartner.“If they don’t get the installed base, business application developers aren’t going to be interested.”Apple must also ensure that it maintains good relationships with the developers who will create new iPhone applications.Mr Jobs last week said that Apple planned to take a 30 per cent cut of third-party applications sold through iTunes or through its new iPhone “Apps Store”.While developers will be able to set their own price, those two channels will remain the exclusive methods of distribution for iPhone applications.This is a situation that could lead to friction if developers eventually come to feel they are not getting a fair deal.Apple plans to screen applications before they are made available to iPhone users. That will allow Apple to ban pornographic or otherwise objectionable applications from being installed on customers’ phones.Apple may need to devote considerable resources to ensuring that this process works smoothly.It also needs to devote time to make sure that the screening process does not lead to unacceptable delays in rolling out new software or software updates.On top of this, Apple will need to take security precautions.Mr Jobs on Thursday acknowledged that allowing outside developers to install applications on the iPhone would create new security risks for Apple customers.“This is a big concern,” he said. “It’s a dangerous world out there.”Mr Jobs said Apple had tried to strike a balance between the need for security and the desire to make it as easy as possible for developers to distribute their wares to their iPhone customers.“Developers have to register with us,” Mr Jobs said. “They get an e-certificate that tells us who they are, so if they write a malicious app, we can take them down and tell their parents.”
582;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-03-05T05:09:38Z;Tata to roll out wireless broadband;;Tata Communications, part of India’s largest industrial group, plans to spend up to $600m during the next five years to roll out a WiMax wireless network in the hope of dramatically boosting the country’s tiny number of broadband internet connections.Tata’s WiMax deployment will be one of the largest in the world, according to Gartner, the research firm. Sylvain Fabre, analyst at Gartner, said Tata’s plans were similar to those of Wateen Telecom, which is rolling out the world’s first nationwide WiMax network in Pakistan.Tata expects to sign up at least 200,000 customers in 115 cities by next March and has signed a deal with California-based Telsima to supply the network.The Indian and Pakistani WiMax deployments are aimed at providing a wireless alternative to fixed-line broadband connections for homes and offices.Proponents of WiMax argue that it is the most economical way of connecting households to high-speed networks in countries where fixed-line networks are less well developed.Meanwhile, mobile operators, such as Sprint Nextel of the US and Japan’s KDDI, are looking to use WiMax to provide “on the move” broadband connections, for example for laptop users.The launch of WiMax in India enables “reliable and affordable communication anytime, anywhere”, Shan-kar Prasad, president of Tata Communications retail business unit, said on Tuesday.The number of broadband connections in India pales in comparison with the swelling size of the country’s mobile phone market. India adds about 8m mobile subscribers each month but counts only 3.1m total broadband connections out of its population of 1.1bn.The country looks unlikely to meet ambitious government targets of reaching 10m broadband connections by 2010. The number of broadband connections is low partly because of poor or non-existent fixed-line telecoms infrastructure running to many homes and offices.WiMax can dispense with ground cables to reach customers, making the wireless technology attractive to many developing countries.Computer ownership in India is also low. While PC sales grew a robust 20 per cent last year, India had roughly 22m computers as of last March, according to IDC, the consulting firm.Tata’s WiMax services are aimed primarily at urban users in the next few years.

584;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-02-27T19:00:52Z;New mobile players ring the changes;;"Apple, Research In Motion and ZTE Corp joined the ranks of the world’s 10 largest mobile phone makers in 2007, underlining how technology advances and emerging markets are producing a new cast of winners and losers in the industry.Apple’s much hyped iPhone, which went on sale in the US and Europe last year and set a new industry standard in mobile web browsing, transformed the US computer maker into the 10th largest handset manufacturer in the fourth quarter of 2007, according to Gartner, the research firm.RIM’s BlackBerry, whose success is rooted in its user friendly mobile email, did better than Apple, and the Canadian company became the sixth largest handset maker as measured by number of devices sold.But perhaps the most interesting new entrant is ZTE, the Chinese telecoms equipment maker that is starting to give established western rivals, such as Nokia, a run for their money.ZTE has struck deals with mobile operators including Vodafone, the world’s largest operator by revenue, to provide cheap handsets for emerging markets.Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner, said ZTE was producing handsets costing $40 or less for markets such as India, and becoming a “bit of an annoyance” for Nokia, the world’s largest mobile maker.ZTE’s success contrasts sharply with the fall from grace of Motorola, the US telecoms company that is considering selling its loss-making handset business. Motorola saw its market share fall to 11.9 per cent in the last three months of 2007, compared to 21.5 per cent in the same period in 2006.That 9.6 percentage point decline was worse than during the third quarter of 2007, and Gartner said Motorola could see a further fall in its market share in the first three months of 2008.Motorola’s strategy of increasing market share unravelled in late 2006 because it lacked new handsets to maintain profitability.Nokia, which secured a record 40.4 per cent market share in the fourth quarter of 2007, and Samsung, the second largest manufacturer, continue to benefit from Motorola’s woes.Apple, RIM and ZTE were in the top 10 in the fourth quarter at the expense of BenQ, the Taiwanese mobile maker; Bird, the Chinese manufacturer; and Sagem, part of France’s Safran group.Global handset sales rose 16 per cent in 2007, to 1.2bn devices, but Gartner estimates the market will grow by 10 per cent in 2008."
585;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-02-17T19:18:51Z;Last showing for Toshiba’s DVD format;;By the time Wal-Mart announced on Friday that it would no longer stock HD-DVD players, the writing was on the wall for Toshiba.Having suffered a string of defeats for its next-generation DVD format and racked up losses from its poor-selling hardware, the Japanese electronics group appears ready to give way to Sony’s rival Blu-ray format after two years of battle.The demise of the HD-DVD format was signalled last month when Warner Brothers announced it would back the Blu-ray standard. Toshiba’s attempts to win back customers by slashing the prices of its players were not persuasive enough.Hiroyuki Shimizu, analyst at Gartner, wrote: “Gartner believes that Toshiba’s price-cutting may prolong HD-DVD’s life a little, but the limited line-up of film titles will inflict fatal damage on the format . . . By the end of 2008, Blu-ray will be the winning format in the consumer market, and the war will be over”.Over the past two years, Toshiba has invested millions of dollars in HD-DVD, churning out players, recorders and laptops equipped with the drives. Paramount and Universal Studios threw their weight behind the format and at one point Blu-ray and HD-DVD were locked in a neck-and-neck battle.Observers say Toshiba simply botched its marketing, and was not quick enough to appeal to Hollywood studios. Sony, which, with its failed Betamax video standard, learned the hard way that superior technology does not always win, used its strong industry connections to woo five of the seven big studios.While Toshiba focused on consumer education, Sony highlighted the content available on Blu-ray and blitzed the media.As one person noted on gadgets blog Gizmodo.com: “Marketing and strategic alliances are probably what won this for [Sony]. Even something as simple as the name, Blu-ray, sounds a hell of a lot more forward-thinking than a long acronym.”But will the demise of HD-DVD amount to a phyrric victory for Sony? After all, consumers have largely ignored the battle, unwilling to invest in a technology that may become obsolete. And with digital downloads becoming increasingly popular, there is the very likely possibility that consumers will bypass Blu-ray altogether and download films from the internet.But Blu-ray backers believe that most Americans do not yet have the infrastructure to support digital downloads and that a preference remains for packaged media.Sony said this year that it planned a significantly step up in its marketing campaign for Blu-ray, which may coax more consumers into choosing the format, as high-definition televisions become a staple in many US homes.Toshiba is expected to retreat in the next few weeks. But as the Microsoft/Yahoo takeover battle brews, observers can’t help wondering: why were these two Japanese electronics companies duelling over hardware, in an age when hardware is quickly becoming obsolete?
586;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-02-10T20:16:49Z;Sony Ericsson eyes China and India;;Sony Ericsson has admitted that its presence is “weak” in India, China and the US, and has designated these countries as priorities while it seeks to become one of the three largest mobile phone makers by 2011.Dick Komiyama, the company’s new president, expressed confidence it would hit its 2011 target through organic growth, and ruled out buying the handset division of Motorola, the troubled US mobile-maker.In his first interview since becoming Sony Ericsson president in November, Mr Komiyama also told the Financial Times that he would consider the case for the company making cheap handsets that cost as little as $25 eachIf he were to implement this shift, it would mark a big change of strategy, since the company has hitherto concentrated on medium and high-priced phones. However, he refrained from committing himself to this shift yet.Nokia has consolidated its grip as the world’s largest handset manufacturer by establishing a strong presence in emerging markets. Sony Ericsson is the fourth-largest handset maker, but it badly trails Nokia.Nokia had a 38.1 per cent market share of the total number of mobiles sold as of September 2007, followed by Samsung on 14.5 per cent, Motorola on 13.1 per cent and Sony Ericsson on 8.8 per cent, according to Gartner, the research firm.“We have three areas where we need emphasis to strengthen,” said Mr Komiyama, pointing to India, China and the US. He described Sony Ericsson’s sales performance in these countries as “rather weak”.Sony Ericsson, a joint venture between Japan’s Sony and Sweden’s Ericsson, plans to increase its market share by customising more of its phones for individual markets.The company on Sunday unveiled what is likely to be seen as a riposte to Apple’s much-hyped iPhone.At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the wireless industry’s main annual conference, SonyEricsson released the X1, a phone that also serves as a music player and provides internet access. The X1 underlines Sony Ericsson’s commitment to sophisticated mobiles, and will spearhead its new push on the US market.But Mr Komiyama said he wanted to explore the merits of Sony Ericsson making cheap handsets, adding such a move could be made within three years.These mobiles, which fell in price to $25 per handset last year, provide basic phone and text services for emerging markets.Motorola’s handset division ran into financial difficulties in 2006 partly because it sacrificed profitability to win market share in developing countries. Those difficulties have continued, and Motorola is considering selling it.
587;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-01-29T18:09:37Z;New mainframes: IT power is moving back to the centre;;"Adecade ago they were counting them all out. Now they are counting the blades and servers back in again, as the trend to distributed computing falters and the datacentre reclaims its central position in enterprise information processing.The talk around the water cooler is of centralised control and virtualisation – using the power of modern processors to run many operating systems and applications on a single machine. Citrix, a maker of thin client software, and VMware, a specialist in virtualisation, are much in fashion.Ian Snadden, vice-president, systems and technology in Europe for Unisys, says the change represents a need to regain control: “Many chief information officers are not aware of the number of servers that sit on their network, never mind the sheer amount of wasted capacity that compromises their productivity.“Add to this growing concerns that staff members are exploiting the computing freedom they have amassed over the past 10 years and the reasons for greater control are evident.”There is no doubt that many big datacentres are struggling with complexity.Milind Govekar, analyst with the Gartner Group, observes that in IT, nothing ever dies. “We glibly talk about IT lifecycles but we don’t believe in one of the key stages and that is death. We keep piling on the stuff until we have a huge, complex mess.“Virtualisation is one answer. But if you virtualise a mess you’ll get a bigger mess. The overriding need is to cut complexity first.”A big catalyst for change, according to Jonathan Priestly, a director of BMC Software, is management’s need to regain control over its enterprise resource planning (ERP) operations.Large ERP systems such as SAP’s are often run on separate systems with their own dedicated staff: “If I walk into a big US retail set-up I can practically guarantee there will be a completely separate SAP team responsible for the implementation of the management side of it and for the core project itself.“This is a big problem from a management standpoint. The application is consuming an enormous amount of datacentre power that you have very little control over. The release of a new version of the product can have tremendous ripple effects throughout the organisation. It might take 18 months to upgrade from one version to the next,” he says, as evidence for his contention that management wants all IT operations under its control.And so, although their architecture today bears no resemblance to that of their predecessors, mainframe computers could once again become the workhorses of the computing industry.As Jim Porell, chief architect for IBM’s mainframe software division, put it: “What we offer is a superior operations container.”He points out that in a typical distributed computing environment, each application will run on a separate server leading to complex networking and a multiplicity of what the industry calls “intrusion points”.These are weaknesses where an insider can gain access to the system to perpetrate fraud or theft, something that Mr Porell says is a huge problem.His answer? “Draw a box around all these servers, call it System Z, and you’ve totally changed the operations model,” he says, arguing that security, resilience and risk management are all simplified in a device which takes up no more floor space than a single server today.System Z is IBM’s latest mainframe family, featuring up to 54 processing units and running ZOS, the latest iteration of the computing giant’s venerable MVS operating software.Mr Porell’s views are backed up by research published last month by the bank Credit Suisse, which confirms that reports of the death of the mainframe are overstated.“In fact,” it says, “we believe that the mainframe market is experiencing a renaissance as IT organisations have once again begun to value many attributes of the mainframe platform including data sharing, disaster recovery, the Linux operating system, partitioning, power and cooling, server pool workload balancing and prioritisation, security, specialised processors, total system utilisation and virtualisation – all of which represent key focus points in today’s cost-and-performance conscious IT spending environment.”Or as Gary Williams, enterprise computing specialist with NEC of Japan, puts it: “With distributed computing, everybody had the power on their desktops. Now everybody realises that is a management nightmare. As well as being heavy on power consumption, it takes a lot of people to manage a distributed environment.“By being able to deliver the same power to the user while putting control back into the datacentre, you are satisfying the best of both worlds. But it’s taken until now for networks to have evolved to be able to support this sort of operation.”NEC’s answer is what it calls the Virtual Personal Computer Centre (VPPC). This is essentially rackfuls of servers in a datacentre that are networked to small desktop units mounted on the back of flat video screens – the 21st-century equivalent of the dumb terminal.Screen updates travel from the datacentre to the desktop; key depressions travel in the opposite direction. The data are secure in the datacentre, free from insider or outsider interference.A similar approach has been taken by the US company ClearCube, which mounts an array of PC blades in the datacentre, communicating with a cassette-sized box on the user’s desk. “In a nutshell, it’s the power and flexibility of a Windows PC with the security, availability and manageability of the mainframe,” says Rich Hoffman, the chief executive.ClearCube’s customers include the US Federal Government and a number of the big banks, all of which value both the security of the system and its high availability – if a blade fails, its workload shifts to another in seconds.The shift back to centralisation has, however, generated diverse approaches. Jason Scott, chief technology officer in Europe for Wachovia, the fourth largest bank in the US, recently returned from the company’s headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he had been networking 5,000 ClearCube blades within a datacentre to create a “grid”, or co-operative computing system for the investment bank.He denies this is a return to the mainframe: “We are looking at a centralised model for running resources but it is a distributed platform. It runs a desktop operating system and it is not expensive like a mainframe. We don’t run any PCs on our desktops any more. Everything we do is what we call back-rack technology.”The ClearCube and grid computing approach seem to have paid dividends for Wachovia. Three years ago, the company invested $2m to create a 625-blade grid farm. “Thirty days later, regulators freed up more than $1bn in capital for Wachovia,” says Mr Scott.David Wright of Hewlett-Packard believes that customers now have a full spectrum of modes of operation available to them: “Computing is now available to customers in a variety of guises, one extreme of which is a centralised model, the other a distributed model.”The Corporate Markets division of Lloyds TSB, the UK bank, recently installed a new computing infrastructure for its 250 traders based on HP workstation blades and servers; the main components were confined to a central equipment room leaving the traders’ desks comparatively uncluttered.HP has recently acquired Neoware, a consultancy and manufacturer of network computers – essentially dumb terminals. According to the company’s Andrew Gee: “It has no moving parts, all is solid state and silent in operation. It uses 12 watts compared with 300 watts for a PC. All the applications reside on the server. It is inherently secure because the data never leave the datacentre.”Tim Murfet of the consultancy Accenture says that while virtualisation is now mainstream, innovations such as allowing staff to buy and use their own PCs over a network are in the early stages. Some companies, he says, are talking of abandoning PCs altogether and using personal digital assistants (PDAs) for connection. “When you come in in the morning, instead of plugging in your laptop to the network, you plug your PDA into the network and into a screen – you would effectively be using your phone to do all your IT.”In the end, however, the decision to centralise or distribute must depend on what is right for the business."
588;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-01-18T22:02:29Z;iPhone sales miss UK target;;Sales of Apple’s much-hyped iPhone in the UK have fallen just short of the expectations of O2, the exclusive network for the handset.O2 said shortly before the iPhone’s UK launch on November 9 that it expected handset sales of 200,000 in the first two months, but people familiar with the situation said the actual figure for the first eight weeks was about 190,000.Some analysts, who had regarded the original 200,000 prediction as a conservative estimate, said Apple might have to cut the price in the UK if it wanted to maintain sales momentum. The iPhone’s headline price is £269, but customers must also take out an 18-month contract starting at £35 a month, meaning a minimum outlay of £899.Gartner, the research firm, said in November that between 350,000 and 400,000 iPhones could be sold in the first eight weeks.O2 declined to comment on the sales figures but said it was “delighted with the response to the iPhone, which has seen unprecedented levels of customer satisfaction”. The mobile operator also confirmed the iPhone was its fastest-selling handset “by a significant margin”.In November, Matthew Key, incoming chief executive of O2 Europe, said he expected about 200,000 iPhones to be sold in the UK in the first two months.The iPhone is also sold by Carphone Warehouse, the mobile retailer. Carphone and Apple on Friday declined to comment on iPhone sales figures in the UK.iPhone sales had been strong in the run-up to Christmas, but tapered off, according to people familiar with the situation.Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner, said price was proving a bigger barrier to sales than she had anticipated. She added that a price cut might be needed to maintain interest ahead of a second version of the handset, due this year.The main problem for Apple is that the UK mobile market, like the US, is subsidised by the network operators. Consumers on monthly contracts often pay nothing for their handset.In the US, 10 weeks after its launch, Apple cut the iPhone’s headline price from $599 to $399, which angered customers who had bought the handset.Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, subsequently apologised. On Tuesday, he said 4m iPhones had been sold worldwide.O2 is pleased how many iPhone customers are proving to be heavy users of data services.Additional reporting by Kevin Allison
589;IT;Gartner Inc;2008-01-17T01:01:39Z;PC sales up but slower growth seen;;Personal computer shipments accelerated in the fourth quarter, but concerns about an economic downturn could contribute to slower growth this year, according to two influential market research groups.Twin studies released by IDC and its rival, Gartner, showed that PC shipments grew between 13 and 15 per cent in the fourth quarter, boosted by better-than-expected growth in the US market.“Despite fourth quarter strength, projections for the next couple years anticipate slower growth,” said Loren Loverde, an analyst at IDC. “Rising concerns about economic growth are likely to reduce expectations further, although we’re still likely to see double digit growth through 2008 and probably 2009,” he added.Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner, said she also anticipated slower PC shipment growth. However, she added that some of the anticipated softness could be offset by the beginning of a new IT replacement cycle, as companies buy new equipment to replace older, outdated machines.Consumers – who emerged as a key driver of PC industry growth last year – could also prove resilient in the face of any economic downturn, Ms Kitagawa said.“PC sales might not be affected by a bad economy. PCs are pretty much essential household items,” she said.Both studies showed Hewlett-Packard extending its lead over arch-rival Dell in worldwide PC sales.HP sold 14.4m PCs in the fourth quarter, compared with 11m at Dell, according to Gartner. IDC’s figures put HP’s sales at 14.7m and Dell’s sales at 11.3m. HP’s shipments grew 23 per cent in the period, while Dell’s grew 17 per cent, according to figures from both research groups.Asian rivals Acer and Lenovo also put in a strong performance, with shipments up 22.5 per cent and 21.9 per cent year on year, respectively.
590;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-12-28T01:21:47Z;Technology predators on the prowl;;KKR’s £600m takeover last week of Northgate Information Solutions was proof that the UK technology sector remains fertile territory for dealmakers.November was a turbulent month as fears began to bite that the credit crunch would force the financial services industry to curb discretionary technology spending, such as on consultants.A profit warning from Detica, one of the sector’s largest players, contributed to the FTSE Software and Information Technology sector’s worst month since the dotcom bubble burst in March 2000.Mild cautionary statements were treated like heavy profit warnings and the long distrust the City has held for technology resurfaced, culminating in early December with the pulled initial public offering of Sophos, the IT security group, despite solid recurring revenues and a 25-year track record.The coming year is likely to prove a tough one for many, especially those with exposure to financial services. After five years of sequential growth, Gartner, the consultancy, is predicting global growth of 5.5 per cent, down from about 8 per cent in 2007.Yet beneath the headline fears, investors, bankers and analysts remain optimistic that corporate earnings and activity will not dry up.The Northgate deal capped a flurry of bid activity in December as predators emerged to sniff out undervalued assets.They appeared willing to pay chunky premiums.Northgate was taken out at 40 per cent more than its prevailing share price, while NSB Retail Systems agreed a £160m deal with US-based Epicor at a 60 per cent premium.Other recent deals include Pace Micro Technology‘s purchase of the set-top box and connectivity business of Dutch group Philips for £68m.Xploite, the IT managed services group, is in talks with several bidders.Investors have grown more comfortable with technology stocks as many companies in the sector have matured and proved far more efficient at converting their cash into operating profit.Furthermore, IT operations are embedded into corporate life as never before.“In a tougher market, there will be more focus on outsourcing tech activity,” said Mike Tobin, chief executive of Telecity, the data centre hosting company.FDM, the IT staffing company, actually forecast results would be materially ahead of previous expectations as a shortage of specialist IT skills meant banks could not rely solely on in-house teams.“Product cycles are typically stronger than the economic cycle – so we are relaxed about the prospects for well-placed product companies like Autonomy, Aveva, Fidessa, Micro Focus and Innovation,” said George O’Connor, an analyst at Panmure Gordon.Will Wallis, an analyst at Numis Securities, said Northgate’s takeover could boost the share prices of companies that have been subject to takeover rumour or talks with private equity, such as Misys, Intec Telecom and Coda.He pointed out that Northgate was sold on a prospective multiple of 18 times enterprise value/net operating profit after tax.“It’s in line with multiples paid by private equity in the UK software sector prior to the credit crunch,” he said.He also predicted it would boost other local government software companies, such as Civica and Anite.“This deal opens up the possibility of consolidation in the public sector, led by private equity,” he added. “Both Civica and IBS …are valued at just half the multiple that KKR is paying for Northgate.”Yet Northgate could still be the largest deal for some time.Graham Bird, fund manager at SVG, which invested in Northgate, said: “I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a pick-up in merger and acquisitions activity as many valuations are extreme.”“Many of these companies are run far better. In the sell-off, there was no distinction between good and bad companies and I think private equity will spot this.”But he added: “There’s unlikely to be mega-deals while the banks are not open properly.”Deals concluded are likely to be “without the need to syndicate with other banks,” he said.Trade buyers flush with cash are also likely to remain interested. Datatec, one of the largest IT services companies on Aim, has a long standing plan for further acquisitions and Jens Montanana, chief executive, remains bullish.“It will play into the hands of operators and not the private equity players as we have assets to make synergies,” he said.“We think there is going to be an opportunity for us,” he said. “But it will take time to work its way through. Some sellers still have silly ideas for valuations.”Nevertheless if the UK and US economies fall into recession, valuations could yet fall further.
591;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-12-27T22:53:00Z;India’s IT outsourcers face increasing costs;;India’s information technology outsourcing sector is heading for crunch time next year, as a rising currency and increasing wage and real estate costs force the industry to rethink how it does business.Multinationals continue to view the country as one of the most viable outsourcing destinations, but competitive pressures are making other countries look attractive.Vineet Nayyar, chief executive of Tech Mahindra, described as “horrible” the impact on IT margins of a 12 per cent appreciation of the rupee against the dollar this year.“All your emerging sectors are going to have major problems because of the currency adjustment,” Mr Nayyar said.India’s IT outsourcing companies have been among the worst performing on the stock market this year. The sector has underperformed the MSCI India index by 47 per cent.Much of the negative sentiment concerns the stronger rupee, which hit Rs39.16 against the dollar last month, its strongest level since March 1998.Indian IT outsourcing companies earn most of their revenue in foreign currencies, particularly dollars, but they incur most of their costs in rupees.The leading companies, such as Infosys Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services, have so far largely maintained their margins. Measures they have used to keep margins up include moving more work onshore and hiring cheaper graduates from disciplines other than engineering. They have also employed hedging.Analysts believe, however, that a longer-term shift in strategy is necessary if India’s IT companies are to prevent more work going overseas to emerging centres such as Vietnam, China and Brazil.Gartner, the research group, in a study of outsourcing destinations, found that India accounted for 28 per cent of the estimated workforce available globally for offshore work. That makes the country the largest such labour pool in the world.But the study also found that costs were rising fast. Salaries are climbing an average 14.5 per cent a year, almost double the rate in China and the Philippines, and the rate of attrition is 20 per cent to 25 per cent.“The attrition [rate] leads to the challenge of consistency and therefore of quality for buyers of these services,” said Ian Marriott, research vice-president at Gartner. “And so the whole appeal of India is starting to just lose a little bit of the gloss.“It’s still very appealing for a whole variety of reasons but it’s starting to get people thinking: should we investigate other locations as well, probably not as an alternative necessarily but in addition to India.”Indian companies needed to move away from thinking that more demand meant more hiring and extracting greater productivity out of existing workforces, Mr Marriott said.While the larger companies were also trying to become more global and were setting up centres in other offshoring locations, this was not an option for the small and medium-sized outsourcers, he said.These smaller companies had to become more specialised. “They’ve got to be very niche by design and very focused on specific markets, specific services, specific kinds of customers,” Mr Marriott said.
592;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;iPhone key to O2 growth;;Matthew Key was in California last week, briefing Steve Jobs on the iPhone’s impact in the UK.The incoming chief executive of O2 Europe, which is the exclusive mobile network for the iPhone in the UK, gave an upbeat report to Apple’s chief executive.Mr Key says 200,000 iPhones should be sold in the UK by early January, which is in line with his expectations since the November 9 launch, al­though some analysts claim his target is conservative. Gartner, the research firm, says sales of up to 400,000 should be possible.In his first interview since his promotion to the top job at O2 Europe was ann­ounced, and speaking ahead of his trip to Apple’s Cupertino headquarters, Mr Key says: “The big question for us is, ‘What does the future look like in terms of product roll-out?’.”Apple’s iPhone has been widely praised for how its innovative design makes data services such as web browsing a user-friendly experience, but it has one big flaw: it runs on second-generation mobile networks.Those networks offer slow web browsing speeds compared to those that rely on 3G mobile technology.A 3G version of the iPhone is due to be launched by Apple next year and Mr Key is confident that O2 will also have an exclusive deal for the mark II device.O2 has signed a multi-year deal with Apple for the iPhone and Mr Key insists Vodafone, for example, could not muscle in and take the 3G iPhone in the UK.Mr Key’s promotion by Telefónica, Spain’s leading telecoms company, which bought O2 last year for £17.7bn, is in no small part due to his success in capturing the iPhone for the UK market.He saw off keen interest from Vodafone, Orange and T-Mobile, although some of them subsequently claimed they rejected Apple’s commercial terms because they were too onerous.Mr Key insists the iPhone is profitable business for O2 in spite of its highly unusual revenue-sharing agreement with Apple. Under the deal, part of the monthly payments made by iPhone customers to the UK mobile operator for phone calls and data services are passed to the US computer company.Capitalising on the iPhone is one of Mr Key’s top priorities as he succeeds Peter Erskine as chief executive of O2 Europe at the end of January.Mr Key, 44, looked nervous when as chief executive of O2’s UK business he stood alongside Mr Jobs at Apple’s flagship London store in September and outlined plans for the November 9 launch.But now he appears confident and relaxed about the prospect of running O2 Europe’s empire, which also includes mobile businesses in Germany, the Czech Republic and Ireland. At €13.2bn (£9.5bn), they generated 27 per cent of Telefónica’s revenue in 2006.Mr Key is excited about how iPhone customers are turning out to have a big appetite for data services. About 60 per cent are sending or receiving more than 25MB of data a month, which is the equivalent of sending 7,500 e-mails.By comparison, only 1.8 per cent of O2’s other mobile customers on monthly contracts are consuming more than 25MB a month.The O2 research suggests that after years of dashed hopes for the operators, customers are on the verge of surfing the web on their mobiles in significant numbers. This could in the future make mobile advertising a significant revenue stream for the operators.In the near term, the iPhone may help Mr Key in the tough task of trying to maintain O2’s position as the UK’s largest mobile operator. Vodafone is resurgent, but Mr Key highlights how the iPhone is enabling O2 to steal customers from rivals. About 60 per cent of iPhone users are new to O2.O2 will in the new year step up marketing of its new fixed-line broadband packages, which were launched in October.O2 is a late entrant to the hyper-competitive UK broadband market, but Mr Key insists it can hit its target of having 1m customers by 2010. Analysts at Enders Analysis say 400,000 is more realistic.However, Mr Key’s most pressing challenge is the turnround of O2’s faltering German mobile business.The German mobile operators are embroiled in a ferocious price war. O2’s German business is the third largest, yet it is well behind that of rivals T-Mobile and Vodafone and has seen its revenue fall for three successive quarters.At Telefónica’s second- quarter results, the revenue growth guidance for O2’s German business was reduced because of its difficulties. It was the first time O2 had ever downgraded guidance.However, Mr Key stands by O2 Europe’s forecast that its group of businesses will increase revenue by between 11 and 14 per cent in 2007, and operating profit by 7 to 10 per cent.
593;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-12-05T22:02:05Z;Nokia changes its tune on mobile strategy;;"Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, Nokia’s chief executive, is leading the Finnish company through the biggest change to its business strategy since it became the world’s largest mobile phone maker in the late 1990s.He is moving the company into providing internet services for mobiles. It is a strategy fraught with uncertainty, not least because Nokia risks alienating its traditional customers: network operators such as Vodafone that buy the Finnish company’s handsets.But Nokia is forging ahead with the strategy because the advent of wireless third-generation networks, coupled with user-friendly handsets, has made it possible to web surf on mobiles at speeds not that far behind fixed-line broadband.Nokia has done a flurry of deals over the past 18 months to give it a capability in mobile internet services. In October the company announced plans to buy Navteq, a US company that specialises in maps for the internet. At $8.1bn, it is Nokia’s largest acquisition.Mr Kallasvuo, who became chief executive in June last year, after 25 years with Nokia, told the Financial Times: “We are second-to-none when it comes to having the ingredients of taking mobility to the internet in a major way. It is a natural extension of the business.”Nokia is diversifying into mobile internet services partly because the handset manufacturing industry is facing slowing growth. The annual increase in the number of devices sold is falling, from 21 per cent in 2006 to a projected 15 per cent in 2007, according to Gartner, the research firm.Moreover, the mobile makers are all reporting that the average selling price of their devices is falling.In the short-term, Mr Kallasvuo says that Nokia’s internet services should “support” its average selling price, and therefore also help its operating margin.The best example of this strategy is Nokia’s potentially far-reaching Comes With Music initiative, under which people who buy certain of its phones will get free access to the music catalogue of Universal Music for one year.That access should bolster the amount that network operators are willing to pay Nokia for phones that include Comes With Music.This is because the operators should in turn be able to charge their mobile customers a premium for Nokia phones that offer the chance to download millions of tracks by Universal Music’s artists.Nokia is talking to other music labels, which means Comes With Music could offer a wide selection of artists when it launches next summer.In the longer-term, Mr Kallasvuo says that Nokia’s mobile internet services, based on its Ovi platform, which means “door” in Finnish, should provide it with “billions of euros”.He is coy about going further, declining to say what percentage of group revenue could come from these services in three or five years’ time.However, Mr Kallasvuo plays down the prospect that Nokia’s internet services strategy could alienate the network operators.Many operators, led by Vodafone, have their own internet portals with pay-per-track music download stores and these could lose business to Nokia’s Ovi platform.But Mr Kallasvuo highlights how, since October, Nokia has struck deals with Vodafone, Telefónica and Telecom Italia under which these operators’ customers will get user-friendly access to the Ovi platform.He argues the operators’ interests are aligned with Nokia’s. If the Finnish
company comes up with attractive handsets, such as those featuring Comes With Music, it will sell more mobiles to the operators, who in turn will sell more devices to customers.Comes With Music is a response to Apple’s iPhone, and the US computer company’s move into mobile underlines how Nokia faces increasing competition. Traditional rivals, such as Samsung, are getting stronger. But the more significant threat could come from new entrants, such as Apple and possibly Google, the internet search company.Per Lindberg, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, who has a “sell” rating on Nokia’s shares, estimates that the operating margin at Nokia’s mobile manufacturing business could more than halve to 9 per cent by 2012.Mr Kallasvuo, however, stands by Nokia’s “solid numbers” in its 2008 guidance, under which the mobile operating margin is expected to increase from 19 to 20 per cent over the next two years.Additionally, he argues that Nokia can lift its share of the mobile handset market from its existing 39 per cent to 40 per cent and beyond.He says: “I am a big believer in the market share. I do not think the economies of scale will stop at 40.”"
594;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-12-05T22:02:05Z;Nokia in move to recapture US lead;;"Nokia is planning a significant assault on the US mobile market in a bid to re-establish its pre-eminence there.Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, Nokia’s chief executive, told the Financial Times he wanted the company once again to be the largest supplier of mobiles in the US.Nokia, the world’s largest mobile handset manufacturer, lost its lead in the US to Motorola in 2004 and has seen its position in the market slip to fourth.Nokia increased its share of the global mobile market to
39 per cent in the third quarter of this year, as measured by the number of handsets sold to network operators.Mr Kallasvuo expressed confidence that Nokia could raise its share to 40 per cent or more, and said the company had to perform better in the US, its weakest market excluding Japan.Nokia is the leading supplier of mobiles in western Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific regions.“The only possible ambition for us in the US is to be the market leader,” said Mr Kallasvuo. “Whatever it takes to be the market leader.” He declined to put a timeframe on regaining the top spot.Gartner, the research firm, estimates that Motorola had a
31 per cent share of the US mobile market in the third quarter, followed by Samsung on
20 per cent, LG on 16 per cent and Nokia on 12 per cent.Nokia wants to bounce back by tailoring handsets to the different needs of the four leading US network operators: AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile.Nokia lost ground after it largely stopped making mobiles for the US market based on the second-generation wireless technology called CDMA, which is used by Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel.It is now looking to develop more Nokia-branded CDMA mobiles but outsource the production.Mr Kallasvuo said Nokia could also benefit in the US from plans by Verizon Wireless to use LTE as its 4G wireless technology, which will offer faster web-
surfing speeds on mobiles.LTE is based on 2G and 3G wireless technologies known as GSM and WCDMA, in which Nokia has extensive expertise.Analysts said Nokia had an opportunity to make up ground because Motorola was weak following profit warnings this year."
595;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-12-05T04:40:27Z;What’s on CIO wishlists?;;"Aligning technology with the business, while dealing with the pressure on space and power in the data centre and addressing green issues are the priorities for many chief information officers next year.Security is now so critical that it automatically figures near the top of every agenda. Steven Bandrowczak, CIO for Nortel, the Canadian telecommunications manufacturer, points out that a security contingency plan is there to prevent a breach of security that can badly damage a brand.A thoroughly unscientific straw poll of CIOs, principally from the US and UK, revealed, nevertheless, that a few other themes come to the fore. Steve Bozzo, CIO of New York based online florist 1-800-Flowers.com, places business alignment at the top of his list.“For 2008, as always,” he says, “companies will be most successful if IT is strongly aligned with the businesses it supports” going on to point out that companies must migrate to an “agile” architecture if they are to bring products to market that will have a meaningful impact on earnings and revenue: “Migrating to a Services Oriented Architecture will be the only way to accomplish this.”This is in line with preliminary findings on 2008 priorities by research firm Gartner, which shows CIOs seeking to focus on aligning IT with growth and innovation. “Looking at costs is straightforward but prioritising growth and innovation is much more challenging,” says Dave Aron, a Gartner analyst looking at CIO issues.Guy Lidbetter, chief technology officer for the big European computing services group Atos Origin, agrees, noting that the CIO agenda is being driven by a need for managed innovation.He emphasises the importance of demonstrating to managers the value that IT investments bring to the business and ensuring IT is agile enough to support changing business needs. “In the context of infrastructure, standardisation, virtualisation and automation will deliver. In applications, enterprise architecture, service-oriented architecture and – potentially – Web 2.0 and collaboration will deliver.”Note how quickly methodologies such as “agility” – developing software in a quicker, less formal way – and “service-oriented architecture” – ways of persuading legacy systems to work with the smart, new stuff – have moved from “might have” to “must have”.Bryan Doerr, chief technology officer of Savvis, a US-managed service group, says, however, that to make the most of virtualisation, businesses need to invest in a secure and robust IT infrastructure. He says: “Both vendors and organisations are embracing new, virtualised technologies to yield more flexible and cost effective solutions. As it continues to mature, I predict it will become less of a differentiator for businesses and more of a commodity.”Rorie Devine, chief technology officer for the online gambling organisation Betfair, concurs: “Virtualisation is definitely part of the mainstream now.”Mr Devine’s chief priority next year will be to execute the business plan while helping to shape the business strategy. The processing load will be substantial: “The number of transactions we process will again be more than all the other years of our existence added together.”Web 2.0 and social networking may be becoming candidates for the mainstream, although some CIOs have their reservations. Bob Worrall, for example, CIO of Sun Microsystems, reckons to have talked to well over 100 of his contemporaries over the past year and believes that social networking represents a new threat. “There is a lot of information out there on blogs and wiki, but there is no easy way to harvest that information and make it available to the organisation” he says.Sun, however, has created a virtual Californian building in cyberspace and is experimenting with its use as a meeting place for remote staff.Mr Worrall says that every CIO is struggling with the problem of power and space in the data centre. Sun itself is downsizing from seven corporate data centres to three, aided by a combination of new, more powerful servers based on novel chip technology and virtualisation – running several operating systems and/or applications on the same server.Brian Jones, a former CIO for both the spirits group Allied Domecq and Scottish Power, says that IT in large companies often grows in an uncontrolled fashion. “There is often a need to remove the complexity that has grown up over time and set a simplification agenda directly linked to the objectives of the business overall,” he says, arguing that this latter aim can often be lost if the transformation is poorly focused.He expects pressure on IT costs will not ease and that CIOs will be forced to balance the need for innovation against tightening budgets. “One trick that CIOs are going to have to learn, if they have not already, is how to take advantage of the latent value in their suppliers.” Suppliers have often spent millions on research and development which could benefit a company. While at Allied Domecq, for example, he formed a partnership with the telecommunications group that transformed Allied’s messy, “basket case” of a communications network, while reducing costs by £3m a year.Mr Bandrowczak of Nortel, is using virtualisation and centralisation to get more efficiencies out of the IT assets the company already has and the investments it has already made. “That’s my first big trend. Second is how to integrate all these disparate and separate technologies. One trend I am driving at Nortel is unified messaging, handling voice, text and fax in one mailbox, so it can be retrieved by any device. Moving between applications causes inefficiencies – I call it business latency.”His ambition is to combine a single log-on with authentication, so that if an individual was on the road and logged on, and another individual in the company wanted to share information with them, the system would indicate he or she was travelling and therefore available only by SMS but that they had the time to discuss that particular issue. “But we’re not there yet,” Mr Bandrowczak says.RM, the supplier of IT to UK schools, places collaboration and mobility at the top of its list. Chris Clements, the CIO comments: “Our vision for collaboration goes beyond our employees and includes our customers. We have a large candidate list of opportunities to add value to our core systems by providing tools that will enable customers directly to influence product development and enable them to do business at any time of the school day that is convenient to them. One of the biggest challenges is to evaluate Web 2.0 opportunities and select those which will add real value to the business.”And the green agenda? A study by Symantec (see “Vendors’ View”, Page 4) suggests organisations are not yet successfully rolling out green centres.But the bandwagon is on the move. The consultancy Quocirca thinks companies will finally make better use of advanced communications capabilities such as web 2.0 and videoconferencing to reduce travel. But it concludes a little wearily that style will defeat substance in some cases. “There will still be those who want to be seen to be green but who do not really take the issue on board and resort to half measures such as carbon off-setting.”One thing all those questioned agreed on, however, was that it is going to be an interesting year.CIO priorities, based on Alan Cane’s informal straw poll:

596;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-11-29T21:28:20Z;AT&T chief lets slip plan for faster iPhone;;Apple plans to unveil a new version of its iPhone handset next year with faster download speeds, according to Randall Stephenson, chief executive of AT&T, Apple’s US mobile partner.Asked at a dinner in Silicon Valley when customers could expect Apple to launch a faster, 3G version of the iPhone, Mr Stephenson said “you’ll have it next year”. He declined to provide further details.News of a faster iPhone comes at an awkward time for Apple. With the Christmas shopping season now under way and just weeks after the iPhone’s European debut, some analysts said there was a risk premature disclosure could alienate customers and stifle sales of existing handsets that run on slower 2.5G networks.“It’s a pretty stupid move,” said Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner, the market research company. “One big complaint about the iPhone is the [slower 2.5G] network. Now Stephenson’s said they’re going to have a higher-speed network next year. People are going to wait.”“If I were Steve Jobs, I’d be very annoyed,” Mr Baker added.Others analysts were less sure it would hit sales.“If he’d have said ‘next year as in next January’ I think it would have had a bigger impact,” said Michael Gartenberg at Jupiter Research. “In the absence of details, I don’t think it’s going to matter that much to consumers.”In the long run, industry-watchers agreed that the launch of a 3G iPhone would open up opportunities for Apple.“In the longer term, having a truly capable 3G phone is good for them,” said Barry Jaruzelski, a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton. “It dramatically expands the iPhone's market and relative competitiveness, particularly in Europe.”Steve Jobs earlier this year said issues with battery life had prevented Apple from launching a 3G iPhone. He indicated that the battery life issue could be solved by late next year.Apple said: “We do not comment on future product direction.”Analysts said Mr Stephenson’s remarks underscored the challenges faced by Apple in managing its partnerships with mobile operators, who do not necessarily share the culture of secrecy about new products Apple traditionally maintains in order to generate buzz among consumers.Apple’s shares rose 2.7 per cent to $185 by late afternoon in New York on Thursday, while shares of AT&T rose 1.6 per cent to $38.11.
597;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-11-27T22:29:07Z;Motorola trails Samsung in global market;;Motorola lost its second spot in the global mobile handset market to Samsung in the third quarter, according to data released on Tuesday, as the US company focused on returning to profit instead of market share.Motorola’s share of the global mobile phone market fell to 13.1 per cent in the three months to the end of September, compared with 20.7 per cent a year ago and 14.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2007, according to figures from Gartner, the research firm. Meanwhile, Korea’s Samsung edged up to 14.5 per cent from 12.2 per cent last year and 13.4 per cent in the previous quarter.Finland’s Nokia underlined its global dominance, increasing its share by 3 percentage points to 38.1 per cent year-on-year – its highest quarterly share to date – and up from 36.9 per cent in the second quarter.“Motorola today is a pale version of the company it was a year ago,” said Carolina Milanesi, research director at Gartner.Motorola saw strong sales in 2005 and 2006 thanks to its ultra-slim Razr phone, which sold more than 50m units, but has struggled to find new products with the same popularity.The latest version of Motorola’s best-seller, the Razr2, has been well received and sold 900,000 units in the quarter, but Motorola needs a wider portfolio of products to compete with its rivals, Ms Milanesi said. She added that Motorola was unlikely to regain a 20 per cent market share in the next 12 months.Ed Zander, chief executive of Motorola, has promised to return the handset business to profitability by next year and is turning down business in emerging markets, where volumes are high but margins are low. Rivals such as Nokia, however, have seen strong growth in these areas.Nokia’s strong volume growth means it is close to reaching its stated goal of 40 per cent market share. The Finnish handset maker also continues to dominate in the smartphone segment of the market, with 57 per cent market share, compared with less than 10 per cent for its nearest rival, Research in Motion, maker of the Blackberry.Apple, which entered the smartphone segment with its iPhone in June, sold 1.4m units in the US in the third quarter. Total global smartphone sales reached 27.4m in the same period. Apple has targeted 10m iPhone sales in 2008, which is likely to make a clear number two in the segment behind Nokia.iPhone sales were not launched in Europe until the fourth quarter.
598;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
599;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-11-20T12:52:47Z;Security: Hidden dangers of file transfer;;Threats to a company’s information security do not always come from new technology. While CIOs and chief security officers might worry about the risks carried in iPhones or brought in through social networking sites, some experts warn that a far older tool is rendering businesses vulnerable to data loss and electronic intrusion.That tool is file transfer protocol, which companies have used since the advent of the mainframe. In some cases, the mainframe is still the principal home for FTP in large companies, because it remains one of the most practical ways to transfer files between large systems.It is, however, what security professionals term a “dirty” protocol. In-built levels of protection are limited. User names, passwords and often the files themselves are sent in the clear.“FTP does things in a way you would never include in a protocol today,” says John Pescatore, vice-president at research firm Gartner, and a specialist in IT security. “In any security audit, FTP is a hole you have to look for.” That hole will, in all likelihood, have been plugged in any business large enough to run its own mainframe.In fact, IBM has developed a number of strong security measures for its Z Series mainframe machines, including access control and encryption, as well as restricting FTP traffic to known and trusted IP addresses or ensuring the only way to use FTP on a network is to use the FTP servers on the mainframe itself.“The [mainframe] platform has security measures for FTP, starting with identification and authentication with a simple user ID and password right through to digital certificates,” explains Linwood Overby, a senior technical staff member at IBM.Deploying a digital certificate to control FTP alone is unlikely to make commercial sense, however, and even companies with FTP running on mainframes or other enterprise-grade systems need to remain vigilant. The reason is that FTP, like so many arcane areas of technology, is being made more accessible.A quick internet search reveals dozens of free FTP applications that can turn a standard desktop computer into an FTP system. Increasingly, FTP services with large storage capacities come with paid-for, and sometimes with free, internet accounts.This makes any company vulnerable to unauthorised FTP traffic, data “leakage” or outright data theft, unless networks have been set up specifically to block unauthorised FTP traffic.And the situation is being made worse by the proliferation of FTP “alternatives” that promise to do away with the technical know-how needed to set up a standard FTP client or server.The uptake of these services – including web-based file transfer utilities such as YouSendIt and SendThisFile – is being driven as much by consumers as by business.A growing desire to send files such as digital photos, music or home videos, and the increasing quality of digital media, have created a demand for services that anyone can use, and that overcome the typical 8MB to 10MB file size limits of most corporate and personal e-mail accounts.But the family guy in the corner looking for a way to send videos of the kids’ party to Grandma might unwittingly open up a serious security hole.“It is very easy to download an FTP application and call your friend or business associate with the address. But there is no way of verifying these transfers, and nothing in the process that protects your business,” warns Dr Taher Elgamal, chief technology officer at security vendor Tumbleweed. “And the free services offer no guarantees that a file transfer is done correctly or properly scheduled.”The most popular file transfer services do provide some basic security, although this is typically restricted to users who sign up for the paid-for business or enterprise services.SendThisFile uses 128-bit SSL encryption, similar to that on many banks’ websites, for all file transfers.Its enterprise version uses DES encryption for files stored on its servers, but that is not a feature of the free service. YouSendIt also uses SSL, although it does not offer file encryption on its servers.Both services provide a higher level of security than a standard open FTP service, and should be less vulnerable to attackers looking for back doors into a company network. But at the same time, the measures that make such services less vulnerable make them harder to block than vanilla FTP. YouSendIt, for example, uses a network’s Port 443, which is also used by web browsers.This raises issues for companies that simply do not want staff transferring files using third-party services, however secure they might be. Allowing the use of consumer-friendly FTP services makes life easier for those who might want to transfer confidential information to people outside the business.A secure, file transfer service overcomes this, in part, by logging who has transferred data, and when. But for total security, these services need to work in conjunction with data leak prevention technology, suggests Bill Nagel, a specialist in security and risk at Forrester Research.“As much as 80 per cent of all data leaks come from inside a company. Businesses are having to keep more data for longer, and the flipside to that is that there is more data that can get out,” says Mr Nagel.The tagging that data leak prevention systems rely on is a huge effort, he points out, and perhaps appropriate only for the most sensitive information.For the rest, a combination of education and providing secure ways to transfer files may be the most effective way to reduce risky behaviour, says Mr Nagel.“In a third of data leak cases, the cause was something that people knew they shouldn’t do, but which made their lives easier.”
600;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-11-20T00:51:19Z;Amazon launches digital reader;;Amazon, the online retailer, has launched a $400 hand-held digital reader that it hopes will popularise the downloading of books, newspapers and print in the way that Apple has driven the growth of digital music.Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive and founder, said he recognised the Amazon Kindle reader “would never out-book the book”. But, he said, “we had to take technology and do things that the book can’t do”.The reader, developed over more than three years, marks Amazon’s entrance into the highly competitive arena of digital devices.It will compete with Sony’s $300 Reader, launched last year, and against multi-purpose devices such as Nokia’s Tablet and Apple’s iPhone.However, Sony’s Reader, now in its second version, has failed to prove there is more than a niche market for e-books. It has refused to disclose sales figures and has not launched the device outside the US.The flurry of interest that accompanied the first digital book readers at the end of the 1990s proved short-lived. “They never went anywhere – they were too big and too expensive,” said Mike McGuire, an analyst at Gartner. “There’s still the issue of price,” he added.The launch of Kindle comes amid a fresh wave of experimentation in digital books, with various technologies now able to bring chapters or even complete books to devices such as Apple’s iPhone, said Mr McGuire. The price of the Kindle includes unlimited access to a nationwide wireless network that lets users buy e-books and download them in about a minute from Amazon.It will also automatically download digital versions of subscription newspapers and magazines, as well as blogs. It includes a built-in digital version of the New American Oxford Dictionary that can be accessed from the pages, and access to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Most bestselling titles will be sold at $9.99.Amazon’s rubber-backed, wedge-like device uses a “paper-like” electronic ink display similar to Sony’s device but is slightly larger and an ounce heavier. Its main advantage will be its easy access, without the need for a separate contract with a wireless-service provider.During the launch of the Kindle, Mr Bezos compared the device with the evolution of writing from the clay tablet to the papyrus scroll to the printed book. Amazon’s shares closed up 0.7 per cent at $79.18.
601;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-11-19T07:18:30Z;Independence: ‘Pure’ advisers may want to dirty their hands;;The classic model of consultancy had the client receiving truly independent advice unsullied by any desire to sell implementation services.But the revenue volatility associated with unpredictable one-off projects has long encouraged most consultancies to try to help implement the solutions they propose. Some offer to manage and staff the transformed parts of the organisation under an outsourcing contract.“Historically, consultants were purely advisers who wrote reports, but 20 years ago they moved into implementation,” says Fiona Czerniawska, director of the think tank at the Management Consultancies Association. “However, in the last three years the pendulum has swung [back] to advisory work, particularly with the re-entry into the consulting market of three of the big four accounting firms. It is pretty balanced at the moment, but the advisory element is just in the ascendency.”Consultancies with this approach tend to hold the intellectual high ground and attract the best consultants. “The client gets deep capabilities and competencies,” says Michael von Uechtritz und Steinkirch, market research director at Gartner, the analyst.However, these skills come at a price and day rates are perceived as higher than those of a more broadly-based consultancy. Georgina O’Toole, a senior analyst at Ovum, says that it is partly historical and partly that they pay top salaries to attract and hold on to higher calibre people.Another disadvantage of this approach is that without the implementation skills, the strategy may be more theoretical than practical. This can lead to problems later on, once the consultant has moved on, that can reduce the value realised from the work undertaken.“Neutrality is expensive and is not always the best option,” says Ms O’Toole. “Clients should question the benefits of independence, because they may not need or benefit from neutrality. There are often advantages in using technology suppliers to implement the strategy, because of their experience of doing, rather than just advising on it. Clients should be intelligent enough to deal with the lack of neutrality if they have a trusting and open relationship with the supplier.”She also warns that pure advisory consultancies are accused of trying to make work for themselves by creating a long-term relationship with the client. In a changing world, they continually want to update the advice and strategy.“Not everybody thinks the pure-play businesses are truly independent,” she says. “They are also accused of trying to sell other services going forward.”Even if strategic advice is insightful and offers sound solutions, its value depends upon well-executed implementation. A Deloitte survey of 120 senior executives found poor execution was the factor most likely to impede company growth.Many consultancies therefore offer to stay with the client and implement their own advice. This is good for the client in ensuring the strategy is implementable and will be properly executed by people who understand the objectives. It is also good for the consultancy, in that it provides ongoing income, and some consultancies go further by employing the staff and managing the transformed operation under an outsourcing contract, so providing an “end-to-end” solution.Paul Toner, senior vice president at BearingPoint, says planning an operational strategy with the knowledge of how it will be executed makes for a far more successful and “implementable” strategy.“Many clients have expressed dissatisfaction at consultants who come in, tell them what is wrong, make change recommendations and then leave,” says Paul Marshall, managing director at Protiviti. “This misses out what clients seem to value most, which is assistance in implementing the recommended changes.”However, KPMG partner Alan Downey argues that few clients actually buy into the lifecycle concept, from strategy to outsourcing, and are right not to. “Clients are more sophisticated and want a specialist at each stage,” he says. “There are more likely to be two or three consultancies than one. There are not many assignments going from boardroom strategy to managing desktop computers!”Mr von Uechtritz und Steinkirch warns that the sheer scale of big transformation projects undertaken by a single consultancy means they may want to exploit the intellectual property they create.“You must watch it carefully,” he says. “Consider who has the financial and economic benefit after the solution has been created. If the consultant starts to replicate the solution with other clients, the end-user may have paid for the standardisation and industrialisation of the solution for the next client.”Many consultancies claim to have competencies across a significant number of industries and all have references. Mr von Uechtritz und Steinkirch advises clients to try to understand the investment the potential consultancy has made to create innovative solutions, which is what clients really demand.He also warns that not every consulting company in today’s market has consultants with strategic, change management and technology skills. Even if they do, staff turnover during a long project can cause problems.At the less glamorous end of the market are the execution-only consultancies, who understand a particular technology, process or industry and may even be owned by a leading supplier. Although not independent, they have deep knowledge of implementation in their area of specialism.“They may lack strategy perspective and objectivity,” says Mr von Uechtritz und Steinkirch, “but they will have vertical solutions, operational models and quality assurance systems in place and are good at execution.”Ms O’Toole says they are not coming at implementation from a purely theoretical stance, but have hands-on experience of implementing similar solutions and strategies. “They have a much more practical viewpoint,” she says.According to Ms Czerniawska, clients sometimes just want advice, sometimes just implementation and sometimes both. “It depends on individual circumstances and the type of consultancy they are after, what sort of relationship they have with their supplier and whether technology procurement is involved.”Ms Czerniawska points out that in an economic boom, organisations are both hungry for advice and have greater discretion to invest in consultancy.“It’s a time when they are thinking about ideas and strategy, rather than just implementation,” she says. “When times are hard, they are more focused on rapid implementation.”The ideas factoriesHow can consultancies justify their sometimes very large fees? And how do they persuade potential clients that they are worth hiring in the first place? Increasingly consulting firms are having to agree quite carefully defined “deliverables” in advance of a piece of work. Clients will want proof that there has been a return on their investment. They also want “knowledge transfer” to take place – that is, the client should benefit from any new understanding that the consultant has helped bring about, writes Stefan Stern.To prove they are worth taking seriously, most consultancies lay claim to a “thought leadership” market position – that is, they claim to have better ideas than anybody else. Clearly, not everyone can be a leader at the same time. So how can a consulting firm truly mark itself out?The answer is to have at least a few really smart people on board who are capable of original thought and insight – and get them to write books. This year has been a bumper one in terms of thought leadership, as authors based at McKinsey, Bain and Oliver Wyman have all come up with genuinely thought-provoking work.At Bain, Chris Zook has now completed a trilogy of books that began with Profit from the Core in 2001. This third book, Unstoppable, is a crisp account of what firms need to do to make the most of the assets they already have but have done little or nothing to develop – the “unknown knowns” of the balance sheet.At Oliver Wyman, Adrian Slywotzky has produced The Upside, an intriguing analysis that overturns 100 years of business orthodoxy. Conventional wisdom has it that to produce great returns you have to take great risks. Wrong, Mr Slywotzky says. The biggest successes come to those businesses that systematically eliminate risk (or “de-risk”). You just have to do the hard work.At McKinsey, Lowell Bryan, together with his colleague Claudia Joyce, have produced an analysis of how the 21st century business ought to be designed. Their book, Mobilising Minds, offers a radical prescription, tearing up conventional organisational charts in favour of a far less rigid structure, one more in keeping with the demands of today’s knowledge economy.Three good books, three fresh ideas. Now that’s what I call “thought leadership”.
602;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-11-19T07:18:30Z;UK public sector: ‘Incentive is more powerful than risk’;;"According to the National Audit Office, total UK public sector spending on consultants was £2.8bn ($5.7bn) in 2005-2006, of which central government accounted for £1.8bn. It suggests that better use of consultants by central government could realise 30 per cent efficiency gains within three years, amounting to £540m a year.“Some progress has been made in recent years,” says Keith Davis, head of the National Audit Office’s efficiency practice, “but government has a long way to go. There are very significant improvements that can be made by making more use of in-house staff; negotiating better contracting terms; and getting improved results for the money spent.”The National Audit Office Value for Money Report on central government’s use of consultants, published in December 2006, found that most departments do not make a proper assessment of whether internal resources can be used instead of consultants. Neither do they transfer skills to build their internal capabilities. Its findings were supported by the House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts’ report on central government’s use of consultants in June this year.In response, the Office for Government Commerce has embarked on a Consultancy Value Programme. It is addressing clearer objectives and measurement of success, reinterpreting existing project management guidance to cover consultancy, contract management, better management information, closer engagement with key suppliers, and promoting shared learning.“One of our major findings was how inter-related most of these issues are,” says Peter Walmsley, the programme manager. “For example, it is very difficult to define a good way to measure performance without clarity of objectives in the business case at the outset and a good project structure within which to control it. In the past, attempts to solve some of the issues piecemeal have therefore had limited effect.”The National Audit Office has launched a toolkit for government departments to improve their use of consultants. Departments complete an online questionnaire and the toolkit responds with areas of weakness and guidance on improving value.The consulting community feels that problems start with the difficulty of clearly specifying objectives in the public sector. Andrea Di Maio, vice president at Gartner, the analyst firm, explains that whereas the objective could be increased efficiency or improved service delivery, there may also be political objectives.“Other European public sectors are addressing the problem of clearly defining public value a little bit better than the UK,” he says. “It is fundamentally different to the private sector, where there is a chain from the mission, strategic objectives and strategic plan to the consultancy engagement. There is no link between political objectives and consultancy contracts. Countries like Australia, France, Germany and the US are attempting to come up with public value frameworks that articulate objectives more transparently.”Accenture has set up the Institute for Public Service Value to focus on measuring the outcomes that drive value. “In the private sector, shareholder value acts as a unifying factor for measuring project success,” says Jeremy Oates, head of Accenture’s government practice. “There is no easy equivalent measure in the public sector.”Mr Davis feels that too much use is made in consultancy contracts of time and materials, and not enough of either fixed-price contracts or, ideally, incentive-based payments. According to the Committee of Public Accounts, only 1 per cent of consulting projects use incentivised contracts, which compares with 12 per cent in the private sector.“Performance-related fees are something that our industry would like to see more of,” says Peter Hill, chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association. “However, whilst clients are intrigued with the concept, they shy away from the reality. If a consultant takes the risk, they need more management responsibility. This can be difficult for the public sector, which tends to be more risk averse and gets very nervous about releasing control. It is also nervous about being seen to give rewards or incentives to consultants, instead of to the tax payer.”Ian Lever, director in the social housing consultancy at NCC Group, points out that in the private sector, many of the risk-reward projects are based upon increased revenue. However, the government sector has still not woken up to the very real opportunities that can be realised by revenue generation.Neil Beer, a member of PA Consulting’s government team, finds that clients are sometimes concerned that the costs of incentive-based contracts cannot be exactly predicted in advance. As a result, some insist on more predictable time-based fees.Part of the same problem is that consultancies see public sector procurement procedures as over-bureaucratic, using generic processes and forms that are not appropriate for consulting. “Potential providers must complete a long pre-qualification questionnaire,” says Paul Marshall, managing director of Protiviti, a consultancy. “These are often used to evaluate organisations as diverse as builders, caterers and consulting firms. They are not tailored for the services required.”The concern is that these procedures focus on keeping costs down rather than maximising the potential benefits, which could actually reduce the value. “Government contracting is done to protect government against failure, rather than making sure the programme is a success,” says Mr Oates. “The contract should encourage both sides to behave in a way that maximises the chances of success.”Alan Russell, head of LogicaCMG’s consulting division, argues that contracts are designed to punish a supplier for not meeting requirements. “If you allocate risk disproportionately,” he says, “it can make one party very defensive. If you have an excess of risk, you manage the project differently than if it is shared equally. Incentive is more powerful than risk.”Mr Di Maio argues that although time and materials is seen as a bad thing, it can allow a government agency to engage with a consultant to understand and refine its objectives. “I am not surprised that the number of risk-reward contracts is low,” he says, “and it will remain low for a long time.”Many consultants feel that procurement procedures are used to keep consultants at arm’s length in order to avoid giving unfair advantage. “If people in the public sector talk to potential suppliers in a more free and open way it would dramatically improve the quality of work done,” says Alan Downey, head of government at KPMG.Jonathan Cooper-Bagnall, a member of PA Consulting’s management group, points out that consulting relies heavily on trust, which means that individuals on both sides have to know each other.Building trust at the start also carries through a successful project. Patrick Smith, a partner at Atos Consulting, argues that an honest exchange of ideas and post contract flexibility are more likely to secure success than stubborn adherence to a contract.The Consultancy Value Programme should help to address these areas of concern. Mr Walmsley reports that there was widespread agreement between users and the consulting industry on nearly all of the issues.“The drive for efficiency means the public sector will continue to need top-quality independent advice,” says Chris Loughran, head of technology consulting at Deloitte. “The better consultancies have little to fear from government getting better at managing this expensive resource.”"
603;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-11-18T22:36:58Z;Microsoft bottom line unaffected by Vista;;For most companies, launching a significant new product to a widespread lack of interest – and, in some cases, hostility – would count as a business disaster of considerable magnitude.But most companies are not Microsoft and most products are not Windows Vista.Some of the customer reactions to the sixth version of the Windows desktop operating system, which was first released to business customers a year ago next week, have been enough to make a product manager blush.“I’m just astounded as I try to live with it,” says Roger Kay, a technology analyst who claims to have spent 30 hours recently grappling with incompatible software formats, the mysterious deletion of files from one of his drives and other glitches caused by his new Vista-powered machine.Yet, as Microsoft’s recent strong quarterly earnings showed, complaints like these have done nothing to dent the software industry’s most reliable money machine. “It’s a problem other businesses would love to have,” says Michael Cherry at Directions on Microsoft, an independent research firm.A number of issues have combined to frustrate many of Vista’s early users.For instance, compared with the previous generation of Windows, called XP, the new software will run slower on many existing machines, says Mike Nash, vice-president for Windows product management – though he adds that rapid improvements in PC hardware have quickly made up for this.Also, the sheer complexity of the code has caused inevitable teething problems. “Windows Vista is probably not yet as reliable as XP,” says Michael Silver, an analyst at Gartner.Most frustrating of all has been a lack of compatibility with some of the 2m different devices that users plug into their PCs and with applications written by other software companies to run on PCs.Even Mr Nash admits to issues with his personal Vista machine – an old scanner at home that is no longer supported on Windows, a new wireless networking card that would not work. He adds, though, that “by and large, the mainstream things are working” after steady improvements in recent months.While most retail customers simply buy a PC with the latest version of Windows installed regardless, the early problems with Vista have delayed its broader adoption. In one sign, PC-maker Dell reversed course and continued to ship the older XP system alongside Vista.Many big organisations, which had been expecting to switch to Vista late this year or in the first half of 2008, have set the timetable back by nine to 12 months, says Mr Silver, and are now waiting to assess the first overhaul of Vista, dubbed “Service Pack 1” and due early next year.None of this, however, has had any discernible impact on Microsoft’s financial fortunes. Many companies buy their software from Microsoft under an arrangement called Software Assurance, which lets them upgrade to new software whenever they like in return for a fixed annual payment.Other companies have a strong incentive to pay for Vista on every new PC they buy, even if they have no plans to use it for some time.That is because they can use Windows XP free of charge until they are ready to switch to Vista, so it makes sense to pay once now rather than make a separate purchase of Vista in the future.“In the short term, they’ll get the money whether people upgrade or not,” says Mr Silver.In the onger term, however, the disenchantment over Vista could take a toll. With sales of Apple’s Macs surging, particularly in some parts of the retail market, customers may prove less tolerant of the teething problems that accompany all new releases of Windows.“I don’t think Microsoft can say they’re the leader in operating systems anymore,” says Mr Cherry.“There is a belief that [buying a new version of Windows] is inevitable, like death and taxes,” adds Mr Kay.“But if Microsoft doesn’t fix it, and fix it good, they’re leaving the field wide open to Apple.”
604;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Fans descend on UK iPhone launch;;Hordes of iPhone fans descended on Apple’s flagship Regent Street store in London yon Friday hoping to be the first to get their hands on the much-hyped mobile device.The earliest had been queuing since 8am the previous morning, through freezing rain. Many had been in line for at least 10 hours.When the doors opened at 6.02pm fans ran in to the store between lines of cheering staff. They emerged moments later, like Olympic athletes crossing the finishing line, brandishing their boxed iPhones in triumph.O2, the UK’s largest mobile phone operator, which secured exclusive rights to supply telephone contracts for the iPhone in the UK, said it had ordered “hundreds of thousands” of iPhone handsets to meet demand over Christmas and into the new year.Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner, a consultancy, said between 350,000 and 400,000 iPhones could be sold in the first two months.O2 has taken on 1,427 extra staff to cope with demand, including 700 in its customer service call centres, and 727 sales assistants in shops. This is a nearly 12 per cent increase in the company’s UK workforce.Charles Dunstone, chief executive of Carphone Warehouse, which is also selling the iPhone, said he expected the handset to be the top-selling product this Christmas. Last week the company forecast it could sell 10,000 devices in the first day.In the US, 1m units were sold in the first 74 days after the iPhone launched at the end of June. Apple aims to sell 10m units globally during 2008.The iPhone, whose design, multi-touch screen and web browser have won many fans, costs £269 including tax. Customers are required to sign up to a 18-month contract with O2, ranging from £35 to £55 a month, putting the total cost of the device at up to £1,259.Ahead of the iPhone launch, hundreds of “grey market” iPhones have already been put up for sale on the internet.
605;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-11-02T22:00:37Z;02 predicts sales of 200,000 iPhones;;Up to 200,000 Apple iPhones will be sold in Britain over Christmas and the New Year, according to 02, the largest mobile operator in the UK.Apple’s much-hyped iPhone goes on sale in the UK on Friday at 6.02pm. 02 will be the exclusive mobile network for the handset and predicts that the iPhone will be its fastest selling handset yet.Matthew Key, chief executive of 02’s UK business, told the Financial Times he expected “a couple of hundred thousand” iPhones to be sold in the first two months by Apple, 02 and Carphone Warehouse, the mobile phone retailer.He added that 02 had ordered “hundreds of thousands” of iPhones from Apple for stores and online outlets run by 02 and Carphone.Some analysts said the 200,000 sales projection was conservative. Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner, a consultancy, said between 350,000 and 400,000 iPhones could be sold in the first two months.After the June launch in the US, 1m iPhones were sold in just under 2½ months.The iPhone combines a mobile phone with a music player and internet browser, and 02 predicts the device will enable it to poach customers from rivals such as Vodafone.Analysts said the only mobiles that have provoked similar excitement to the iPhone are Motorola’s Razr and Sony Ericsson’s Cybershot and Walkman phones.As well as being much-hyped, the iPhone will be one of the most expensive mobile handsets yet.It will be sold for £269, but customers must take out contracts with 02 that start at £35 per month. It means the cheapest iPhone deal will cost £899 because the contracts last 18 months.Mr Key shrugged off the price differential between the iPhone in the UK and the US, where it is available for $399.The iPhone price was cut in the US by $200 less than 10 weeks after launch, but Mr Key played down the idea of swift reductions in the UK.The one glaring weakness with the iPhone is that it runs on 2.5G mobile networks, which offer markedly slower web browsing speeds than their 3G equivalents.Mr Key expressed confidence that 02 would get the 3G version of the iPhone, which is due in the second half of next year.
606;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-11-01T23:30:49Z;MySpace joins Google in Facebook fight;;MySpace on Thursday raised the stakes in the battle to blunt Facebook, its fast-growing social networking rival, as it joined a Google-led alliance intended to make it easier for web developers to create features that work across a wide variety of social networks.With rival networking site Bebo also joining the alliance, which was first announced by Google and a handful of smaller players on Wednesday, the new grouping claimed members that have more than 200m internet users between them, compared to the 51m users of Facebook.The move pointed to an acceleration of the realignment that had already been under way among some of the internet’s biggest powers as social networking has risen in importance, according to observers.“In the short term, you could view it as Google and MySpace on the one hand, and Microsoft and Facebook on the other,” said Ray Valdes, an analyst at Gartner, pointing to Microsoft’s advertising partnership and recent investment in Facebook. “There are others yet to weigh in,” he added, including internet giants such as Yahoo!, Ebay and Amazon, all of which maintain a certain amount of “social” data on their users.Facebook has become the focus of intense Silicon Valley buzz since it opened its site to outside developers in May. That move sparked a flurry of interest as professional and amateur developers raced to build new features that took advantage of the connections between users on the Facebook site.However, Facebook uses its own proprietary technology for this purpose, meaning that applications written for its site cannot be used elsewhere on the Web. That contrasts with Google’s new OpenSocial technology, which seeks to establish a standard that can be applied across any network that uses it.Chris DeWolfe, chief executive officer of MySpace, denied that the decision to join the Google coalition had been prompted by a need to counter the recent rise of Facebook. Instead, he said it had been under discussion for a year, and was “just a natural extension of the open approach we’ve had since we started”. He called OpenSocial a new “de facto standard” that would make life easier for developers.Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google, added that the emergence of rival technologies was not likely to result in a “Balkanisation” of the internet around different technology platforms.“The history of the web says that is not the way it will happen,” he said. “History says that the [open] internet wins.”Google executives refused to say if they were in discussions with Facebook over OpenSocial, but confirmed that they had made app­roaches to all the significant internet companies.“One of the most important things about openness is that anyone is invited to join,” said Mr Schmidt.
607;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-10-25T22:24:33Z;Apple set to unleash Leopard;;"Apple will on Friday cap a series of recent product launches by rolling out a new version of its Macintosh operating system.The update, called Leopard, comes days after Apple reported a 34 per cent jump in Macintosh sales. It will be pre-installed on new Macs while an online version for customers with older machines will sell for $110.Leopard is the latest in a series of new products from Apple, including a new line of iPods launched last month; new Macintosh desktops launched this summer; and the iPhone, Apple’s foray into the mobile handset market, which launched in June.It marks the fifth update to Apple’s OS X operating system since the original version launched in 2001.“Leopard is an important release for Apple — it demonstrates their ability to ship release after release of their operating system and refine the PC experience,” says Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Jupiter Research.Unlike Microsoft, which licenses its operating systems to other companies that install them on a wide range of PC brands, Apple has long favoured a closed system in which its Macintosh computers are the only computers that run its operating system.This arrangement has allowed Apple to keep up a faster pace of software innovation while avoiding some of the interoperability and security problems that have plagued the recent launch of Vista, Microsoft’s new operating system, says Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner, the market research group.“Apple has an unfair advantage because it knows exactly what hardware their system is going to run on,” says Mr Baker. “They have leveraged that advantage to make themselves look more competent than Microsoft.”Meanwhile, Microsoft has had to see through the launch of a new operating system that is designed to replace the Windows software that powers more than 90 per cent of the world’s PCs, he adds.Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, has boasted that Leopard contains more than 300 new features, including a new back-up system called Time Machine, which allows users to browse through chronological snapshots of the contents of their computers’ hard drive to retrieve lost files.Such features are likely to make the Macintosh more appealing to users in search of an alternative to traditional Windows and now Vista-based PCs, analysts say.Apple accounted for 3.2 per cent of the 68.6m PCs sold round the world last quarter, says Gartner, up from 1.9 per cent in the first quarter of 2006."
608;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-10-22T23:13:39Z;Mac sales lift Apple profits by 67%;;Surging sales of Macintosh computers drove Apple profits up 67 per cent in the fourth quarter - and the company predicted a bumper Christmas holiday period.The results were stronger than expected and came in spite of a slowdown in the rate of growth in sales of the iPod, the portable music player that has helped turn Apple into a dominant consumer brand.Apple’s shares, which rose 2.3 per cent on Monday ahead of the announcement, jumped 6.8 per cent in after-hours trading to $186.21. The rise pushed Apple ahead of IBM on the list of the world’s biggest technology companies by market capitalisation.Apple said it had sold 1.12m iPhone handsets in the quarter, bringing total iPhones sales this year to 1.38m.But it was a strong appetite for Macintosh personal computers that drove earnings of $1.01 a share on sales of $6.22bn, up 67 per cent from a net profit of 62 cents a share on sales of $4.84bn last time. Most Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 86 cents a share on sales of $6.07bn.Apple said it expected to make earnings of $1.42 per share on sales of $9.2bn in the coming quarter, which will include the Christmas shopping season.However, there was a year-on-year decline in the rate of sales growth for the iPod. Apple said it had sold 10.2m iPods in the fourth quarter, an increase of 17 per cent over the same time last year. Sales had grown 35 per cent between the fourth quarter of 2005 and that of 2006.In spite of the slower growth, the iPod remained a big contributor. Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner, said: “It’s the law of large numbers…It’s coming back to bite them a bit. But we’re still talking about 10.2m units.”Apple is to roll out the iPhone in Europe in the next few weeks.
609;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-10-18T00:49:47Z;iPhone to support third-party programmes;;Apple on Wednesday moved to placate restless software developers by announcing plans to allow software makers to create programmes for its iPhone mobile handset.The announcement marks a change of tack for Apple, which has long resisted opening its products to outsiders in favour of closed systems in which it controls the features loaded on its hardware.It is likely to spark a flurry of software development as programmers rush to build applications that take advantage of the iPhone’s touch-screen interface and its ability to make calls, browse the internet, and store photos and music.“You’re going to get a lot more applications than you would if you have a closed environment,” said Van Baker, an Apple analyst at Gartner, the market research group.Such applications could include contact management and other business software – a lack of which has limited the iPhone’s appeal to corporate customers, who are among the biggest buyers of smartphone handsets.In a statement on Apple’s website, Steve Jobs, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, said it planned to provide a development toolkit to outside programmers by February.“We are excited about creating a vibrant third-party developer community around the iPhone and enabling hundreds of applications for users,” Mr Jobs said. Apple has sold more than a million iPhones since the handset was launched in June.
610;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-10-09T05:00:01Z;Gateway unveils offer to buy Packard Bell;;Gateway, the US personal computer maker, has made a “binding offer” to acquire Packard Bell, Europe’s third-biggest PC company.The deal, just weeks after Gateway agreed to be bought by Acer, a Taiwanese rival, for $710m, would keep Packard Bell out of the hands of Lenovo, Acer’s Chinese rival.Acer has agreed to finance the Packard Bell bid and said it had already put the necessary funds into escrow for Gateway to use.A source close to Acer said the cost for the Packard Bell acquisition would come on top of the US$710m Acer is to pay for Gateway, but the European PC maker would cost it less than US$100m. The source said that the agreement between Gateway and John Hui, Packard Bell’s major shareholder, did not allow for a renewed rival bid from Lenovo following an offer from Gateway, thus preventing a bidding war between Lenovo and Acer.Lenovo had expressed an interest in acquiring Packard Bell to bolster its European presence.But Gateway last month threw those plans into doubt, saying it intended to exercise its right of first refusal to acquire all shares in Packard Bell’s holding company from Mr Hui. Gateway acquired the option to buy Mr Hui’s shares last year.Nevertheless, Bill Amelio, Lenovo’s chief executive, said last month that Lenovo was “still very interested” in the company. Acer and Lenovo have been fighting for third place in the global PC industry behind US computer makers Hewlett-Packard and Dell.Acer and Gateway combined will have 8.8 per cent of the global PC market by unit shipments, followed by Lenovo with 7.9 per cent, according to Gartner, the market research company. Acer alone holds 7.1 per cent.Acer said last week 80.68 per cent of Gateway’s shares had been tendered as of the end of October 1, the original deadline of its offer, taking it beyond the minimum 70 per cent needed to allow the deal to go forward, but the Taiwanese company extended its deadline to give US authorities more time to complete their review of the deal.Gateway said on Monday that it expected the Packard Bell deal to close by late 2007 or early 2008, pending approvals by regulators.The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Lenovo, which bought IBM’s PC business for $1.75bn in 2005, is trying to build on its dominant position in the fast-growing Chinese market. The fact that Acer looks likely to control both Gateway and Packard Bell means that Lenovo will likely be forced to grow organically.
611;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-10-05T03:26:08Z;Competition begins to hot up;;The question of whether wi-fi can be a serious competitor to the mobile phone network has been reopened by BT’s announcement on Thursday.The idea of connecting laptops, mobile phones and other portable devices to the internet has been a key theme for the technology sector.Mobile phone operators have been keen to promote the idea of consumers surfing the internet while commuting home on the train or downloading songs to their mobile handsets while sitting in their favourite cafés.Five UK mobile operators collectively paid £22.5bn in 2000 to acquire licences for 3G spectrum, which would allow them to provide services such as these.Many of the same functions can be carried out through a wi-fi wireless connection, however. In fact it is cheaper and faster to download very big, data-heavy files such as videos over wi-fi.Several problems with wi-fi have prevented the technology from being seen as a serious competitor to mobile networks.There have been few mobile handsets with wi-fi capability, wi-fi has tended to drain the batteries of portable devices too quickly, and, above all, the networks of publicly accessible wi-fi hotspots have been too sparse to be of much use.There are estimated to be fewer than 11,000 wi-fi hotspots in the UK, and each one covers only 30-40 square meters – at best 100 sq m – compared with 50,000 mobile phone base stations, which can cover an area of several miles.However, these factors are beginning to change. More mobile phone handsets are including wi-fi capability: an estimated 258.7m worldwide, according to Gartner, the research group.One of the most notable is Apple’s iPhone which comes to market in the UK in November. Apple has a deal with O2, the mobile phone operator, to allow customers to make voice calls on the handset, but did not include 3G capability.Instead, the iPhone can use a wi-fi connection and Apple says it expects many customers will use this, rather than the slower mobile phone network, to download music to the device.In fact Apple sells a version of the iPhone – called the iPod Touch – that has no phone component but does have wi-fi access to allow users to surf the internet and download music.BT’s move to create a national network of wi-fi hotspots could solve the problem of sparse coverage.Many observers see BT’s move as a way for the fixed-line operator to get back into the mobile phone market. After demerging its Cellnet mobile business, which went on to become O2, BT missed out on a growing market. It has attempted to re-enter with the launch of the Fusion phone: a hybrid home and mobile phone that can access wi-fi networks, but has so far seen poor take-up.Analysts say wi-fi is unlikely to compete directly with mobile phone voice calls. Customers can make cheap calls over a wi-fi network by using free internet calling services such as Skype, but these can be tricky to set up.“The cost of voice calls on the traditional mobile network is going down, so the attraction of free services like Skype is less,” said Elsa Lion, analyst at Ovum. “It’s a solution for some segments of the market but it isn’t a threat for the core business of mobile operators.”Some mobile operators, such as 3, are allowing customers to use services such as Skype on their 3G networks, offering much cheaper calls. 3 is understood to be working with Skype to create a handset designed to make these internet phone call services easier.However, wi-fi may be an attractive alternative for more data-centric services, such as downloading music, videos or watching TV over the internet.
612;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-10-02T14:22:29Z;Tailored software becomes key to Saas model’s success;;"No licence fees to pay, no hardware to install and no maintenance burden to shoulder. It is no wonder that the concept of software-as-a-service, or Saas, is changing the way many companies purchase and deploy enterprise applications.Take, for example, Allianz Cornhill, the insurance company. In 2006, it rolled out a CRM system to 350 underwriters and sales staff, so they could track and manage the process of converting sales leads into policies.Rather than deploy the software in-house, however, Allianz Cornhill opted for a suite of hosted applications from Saas provider Salesforce.com.As a result, its CRM tools and data are hosted, managed and regularly upgraded by Salesforce.com staff in the provider’s own data centre. Allianz Cornhill staff, meanwhile, access them over the internet and pay a monthly, per-user subscription fee for the privilege.It was not hard to convince senior executives of the attractions of the Saas model in terms of cost and convenience, says Phill Harding, broker development manager at Allianz Cornhill. For a start, the roll-out of the software took six weeks, where an equivalent inhouse deployment might have taken months, he says.“In fact, once the concept had been adequately explained and demonstrated and the solution was in place, we were asked by senior executives: ‘Why haven’t we used this approach before?’,” he says.Others are wondering the
same thing, and demand for Saas
applications is soaring. Recent estimates from analysts at IT market research company Gartner, for example, suggest worldwide sales growth of 21 per cent this year, to $5.1bn. By 2011, they say, Saas will account for one-quarter of business software sold globally.“Ease of use, rapid deployment, limited up-front investment in capital and staffing, plus a reduction in software management responsibility all make Saas a desirable alternative to many on-premises solutions, and will continue to act as drivers of growth,” says Sharon Mertz, a research director at Gartner.Some potential users, however, still have reservations about Saas. If information is power, and data among the most valuable of corporate assets, they ask, then why would we put them in another company’s hands?How can we customise software that is hosted remotely by a third party to fit our company’s unique business processes? And how can we possibly integrate Saas applications with the core in-house systems that remain vital to our business?These are all areas that leading Saas providers, such as Salesforce.com and NetSuite, are working hard to address.In terms of reliability and availability, for example, NetSuite offers a money-back guarantee of 99.5 per cent uptime. “Most companies would really struggle to achieve that kind of uptime inhouse and yet we offer it consistently to our customers,” says Zach Nelson, chief executive of NetSuite.And, following well-publicised outages in early 2006, Salesforce.com has upgraded its architecture and can now promise uptime of 99.999 per cent, according to Lindsey Armstrong, the company’s European president. In addition, it has committed itself to full disclosure of performance metrics via a website that was launched in response to those outages, trust.salesforce.com.Other obstacles to Saas are “more perceived than real”, says Robert Bois, an analyst with market research company AMR Research. “Integration and customisation are still common concerns that our clients raise with us, but in fact, the larger Saas suppliers are pretty good at solving those problems and the technology of the multi-tenant architecture that underpins Saas solutions has matured sufficiently that they’re no longer a big issue,” he says.At one time, a “one-size-fits-all” Saas approach was the norm, and “plain vanilla” functionality (where the same product is deployed by all customers) was viewed as the necessary trade-off for relatively low cost of entry.But recent technological advances have changed all that. “Not only can you customise pretty much anything you need to in NetSuite, but those customisations carry over every time the application is upgraded – and we upgraded NetSuite 400 times last year,” says Mr Nelson.“You certainly don’t get that when you customise on-premise software and then need to upgrade it,” he adds.“We do a huge amount of customisation,” confirms Andy French, head of information systems at NetSuite customer Opal Telecom, a division of Carphone Warehouse. “These tweaks and changes range from making certain data fields mandatory to installing Java scripts that drive system logic and user behaviour,” he says.In fact, the only limitation facing Carphone Warehouse, which has more than 3,000 users of Netsuite company-wide, is the number of skilled IT people available to do that configuration, he says.Integration between Saas tools and inhouse applications is also more commonplace these days. Most Saas companies publish application programming interfaces (APIs) based on web services standards, which allow disparate systems to exchange data whether they are based inside the firewall or on a third party’s premises.According to Ms Armstrong, more than half of all API calls to Saleforce.com applications come from non-Salesforce.com systems.Analysts at Gartner, meanwhile, predict that by 2010, three-quarters of large enterprise Saas deployments will have “at least five integration or interoperable points to on-premise applications”.But with increased scope for customisation and integration of Saas products comes greater demand for outside help – a point not lost on a number of leading systems integrators, including Accenture and Deloitte, who have already set up dedicated practices in this area. Mr Bois of AMR Research says other IT services firms are “eager to tap this market, but less willing to go on record with details of their Saas strategy. They’re taking more of a ‘wait and see’ approach.”One company that is certainly not holding back is Saaspoint, a specialist Salesforce.com implementation and consulting partner led by John Appleby, who previously worked for Salesforce.com and was that company’s first EMEA employee. “Demand for help with Salesforce.com implementations far outstrips supply and, as long as Salesforce.com continues to grow so quickly, we don’t see that demand drying up,” he says.For Saaspoint, buoyant demand currently translates to year-on-year quarterly sales growth of between 250 per cent and 300 per cent, fuelled by projects at leading names such as P&O Ferries and pharmaceutical company Quintiles.This flurry of progress suggests a rosy future for Saas, not to mention the consultancy ecosystem that is
fast springing up around it, says Mr Bois of AMR Research. “Already, there are few areas of the enterprise applications industry untouched by Saas,” he says.And as software companies associated with more traditional models of software delivery, such as SAP, Oracle and Microsoft, catch up, he says, the case for Saas deployment can only get stronger."
613;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-08-28T21:26:10Z;Acer/Gateway;;Who needs private equity when you have Asian trade buyers? Acer, the Taiwanese PC maker, is set to become the latest north Asian manufacturer to snap up a sluggish but better-known rival following Monday’s $710m bid for Gateway of the US.The deal carries hallmarks of earlier acquisitions such as Chinese rival Lenovo’s successful 2004 purchase of IBM’s PC business or BenQ’s takeover of Siemens’ mobile handset business. As with Lenovo, Acer appears to have paid up handsomely in order to secure a brand and market share. Acer’s offer represents a near-60 per cent premium to Gateway’s undisturbed share price. In an industry where scale is crucial, the deal returns the Taiwanese group to the number three slot, ahead of its Chinese rival. Added muscle – the combined company would ship more than 20m PCs a year, giving a market share of 8.8 per cent, according to research consultancy Gartner – means cheaper component parts.But there are big differences, too. Acer could prove savvier than the luckless BenQ, whose deal ended with the mobile handset unit going into insolvency amid squeals from German unions and politicians. Importantly, the transaction hands Packard Bell to Acer, spoiling Lenovo’s ambitions to acquire the European PC maker. Gateway’s pre-emptive rights should enable Acer to take control of Packard Bell at a discount to the (undisclosed) price proffered by Lenovo.Excluding Packard, the deal’s headline enterprise-value-to-sales multiple of 0.19 times represents a 27 per cent premium to Lenovo’s IBM purchase. It seems unlikely that the acquisition of Packard will improve the valuation substantially. The number three spot still leaves Acer with two formidable competitors. Acer’s shareholders recognised as much, sending the PC group’s shares down 7 per cent on Tuesday – expunging almost half the deal cost from its market capitalisation.
614;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-08-22T19:54:47Z;Motorola loses market share;;Ed Zander could come under renewed pressure to step down as chief executive of Motorola on Thursday as new figures showed the handset maker lost more than seven percentage points of market share during the second quarter.Motorola narrowly maintained its position as second-largest handset manufacturer – but its share of global sales fell to 14.6 per cent, from 21.9 per cent a year ago, according to estimates by Gartner, a research company.Samsung, the world’s number three, increased its share to 13.4 per cent, gaining prime position to overhaul its US rival. “It will be interesting to see what Samsung can do in the third and fourth quarters. Samsung has been bringing in more mid-tier handsets and cutting prices on older phones faster to help build market share,” said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner.US analysts and IDC, a rival market research firm that published global handset sales figures this month, reckon Samsung passed Motorola in the second quarter. US analysts also reckon Motorola’s market share may dip further before stabilising when handset models to include the 3G Razr2 are launched in many markets in the next months.Mr Zander has acknowledged more work is needed, but he said last month Motorola’s management team was beginning to make progress in turning round the lossmaking mobile phone business. It accounts for about half of Motorola’s revenues. Analysts said Mr Zander should take the blame for a failed strategy that has seen Motorola pull away from selling lower-priced mobile phones in emerging markets.The market share figures are Motorola’s lowest since the third quarter of 2004, before it launched the ultra-slim Razr handset in 2005, which helped lift market share into the 20s.The Razr has sold more than 50m units, one of the most popular handset models marketed. But Motorola has struggled to find fresh products with the same popularity.
615;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-08-16T22:18:07Z;Strong sales growth at Hewlett-Packard;;"Hewlett-Packard on Thursday notched up its strongest sales growth in seven years, as brisk sales of personal computers capped the latest in a series of strong quarterly results.Revenues at the company grew 16 per cent to $25.4bn in the third fiscal quarter, led by a sharp increase in sales of personal computers. Net profits were $1.8bn, or 66 cents a share, a 29 per cent improvement on the $1.4bn in net earnings HP recorded in the same period last year. The results were well ahead of Wall Street estimates.Mark Hurd, chief executive, said the results demonstrated strength across each of HP’s key businesses. “We are executing increasingly well,” he said. “We are continuing to become a more efficient organisation.”The company has cut costs by more than $1.9bn since Mr Hurd took over as CEO in 2005.HP’s PC sales jumped 29 per cent in the period, outpacing the broader PC market, which last quarter recorded a growth of 12.5 per cent, according to Gartner, the market research group.The company said sales of notebooks rose 54 per cent in the period, while desktop revenues increased 12 per cent.The strong results led HP’s shares 2 per cent higher to $47.02 in after-hours trading. The stock had fallen from a recent high of $49.40 last week.The company’s overall profitability also increased. Operating margin, which measures profits as a percentage of overall sales, rose to 9 per cent in the quarter, a 1.4 percentage point improvement over the same quarter last year.Contributing to the solid performance was a 10 per cent increase in sales of servers and storage equipment, an area where HP has struggled to gain momentum in the past.Looking ahead, HP said it expected earnings per share of 80-81 cents in the co-
ming quarter on sales of $27bn-$27.2.bn."
616;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-07-22T21:01:20Z;Office chief explores new windows of opportunity;;"Mature cyclical product, or one of the main catalysts for the next leg of growth at the world’s biggest software company?To many, the Office suite of PC software applications has become a mundane part of working life. But to Jeff Raikes, head of Microsoft’s business software and server divisions, it is the starting point for a wave of software that will launch the company into new markets.He has pushed this vision since taking over the division six years ago: Office as the front door through which “information workers” will one day access a far wider range of the tools needed to do their jobs, from tapping into the core business applications that support their companies’ operations to holding conference calls with colleagues over their computers.Now with businesses that represent 58 per cent of Microsoft’s revenues reporting to him, Mr Raikes is in a position to try to prove that he can stitch together the software pieces to make it work.It is a grand scheme that is still in its early stages. David Smith, an analyst at Gartner, says that using Office as a platform to support other businesses is a strategy that is only “just getting off the ground” at Microsoft, and is an idea that has brought mixed success in the past.Also, some early moves have taken longer than expected to bear fruit. In business applications, a market where it is taking on SAP and Oracle, Microsoft has been slow to make a mark.“We have learned some things,” concedes Mr Raikes. “I thought small and
medium-sized companies would probably change their [enterprise] software faster because of the internet than, perhaps, what they did.”Despite that, analysts generally credit Microsoft with success in some parts of its vision, as well as in finding ways to refresh the basic Office software to continue to drive sales. The latest version, launched earlier this year, contributed to a 19 per cent jump in revenues from the business division in the most recent quarter, to $4.6bn.The best indication that the wider Office vision is gaining ground has been the success of SharePoint, a piece of server software first launched in 2001 that is integrated with Office. SharePoint has been steadily expanded to include document management, enterprise portal, search and other functions needed to
let workers in the same company collaborate more
easily.Mr Raikes compares the SharePoint strategy to the one behind Office itself: combining a set of tightly linked capabilities in one steadily expanding product. With 233 per cent growth over the past year, SharePoint has become one of Microsoft’s hottest new products for business customers.Ultimate success, however, will depend on two things. One is whether Mr Raikes can sell a broader set of applications to run on the foundation of Office, SharePoint and Exchange, the company’s e-mail and messaging server. Along with business applications and business intelligence, this includes workplace communications – a market which the Microsoft executive predicts is about to go through upheaval.Mr Raikes compares it to what happened in computing in the 1990s, when a vertically integrated industry moved to a horizontal structure based on standardised hardware and a new software platform.Thanks to the enabling technology of IP, the communications market is ripe for a similar change, he says.The other test for Mr Raikes will be whether he can manage the shift towards a new business and delivery model in the corporate software business, one that relies on internet-based delivery of services.His response: for all the attention given to companies such as Google and Salesforce.com, the corporate software business is not about to be revolutionised overnight. “We’re probably moving a lot faster than people realise, and …the market isn’t moving as fast as some of the competitors would like to make people perceive,” he says."
617;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;HP further boosts market share over Dell;;Dell continued to slip further behind its rival Hewlett-Packard in personal computer shipments last quarter, according to new data from two of the world’s leading market research groups.The preliminary figures from Gartner and IDC showed that HP, which overtook Dell last year as the world’s leading PC maker, continued to gain market share over its beleaguered rival.Gartner’s figures showed HP shipments up more than 36 per cent in the second quarter, while Dell’s shipments over the same period dropped more than 5 per cent owing to a difficult consumer market.IDC data showed a similar trend, with HP grabbing more than 19 per cent of the worldwide PC market in the period, compared with just over 16 per cent for Dell.“Dell volume continued to decline as the company restructures itself amid aggressive competition. Commercial volume was relatively stable, while consumer shipments declined rapidly with Dell moving away from the low end,” IDC said.Worldwide PC shipments grew 12.5 per cent in the second quarter, according to IDC – a better-than-expected performance.In spite of the rise in shipments, computer makers remain engaged in a fierce price war that has led margins on desktop systems to languish.IDC said the biggest PC makers were beginning to move beyond price to battle with each other on other fronts.“Despite the temptation to simplify, the market is not just about replacing systems at the lowest cost,” said Lorne Loverde, an IDC analyst.“System design, customer service, channel coverage and market expansion are all playing key roles in winning business.”The renewed focus on design has led HP to launch an aggressive ad camaign designed to showcase how well-known personalities such as fashion designer Vera Wang use their HP computers.Dell is also in the midst of a consumer brand revamp. It also recently struck a deal to sell desktop computers at Wal-Mart stores in an effort to boost sales.
618;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-07-11T08:40:50Z;Where do we go from here?;;It is easy these days to be overtaken by the future. Take e-mail, for example, the mainstay of modern business communication: “Younger people see e-mail as something older people do,” grimaces Don Rippert, chief technology officer for Accenture, the world’s largest consultancy.“I thought it was a novel, next generation technology, but to young people it’s: ‘You should post to my site on MySpace [a social networking website], you should text message me, you should instant message me, why would you want to e-mail me? I don’t even check my inbox any more’.”Indeed, the Gartner Group predicts that by 2011, instant messaging will be the de facto tool for voice, video and text communications in business. By then, of course, the young will have moved on to something else – refinements of the imaginary worlds of Second Life and other “virtual worlds”, or metaverses, perhaps.Sometimes our technological future and our traditional present even collide, with risible results. “I will pay with my phone,” Tero Ojampera, Nokia’s chief technology officer, declared as he ordered coffee in a branch of McDonald’s, the fast food chain, expecting to be able to wave his handset over a wireless card reader. His waitress was unimpressed: “We don’t accept phones as payment,” she sniffed dismissively.Such misunderstandings aside, near field communications (NFC), a short range (hand’s width) wireless technology, looks set to turn mobile handsets into electronic wallets and could revolutionise the way we pay for goods and services within the foreseeable future. Prototypes already exist and trials are under way, underlining a truism about forecasting technological futures: what we can reliably predict already exists, at least in the laboratory.Beyond that, according to Andy Mulholland, chief technology officer at Capgemini, Europe’s largest computing services group, other factors cloud the issue: “I have a formula about where technology takes us. For a year ahead, you can be confident about where it is going because betas [prototypes in test] and alphas [finished designs] for the products which are going to come out already exist.“For three years to five years ahead you have people collecting requirements definitions for the releases beyond that. Beyond five to 10 years, you might have an idea of what could come out of the laboratories. But from 10 to 20 years ahead, your only guidance is demographics: what people have grown up with and what they see as normal.”So for this article, we will stick with the foreseeable and practical rather than the blue yonder. Inevitably, an expert’s view of the future is coloured by his or her area of expertise – Mr Ojampera looks forward to mobile handsets fabricated in new materials that would enable them to be bent or stretched, while Mr Mulholland anticipates technologies based on communications and interaction rather than today’s transaction-based approach.But overall, this straw poll of some of the IT industry’s leading experts reflects a thoughtful, rather downbeat view of the future rather than the technocratic, gung-ho self-assurance of earlier years.Many were concerned about personal privacy and security in a world where miniature video cameras would be ubiquitous and failure to safeguard sensitive data could open individuals and companies to legal action. “E-mail, voicemail and text messages used to be ethereal,” says Mike Lynch, chief executive of the UK company, Autonomy. “But no longer. Now you can see them being brought up in court.”Crispin O’Brien, chairman of the technology group at consultancy KPMG, while questioning whether fixed line telephones have a future, worried about the mobile alternative: “There are huge, huge risks in mobile working,” he says. “If you leave a laptop on the back seat of a car, you could be in breach of all sorts of confidentiality issues.”He argued that business was remiss to “just hunker down behind the firewall” – the defensive barrier at the perimeter of the business – rather than working out how to guard BlackBerrys – devices offering mobile e-mail and more – from eavesdroppers. “Mobile working and devices such as the BlackBerry require a new approach to security,” he says. The French security service’s recent decision to ban BlackBerrys from the president and prime minister’s offices underlines the point.Mobility is clearly a challenge and opportunity. Mr Ojampera of Nokia thought the principal underlying trend would be the merging of mobility and Web 2.0 – shorthand for the latest iteration of the World Wide Web that emphasises interactivity and shared experiences: “Communities of people sharing experiences combined with a very intelligent mobile device which ‘knows’ your location will bring a completely new type of interactivity.”He predicted in three or four years the emergence of mobile devices with visual recognition technology linked to intelligent databases. A tourist in London for example, could point their mobile phone at the Houses of Parliament. The phone would recognise the image and provide a commentary – perhaps spelling the beginning of the end for the tour guide?Mr Ojampera also argued the next iteration of the internet would be created around mobile rather than the fixed computers. Each individual’s mobile device would become a web server in its own right with other internet users given specific rights to access the content.According to Mike Lynch of Autonomy, the emergence of the first elements of Web 2.0 such as YouTube and MySpace and other social networking sites represents the biggest change in the IT industry since its formation.Instead of simplifying the material world so that it can be handled by computers, people now expect computers to be able to cope with human-friendly information: “Rather than us being slaves to what the computer needs, the computer will have to follow what we like.”The cause, of course, is the explosion of unstructured information and Mr Lynch, as head of a company that specialises in the management and retrieval of such information, is in no doubt about the complexity of dealing with it: “No one is going to be able to tag every piece of information and knowledge, even if they agreed on how the tags are defined. It’s a case of the hype getting ahead of the reality.”Important information will, however, be tagged with metadata and made easily accessible. Andrew Herbert, head of Microsoft’s Cambridge laboratories, argues that computers will increasingly become a prothesis for civilisation’s overburdened memories: “The computers will know who you work with and show you things before you need them.“So if you usually interact with certain documents while you have the monthly accounts open, then the computer might go ahead and get those documents ready for you in case you need them. It will be a sort of intelligent pre-search function – in search, we’re moving on from searching on key words to searching for concepts and the technology behind this is machine learning.”There is broad agreement that there will be fundamental changes to ways of working. Don Rippert of Accenture points to an increase in the use of contractors – people employed for specific projects – and ways of substituting for today’s centralised workforces: “Having people drive through traffic for an hour to get to work will become unacceptable.”“Increasingly, we will have to find ways for a distributed workforce to collaborate across time and distance,” he says, arguing that the latest, highly realistic videoconferencing systems would play a part, as would elements of Web 2.0: “Look at how teenagers use computers and the internet. They seem to be able to collaborate with each other with no effort whatsoever.”He argues that derivatives of consumer products such as MySpace could be used in an enterprise setting. It was already happening in an informal way: “If you put SOA into a keyword search in YouTube [a video-sharing website] you will get video after video about service oriented architecture” – hardly regarded as a popular topic on teenage-orientated websites.Crispin O’Brien of KPMG agrees that the elements of Web 2.0 – something he called Enterprise 2.0, or social networking in a business context – would be significant: “The more you can network people in an informal way, the more value a company can create,” he says.He also argues that computers have to behave more like humans and that the next phase of workplace IT could be as influenced by social anthropology as by writers of computer code.John Gage, chief researcher for Sun Microsystems, combines the sinister and social potential of technological progress in pointing out that, in his view, the big issue is the conjunction of the identity of people, objects, programs and data with location.“Couple Google’s plans to map the surface of the Earth to an accuracy of 20cm with global positioning systems – which means the position of the 2bn-3bn existing mobile devices could be located to within a metre – with IPV6 [the latest internet protocol that allows for a virtually unlimited number of internet addresses and therefore objects connected to the internet] and we have the makings of a police state as well as incredible logistical power. We would know the location of every package, truck, container vehicle and traffic jam.”In fact, with the latest storage and processing technologies, the capability is almost here to record every incident in an individual’s life. But is that something to which we should aspire, the experts ask?Some corners of every life are best left dark. Indeed, bloggers are already being warned that their words ay come back to haunt them in later life in applying for jobs or promotion.
619;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-07-05T08:18:00Z;O2 nears iPhone partnership;;Telefónica’s O2 mobile phone business was poised on Wednesday night to clinch a deal as Apple’s exclusive network partner for iPhone in the UK, said people familiar with the matter.O2 is set to be the first European mobile operator to reach a deal with Apple for its much-hyped iPhone. Apple is to limit iPhone’s European launch this autumn to the UK, France and Germany. It will follow elsewhere in Europe next year, when it will also launch in Asia.The European iPhone will operate on slower 2.5 generation mobile networks, not the 3G infrastructure of companies such as Vodafone, people close to the situation said.The US computer company talked to four leading European mobile operators: Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile, France Telecom’s Orange, Telefónica’s O2 and Vodafone.Carolina Milanesi, research director at consulting firm Gartner, said an iPhone launch in three European markets could make sense as no one operator covers the entire continent. Apple would logically deal with operators with most customers in each of the three markets. Orange leads in France, T-Mobile in Germany, and O2 in the UK.European operators had a dilemma in negotiations because of concerns Apple seeks deals that could be far more onerous than past agreements with other handset makers.The deal between Apple and AT&T, largest US telecommunications company, for the US puts Apple in the driving seat, reportedly giving it a share of customer revenue. The iPhone is priced at $499 and $599. US iPhone runs on AT&T’s 2.5G network.When Apple set up its iTunes music download site in Europe in 2004, it confined the initial launch to the French, German and UK markets.Ms Milanesi said Apple would be under pressure to launch the iPhone in other European countries soon after the French, German and UK markets because otherwise it could upset potential customers.O2 said: “We have not signed a deal with Apple.” Apple said: “We …do not comment on rumours or speculation.”However, Vodafone shares were among the worst performers on the FTSE 100 on Thursday - down 1.3 per cent at 164p.
620;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-06-29T19:32:51Z;Smartphone wars;;Can Gandalf work some magic on Palm? Numerous tech blogs are currently speculating about a new smartphone that Palm is working on, giving it the same name as the wizard from The Lord of the Rings.Palm could certainly do with a boost. Even as it reported fourth-quarter results on Thursday evening, lines were forming across the US in anticipation of the product launch of the year: Apple’s iPhone. Weaker-than-expected guidance for sales of Palm’s Treo smartphone over the summer reflects the competitive threat Apple poses.That contrasts starkly with Research in Motion’s performance in the same period. The Canadian maker of the BlackBerry beat estimates and downplayed the threat from Apple. The market certainly believed it: RIM’s stock soared by as much as 22 per cent on Friday. RIM’s solid base among business customers provides it with some insulation against the iPhone. However, about half of RIM’s new subscribers in the first quarter came from outside big businesses, so the overlap with Apple’s target is increasing. In light of that, RIM’s 2007 price/earnings multiple of 34 times – a slight premium to Apple itself – looks punchy indeed.Yet Palm’s challenges are arguably greater. Palm’s differentiating factor – its user-friendly operating system – clashes directly with one of the iPhone’s main attractions. The smartphone market, although just 9 per cent of global mobile handset sales, according to Gartner, is fast growing. That is an opportunity, but also means the sub-sector attracts the attention of Apple and other heavyweights such as Nokia.The iPhone’s success is not guaranteed. And that, along with Palm’s recently strengthened management team, provides some scope for optimism. But overhauling the product range at Palm will take time in a market that, as those lines outside Apple stores demonstrate, can change exceedingly quickly.
621;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;iPhone costs hit Apple shares;;Shares of Apple fell more than 2 per cent on Tuesday after Apple and AT&T revealed three new pricing plans for iPhone.The companies said iPhone customers would have to pay between $59.99 and $99.99 a month in service charges in addition to the $499 it costs to buy the long-awaited handset, which is set to hit US stores on Friday.The fall in Apple’s share price came in spite of the fact that the pricing scheme was comparable to data and voice plans offered by rival carriers for other smart phones.“This thing is so incredibly hyped,” said Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner. “I haven’t seen a product launch that has this much buzz around it as this one has in my entire career.“It’s an impressive little device, but whether it can live up to the expectations that are so blown out of proportion remains to be seen.”AT&T said the service plans, which require a minimum two-year contract, were designed to make it simple for customers to use the full spectrum of iPhone features, from making calls to surfing the internet.The iPhone is expected to form the centrepiece of AT&T’s new mobile business, which is being rebranded after it bought the remaining stake in Cingular it did not already own last year as part of the BellSouth deal.Although the iPhone is likely to be one of the most widely-watched product launches in history, analysts have pointed out potential weaknesses in the handset, including the fact that it will run on a slower 2G radio connection, rather than on faster 3G phone networks.Apple has yet to announce mobile partners for the iPhone in Europe and Asia, where it is expected to launch later this year and in 2008, respectively.AT&T also said customers would be required to take out a service plan before they could use their iPhones for non-phone related tasks such as listening to music, watching films or viewing pictures.Mr Baker at Gartner said the restriction was unlikely to dissuade consumers. “It doesn’t make sense to go buy an iPhone if you don’t want the phone features,” he said.Apple’s shares closed 2.2 per cent lower on Tuesday at $119.65.
622;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-06-05T23:28:50Z;Dell plans purchases to build services;;Michael Dell is planning a series of acquisitions to turn Dell into more of a computer services business, as he struggles to boost sales and margins at the world’s second-biggest personal computer maker.Mr Dell, co-founder and chief executive, on Tuesday told the Financial Times that the company’s services business was growing faster than sales of computer equipment, and represented a “huge opportunity”.“That growth will come not just from organic growth but also partnerships and acquisitions. We made a small acquisition in Scotland, which has worked out quite well, and I think you will see some more acquisitions to add capability to our services team,” he said.The comments came days after Dell announced it was slashing 10 per cent of its workforce in a cost-cutting drive designed to help put the company back on track after a string of missteps.“Michael Dell knows the company has got to change,” said Martin Reynolds, an analyst at Gartner. “[Using] services to sell hardware is something that makes a lot of sense for Dell.”Services offered by Dell could include helping companies install new equipment and running an IT helpdesk for staff.Mr Dell said only about $6bn of Dell’s $60bn annual revenues came from services.Rivals such as Hewlett-Packard and IBM have spent the past several years building up their services businesses to serve the computing needs of big companies. Many companies find services attractive because they are more profitable than hardware sales.Mr Reynolds said Dell was more likely to begin making small acquisitions to grow its existing services portfolio, rather than attempt the acquisition of a more specialised computer services company such as Accenture.But Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies, said Dell might be interested in a bigger deal.“In the past, Dell has wanted to remain lean and mean,” said Mr Kay. “Now they’re looking at it differently and saying: ‘We need to get this capability under our roof’.”Dell said recently it would begin selling through Wal-Mart stores and third-party resellers in addition to its direct sales over the telephone and internet. Mr Dell also indicated that the company could be expanding its range of own-branded stores beyond two experimental US outlets.Dell is also thought to be winding down a foray into Dell-branded televisions that began in 2003. The Bloomberg news service reported on Tuesday that Dell could stop selling its televisions as early as this month. A Dell spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the report.
623;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-05-30T23:11:24Z;Google moves to take on Microsoft;;Google will announce an initiative on Thursday that will take its applications beyond the web and challenge Microsoft on its home turf of the computer hard-drive.The internet company is launching Google Gears, an open-source technology for creating offline web applications.A key differentiator of Microsoft applications is that they can be used without an internet connection. They are launched from the computer’s hard drive and files created can be stored and accessed on that drive.Google Gears will enable its own applications to have the same capabilities. Google Reader, a news reader, will be offline-enabled from today and other applications would be expected to follow.“With Google Gears, we’re tackling a key limitation of the browser in order to make it a stronger platform for deploying all types of applications,” said Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive.Google says Gears will work with all main browsers on all main platforms – Windows, Mac and Linux. But while it says the Firefox and Opera browsers welcome Gears, it made no mention of Microsoft or its Internet Explorer web browser.Of additional concern to Microsoft will be Google’s decision to “open source” its technology. Google hopes Gears will move the industry towards a single standard for offline capabilities, potentially enabling thousands of applications to compete with Microsoft software.“Microsoft is either going to have to support this or do something like it,” says David Mitchell Smith, analyst with the Gartner research firm.
624;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-05-14T19:18:17Z;Nokia upbeat on rivalry with Motorola;;Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone maker, on Monday signalled its confidence that it could increase market share at the expense of Motorola by raising its forecast for the second quarter of 2007.Nokia said it expected its market share of mobile devices to be more than the 36 per cent that it recorded in the first quarter.Analysts said Motorola’s market share has been falling since a U-turn in strategy that is supposed to restore its profitability.Motorola, the second-largest mobile maker, last month reported a loss of $181m for the first three months of 2007.Carolina Milanesi, research director at Gartner, the telecommunications consulting and research firm, said Nokia’s confidence that it could raise its market share in the second quarter of 2007 was based on “Motorola’s weakness”.Nokia, led by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, chief executive, said on Monday that it expected “its share of the global device market to increase sequentially in the second quarter of 2007, from its estimated 36 per cent share at the end of the first quarter”.Last month, Nokia said it expected its market share to be unchanged in the second quarter.Nokia has a better view of its likely second-quarter performance following the clearance of a glut of mobiles shipped by manufacturers to network operators and retailers.Some analysts said the glut was principally the result of operators and retailers struggling to sell Motorola mobiles such as the Razr phone.Nokia’s market share of 36 per cent in the first quarter of 2007 compares with 35 per cent in the same period last year.The increase was driven by strong sales growth in Asia and Europe, which offset a decline in the US.Until last autumn, Motorola raised its market share for several years through the popularity of its Razr phone and an aggressive price-cutting policy, particularly in developing countries.But the strategy backfired as the Razr’s popularity waned and Motorola’s profitability tumbled because its manufacturing operations were not as competitive as rivals.Ed Zander, Motorola’s embattled chief executive, changed strategy and the company stopped bidding for contracts where profit margins were thin or non-existent.The impact was almost immediate. Motorola saw its market share plunge to 18 per cent in the first quarter of 2007, from 20.4 per cent in the same period last year, according to Strategy Analytics, a Boston-based research firm.
625;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-05-10T00:47:04Z;New Intel chips to boost laptop sales;;Growth in the sales of laptops is set to continue to outpace that of desktop PCs after Intel on Wednesday launched chips that will boost the performance, graphics and battery life of mobile computers.The world’s biggest chipmaker said more than 230 laptops had been designed for new versions of its Centrino chips, which would be available this year.Mooly Eden, vice-president of Intel’s Mobile Products Group, said the industry had been surprised by the growth of the laptop market.Gartner, the research firm, forecast two years ago that 73m laptops would be sold in 2007, but sales of 102m are expected this year. Shipments are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 19 per cent until the end of 2011.In contrast, sales in the more mature desktop market are expected to increase by only 4 per cent a year worldwide. Less than half as many laptops were shipped as desktops in 2005, but the IDC research firm expects the gap to have closed to 177m desktops shipped in 2010, compared with 159m laptops.Intel introduced two new brands on Wednesday – Centrino Duo and Centrino Pro for consumers and business users. The Centrino Duo includes Core 2 Duo processors – its first dual-core processors optimised for laptops.A new graphics chipset will enable smooth high-definition video and wireless chips will meet the latest 802.11n standard, expected to be finalised shortly.Intel announced other features including the introduction of flash memory, which will cut start-up times for laptops by 20 per cent.Mr Eden said the latest launch of Centrino chips would offer 44 per cent better performance than last year’s releases.Centrino Pro laptops will feature management tools that will help IT departments fix and monitor employees’ laptops remotely.

Teleportation also gives easy access to the regions of Tanaris and Winterspring and TP as it’s known is a standard mode of transportation from Neualtenburg to Neverland and from Little Tokyo to Luna Oaks.I refer, of course, to how people get around and establish communications in virtual worlds over the internet – these are places in Anarchy Online, Runescape, World of Warcraft and Second Life respectively.There is nothing real about them, but they are establishing a version of reality and connectivity that is growing far beyond the capabilities of the telephone, the television or the webcam.In the real world, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco are selling TV-style studio systems with huge screens that take conference calls over the internet to the high-definition life-sized level.Participants in Silicon Valley feel they are sitting at the same boardroom table as someone in New York, but are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for the privilege.The graphics may not be as sharp in Second Life and users’ avatars are hardly photo-realistic, but the potential is there for even greater interactivity of larger numbers of people, at almost no cost.Philip Rosedale, founder and chief executive of Linden Lab, the creator of Second Life, described the new voice capabilities being introduced at a recent conference in San Francisco on emerging trends, organised by the Gartner research firm.He said voice in virtual worlds would fix the problem of conference calls where it was hard to hear different people speaking.In Second Life, sound will have a different dimension, adjusted to the nearness or distance of a speaker and bringing a spatial awareness of where people are sitting and speaking in a virtual boardroom.This seems a much more engaging use of Second Life than many of the marketing experiments that have been taking place there and is of relevance to the enterprise.Gartner analysts predict that 80 per cent of active internet users and Fortune 500 companies will have a “second life” by 2011, although Linden Lab’s creation may not necessarily be their chosen world.Gartner came up with five laws to be observed by companies participating in these unregulated environments.First, it points out virtual worlds such as Second Life are not games, but neither are they a parallel universe yet. Executives who dismiss them as games are just as wrong-headed as those who immediately want to exploit them as sales channels.Second, behind every avatar is a real person and a culture and etiquette is developing – enterprises have to be careful how they handle this to preserve their corporate reputations.Companies also need to be relevant and add value – there have been no effective, profitable sales channels established yet and Gartner expects this to continue for the next three years. In addition, companies need to be aware of the downside of such worlds, where protests and graffiti directed at them can have as big an impact as in the real world.Finally, the development of virtual worlds will be a long haul. Gartner compares their current state of flakey technology and limited adoption to the internet circa 1993, when the first consumer browsers were appearing.I think another trend of a growing commercialisation of this segment also echoes the early days of the web. Mr Rosedale is something of a Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the web, in his altruistic embracing of open source and allowing Second Life members to retain intellectual property rights for their creations.Others moving into this space are out to make a buck and have an eye on the mass-market consumer.Atlanta-based Kaneva is cleverly simplifying the virtual world experience and adding social networking elements, while Sony will launch Home, a virtual world for its PlayStation3 owners, this year.It will help it to promote its own products, increase brand loyalty and sell games, movies and music in its virtual arcades, cinemas and clubs.Eve Online, which was developed in Iceland, is making a healthy profit from subscriptions for its dog-eat-dog space-based virtual world.It appears to be very popular with city traders and businessmen. I have spoken to two chief executives who became addicted to the game and honed their management skills running virtual megacorporations in a cut-throat and relatively lawless environment.It’s the sort of world the faint-hearted would want to teleport out of pretty quickly. Beam me up Scotty, as the saying goes.
627;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-04-25T23:30:00Z;Consumer barbarians at the IT gates;;"Those in search of the latest trends in technology and what it will mean for their businesses have converged on the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo: Emerging Trends in San Francisco this week.
The conference has been built around eight mega-trends identified by Gartner analysts, including the globalisation of supply and demand, the commoditisation of the tech sector, the virtualisation of IT and the socialising of technology.
Martin Reynolds, Gartner vice president, gave me his thoughts on the consumerisation of IT.
He showed how his non-work cellphone could access his office emails with the help of the latest version of Microsoft Exchange Server. It allowed a port to be safely opened to the company’s network that would satisfy the security concerns of the IT department.
He sees consumer-focused companies such as Apple, Google and Sony having a big effect on enterprise IT. The Apple iPhone when it comes out is not expected to be able to connect to business email systems in the way that a Blackberry can. Mr Reynolds said he did not think it would have virtual private network (VPN) software. This would challenge IT when influential executives turned up at work and demanded connectivity to the company network.
Google was doing its best to disintermediate IT, said Mr Reynolds, with its browser-based applications and its provision of a vast infrastructure for users.
He feels Google and others, such as Yahoo, Microsoft, Sony and Amazon, could challenge IT departments and traditional infrastructure providers by offering spare capacity on their own online networks to enterprises.
IT departments need to adjust to some new realities, he said.
""IT is no longer about how we run the computers, it’s about how we make the business better, how do I increase revenues rather than how do I decrease costs."""
628;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-04-19T17:06:53Z;Dell falls further behind HP;;Dell shares fell almost 1 per cent on Thursday, a day after two new studies showed the world’s number two PC maker continued to give up ground to Hewlett-Packard in spite of a pickup in computer sales worldwide.Preliminary figures from IDC and Gartner, the market research companies, showed that HP pummelled Dell in the battle for PC market share in the first quarter.HP’s PC shipments grew by more than 28 per cent in the first three months of the year, while Dell’s PC shipments fell 6.9 per cent over the same period, according to IDC. Gartner’s numbers painted a similar picture, with HP shipments up 28 per cent and Dell shipments down 7.8 per cent worldwide.The move marked the third successive quarter that HP has gained market share at the expense of its once-dominant rival. Analysts said HP had benefited in part from a backlog in demand for personal computers at retail stores following the launch of Microsoft’s Vista operating system earlier in the quarter.“It’s really dramatic,” said Loren Loverde, an IDC analyst. “Dell has a large exposure to the US and that’s a slow market. On top of that they’ve got low exposure to retail, which is a high growth area.”Total PC shipments by all vendors rose 10.9 per cent and 9 per cent in the first quarter, respectively.“The strong first quarter is a good indicator of the health of the industry,” said Mr Loverde. “The United States and Japan didn’t grow much in the first quarter, but solid gains everywhere else and a boost from [Microsoft’s Vista operating system] brought us back to doube-digit growth.”Earlier this year, Michael Dell returned as chief executive of Dell in order to help put the company back on track after price competition and poor customer service led to a string of weak results. Dell’s problems have been exacerbated by HP’s improved execution under chief executive Mark Hurd.“The first quarter of 2007 was a transitional quarter for Dell as the company began a major restructuring project,” said Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner.Although Dell managed to hold on to the top spot in US market share, its US PC shipments fell by 15.5 per cent in the first quarter, according to Gartner. HP’s US shipments use 25.8 per cent in the same period.Inernationally, HP widened its lead, claiming 17.6 per cent of total PC shipments, according to Gartner. Dell came in second with a market share of 13.9 per cent.Acer displaced Lenovo as the world's third-biggest PC marker following a 46.1 per cent increas in PC shipments in the quarter. Lenovo’s PC shipments grew 16.1 per cent, according to Gartner. The IDC study showed Acer and Lenovo tied for third in worldwide PC shipments.Dell’s shares fell 0.7 per cent to $24.84 by mid-day in New York. HP’s shares rose 0.7 per cent to $41.27.
629;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-04-16T20:50:17Z;All eyes on Google advertising;;The irony of seeing Microsoft voice antitrust complaints against arch-rival Google over the weekend has not been lost on its adversaries.Long accustomed to being the subject of regulatory scrutiny itself – in part prompted by complaints from rivals – the software company has finally acted to try to turn the tables.Yet among at least some observers on Monday, there was a strong suspicion that Microsoft’s charges – echoed by others, including AT&T – would fail to convince regulators to block Google’s proposed purchase of the online advertising company DoubleClick.At the heart of the complaint is that Google’s share of the search adverts placed on third-party websites, combined with DoubleClick’s dominance of the business of serving up graphical – or display – adverts, would give the enlarged company a dominant position in the overall online advertising business.Central to the analysis of this complaint will be whether the search and display advertising businesses, until now separate, should be treated as a single market for regulatory purposes.“It seems there is a clear distinction between Google’s business and the business it is entering with the acquisition of DoubleClick,” said Andrew Frank, an analyst at Gartner. If so, Google is not acquiring extra market power through the proposed deal.Some opponents, though, make the opposite argument. The search company has clearly stated an intention to integrate the two online markets closely together, says Brad Smith, general counsel at Microsoft.Announcing the proposed $3.1bn deal last Friday, the company said it would let advertisers manage their search and display campaigns using the same tools, making it easier to compare the effectiveness of their overall online advertising.However, to the extent that the integration only happens at this level, the two markets could still be considered separate, with their own pricing dynamics.Even if the two markets remain separate, though, combining a dominant position in each in a single company like this could put online publishers at risk, say critics.According to Jim Cicconi, head of external and legislative affairs at AT&T, it would make any web company that depends on online advertising dependent on a single supplier.In effect, Google would be able to influence the revenue lifeline of other internet companies, some of whom are its direct competitors.A further consideration, however, is whether the specialised nature of DoubleClick’s services in the online display market, which are far narrower than the services Google operates in the search advertising market, are central to the workings of that business to make the union anti-competitive.While DoubleClick’s technology serves up many of the display ads that are inserted into web pages, it does not run its own network to sell advertising space, as Google does. Instead, it works with advertising agencies, which use DoubleClick’s technology to distribute ads.Advertisers and agencies use the company’s Dart technology to target adverts based on demographic or behavioural criteria, track the number of people who see them, and manage their online campaigns.Google may eventually be able to leverage DoubleClick’s technology to gain a stronger position to sell display advertising.That opportunity helps account for what many analysts descri­bed as a very high price for a company understood to have revenues of only $300m to $400m.Some rivals in the online display market, meanwhile, argued that advertisers and website publishers could react to any excess market power on Google’s part by simply switching to another ad network.There are no barriers to prevent this switching, which reduces any anti-competitive concerns from a deal, said Dave Moore, chief executive officer of 24/7 Media, a rival online advertising services firm.“In the advertising business, there’s never been anyone who has been able to consolidate a market and hold on to it,” he says. “Google continues to build a Roman empire. We all know what happened to that.”
630;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-04-16T04:33:07Z;Microsoft to unveil rival to Adobe’s Flash;;Microsoft is set on Monday to unveil an internet technology to rival the Flash player, a piece of software made by Adobe that has become an ingredient in the success of video from YouTube and other online experiences.The move will touch off a fight over a strategically important internet technology, echoing earlier battles Microsoft waged against the Netscape browser and RealNetworks’ media player, according to analysts.Like Flash, Microsoft’s Silverlight player is a plug-in for web browsers, a software add-on that powers graphics and video.Flash has been central to advances in web technology that have turned the static, text-based HTML pages of the early internet into a richer interactive experience.That has made web-based applications an appealing alternative to software running on a PC, accelerating the shift to a computing architecture that threatens to weaken Microsoft’s grip.For Microsoft, creating a rival to the Flash player was “hugely important” since this was set to become the user interface for web-based computing, said David Smith, an analyst at Gartner.Jeffrey Hammond, an analyst at Forrester Research, added: “This is a battle for the next generation of eyeballs.”Flash is present on virtually all PCs, and is shipped with many new mobile handsets.YouTube’s decision to use the technology has added to its success: computer users whose machines do not already include the software are prompted to download it before watching a video.In similar battles in the past, Microsoft fought back against early leaders such as Netscape and RealNetworks by integrating its own rival products tightly with its Windows operating system – a tactic that exposed it to attack by antitrust regulators.The company did not plan to follow a similar approach with Silverlight, said Forest Key, a Microsoft executive.Instead, it would count on creators of web video and other content to adopt the technology, prompting internet users to download it to their PCs and other devices when they wanted to view the content.The player was designed to download in around 15 seconds, Mr Key said.Monday’s announcement will include news of partnerships with content produces that will use Silverlight, including Major League Baseball and Netflix, which rents out videos over the internet.A beta version of the software is due in the coming weeks.
631;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-03-28T21:04:00Z;Sony’s PS3 has record launch in Europe;;Sony’s PlayStation 3 console has enjoyed a record-breaking launch in Europe, with about 600,000 sold in the first two days, despite its being the last and most expensive of the new games machines to come on the market.Sony said it estimated that about €400m worth of PS3 consoles, games and peripherals were sold across Europe on launch weekend.The sales figure compares with about 500,000 Xbox 360 consoles sold by Microsoft in Europe in the first month after its release in December 2005. Nintendo sold about 700,000 Wii consoles in Europe in the month after its launch last December.Retailers such as the UK’s Game Group and FNAC of France said they had seen huge demand for Sony’s machine.In the UK, Sony’s biggest market in Europe, 173,000 PS3 units were sold in the first 48 hours of launch, compared with 70,000 Xbox 360s and 105,000 Wiis on their launch weekends.The PS3 launch eclipses that of its predecessor, PlayStation 2, in 2000. PS2 took several weeks to reach similar sales. Sales of the Xbox 360, Wii and PS2 were hampered by lack of stock, however. Sony, which had delayed the European debut by several months, ensured a stock of 1m PS3s in stores.The PS3 also launched with a larger library of games than its rivals. The PlayStation platform has the largest European installed base, with more than 42m PS2s sold in the region.“I would expect the PlayStation 3 to do well initially because a lot of PS2 users had been waiting for the PS3 to come along,” said Paul O’Donovan, an analyst at the research company, Gartner. US figures suggest that the PS3 is performing marginally better than the Xbox 360 at the same stage of its sales cycle.NPD, the research group, estimates that about 1.1m PS3 consoles have been sold in the US in the first four months since launch, compared with 1m sales for Xbox in its first quarter. A strong launch does not guarantee market dominance, however.Many analysts say that while Sony will have no trouble selling the first 1m PS3s in Europe, it could struggle to find buyers for the £425 console once its loyal fan base is saturated.Microsoft, which has had a year’s head start over its rivals, had sold more than 10m Xbox 360s globally by the end of last year. Gartner expects that by 2009 the PlayStation will have outsold both the Xbox 360 and Wii as more games are created for the machine.
632;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-01-28T23:06:33Z;Technology sector at threshold of new world order;;For hundreds of tech companies around the world, tomorrow’s Windows Vista launch will mark the end of five years of anxious preparations.“We’ve devoted 150,000 man-hours to working with Microsoft on the Vista roll-out and testing,” says Shane Robison, head of strategy at Hewlett-Packard, the world’s biggest personal computer maker.For many, however, the real work is only just beginning.Some analysts expect Vista’s launch to result in a release of pent-up demand for new systems, with market research company iSuppli forecasting an increase in PC sales of 10 per cent over last year, roughly in line with last year’s growth rate.According to forecasts by market research company Gartner, 58 per cent of new PC shipments this year will include Microsoft’s new operating system.Any increase in sales may be partially offset by the higher cost of new hardware required to run Vista. Isuppli estimates PC makers will have to spend 20 per cent more on components – an average desktop costing $500 to make will now cost $600.That is likely to eat further into margins already depressed by fierce price competition.Steve Kleynhans, analyst at Gartner, says PC margins could also suffer if unexpected problems with Vista lead to a big increase in customer support calls.“As soon as they pick up the phone, you are starting to lose whatever meagre profit you made on the sale.”Michelle Pearcy, who is helping to lead the Vista transition at Dell, says the world’s number-two PC maker is shipping customised instructions to its new Vista customers.“Based on our testing we predict [the transition] will go smoothly,” she says.Both Dell and HP declined to provide a specific forecast of Vista’s impact on future PC sales, citing restrictions surrounding the “quiet periods” ahead of their quarterly earnings next month.However, many other hardware companies will be affected by Vista’s launch.Much of the extra cost of hardware required for Vista – worth about $91 – is for memory chips, with 512mb of memory being deemed sufficient by Microsoft, but many makers doubling this to 1Gb for optimal performance, according to iSuppli.While this sounds like good news for chipmakers, analysts have warned that Vista hype could lead to a sharp fall in prices.However, Samsung, the world’s largest memory chipmaker, is more optimistic, expecting Vista to expand the D-Ram market by 17 per cent this year to $35bn.Component makers generally expect Vista to have a profound impact on the industry – its sophistication, power and better graphics creating demand for faster processors, more memory, extra storage and bigger, wider screens.But the consensus appears to be that little pick-up is expected in Vista’s early days, particularly by big corporate customers.Of 240 IT directors and helpdesk managers questioned by Axios Systems, only 5 per cent said they would deploy Vista in 2007.“Large organisations are going to take whatever time they need to evaluate and deploy the technology,” says HP’s Mr Robison.Paul Otellini, chief executive of Intel, was optimistic last week that Vista would help sell its chips to the consumer across the board, including in laptops, the hottest part of the market.“[What] we do not know yet is whether the combination of Vista and the vPro product line [of processors for corporate use] will create a change in the refresh rate of enterprise-based PCs, outside of notebooks,” he said.Intel rival AMD predicted uncertainty in the first quarter over whether there would be rapid adoption of Vista, whether it would suffer any problems at launch and what effect it would have on inventories.“We’re very bullish on what Vista is going to do for the whole year, but the first quarter impact is rather questionable,” says Hector Ruiz, AMD chief executive.Seagate, the hard-disk maker, expects to benefit in the long term from Vista – extra storage will be needed for digital media recorded and edited by consumers and for back-up purposes.“Our sense is that it’s not going to be a big deal in the next quarter or two – we think it’s a consumer play for the most part early on,” says Bill Watkins, Seagate chief executive.“But I don’t get the feeling a lot of consumers know about Vista yet.”
633;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-01-28T22:59:11Z;Leopard could spoil view for rival’s offering;;"As Microsoft celebrates the launch of Windows Vista, software engineers at Apple are busy putting the finishing touches to a new operating system of their own.Apple is expecting big things from Leopard, the sixth instalment of its popular OS X operating system; to the extent that the banners at Apple’s 2006 developer conference wittily referred to Leopard as “Vista 2.0”.Some analysts expect Apple to launch its new operating system as early as this spring, but whether Leopard will upstage Vista remains to be seen.“Depending on when Leopard comes, it could be a bit of a spoiler for Vista,” says Van Baker, analyst at market research company Gartner.Long relegated to bit player status in the market for personal computers, Apple has seen a pick-up in Macintosh sales in recent quarters, thanks in part to interest generated by the runaway success of its iPod music player.In some ways, when it comes to technology, Apple is already ahead.“An awful lot of what Microsoft has done is a knock-off of the latest release of OS X,” says Mr Baker.Leopard will replace Tiger, Apple’s existing version of OS X, which already contains many of the features Microsoft has been trumpeting as part of its Vista push, such as the ability to load software “widgets” and an enhanced media player.Apple may also have an advantage when it comes to security, an area where Microsoft has promised big improvements. Apple’s previous operating systems have thus far managed to avoid the security problems that have plagued past Microsoft releases.While both Leopard and Vista will share some similar features, such as improved back-up capabilities, Leopard’s full feature list remains a closely-guarded secret.In spite of its recent strides, Apple still commands only about 2.9 per cent of the worldwide PC market, according to Gartner. Even if Mac sales were to surge as a result of the Leopard launch, it is unlikely Vista sales would take a big hit.While Apple is winning converts among consumers, it lacks a strong presence in the business market, which accounts for the majority of worldwide computer sales.“Apple doesn’t chase the volume purchase agreements with Fortune 500 companies,” Mr Baker says. So long as that is the case, the potential for Leopard to act as a spoiler for Vista will be limited.Apple could still realise big benefits from Leopard, however. The PC market’s sheer size means that small gains in market share could translate into big increases in revenue for Apple."
634;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-01-28T22:41:37Z;Vista marks end of an era for Microsoft;;The stroke of midnight on Monday night will be a defining moment for Microsoft. After more than five years of work, several delays and an about-turn that saw it drop part of the original design, personal computers loaded with the long-awaited Windows Vista operating system will officially go on sale.The moment also marks a turning point in the history of the world’s biggest software company, as Microsoft turns its attention more fully towards a future software industry that is likely to look very different.“It probably is the end of an era,” says Michael Cusumano, software expert and professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The methods Microsoft has relied on to develop and to deliver software – including the latest releases of Windows and the Office suite of applications, which also goes on sale today – are going through a fundamental change.That is partly because of what Mr Cusumano calls the internal “trauma” caused by its struggles with Vista. Never again: in future, he says, Microsoft will release less ambitious, and more frequent, updates to Windows.However, it also reflects a deeper change in how the software business works.With “software as a service” the industry’s new mantra – referring to the way companies such as Google or Salesforce.com deliver a service over the internet that is powered by software running on their own servers – a post-Vista Microsoft will refocus its efforts towards online services, says David Smith, analyst at research firm Gartner.“You’re going to see a shift between what’s delivered as Windows, and what’s delivered as Windows Live,” the range of consumer internet services that Microsoft announced more than a year ago, he says.The pressure to change will be felt first with Office, where Microsoft is starting to face competition from online services offered by Google and others, says Rick Sherlund, software analyst at Goldman Sachs.Microsoft’s old way of doing business will not change overnight. In the short term, Vista is expected to represent another powerful product cycle for Microsoft’s phenomenal desktop software cash machine, helping to lift the company’s growth rate back from less than 10 per cent, where it dipped two years ago, closer to 15 per cent, according to most Wall Street forecasts.Vista could also stimulate demand for a range of other current Microsoft products and services.“We look at Vista as the platform for how the digital lifestyle will evolve,” says Brad Goldberg, product manager for the Windows Client business. Translation: software that is easier to use, supports high-definition video and is less vulnerable to security threats could prompt faster adoption of digital media, lifting demand for everything from Microsoft’s Xbox 360 games consoles to the new home servers put on display this month.“They’ve got the wind at their backs at the moment,” says Mr Sherlund, pointing to the new spurt of growth from several directions, including Microsoft’s server business. Vista “gives them stronger growth and probably allows them to fund new ventures” such as the push into internet services.However, this leaves some fundamental questions unresolved. By the time the Vista product cycle matures, many analysts expect the changing software landscape to present a more serious challenge to Microsoft’s traditional business model and culture.Fundamental changes in technology architecture, of the type now taking place around the internet, seldom favour incumbents, whose ways of making money are built upon an earlier technology.Advertising-supported services delivered over the internet have become the biggest challenge to Microsoft’s approach to doing business.Under Ray Ozzie, Bill Gates’ successor as chief software architect, Microsoft has responded with a strategic vision focused on “software and services”. While internet services become more important, according to this view, they do not weaken the need for software-rich “client” devices such as PCs, cell phones and games consoles.Even if Microsoft is able to forestall radical business model disruption, it still has to prove it can build a successful services business. Just as important is an online advertising system needed to “monetise” these services. To judge by its latest earnings, released last week, it has made little progress on this front.“It’s a question of whether they can get the product orientation itself right,” says Charlie diBona, analyst at Sanford C Bernstein. “There has been a bit of: ‘Build it and they will come.’ That has to change.” By the time Vista recedes into history, Microsoft will have had to build its own Google or Yahoo – or, failing that, have gone out and bought one.
635;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-01-18T03:31:05Z;HP extends lead over Dell in PCs;;Hewlett-Packard extended its lead over Dell in personal computer shipments last quarter, according to a study published on Wednesday by Gartner, the market research group.The study found that HP shipped 11.6m computers in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with 9.4m at Dell. Lenovo rounded out the top three PC vendors, shipping about 4.8m computers in the period.The news marked the second successive quarter that Dell has lagged its arch-rival in PC shipments. Last quarter, Dell lost the number one spot in the PC market to HP for the first time in three years.Gartner said PC makers had grappled with difficult conditions in the fourth quarter as companies battled against falling prices and delayed purchases ahead of the launch of Vista, Microsoft’s new operating system.“PC price erosion was a defining feature of the quarter,” said Mikako Kitagawa, analyst at Gartner. “In the consumer market, the PC industry battled for wallet share against other consumer electronics products, such as games consoles and flat panel TVs, while at the same time cutting prices to ensure market demand did not stall prior to Microsoft’s Vista consumer launch in January.”Dell managed to hold on to its lead in the US PC market. But while the struggling computer maker shipped more units than HP in the period, its overall market share fell.“Dell’s market share was its lowest in four years” Ms Kitagawa said. “It lost market share across all segments in the US, particularly the home market.”Dell declined to comment on its performance in the fourth quarter ahead of its quarterly results due out next month. A spokesman pointed instead to Gartner’s full-year numbers, which showed Dell slightly ahead of HP. “Dell set an industry record for shipments for the year,” he said.Nonetheless, this quarters’s loss of market share in Dell’s core US market is likely to add to the pressures facing Kevin Rollins, chief executive, who is trying to put the company back on track after a several quarters of mis-steps.Over the past six months, Mr Rollins has reshuffled the company’s business units and has invested millions to improve customer service. Although the company’s shares benefited from improved margins last quarter, sales growth has languished.Some analysts have argued that the company’s eroding cost advantage means that it could be difficult for the computer maker to return to its traditional double digit sales growth rate.Dell’s shares fell 2.5 per cent on Wednesday to $25.84. The shares had risen from a low of $19.91 in July.
636;IT;Gartner Inc;2007-01-10T02:21:21Z;Apple faithful smitten to the core;;"The throngs of Apple fans who crowded into the Moscone convention centre in San Francisco to hear Steve Jobs give his annual MacWorld keynote address went into the room with high expectations.Judging by their response their expectations were more than met.The unveiling of the iPhone, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the mobile handset market, was greeted by rapturous applause, gasps of disbelief, and occasional whoops of joy from the Apple faithful.Six years after Apple transformed the market for digital music players with the introduction of the iPod, the company had attempted a repeat performance in the market for mobile handsets with the iPhone – a slim, sleek handset that relies on an innovative touch-screen interface.“This thing is amazing,” says Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner, who had a chance to try the iPhone himself during an analyst briefing by Apple. “It’s the biggest home run for them I’ve seen yet.”Apple is far from the first company to try to crack the so-called smart-phone market. Microsoft, Apple’s arch-rival, has been talking about such devices for years, but its mobile windows effort has slumped – in part because mobile carriers were wary of Microsoft and kept out.Just 6m smart phones were sold in the US last year, compared with more than 1bn mobile handsets sold worldwide.Two million of them operated on Windows software, with the rest split between Research In Motion, maker of the Blackberry; Palm, maker of the Treo handset; and a handful of others. Shares of RIM fell 7.9 per cent while Palm stock was 5.7 per cent lower. Motorola shares were down 1.8 per cent.Charles Golvin, analyst at Forrester, cautions that, even with Apple’s impressive device, the market for phones that integrate voice calls, e-mail, web browsing and music will remain a small part of the overall handset market.Miro Kazakoff, senior associate at Compete, an industry analyst group, says his research shows that “it’s unlikely that any phone, no matter how good, is going to get people to pay a high price and up to $200 in early termination fees on their current contract”.“Wireless shoppers are hooked on free phones as carriers have subsidised better and better devices over the years,” he adds.Apple is betting that the iPhone’s unique user interface – the result of years of research – will reinvent the entire smartphone category, just as the Macintosh redefined computers and just as the iPod redefined what customers came to expect from their digital music players.“Apple is going to reinvent the phone,” was Mr Jobs’ bold pronouncement at
MacWorld. The early signs are encouraging.Ralph Simon, MEF Americas Chairman Emeritus of the Mobile Entertainment Forum, says that the iPhone represents a “quantum leap in innovation” for the entertainment industry.“You can’t overlook the strides already made by competitors like Nokia and Motorola, but the seamless marriage of the iPod’s kudos to the mobile phone is a key step evolution of the mobile to becoming an all-round entertainment device,” says Mr Simon. With the least expensive iPhone models priced at $499, price remains a concern. “How many people will be out there willing to pay that kind of premium?” Mr Golvin asks.However, he says there are some encouraging signs in Motorola’s recent experience with the Razr, its ultra-thin premium mobile phone. “The Razr is now several years old – they were able to keep their premium prices for quite a while,” Mr Golvin says.Mr Jobs was keen to signal Apple’s intention to become a leading player in consumer electronics. At the close of his MacWorld speech, he announced that the company had decided to drop the word “computer” from its name now that its brand has spread well beyond the Macintosh to include other devices.Even the most jaded observers would be hard pressed to deny that, with the iPhone, the newly christened Apple is off to a great start."

638;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-12-30T01:16:10Z;YouTube software threat to Google plans;;YouTube’s failure to complete a key piece of anti-piracy software as promised could represent a serious obstacle to efforts by Google, its new owner, to forge closer relations with the media and entertainment industry.The video website, the internet sensation of 2006, promised in September the software would be ready by the end of this year. Known as a “content identification system”, the technology is meant to make it possible to track down copyrighted music or video on YouTube, making it the first line of defence against piracy on the wildly popular website.YouTube said on Friday the technology would not be formally launched this year and YouTube’s offices were closed until the new year. While providing no further details about when the system would be made formally available, it said tests of the system had been under way with some media companies since October and the system remained “on track”.Mike McGuire, a digital media analyst at Gartner, said the important part systems such as this played in building better relations between internet companies such as YouTube and the traditional media industry meant there was likely to be little patience for missed deadlines. “The technology industry really has to start living up to the media industry’s expectations,” he said.If the delay lasts for more than a week or two into the new year, suggesting more than just a slight technical hitch, “this is certainly going to be a serious issue”, Mr McGuire added.Leading music companies have already made clear they see completion of YouTube’s anti-piracy technology as an important step in any closer co-operation. Failure to build adequate systems to protect copyright owners could also add to the risk of legal action against the site.Doug Morris, chief executive of Universal Music Group, hinted at legal action against YouTube late last summer, accusing both it and MySpace of being “content infringers [that] owe us tens of millions of dollars”. Universal went on to sue MySpace but was one of the companies to reach a partnership with YouTube, partly based on the ability of its promised content identification system to track down copyrighted music.The delay to the software could also spell wider problems for Google, which has been trying to negotiate partnerships that will give it access to content from a number of big media and entertainment companies. The company could not immediately be reached for comment.On Friday night, a YouTube spokeswoman said the company had never promised general availability by the end of the year.
639;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-12-12T00:36:33Z;TI signals industry slowdown;;Texas Instruments, the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, on Monday signalled an industry slowdown as it lowered its earnings forecast for the fourth quarter.TI, considered a bellwether stock by semiconductor analysts, dropped its profit expectations from between 40 and 46 cents a share to 37 to 40 cents.“I would say wireless has weakened further than our expectations in October,” Ron Slaymaker, head of investor relations, told an analyst conference call.He was referring to a third-quarter results call when cell phones were already identified as TI’s main area of less-than-seasonal demand entering the fourth quarter.TI’s biggest concentration of chips is in high-end “smart” phones using next-generation technology.“3G continues to be an area of softness,” said Mr Slaymaker.The Dallas-based chipmaker, number three in the world, is a key supplier of chips for Nokia and other handset-makers. It can provide an early warning of slowdowns in the industry.The Gartner research firm last month raised its estimates for 2006 to 986m handsets being sold after 251m sales were recorded in the third quarter.But Informa Telecoms & Media predicted growth of about 16 per cent this year would fall to 3 per cent by 2011 as markets matured.TI said its fourth-quarter revenue expectations were in a lower range of $3.35bn to $3.50bn, down from $3.46bn to $3.75bn.It said its expectations for semiconductors in general were broadly lower.“We don’t believe this has bottomed yet, we’re likely to see first-quarter revenue lower than the current quarter,” said Mr Slaymaker.He said the company was taking action by constraining costs – cutting down on travel and new hires. It was also reining in production in its factories and in the third-party foundries it used.Despite this, its inventories had grown from the third quarter, peaking in November and on the decline since then. New orders were down and TI’s book-to-bill ratio was likely to be less than one for the current quarter.TI shares were flat at $29.29 on the news in extended trading in New York.
640;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-12-01T18:21:20Z;Microsoft ‘may need a rethink’ on Zune;;The mixed early reception for its Zune music player means Microsoft will have to make early tweaks if it is to stand any chance of rattling Apple’s dominance of the digital music business, according to analysts.That should mean announcements early in the New Year of new versions of the player and more wireless facilities, they said.Microsoft “has to build momentum” to establish Zune as a music platform to rival iPod in the long term, said Mike McGuire, an analyst at Gartner. “If they don’t make a dent this Christmas, they’ll have to move fast” to improve the product.Launched little more than two weeks ago, the player and accompanying online music service were developed and rushed out for the Christmas season in just eight months after Microsoft made an about-turn in its digital music strategy.Initial sales in US stores put the Zune second to the iPod. The player accounted for 9 per cent of MP3 players sold in its first week, according to NPD, a market research group, compared to Apple’s 63 per cent.But there have been signs that early interest in the Zune has faded fast. On Amazon.com’s listing of most popular electronic products, considered one measure of broader demand, Zune on Friday morning stood at number 62. That was well below rival MP3 players from SanDisk and Creative.While some US stores sold out of Zune players early on, with demand particularly strong in urban areas near universities, others have seen weaker sales, said Richard Doherty, a digital media analyst at Envisioneering.The launch has also been beset by problems with the machines – from limitations on sharing music with other Zune owners wirelessly, to the incompatibility with other online music systems.“Somewhere around version three, they [always] get it right,” said Mr McGuire at Gartner. “But I’m not sure they have that sort of time,” given the speed of iPod product development. Analysts said Microsoft should use the Consumer Electronics Show, in early January, to announce new wireless capabilities for the Zune, and launch a whole new version of the player by the spring.
641;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-12-01T00:13:43Z;Patent move brings Apple phone closer;;Speculation over whether Apple is preparing to launch an iPod phone all but ended on Thursday after a patent application revealed that the computer group is working on a device that will combine a “media player” with a mobile phone.Apple fanatics and Wall Street analysts have long speculated that the company would move into the mobile handset market.“Today was probably the final hard evidence that they’re working on something,” said Gene Munster, analyst at Piper Jaffray. “Now the key question is the timing.”Many observers believe Apple, which is notorious for its secrecy around product launches, might launch a mobile phone in January at MacWorld, its annual convention and expo. But Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner, said such speculation was premature. “Every time you get close to MacWorld the rumour mill and speculation ramp up,” he said.Apple’s patent application outlined plans for a device that would combine a “cell phone” and a “media player.” The bulk of the application was dedicated to describing a new way of assembling the device. It contained few details about the device itself.Detailed drawings were submitted along with the patent application, but could not be recovered from the US Patent and Trademark Office’s website.The mobile handset market is seen as an important new growth area for Apple, which dominates the market in portable music players. It comes as Microsoft and other digital music rivals are stepping up efforts to grab market share from the Apple’s iPod in the music player market. Zune, Microsoft’s answer to the iPod, made its debut last month to mixed reviews.Apple has sold more than 70m iPods since the device first launched in 2001. That number pales in comparison with the potential market for mobile phones, however. Analysts expect more than 1bn mobile handsets will be sold in 2007.Apple shares were steady in after-hours trading at $91.66.
642;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-11-22T19:12:38Z;Nearing the magic billion;;"This is a golden year for the cellphone industry and all who sail with it.
More than a quarter of a billion mobile phones were sold worldwide in the third quarter, according to today’s figures from Gartner, and with the holiday season ahead, there must be a chance of hitting 1bn this year for the first time.
Sales of 251m in Q3 were up 21.5 per cent on last year and Gartner raised its full-year forecast to 986m units, with 281m forecast in Q4.
For chipmakers, it has been nothing but good news for the likes of Texas Instruments, the biggest supplier of chips for cellphones, and Qualcomm.
But this may be the best of times as slower growth lies ahead, according to Informa Telecoms & Media. It predicted last month annual growth of around 16 per cent this year will have declined to 3 per cent by 2011, when 1.255bn phones will be sold.
""The growth in developing markets such as India, China and Latin America is impressive but we are not seeing the same levels of phone take-up per capita,"" said Dave McQueen, Principal Analyst.
""With handset sales in saturated developed markets being much slower and reliant on replacement of old models, the net effect is a major slowdown in overall rate of growth from next year.""

643;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-11-16T16:54:48Z;Introduction;;"In the space of little more than 20 years, the mobile phone has changed almost beyond recognition – and with it, the way we communicate has evolved, too.The first mobile phones were bulky, had poor battery life and variable call quality. Nonetheless, they succeeded because they were convenient. Since 1984, when the first cellular phones went on general sale, mobile networks and, especially, mobile handsets have experienced several waves of development. The first generation networks gave way to the digital CDMA and GSM standards. These, in turn, are being replaced by 3G, while the industry is already busy working on a fourth generation of communications technologies.The greatest change of all, however, has been in the handsets themselves. The mobile phone has been a beneficiary of both miniaturisation and of Moore’s Law, which states that computer processing power doubles every two years. Handsets have also become significantly cheaper: the early models cost about $4,000, while today, service providers offer free handsets to customers with their contracts.But although someone buying a mobile phone in 1984 might have predicted – and probably hoped for – cheaper, smaller and lighter handsets, few could have anticipated the way the mobile phone would become a powerful computing, entertainment and business device all in one.“There has been a change in the way we perceive mobiles,” says Mark Stansfeld, sales director for mobile operator O2. “It used to be that they were a cost and the idea was to buy voice calls as cheaply as possible. Now it is a question of the incremental profits a mobile device can drive to the business.”At the top end of the market, high-end smartphones have taken on the tasks of the personal digital assistant (PDA), and the more powerful smartphones are starting to encroach on the territory of laptop computers. These phones now come with touch screens, folding keyboards and support for data networks such as WiFi. They can run presentations, come with word processing and voice recording software and increasingly, business applications for everything from field sales to healthcare. According to Gartner, the industry analysts, almost 35m smartphones were sold last year, four times the number of conventional, non-cellular PDAs.Although smartphones are designed to handle a wide range of communications and entertainment functions, there is one application that above all else has driven phones to replace PDAs: e-mail. Handsets such as the Palm Treo, Nokia’s E Series, Motorola’s Q, Sony Ericsson’s P990 and HP’s iPaq Messenger have all helped to make e-mail on the move a realistic proposition. However, there is one device that has arguably done more than any other to drive the take up of mobile e-mail: Research in Motion’s BlackBerry.In some ways, the BlackBerry goes against the smartphone trend because it is almost a single-use device; users complain that even making voice calls on the original, PDA-style BlackBerry is an imperfect experience. But the same users say that it is very, very good for e-mail. Research in Motion has responded by developing its own range of more conventional smartphones, alongside its PDA devices. The company has also formed partnerships with phone manufacturers, such as Sony Ericsson and Nokia, to offer BlackBerry functions on non-BlackBerry devices.But the BlackBerry, and to an even greater extent phones optimised for music and taking pictures, represent what industry observers call “functional convergence, physical divergence”. Such developments have changed the nature, and sometimes the shape, of mobile phones. Manufacturers, for example, have designed phones that are optimised for still photography or for video. These feature flash, high-resolution sensors and high-quality optical lenses.Phones designed to play music are another powerful part of the “feature phone” market. There are phones with huge hard disks for storing music, phones that connect to Apple’s iTunes and even phones with Sony’s iconic Walkman branding. The best phones in this market have sound quality that rivals or even exceeds that of a dedicated music player.A handset maker will use the same basic components to build a phone, including a processor, display, memory, interface, camera and software. It is the way the designers emphasise one set of features over another, such as play and pause buttons for music, a shutter button for pictures or a keyboard for e-mail, that give the clues about how the device has been optimised for its target market.However, this richness of functionality is not without its critics. Some businesses are finding that the growing features of mobile phones are creating administration and support problems around a device that is meant to be a work tool. The consumer appeal and low cost of mobile phones also means that some companies are struggling to manage the personally purchased handsets that their owners want to connect to the company network. This has led some to introduce strict policies on device usage, or even complete bans on non-company smartphones.“At one level, there is absolutely no benefit to businesses from the new generation of handsets,” cautions Ken Dulaney an expert on mobility at Gartner.Ignoring the potential of the latest communications devices could, however, mean missing out on an opportunity. “At another level, many of these phones are training wheels for the future,” he says. “The BlackBerry has given CIOs a real insight into what a wireless computer can do.”The generation of mobile handsets currently on the designer drawing boards will be more powerful still. Handset makers are placing big bets on “dual-mode” phones that can make voice calls over both wireless and cellular networks; the more sophisticated smartphones already have wireless LAN on-board.Cost savings will be one factor driving the take-up of such handsets. “Dual-mode phones have the potential to act as PBX [office phone system] extensions in the office, using all the facilities of the PBX, and as a VoIP [internet telephony] phone at WiFi public hot spots or at home,” says Phil Sayer, senior analyst at Forrester Research. With half of all mobile calls estimated to be made in buildings – potentially within reach of a wireless LAN – the savings on call charges alone could be huge.But cost is not the only driver for WiFi-equipped phones. Unified communications and “presence” are both predicted to be important, especially to business users. Unified communications will let office workers use their mobile handset for voice calls, voice-mail, e-mail, instant messaging and video conferencing.Presence-based systems will route calls to a worker using the most appropriate form of communications, such as a cellular call if they are on a train, an instant message if they are in a meeting or a VoIP call if they are at their desks.“The real benefit comes from a single phone number approach,” says Mr Sayer. “Your contacts call your ‘one number’, and the call reaches you via a land line to the office, at home, or in a public WiFi zone, or via GSM if none of the other options apply.”However, making all this work seamlessly is still a little way off. Moreover, there are trade offs to be made between power consumption, device complexity, cost and features. A phone with a great MP3 player is fine, but it is no good as either a phone or a music player if the battery drains too quickly. In these cases, many users will opt for simplicity over a multitude of functions.“Often the most important feature of all is battery life,” says O2’s Mr Stansfeld. “Talk time is incredibly important for some of our customers, so we developed a phone that has double the talk time. It is a question of what people want from a phone.”"
644;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-11-16T16:54:48Z;Camera phone;;In just four years, camera phones have entered the mainstream. More than 300m camera phones where shipped in 2005, according to Gartner, the research group, and at current growth rates there could be an extraordinary 1bn camera phones in use worldwide by 2008.In some countries, it is now difficult to buy a mobile phone without a camera – but not yet impossible. “We still make phones without a camera for price-sensitive consumer markets and for corporate users who specifically do not want a camera,” says Satu Ehrnrooth, director for cameras with Nokia’s multimedia division.Corporate users may need a camera-free phone because many businesses – including, ironically, phone manufacturer Samsung – have policies prohibiting the use of some camera phones on their premises because of corporate espionage or privacy concerns. Nevertheless, two out of every five phones sold in 2005 had a camera, and worldwide sales of mobile phones with embedded cameras will outpace non-camera phones this year, according to ABI Research. In advanced Asian markets, that crossover point was reached some time ago.It is not hard to see why such devices are so popular. Instead of having to carry a separate digital device, a camera phone kills two birds with one stone. According to Nokia, 44 per cent of camera phone buyers use the phone as their primary camera. “In emerging markets, the figure is much higher, and reaches 90 percent in India,” says Ms Ehrnrooth.For the digital camera industry, which is facing over-capacity and declining sales, that is a chilling statistic. Now, it seems, the sector can no longer depend on the emerging economies to re-ignite growth.For most people, the sheer convenience of having a camera in their mobile phone outweighs the limitations, particularly in areas such as usability and picture quality. The quality of the photographs taken with a camera phone was once noticeably inferior to that of a dedicated digital still camera. But today, all but the cheapest camera phones have sensors with resolutions of 1m pixels or more. And by 2010, most camera phones will come with four-megapixel sensors or better.Samsung, for instance, is already ahead of that target. Last year, it unveiled the world’s first seven-megapixel camera phone. It drew gasps of surprise from the still camera industry, which had taken several years to evolve conventional digital cameras up to a resolution of seven megapixels.More recently, Samsung has moved even further. It has just unveiled a camera phone with 10 megapixels, more than that offered by many sophisticated digital SLR cameras – and better than what most users realistically need, according to Nokia’s Ms Ehrnrooth. “Our latest multimedia phone has a five-megapixel sensor and with that resolution you already get excellent quality,” she says.Apart from the trend to multi-megapixel sensors, the other big development in camera phones is the advent of phones optimised for use as cameras – in some cases, they even look like cameras. Earlier this year, for example, Sony Ericsson introduced its K800 and K790 phones, the first handsets to carry the well-regarded Cybershot brand – used by Sony for its best-selling line of digital still cameras. Both cameras have a 3.2-megapixel sensor, autofocus lens and a user interface similar to that of a standalone Cybershot device.Not to be outdone, Nokia recently unveiled two camera phones, the N93 and N73, which sport 3.2-megapixel sensors and Carl Zeiss optics – a first for a camera phone.But sensor resolution and optics are only part of the problem. Users of digital still cameras know that images taken with camera phones often do not look as sharp as they could. A lot of the time, the problem is due to blurring caused by natural hand jitter, especially in low-light conditions.While makers of digital still cameras add circuitry to electronically stabilise images, camera phone circuitry is tightly packed, requiring small and expensive components. As a solution, InvenSense, a US company, has developed a tiny low-cost gyroscope that it claims can reduce camera shake.Another challenge is adding features such as autofocus and zoom lenses, which are taken for granted on digital still cameras but cause big headaches for makers of camera phones. One radical solution is to substitute the conventional mechanical moving parts of a zoom or autofocus lens with a so-called liquid lens, which reduces size, cost, weight and power consumption.Varioptic, a French company, has been trying for some time to get phone makers interested in its liquid lens technology, but so far no one has publicly committed to use it.“We are looking at all emerging areas of camera phone technology, but the biggest challenge is making sure the technology is reliable,” says Ms Ehrnrooth.Another big challenge is getting consumers to actually use the technology. In the UK, for example, M:Metrics, the mobile market researchers, found that 53 per cent of the mobile phone population takes a photo once a month, but only 30 per cent use network services to send the photo (or video) to someone else. That’s bad news for the mobile operators who have invested in functions such as Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) to encourage people to use the networks for more than just talk.In the US, where camera phones are less common, the figures are even worse. Only 27 per cent of US mobile phone users take a photo at least once a month and only 15 per cent use network services.When it comes to uploading photos and videos to the web – immensely fashionable thanks to the blogging and YouTube phenomena – it is a similar story. Only 2.8 per cent of the UK’s mobile phone population are uploading videos to the web, according to M:Metrics.Nevertheless, Paul Goode, an analyst at M:Metrics, says these figures are averages and usage varies tremendously depending on the handset. For example, more than 92 per cent of those who own the W800, Sony Ericsson’s popular Walkman phone, take a photo at least once a month. What’s more, a record 25 per cent upload a photo to the web. Why? “The W800 comes with a great application called ShoZu that helps you upload the photo and create a blog if you do not have one,” says Mr Goode.While the technology in camera phones has made giant strides in recent years, the industry has belatedly realised that advanced features count for little unless they actually get used.
645;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-10-19T21:23:14Z;HP ahead in PC shipments;;Hewlett-Packard has regained its lead over Dell as the world’s biggest personal computer maker by shipments for the first time in three years, according to new studies by two influential market research groups.The studies by Gartner and IDC, which come weeks ahead of both companies’ quarterly results, underscored Dell’s struggle to adjust to a changing PC market after a period of extraordinary growth.For HP, the studies marked further evidence that the company’s operational performance remains unaffected by a boardroom spying scandal that has led to several high-level departures and a shake-up of the board.“HP continues to take better advantage of the faster growth segments such as the consumer market,” said Mikako Kitagawa, a Gartner analyst. “Dell felt the effects of the weak sales in the US market, and it gave up some ground.”Gartner said HP shipped 9.65m computers in the third quarter, an increase of more than 15 per cent over the same period last year. Dell shipped 9.54m PCs, an increase of just 3.6 per cent.Two years ago, the situation was the reverse, with Dell logging growth in the mid to high teens while HP languished.Lenovo, the Chinese computer maker, rounded out the top three PC groups, with 4.44m shipments worldwide in the third quarter.Shares of Dell fell 6.2 per cent on the news. They have fallen more than 40 per cent since Dell’s troubles began last year. IDC said Dell had suffered from a further slowdown in its US business, which accounts for about half of the company’s computer shipments.Its analysis was more cautious, however. It found that HP beat Dell’s shipments by just 28,000 computers, resulting in a “statistical tie”.Kevin Rollins, Dell’s chief executive, has come under increasing pressure to put the company back on track following a series of pricing mistakes and slip-ups in customer service. In spite of its troubles, Dell hung on to the top spot in the US computer market, with 32 per cent market share.
646;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-10-11T00:57:10Z;Indian firms eye investments of $150bn;;Indian companies have an estimated investment pipeline of about $150bn as they step up borrowing to capitalise on the country’s rapid economic growth, according to one of the country’s most senior bankers.Kalpana Morparia, joint managing director of ICICI Bank, the country’s largest private lender, said three years ago, the country’s top 1,500 companies only had plans to invest about $50bn.“We have never seen a pipeline of this magnitude before,” Ms Morparia said in an interview with the Financial Times.The ramp-up by India’s corporate sector follows comments from Manmohan Singh, prime minister, last week that the country needs $320bn in infrastructure investment over the five years starting in 2007 to lift economic growth to 10 per cent a year.India’s largest business groups are also rolling out investment programmes on an unprecedented scale in sectors such as retail, telecommunications, energy, real estate, manufacturing and special economic zones.In one of the biggest programmes, Reliance Industries, run by Mukesh Ambani, is expected to launch a $5.6bn nationwide retail business.The country’s telecoms companies, meanwhile, are expected to have nearly 300m subscribers by 2009, according to estimates by Gartner, the research firm – more than double the current levels.Ms Morparia said the investment pipeline identified by ICICI consisted about 40 per cent of energy-related projects, such as oil refineries, power plants, oil exploration and production, with the rest split between metals and mining, infrastructure, manufacturing and industries such as textiles, cement and others.“$150bn is a significant number for a country where the total size of the bank credit book is Rs15,000bn ($328bn),” Ms Morparia said.But she said that of the $150bn, half would be funded through internal cash accruals and domestic capital markets. Another quarter would come from foreign debt and about $35bn to $40bn would come from domestic banks.Ms Morparia said bank credit grew 35 per cent last year. “You might see similar growth this year,” she said.India’s economy has been growing at a three-year average of 7 per cent, according to McKinsey, the consultancy. However, McKinsey says growth could be higher, not only with better infrastructure, but with financial sector reform.Distortions in the system mean that the country’s dynamic private sector receives only 43 per cent of the country’s commercial credit, with the unwieldy public sector absorbing the remainder.Banks are obliged to invest 25 per cent of their assets in government bonds and direct 36 per cent of their loans to other priority sectors, the consultancy says.
647;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-10-09T23:21:24Z;Copyright problems could hinder new partners;;"For months, YouTube’s co-founders, Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, have walked a fine line between encouraging their audience to upload video clips and soothing the nerves of anxious rights holders who could have crippled their fledgling start-up with copyright lawsuits.Even after the group’s $1.65bn acquisition on Monday by Google, some observers remained sceptical that even Google and YouTube combined would be able to overcome the technical and legal challenges posed by copyright.“Any sort of material that’s posted on YouTube that includes music is in violation of copyright law,” said Josh Bernoff, an analyst at Forrester Research. “There are many thousands of videos that fit that criterion.”Monday’s announcement that YouTube had struck deals with CBS and Vivendi’s Universal Music Group provided fresh evidence that big studios see YouTube as a potential partner, rather than an adversary. However, in spite of a recent string of such deals, concerns about copyright remained.“I see no evidence that YouTube has figured out how to avoid the copyright issue. “ said Allen Weiner at Gartner. “This deal makes no sense. [YouTube] do have a pretty powerful platform, but it’s a platform in search of a sustainable business model.”Mr Chen said on Monday that YouTube’s engineering team is hard at work on improving how content owners could identify material on the site through audio fingerprinting, keyword and context searches. He hoped to release the new technology in the next month. That strategy will now gain the formidable backing of Google’s engineering team.Mr Hurley said on Monday that the additional resources would help YouTube when it came to dealing with rights holders. He added that YouTube’s task of identifying illegal content would be made easier now it had access to Google’s vast resources and know-how.“From the beginning, we have always respected rights holders,” he said. “What this deal allows us to do is focus on that more than ever before, so copyright holders can benefit from our site.”Still, some have suggested that YouTube’s search for a buyer could backfire. Now that YouTube has found a parent with deep pockets, they say, copyright holders may find it more attractive to sue Google for infringements.“YouTube may have avoided major lawsuits so far because they have limited funds,” said Greg Kostello, founder of a rival video site vMix. “Any acquirer with large amounts of cash will make it a great target. While it’s true that YouTube has struck deals with a few media companies, they would need to make deals with virtually all of them to avoid major copyright lawsuits.“Meanwhile, some analysts said YouTube’s outreach to big studios would risk alientating the legions of amateur videographers whose homemade videos helped cement YouTube’s meteoric rise to an icon of online culture.“If you have people who are excited about using the service, and come down heavy handed with the copyright, you are going to see people leaving the site,” says Mike McGuire at Gartner. A cursory search of the YouTube site found 25 videos from users debating whether Google should buy YouTube – most were against it.For their part, music labels seem to have learned some lessons from their experiences with Napster, the peer-to-peer file sharing service that popularised pirated music in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Much the same as what happened with Napster, there is a series of labels which fear YouTube or anybody who acquires YouTube.“Music labels have begun to realise the cat is out of the bag with copyright and they’re trying to make money off of it. With video people, that’s not the case. The people who own video still believe that any violation ought to be acted upon,” said Michael Sherman, head of the entertainment practice at Jeffer, Mangels, Butler and Marmaro.Mr Sherman said studios are of two minds when it comes to dealing with YouTube. On the one hand, studios such as Warner Music and Universal have decided to work with YouTube rather than trying to destroy it at the risk of alienating their audiences.On the other, groups such as Paramount have taken a harder line.Google itself is no stranger to copyright controversy. It is preparing its defence for a lawsuit filed a year ago by the Association of American Publishers. They complain that a Google Print programme that would digitise and make available large parts of the book collections of leading universities would infringe on the copyright of publishers and authors.Sources: Citigroup; comScore Media Matrix"
648;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-10-04T23:08:03Z;Apple chief knew about stock options;;Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, on Wednesday admitted to knowing about backdated employee stock option practices at the iPod and Macintosh computer maker, as a former chief financial officer resigned from its board over the affair.Mr Jobs’ admission, and a public apology he issued over the matter, make him the most prominent Silicon Valley executive yet to be tarnished by the spreading options backdating scandal.“If this were to escalate to the point where Steve Jobs were forced to resign, it would be a disaster for Apple,” said Van Baker, analyst at Gartner. He added, though, that that seemed unlikely, since Apple said on Wednesday that its chief had not benefited personally from the practice.Apple said that a three-month internal enquiry had shown that Apple had backdated options on 15 occasions between 1997 and 2002. The practice, which involved issuing options to employees at exercise prices more favourable than the stock price at the time, was not in itself illegal, but could have been if companies failed to disclose or account properly for the practice. Apple is one of more than 100 US companies that have been caught up in the affair.In a filing with the SEC, Apple said that Mr Jobs was aware of the backdating “in a few instances”, but that he “did not receive or otherwise benefit from these grants and was unaware of the accounting implications”.A statement attributed to Mr Jobs in the same filing said: “I apologise to Apple’s shareholders and employees for these problems, which happened on my watch.” He went on to promise “proper remedial measures… to ensure this never happens again.”Apple also said that Fred Anderson, a former chief financial officer, had resigned from its board over the affair. The company also said its investigation had uncovered “serious concerns regarding two former officers in connection with the accounting, recording and reporting of stock option grants”. A spokesman refused to comment on whether Mr Anderson was one of the executives involved, or whether its board had requested his resignation.Henry Hu, a corporate and securities law professor at the University of Texas law school, said that many of the executives caught up in the backdating scandal had probably not acted with any intention of misleading their shareholders. “A lot of executives were not aware [of the accounting requirements], and there were a lot of other things to worry about,” he said.However, he questioned why Apple and Mr Jobs had not disclosed his knowledge of the backdating three months ago, when the company first disclosed its internal investigation into the matter. “I think it was a bad judgment call,” he said.Apple’s shares slipped less than 1 per cent in after-market trading on Wednesday, suggesting that investors did not believe that Mr Jobs’ admission would weaken his position at the company.
649;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
650;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;MySpace videos ‘most watched’;;MySpace, the social media site owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, on Wednesday earned a new feather in its cap after an online ratings agency said it showed more videos in the US than any other internet site in the month of July.MySpace’s US users watched 1.5bn videos in July, more than double the 649m watched on YouTube, the fast-growing specialist video site, according to comScore, an online ratings agency. Yahoo users are also reported to have streamed more videos, with 812m viewings in the month.If accurate, the figures suggest MySpace may already have more weight in the booming online video business than even News Corp executives have suggested. Peter Chernin, News Corp president, took aim at YouTube at a Merrill Lynch conference this month, saying MySpace aimed to match or exceed its audience.As many as 60-70 per cent of YouTube’s users connect to the service though MySpace, Mr Chernin claimed, making them an attractive target market for MySpace’s own in-house video service. However, Chad Hurley, YouTube chief executive officer, played down the significance to his company of traffic from MySpace, saying it did not represent a dominant share of YouTube’s audience.While early audience gains were an important indicator of which companies were doing well in online video, none of the internet sites had yet found a reliable way to sell the new audiences to advertisers, said Allen Weiner, an analyst at Gartner. The booming viewer numbers “show the pressing need all these companies have to come up with a way to insert ads”.
651;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-09-14T22:33:41Z;Microsoft nears launch of iPod rival;;Microsoft on Thursday unveiled new details about Zune, its answer to Apple Computer’s popular iPod music player.The world’s biggest software company confirmed what many analysts had expected, that Zune would allow users to download and share music wirelessly.It said the device would be available for the holiday shopping season in the US, although it declined to provide a launch date.The latest details about Zune came days after Apple unveiled a movie download service.The service, along with a wireless device called iTV which allows users to play on their television sets films downloaded on to their computers, marked a long-awaited move by the computer maker for control of the digital living room.Microsoft has been scrambling to catch up with Apple, whose iPod music player and iTunes music store account for the lion’s share of the lucrative portable music player market.David Smith, an analyst at Gartner, said Zune would include features allowing users to share music with each other. He said that could put Microsoft ahead of Apple in the race to incorporate “social networking” into its music and video service.“The idea of building a community where you can share music and the like is certainly ahead of the market,” he said, noting that Microsoft still lagged behind Apple in providing video content.Microsoft said Zune would let users share songs, pictures and other files with friends. Users would be able to listen to any shared song up to three times over three days, after which time they would have to buy the song from Zune Marketplace, an online music store that will be bundled with the Zune player. The music store will offer customers the choice of paying for individual songs or signing up for a monthly subscription service.Although Microsoft failed to offer details about pricing, it said the Zune device would be priced competitively with rival products.Speculation about the future of Apple’s digital media strategy continued to swirl on Thursday after analysts at Piper Jaffray pointed to new evidence Apple might be preparing to launch within the next few months a mobile phone capable of playing music and videos.Researchers at MacShrine, an Apple fan site, uncovered details about an unreleased mobile device buried deep within the documentation files of the latest version of Apple’s iTunes music software. Microsoft shares closed up 1.35 per cent in New York on Thursday.
652;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-09-04T17:24:06Z;Mashups that let companies get creative with data;;"Teenagers around the world spend hours every day borrowing or stealing pieces of information from the web and assembling it on their own web pages. On tens of millions of web pages on MySpace, Bebo or Cyworld, users can find the world’s most popular sound tracks, video clips and pictures.They are not the only ones using easily available web tools to create their own sites with their favourite content. Businesses around the world are embracing the so-called web 2.0 tools that allow the easy combination of information from many sources.“With web 1.0 you built a better mouse trap and then waited for people to come along and use it. With web 2.0 you build something that could be a better mousetrap or something else,” says Ray Valdes, research director of internet services and web platforms at Gartner, the US research company. “You unleash people’s creativity and in the process add value.”This second stage of the web reflects the rapid spread of broadband connections, which make it easy for people to manipulate and view content, including pictures and video.Borrowing a term from disc jockeys and musicians who combined sound tracks to create new ones, “mashups” have become one of the most useful new applications of the web 2.0 tech­nology for companies.A mashup is a website or web 2.0 application that uses content from more than one source to create a new service. In their simplest form, these combinations of information – essentially a kind of interactive cross-referencing tool – allow a builder, for example, to combine details about assignments with maps, traffic and weather data to determine how long it will take to get from one job to another.“The do-it-yourself web is emerging and some of the technical barriers are coming down,” says Rod Smith, IBM fellow and vice-president of IBM’s emerging technology software group. “Before, creating an application to analyse data would require months of work between business analysts and IT departments. Now, some of these projects can be created in half an hour.”All this is possible because many sites provide “hooks”, or application programmer interfaces (APIs), that enable programmers to tap into and capture information easily.Other methods of sourcing content for mashups include tapping into web data feeds such as the really simple syndication (RSS) feeds that many sites use to deliver news information and other updates, and Java­Script, a programming language developed by Netscape.Whatever the source, captured data can be incorporated to create all kinds of mashups. Many of the most popular ones innovatively combine existing data from sources such as Amazon.com, Ebay, Google, Windows Live and Yahoo. (See ­www.programmableweb.com for lists of mashups.)Google Maps, Google’s web-based mapping service, is one of the most popular mashup components. There is an entire blog (http://
googlemapsmania. ­blogspot.com) devoted to popular Google mapping mashups.Some of these mashups combine information from Craigslist, the online classified advertising service, and Google Maps to show the location of apartments for rent, for example. Others provide obscure services such as tracking the birthplaces of Oscar winners.Business applications of web 2.0 tools, including asynchronous JavaScript (Ajax), a web-development technique that enables programmers to build inter­active web applications and more dynamic sites, are also expected to become much more widespread. This will be encouraged as more websites incorporate open APIs, which are favoured by developers and their financial backers because they drive up use of their websites.“It is a requirement of most venture capitalists and funding principals that you provide open APIs,” says Mr Valdes, ­“because it extends your reach.”More and more companies are using APIs and other web 2.0 tools to build their own mashups. They are already looking at ways to change how they communicate with consumers. Since information of any sort can be viewed as a “feed”, banks, for example, could try to limit the rush to their websites by customers checking their accounts on Friday afternoons by automatically sending out an e-mail or an alert (similar to those commonly sent out about breaking news stories) with account balances.“The norms of the internet are changing,” says Mr Smith. “We are at the initial stages of this whole era. Mashups are just some of the things that people can easily do, but in a 10-mile race, we have really just left the gate.”"
653;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-07-26T02:25:29Z;Motorola in India IT joint ventures;;Motorola, the US handset maker, is to form two separate joint ventures with Indian IT outsourcing groups to create mobile phone software and telecoms networks for other companies.The move highlights the shifting role of Indian software exporters from behind-the-scenes players to companies with increasing global presence.It also reflects the growing sophistication of IT outsourcing towards work that requires complex industry expertise.Motorola’s venture with Tech Mahindra, which will be called Canvas M, will serve Indian telecoms companies that want to outsource development of mobile phone software related to messaging, entertainment and e-commerce.Current growth rates suggest India’s monthly additions to its mobile subscriber base could overtake those of China as early as September, although overall penetration will continue to lag, according to technology consultancy Gartner.Canvas M will be headquartered in Noida, India, near New Delhi.While the venture will focus initially on the Indian market, Motorola’s other venture, with Wipro, aims to design and manage wireless and traditional networks for global telecoms operators.Wipro is India’s third-largest exporter of software and IT services.A L Rao, Wipro chief operating officer, pointed out that the venture, called WMNetServ, would focus on telecoms networks.“Customers now have a dependable and long-term partner that is backed by two global companies to outsource and manage their network operations,” said Mr Rao.Wipro’s experience in telecoms outsourcing “complements Motorola’s expertise in mobility,” said Srikanth Kannankote, corporate vice-president at Motorola.The joint-venture will be headquartered in Europe with its main operations centre in India.The three companies did not disclose financial details of the joint ventures in Tuesday’s announcement.Separately, technology consultancy IDC India on Tuesday projected that the country’s domestic IT market would grow faster than IT exports by 2010. The increase would be driven by more prosperous consumers and businesses in India.Also, Motorola on Tuesday said it had signed a deal with Huawei Technologies, the Chinese telecoms company, for wireless network equipment based on HSDPA technology, a faster version of the GSM standard.The move comes amid speculation that Motorola would be forced to sell its network business or make a large acquisition to increase the size of the unit as its rivals merge and it faces competition from companies such as Huawei.
654;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-07-20T15:43:33Z;Mac sales boost helps lift Apple;;A rebound in sales of Macintosh computers helped Apple beat Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, sending shares in the company up more than 10 per cent in pre-market trading.Steve Jobs, chief executive, said Apple was “thrilled” with its performance.Apple recorded net earnings of 54 cents a share for the period, up 46 per cent from a year ago. Sales were $4.4bn, up 25 per cent year-on-year. Most analysts had expected earnings of 44 cents a share on sales of $4.4bn.The computer maker sold about 1.4m Macintosh computers in the period, up 12 per cent from one year ago. Investors had been keeping a close eye on the Macintosh numbers following a sluggish April quarter in which Mac sales increased just 4 per cent.Analysts said the April slowdown reflected customer hesitation to make new purchases as the company made the transition to Intel-based microprocessors in its flagship computer line.Mr Jobs said 75 per cent of the Macs sold last quarter contained Intel chips. He predicted that the remainder of Apple’s product line would be fully converted to Intel chips by the end of the year.Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner, said the third-quarter Mac numbers were “clearly an improvement” over the April quarter, but warned that Apple faced a “long, slow battle” as it attempted to win converts to the Macintosh.“They’re not going to have an overnight switch,” he said, noting that the debut of Microsoft’s long-awaited Vista operating system in several months’ time would test whether Apple was going to be able to win a steady stream of PC converts.Apple sold more than 8m iPods in the quarter, up 32 per cent from one year ago, confounding some analysts who had expected a slowdown in iPod sales growth. Shares in the company have fallen more than 40 per cent this year amid mounting pressure to develop new versions of the popular music player.Mr Jobs said on Wednesday that Apple was “extremely excited about future iPod products in our pipeline.”Looking ahead, Apple said it expected earnings of 46 cents to 48 cents a share in its fourth fiscal quarter, on sales of $4.5bn to $4.6bn.Meanwhile, Apple it did not expect an internal investigation into options-granting practices to result in a restatement of its financial results.Apple, one of dozens of Silicon Valley companies to have become caught up in a controversy over options grants, last month announced that a voluntary investigation had uncovered “irregularities” in grants to several senior executives between 1997-2001, including one grant to Mr Jobs that was never exercised.Broadcom, a semiconductor company, earlier this week said it expected to take a $750m charge and restate five years of results following an internal options probe.By late Thursday morning, shares of Apple, which fell 8 per cent on Monday, were trading more than 12 per cent higher at $60.63.
655;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-07-18T20:20:10Z;Microsoft links up with Nortel;;"Microsoft on Tuesday ramped up its ambitious attack on the business voice communications market as it announced an alliance with Nortel Networks, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker.Launched late last month, the new communications strategy marked a broad push by the software company to build voice, e-mail and instant messaging into its desktop and server software. Potential new services include making it possible for office workers to see online when their contacts are available to take a call and to launch a conversation from their PCs, phones or any other device; and converting voice calls easily to email and vice versa.“There are hundreds of millions of people who will be getting a new communications experience over the next four or five years,” opening up a big new software market as telephony and the internet converge, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive officer, said on Tuesday.By building communications into more of its software, Microsoft “is redefining communications and moving into it as a major player, becoming a peer with Cisco and Siemens,” said Bernard Elliot, an analyst at Gartner. Failure to integrate internet-based communications into its PC applications would expose the company to attack from other online rivals, he added. “If Microsoft doesn’t do it, they’ll lose the desktop,” he said.Microsoft’s attack on the voice communications market has sent waves through the telecoms equipment industry, raising the prospect of direct competition with companies like Cisco Systems, Nortel and Avaya.The software company appeared to offer one response to those concerns with Tuesday’s announcement of a link with Nortel, one of the biggest makers of Voice-over-IP, or Voip, equipment. However, the software company looks to be on a more direct collision course with others in the industry, such as Cisco, whose own “unified communications” strategy closely mirrors that of Microsoft.“We have very important aspects of cooperating [with Cisco] – but we have very important aspects of competition,” Mr Ballmer said.Under the alliance with Nortel, the companies said that some of the equipment company’s employees would work alongside Microsoft developers at the software company’s headquarters to create new internet-based communications products. While keeping their salesforces separate, the two sides said they would also develop a plan to market their joint products and services, and to coordinate their separate sales channels.“You can squarely say that Microsoft, with Nortel, is …in the business of voice quite clearly,” Mr Ballmer said.According to Mike Zafirovsky, Nortel’s CEO, the alliance would produce “well over $1bn” in extra revenues for the Canadian company over the next three years, with much of it coming from selling services to companies that want to upgrade their existing networks to handle the new capabilities.Nortel’s shares closed nearly 6.8 per cent higher on the news. However, at $2.09, they still stand stand some 60 per cent below their 12-month high."
656;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-07-11T14:27:14Z;Chris Nuttall: To boldly go beyond search;;What has Google done for the enterprise lately?Sadly, not a lot – its mission seems more aligned with the Starship Enterprise than business needs. It is interested in space – Google Mars for instance – the final frontier of capturing all the world’s information and boldly going where no search engine company has gone before.Providing service and support for a relational database, entering into a service level agreement for a suite of office productivity tools or installing servers to run an IT infrastructure sound altogether too mundane for the innovative Mountain View company.That should be a mighty relief to the likes of Microsoft, Oracle and Hewlett Packard, who may justifiably feel they have little to fear from Google in their core competencies.Google does not have to serve the enterprise, of course, when 99 per cent of its revenues come from advertising and are showing spectacular growth.“But there will come a day when those revenues are flat and at that point the enterprise software and services market is going to seem very exciting and they are going to want to talk about that to Wall Street,” Whit Andrews, a Gartner analyst, told me last week.Gartner has been looking at Google’s enterprise intentions and wondering where they may lead.Google’s regular tactic of throwing different jellies at a wall of users and seeing which sticks does not constitute a strategy for success in the enterprise, which insists on products that are ready for primetime, 99.9 per cent reliability and someone there to fix things when they go wrong.Google’s most serious effort in the enterprise to date has been the Google search appliance, although the bright yellow box with holes in it resembles more a slice of Swiss cheese than a blade server. But, from $30,000, the server will index and search half a million documents and, with the smaller Google Mini box, it has won 4,000 customers for the company.“I’ve spoken to about 20 to 25 of these and they tell me that when they want support, Google says: ‘Yes, we know there’s a problem, we’ll get to it’,” says Mr Andrews.“That’s something they have to change – they need a clear vision they can tell enterprises about. Enterprises know what Microsoft is doing, they have a road map, they have manuals, training, you get a sense of what they are going to do for you.”But Google’s Enterprise division is still tiny – made up of only 200 employees from its 6,000 strong workforce. Dave Girouard, its general manager, represents it as a semi-autonomous start-up within the company.He foresees a day when search will become so vital to enterprise employees for accessing the information they need that Google could become central to the workplace.First though, it will have to match the skills of bigger enterprise search companies such as Autonomy in dealing with legacy systems, unstructured data and security issues such as restricting company data sets only to those who have privileges.The Enterprise team is also hard at work trying to adapt for business use Google products originally aimed at consumers and in beta, that are now becoming fully developed.Google Maps for Enterprise was launched last month. This offers full enterprise licensing and support for its Maps service, meaning businesses can “map customer locations, track shipments, manage facilities” etc and publish these on their websites or intranets.It is also at the early stages of testing its Gmail e-mail service with universities and small businesses. The thinking seems to be that e-mail is very much tied up with search and company information and Gmail is a natural complement to its search appliance.Beyond that, Google has introduced an online calendar in beta recently and a spreadsheet application. It has acquired Writely, a word processor inside a web browser, and all it needs to complete a Microsoft Office-type basic suite of applications is a Powerpoint alternative.In addition, services such as Google Video, Picasa photo editing software and its Blogger tool for creating web logs could all find uses in the enterprise.The problem for Google is integrating them into a clearly defined product set and developing a licensing or subscription model very different from its current advertising one.Google’s products and their constant updates lend themselves very much to the software-as-a-service online model, enabling workers to collaborate in an ad hoc way over the web.This sounds like the future, but the Starship Google needs to engage a different warp factor to achieve it.As it stands, the state of its enterprise solutions is more akin to a frantic Scottie in the engine room shouting “She canna take much more captain,” up to the bridge.

This is something we’re anticipating.”Excluding fixed wireless customers, the Chinese mobile market had 374m subscribers at the end of 2005 and is expected to grow by 15 per cent to reach 432m by year end.India’s stood at 76m last year and is forecast to grow by 68 per cent to 128m in 2006.Telecoms is one of the rare infrastructural areas in which India can hold a candle to China. Most infrastructure services are 50-100 per cent more expensive in India than in China, according to Morgan Stanley research.Over the next five years to 2010, Gartner expects China’s mobile subscriber base, the largest in the world, to grow at a compounded annual rate of 11 per cent, compared with 31 per cent for India’s, the fastest-growing major market worldwide.India will continue to play catch-up with China for some time as coverage is patchy. India’s mobile networks are still largely focused on major cities. Coverage extends to 30 per cent of its 1.1bn population, compared with about 95 per cent in China.“Today the Indian operator with the widest coverage, BSNL, has done around 7,000 towns and cities,” says Ms Desai. “As there are around 650,000 villages in India, there’s a long way to go.”India’s mobile penetration rate stood at just 7 per cent in March, but should hit 32 per cent by 2010, according to Gartner, while China’s is set to rise to 48 per cent from 28 per cent.The astonishing acceleration in the growth of the Indian mobile market reflects a 93 per cent fall in the cost of calls since 1998 and growing availability of affordable handsets. More than 90 per cent of Indian mobile users have signed up since January 2003.On June 9, India announced it had become the fifth member of what its telecoms regulator called the “100m mobiles club”, joining Russia (130m in February), Japan (141m in January), the US (170m in January) and China.

659;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-06-21T09:29:16Z;Wireless networks: City-wide hotspots increase options;;Cities across the world are racing to establish a “network” of hotspots that allow business people on the move to connect to the internet – using technology that was never designed for city-wide networking.It will not be long before workers will be able to connect anywhere, any time and this extra mobility could force businesses to see themselves differently.“Technology is ahead of people’s ability to use it,” says Chris Bray, a solutions executive at IBM. “To take full advantage companies will have to think and work differently.”The technology in question is Wi-Fi, or wireless networking. It is popular because the equipment is cheap, operators do not need a licence, and almost every laptop being sold is Wi-Fi capable.It is already widely used by companies – 91 per cent of businesses have installed it or are planning to, according to Gartner, the research company. It is also common in homes, airports, hotels, cafés and bars.But now cities are getting in on the act: two of the first networks, in Philadelphia and Tempe, Arizona, are being completed this year. Soon, almost every big city from San Francisco to London to Singapore will have city-wide networks.This is in spite of the fact that under normal operation, Wi-Fi signals have a maximum range of about 90 metres and can be hampered by stone walls, concrete floors, trees and rain. It therefore works best in a single office building or campus.The fear is, that with expectations raised so high, the city networks may disappoint. “Most often politicians get hold of the idea and say they can offer free access to citizens,” says Ian Keene, research VP at Gartner. And although these networks will be low-cost and effective, they may not offer the quality of broadband that users are used to.To keep costs down and avoid cabling, many of the networks, such as the one in Tempe, use a technology called “mesh”, where each Wi-Fi hotspot transfers data from adjacent hotspots. When working properly, mesh networks should be robust and “self-healing” with signals routed around any problems.However, the technology is new and there are differing views of how best to implement it so that networks do not fail under the weight of their own traffic. Currently “mesh” is not an industry-wide standard – discussions to standardise it only began in June 2005 and are unlikely to be completed for years.To address some of the shortcomings of Wi-Fi a new technology, WiMAX, is being introduced. It is more suitable for outdoor use, has a range of several miles and can be used in licensed radio spectrum, ensuring it does not suffer the interference problems of Wi-Fi. This also makes WiMAX suitable for critical business use.In particular, it can link hotspot networks, such as the one in Tokyo where a planned 30,000 hotspots will be linked by 3,000 WiMAX base stations, says Paul Senior, vice-president of Airspan, a maker of WiMAX equipment.Because WiMAX guarantees transmission quality and availability, it can increase the reliability of hotspots. This means high-quality voice over Wi-Fi might be possible.Another feature of WiMAX is that it allows different levels of service to different clients, says Graham Currier, Director of Wireless at Pipex Communications, which owns some of the radio spectrum for WiMAX in the UK. This allows operators to charge clients different rates depending on the service they require.Many mobile phone operators already own spectrum that could be used for WiMAX and they have the masts on which WiMAX base stations could be deployed.Fortunately, WiMAX and cellular networks do not necessarily interfere with each other, so operators such as Vodafone, have started to adopt WiMAX to provide capacity to Wi-Fi hotspots and link to their own networks.Although WiMAX is today of interest mainly to telecoms companies and businesses, by the end of this year devices will be available that will allow laptops to connect directly to WiMAX networks that adhere to the “mobile WiMAX” standard.Next year, laptops and other mobile devices with integrated WiMAX will be available. Dan Coombes, Motorola Networks senior vice-president, predicts that 10m WiMAX laptops will ship in 2008.This means that in areas away from urban centres, where Wi-Fi hotspots are few and far between, WiMAX can fill in the gaps. Often, users will have a choice of networks, either Wi-Fi, which can handle higher data rates, or WiMAX, which is slower, but has guaranteed service levels.In parallel with these, there are the GSM, 3G and CDMA mobile phone networks. These can offer connectivity without the quality of service problems that Wi-Fi networks have. They are also available in many remote areas.End-users will, therefore, have choices. The technology to enable some of that choice is already available. For example, Vodafone is making available network cards and phones in Germany that allow users to choose between its own mobile phone network or a Wi-Fi hotspot.Users can choose the most appropriate network and be charged a corresponding rate. For example, most business users choose the 3G network simply because it is more convenient, says Alan Harper, Group Strategy Director at Vodafone.
660;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-05-30T17:15:30Z;Stopping your network from catching a cold;;Traditionally, companies have protected their computers from attack by using firewalls that stop unauthorised access to the network. But what about the dangers from authorised access?All good IT managers control their PCs with an iron fist, ensuring that they are up to date with the latest anti-virus and anti-spyware patches, for example. But mobile employees who leave the building with company laptops take those computers outside of the IT department’s control, meaning that they could be compromised.People reconnecting to the network, either over a secure link from outside the office or by plugging a laptop back into the network, may be authorised, but the IT managers cannot be sure that their PCs are totally clean. Operating system patches may not have been applied, anti-virus updates may be out of date, or unauthorised software may have been installed.This means that mobile employees and visitors to the company connecting their laptops to the network can pollute the whole system with worms and viruses. Gartner Group research director Lawrence Orans recounts a story told to him by a client about a visiting photocopier repair engineer. Connecting his laptop into the corporate network to download a software patch from the internet, he became infected by a worm which then spread to the rest of the network.Companies are working together to solve the problem using technology that vets computers before they are allowed to access company resources. Quarantine technologies detect when a machine tries to connect to the network and scans the PC to ensure that it is up-to-date with antivirus signatures, and patches to operating systems and applications.Network equipment company Cisco has led the field with its Network Access Control technology. It uses a software agent installed on a PC to verify that the machine is safe. Administrators can set policies that send non-compliant machines to a cordoned-off part of the network. That subnetwork might allow them to surf the internet, but might not let them near the company’s other computers.Cisco is working with industry partners selling anti-virus and configuration management software, so that their products can be used to bring non-compliant computers up to date before allowing them back on to the company network.“The whole idea of NAC is to prevent infections from spreading to other machines on the network. It’s about reducing all of the costs and the business disruptions,” says Philippe Roggeband, product manager at Cisco.Microsoft has been slower on the uptake. The company shipped an early quarantine technology called Network Access Quarantine Control in Windows Server 2003, but it only supported remote connections, rather than laptops connecting inside a company’s network.The company originally planned to ship its newer quarantine technology, the Network Access Protocol, in an update to its Windows 2003 server towards the end of last year. It then delayed the technology until its next major version upgrade.Now, the first version of desktop windows to support NAP will be the Vista PC operating system, which is supposed to ship in November this year. But the technology requires a server operating system to support it, which will not arrive until the Longhorn Server operating system is available in market-ready form later next year. By the time companies decide to take the plunge, it could well be 2008 before Microsoft NAP is used in anger.The third major piece in this puzzle is the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), which has formed the Trusted Network Connect (TNC) working group. This initiative pulls together multiple industry partners to produce a standard for network quarantining technology.How the technologies will work together is not yet defined.Another part of the quarantining movement are virtual operating systems on PCs that run simultaneously alongside each other. Users can switch between the two without having to restart their computers, enabling employees to use one operating system at home and another “clean” system when connecting to the network.Overall, network quarantining is available, but companies are still waiting for standards to settle down. Once that happens, the average corporate network could be a safer place.
661;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-05-30T17:15:30Z;Wi-Fi creates new vulnerability;;"Wireless networks are growing fast. “I have seen Wi-Fi roll out aggressively for years and problems with security standards don’t seem to slow it down,” says John Girard, of consultancy Gartner.“Only 9 per cent of our clients say they have no plans to implement wireless Lans.”Growing just as fast as the wireless networks, however, are fears over its security.Kaspersky Lab, a security consultancy, believes the large number of open networks based on Wi-Fi, a wireless networking standard, could lead to a new generation of computer viruses that use these networks to propagate.And SecureTest, another consultancy, believes it is relatively easy to hijack a series of laptops through an insecure Wi-Fi connection.Guarding against attacks in this fast-changing environment depends on management and processes as much as on technology.Measures are being taken, however. Since March 13, all products certified as “Wi-Fi” have had to incorporate a security specification called Wi-Fi Protected Access 2, or WPA2.Although WPA2 is far more secure than previous Wi-Fi based security, there may still be vulnerabilities, depending on how it is configured, says Mr Girard.While the encryption of data ensures that it cannot be eavesdropped on by crackers, authentication and authorisation of users connecting to the network might pose problems.For example, one version of the WPA2 specification, called “Personal”, is easy to set up, but it uses authentication “keys” that could pose a security risk.A second, more secure, version called “Enterprise” employs a range of complex identification mechanisms to be used through a centralised Extensible Authorisation Protocol or “EAP” server.Properly configured, it could be almost impregnable but is far harder to implement. EAP-based security does not necessarily depend on use of WPA2 but running an EAP server could stretch the capabilities of many small businesses.For those companies that have Wi-Fi installations, switching all their equipment to WPA2 is an expensive option: “We’re advising our clients to move to WPA2 where they can,” says Mr Girard, “but always follow best practice.”One option is to have employees connect to the Wi-Fi network through virtual private networks that terminate at the corporate firewall. These are secure “tunnels” for transmitting data through the insecure internet or a Wi-Fi network.“That’s a solid solution,” says James Walker, Product Manager at ZyXel, the equipment maker.Different users could be put on separate “virtual” networks allowing them the right type of access privileges depending on their security level. The technology to do this is widely available.Because WPA2-Enterprise is an implementation of a standard called 802.1x, which concerns networking security as a whole, whether wired or wireless, businesses can develop a holistic view of security.Kail Krall, Global Mobility Product Manager at HP’s ProCurve Networking division, says companies should control who, how and when any part of the network is accessed.“Security should be viewed in layers,” says Richard Edgar, Global Product Manager for Wireless at 3com, the networking company. Hence, each part of the network can allow different levels of access depending on the security level of the user.Wi-Fi security can also be configured in this way. For example, a network administrator could allow visitors to the office access to the Wi-Fi network so they can surf the internet and check their
e-mail, but forbid them access to corporate systems.This layered view also helps to deal with a range of network security issues. For example, employees might install a rogue Wi-Fi access point for their own convenience, not realising they are offering crackers a way into the corporate network."
662;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-05-23T18:27:31Z;Key Microsoft products on target;;Microsoft on Tuesday moved to restore faith in its ability to launch key products on schedule, releasing second test versions of its Windows Vista operating system, Office 2007 programs suite and Windows Longhorn Server software.Announcing the Beta 2 versions at a conference in Seattle, Bill Gates, chairman, said it was the first time there had been such a synchronised release of “the three most important Microsoft products.”“Today’s a milestone for us in terms of the huge investment and big innovation going into the next major version of Windows and all of the complementary products,” he said.Analysts had begun to doubt whether Microsoft could stick to a new deadline it set itself in March of shipping Vista on new PCs from January 2007. It had earlier targeted a November release after failing to get the new operating system ready by 2005.Microsoft had promised the second beta would be available before the end of June, prompting the Gartner research firm to warn earlier this month that this did not leave enough time to test such a complex piece of software. It predicted PC buyers would have to wait until at least next March to get Vista. But this May release appears to give Microsoft more breathing room to get the software right before it is released for manufacturing.“Not only are we happy we are hitting our targets on schedule, but this gives our corporate customers the chance to get a sense of how all three of these work together,” said Neil Charney, senior director of the Windows client group.Mr Charney said half a million IT and corporate customers had been testing exisiting betas and the new test version would be distributed more widely to include technology enthusiasts.During the conference, new features were demonstrated including the ability of laptops with wi-fi cards to exchange files with one another, without the need for a wireless network. They could also send presentations to a wireless projector.Microsoft shares closed 0.4 per cent lower in New York at $22.79.
663;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-05-18T21:03:40Z;Micron claims high-definition sensor breakthrough;;Micron, the imaging and memory chip maker, has announced a breakthrough in enabling high-definition video and pictures on smaller, faster chips.The technology being used is CMOS - complementary metal-oxide semiconductor - which has been long associated with relatively low quality images compared to those of charge-coupled devices or CCDs preferred in digital cameras and camcorders.But Micron said it had produced the world’s smallest 8-megapixel image sensor, capable of taking 10 pictures a second at that resolution and 30 pictures at a 2 megapixel resolution.“Micron has done really really well in the mobile phone market with CMOS, but then you have the digital still cameras dominated 90 per cent by Japanese CCDs,” said Chris Chute digital imaging analyst with the IDC research firm.“In the middle, you have the camcorder market, which is lower volume and higher selling price. There is a lot of interest in adding new features and I see [the new chip] playing there in the short term.”The image sensor market was worth $5.9bn in 2005 - the first year that CMOS image sensors overtook CCD image sensors in terms of revenue, according to the Gartner research firm.The market for CMOS image sensors has been driven by strong growth in the camera phone market and Gartner expects that it will grow from $3.1bn in 2005 to $6.1bn in 2010.“The digital still camera market and the digital video camera market are really the last strongholds for CCD image sensors,” said Jon Erensen, semiconductor analyst with Gartner“Micron’s announcement signifies their intention to challenge CCD image sensors for dominance in the mainstream point-and-shoot and prosumer digital still camera market,” he said.The high-end of this market should be at 8 megapixels next year. Micron is planning to go into production in the first quarter of 2007.Mr Erensen said Micron had made the important breakthrough of reducing the pixel size to squeeze 8 megapixels onto the popular form factor for mainstream digital cameras. CMOS also represented a lower-cost option than CCD as it needed fewer associated components.
664;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-05-14T22:01:23Z;Investors expect to see HP advance;;Hewlett-Packard’s rivals will be keeping a close watch on the number two US computer maker as it reports its second-quarter results on Tuesday.Investors expect evidence that HP has stolen a march on Dell, its chief rival in the personal computer market, which last week warned it would miss earnings forecasts for the third time in four quarters. Dell reports quarterly results on Thursday.Martin Reynolds, analyst at Gartner, said: “If HP continues to grow at a rate it grew in Q1, it could overtake Dell as the largest PC maker in the world by next year.” However, he cautioned that this was unlikely.HP may also pass International Business Machines to become the world’s biggest technology group by sales. HP’s sales last year of $87bn ranked second in the sector, just behind IBM’s $91bn.The company has regained momentum after weak sales, low morale and a loss of focus led it to languish under Carly Fiorina, his predecessor.Shares in HP have risen more than 60 per cent since Mark Hurd, HP’s chief executive, took charge a little over a year ago and launched a $1.9bn cost- cutting drive.Now, the focus has turned from cost-cutting to growth.HP has remained cool on suggestions that it should consider selling its low-margin PC business in order to boost profitability.Todd Bradley, the head of HP’s personal computer group, said in spite of a slower overall PC market, “our numbers are very strong”.Along with healthy growth in notebook sales last quarter, “our media centre PC is clearly showing growth,” he said. “We are also working on desktops tailored to work environments. I don’t think we’re giving up on the desktop yet.”Ann Livermore, head of HP’s enterprise computing division, said the PC business gave her business unit greater power in its relationships with suppliers.“The lowest end servers are basically PCs that stand on their side,” she said. “The components are the same and the distribution channels are the same.”HP has not indicated an interest in big acquisitions to boost growth. Mr Hurd told a panel in February that the company remained focused on smaller “digestible” deals.But some bankers believe Mr Hurd may be interested in using some of HP’s $13bn cash pile to make a multi- billion dollar acquisition this year – perhaps in software or mobility.
665;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-05-10T15:42:51Z;A costly game of cat and mouse;;"Online banking has been one of the biggest success stories of the internet, with 40m users in the US, and 15m in the UK. In addition to ease of use, it has saved banks millions by reducing the need for branch staff.But along with the efficiencies and cost-savings have come rich pickings for criminals.Phishing – a tactic used by identity thieves to trick internet users into giving out bank details and other sensitive information – has fooled an estimated 2.42m Americans, costing them $929m, according to analyst firm Gartner. In the UK, payments group Apacs says online banking fraud doubled last year to £23.2m.“The growth in online banking fraud over the past three years has been significant and there’s no getting away from the fact that fraudsters see it as an opportunity,” says Kate Brown, senior manager, risk and compliance, internet channel at UK bank Lloyds TSB.More than 2m Lloyds TSB customers have signed up to internet banking, but there is still a proportion that is nervous due to security concerns, she says.Research by analyst firm Forrester claims 600,000 of the UK’s 15m online banking customers have deserted the internet, because of concerns about phishing and keystroke logging software.But financial institutions are fighting back: in Hong Kong it is mandatory for banks to offer security devices to internet customers; in the US, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council has issued guidance requiring all internet banks to authenticate customers better.By issuing customers with a key-ring-sized device that generates a unique passcode every 30 to 60 seconds, banks are trying to render the stealing of passwords and log-on details useless. Even if criminals trick customers into revealing log-on details they still need the passcode from the physical device to enter the site and carry out transactions, says Ms Brown.A six month trial by Lloyds TSB, using devices from Vasco, eliminated online banking fraud among 23,500 customers, she says.Lloyds TSB is not the only bank using technologies – such as tokens, biometrics, smart cards, cookies and scratch-off cards – to authenticate customers, says Clive Longbottom, head of research for analyst Quocirca.HSBC has been trialling two-factor authentication devices in Hong Kong and Brazil and last month announced it would issue 180,000 tokens to UK business customers. German banking customers have been using one-time passwords for more than a decade and less hi-tech scratch-off cards have been used by banks such as Nordea in Scandinavia for years.But Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at Finnish IT security company F-Secure, says that two-factor authentication is not foolproof in the fight against criminals.“These guys do this for a living and make a lot of money out it. They can invest time to figure out what banks are doing and find ways around safeguards. It’s a game of cat and mouse,” he says.Criminals are developing new methods, such as “session hijacking malware” and “man-in-the-middle” attacks, where hackers intercept online banking data by sending customers to replica sites. While customers enter details, a software program automatically contacts the real site, logs on, steals financial information and transfers money.“At the moment the bad guys are still finding easy targets. They are going after the cars without the car alarms. But we are going to see more sophisticated attacks sooner or later,” says Mr Hyppönen.In the meantime, Bank of America and UK bank Alliance & Leicester are working with IT company PassMark to stop the criminals. In addition to using a cookie to authenticate a particular computer, internet banking customers also choose a personalised image when they register. By showing the image each time a person logs on, the bank is authenticating itself to the customer making them less likely to fall prey to criminals’ spoof websites or man-in-the middle attacks.“The problem behind phishing isn’t the failure of the user, it is the failure of the banks to authenticate themselves properly to customers,” says Mr Hyppönen."
666;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-05-10T09:06:45Z;Cash is the enemy of the card issuers;;Payment card issuers are waging war on cash by introducing contactless cards for low-value transactions.Purchases are made using a contactless card by placing it within a few centimetres of a card reader, which uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to extract data.Since a signature or personal identity number is not required for most small purchases, transactions can be carried out rapidly – without necessarily removing the card from a wallet.Consumers in the UK make about 27bn cash transactions a year, worth £250bn, and about 80 per cent of these are for purchases of less than £10, according to Visa International estimates.“Card issuers are aggressively trying to increase the size of their market, and the enemy is cash,” says Christophe Uzureau, a banking analyst at research house Gartner.“They want to replace as many cash transactions as possible with card transactions, so they can earn fees.”Contactless payment cards have already been successfully implemented in transport systems, notably the Octopus card in Hong Kong and the Oyster card in London, and both Mastercard’s PayPass and Visa’s Contactless systems have been piloted in the US.JP Morgan Chase has also issued more than 6m credit and debit cards which include contactless technology under the name “blink”.The blink system uses the existing Visa and Mastercard infrastructure to authorise payments, and at many retailers a signature is not required for transactions of less than $25. American Express has also introduced its ExpressPay contactless system on some Blue American Express cards.Although card companies are driving the adoption of contactless technology, it offers significant benefits to retailers, such as fast food outlets and convenience stores, where typical transaction values are low. These include higher transaction speeds, increased transaction values, and lower cash handling costs.“We’ve found that transactions carried out using blink are three to five seconds faster than credit card transactions, and seven to nine seconds faster than cash transactions,” says Rob Williams, controller at The Bailey Co, parent company of Arby’s, a fast food restaurant chain based in the US.He adds: “This means each Arby’s employee can get more customers through per hour, so we get higher productivity.”Mr Williams has found that customers spend about 50 per cent more when they use a contactless card than when they pay for their food with cash: “I think it is psychological: because customers are not pulling cash out of their wallet, they spend more.” Arby’s has also made productivity gains with less time being spent on counting money and taking it to the bank, Mr Williams says.Another benefit to retailers is that cards allow them to capture data about their customers from small transactions.“If contactless cards offer merchants better information on their customers, that could prove to be valuable,” says Mr Uzureau.So far, Europe has lagged behind the US in the introduction of contactless payment cards, although Royal Bank of Scotland plans to run limited trials of MasterCard’s PayPass system in the UK this summer. Visa also plans a trial of its Visa Contactless later in the year.In the US, each transaction is authorised online just like a credit or debit card transaction, but in the UK transactions under £10 will usually be “offline” – the card will interact with the card reader, but the authorisation process will be skipped – making them even faster. To provide security, shoppers must enter a Pin after a set number of offline transactions.Mr Uzureau warns that although lowering the security requirements for contactless transactions may make them faster, this risks scaring off security-conscious users. But with a Pin-free transaction limit of just £10 they are unlikely to be big targets for criminals.Debit cards accounted for more retail spending than cash last year for the first time in the UK, according to payments association Apacs.If contactless cards prove successful, paying cash may soon be a thing of the past.
667;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-05-03T22:55:12Z;EDS not out of the woods despite profits;;A day after Electronic Data Systems reported a sixfold increase in quarterly profits, its shares tumbled almost 6 per cent, underscoring the challenges facing the IT outsourcing group as it begins to emerge from a painful three-year shake-up.When Michael Jordan took over as chief executive three years ago, EDS was in dire straits. The company, which was spun out of General Motors, the US automaker, in 1996, was struggling against low morale and the spiralling cost of administering a huge contract to provide IT services to the US Navy.Soon after he took charge, Mr Jordan brought in new management talent, launched a cost-cutting drive and set about improving relationships with some of the company’s key clients. But the troubles continued, particularly in the UK.In January 2004 it lost a long-running £3bn ($5.5bn) contract to run IT services for the Inland Revenue. It later found itself embroiled in a lawsuit with the National Health Service after the health provider scrapped a £90m e-mail deal with the company.But by early this year, Mr Jordan’s efforts had begun to pay off. In February, he pronounced EDS’s turnround complete, and said the company would focus its efforts on margin improvements and revenue growth.His performance has won plaudits, even among sceptics. “Mike Jordan and his management team have lived up to every promise they made,” says Allie Young, an analyst at Gartner.But EDS is not out of the woods yet. Profits were slim last quarter – just $24m on more than $5bn in sales – and while Mr Jordan has dealt with the contracts that had threatened to sink it, EDS has yet to catch up with IBM, its bigger US rival.Although EDS, whose clients include the UK’s Ministry of Defence, saw a sharp pick-up in new business in the period, including an extension of the Navy contract and several billion dollars of new business from GM, changes in the way big institutions are structuring IT contracts mean that companies such as EDS can expect fewer multi-billion dollar “mega deals” in the future.“[Big institutions] want more control,” says Nick Nilarp, an analyst at Fitch Ratings. “They want to do [contracts] piecemeal with various companies and on shorter timeframes.”Not all analysts view this as a disadvantage. “Mega deals are hard for providers to make profitable,” says Ms Young. “When you win a smaller deal, you get a more manageable piece of business.”A bigger challenge for EDS may be more competition for IT contracts from outsourcing groups in countries, such as India, with a much lower cost base.Mr Nilarp argues that new growth should help companies such as EDS and IBM keep pace with the upstarts that have begun to eat into US outsourcing groups’ traditional business – a sentiment Mr Jordan seems to share.EDS has moved to address the threat by building up EDS’s Indian presence. Earlier this year, it said it would take a majority stake in MphasiS, an Indian outsourcing group.EDS has also been investing heavily in its global IT network to improve the efficiency of its internal teams.Mr Jordan says the company is moving from developing new technologies and systems to implementing them. But it may be some time before EDS can reveal whether those investments will generate the profits and margin improvements investors are looking for.
668;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-05-02T22:09:49Z;Windows Vista set for ‘further delays’;;The complex testing that still needs to be carried out on the next version of Windows means the computer operating system is likely to be hit by further delays before it finally goes on sale next year, Gartner, the technology research firm, said on Tuesday.The warning from one of the most influential firms in its field comes little more than a month after Microsoft conceded the most recent slip in its timetable, saying that Windows Vista would not now go on sale in new PCs until January and so miss the important holiday shopping season for consumers.The software will be made available to big companies that have volume license agreements with Microsoft later this year, according to the company.According to Gartner, however, PC buyers will not be able to buy Windows Vista until at least March next year, and possibly not until June.“We respectfully disagree with Gartner’s views around timing of the final delivery of Windows Vista,” a spokesperson for Microsoft said, adding that the software would be completed on time.David Smith, a Gartner analyst, said that Microsoft’s repeated failure to hit earlier deadlines with Vista was one of the factors that the research firm weighed when coming to its latest prediction on timing.“They firmly believe they’ll get it done on time – but, until a month ago, they firmly believed they’d get it done by the end of the year,” he said.Microsoft has said it will release the second beta, or test, version of its software before the end of June, leaving a period of about five months of testing and de-bugging before its planned “release to manufacture” date – the moment the software is given to PC makers.That schedule does not leave enough time to test such a complex piece of software with all the many applications that will run on it, Mr Smith warned. By comparison, the second test phase of Windows 2000, the last major revamp of the operating system, took 16 months.
669;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-04-11T17:49:02Z;E-mail - is it out of control?;;"E-mail was never designed for most of today’s purposes, yet it is the internet’s most enduring “killer application”. We can’t live without it, but we can’t manage it either. What are the alternatives, and why aren’t we using them yet?In 2003 researchers at Xerox PARC observed staff in three organisations and noticed it had become the “habitat” of choice for most knowledge workers, who used it as their main tool for scheduling, collaborating, and transferring files. They concluded it was so overloaded and so widely co-opted for inappropriate uses that “serial-killer application” would be a better description.It is hard to believe, but it is almost 40 years old. Unsurprisingly it has shortcomings: spam, security, archiving and asynchronicity being just a few. Yet it is still the tool most people use to communicate and collaborate at work. For its billion or more users, part of its enduring attraction is its flexibility and informality, says Nikos Drakos, a research director at Gartner, the IT research group. “People can use e-mail to reach anyone. When they’re making it available, they have a degree of control that says ‘I will only make it available to you and you’ – it’s a kind of access control mechanism. And it’s semi-private.”But the advantages have also led to over-use. Most people use it for tasks for which it was never intended – filing, planning, collaborating and sharing knowledge. The prediliction for using e-mail in this way has led to concerns about knowledge being “trapped in e-mail”.Few would claim it is the perfect tool for communications. But although the over-use phenomenon was first noticed at least 10 years ago, attempts to improve it, or develop alternatives – and, importantly, to get people to use them – have proved difficult.Arduous legal and regulatory record-keeping requirements have made it inevitable that archiving has been one of the big growth areas in e-mail management. Spam and viruses have also been a significant distraction but the consensus is that filtering technologies are now effective enough for most organisations to protect their staff from excessive spam.And although its use is growing unabated (IDC estimated 22,000bn messages will be sent this year, compared with 19,000bn last year) growth in spam as a proportion of the total is slowing. Instead, it is “occupational spam” – legitimate messages that are unnecessary, unclear, or too widely circulated – that has become the scourge of knowledge workers.Individual habits can go some way towards reducing occupational spam. On the recipient’s side, filters can be used to direct certain types of messages automatically – such as those that are meant for someone else and only copied – into specific mailboxes. A popular list of tactics for both recipients and senders, written by Stever Robbins, a Harvard Business School graduate, makes suggestions such as writing detailed subject lines; judicious forwarding and limiting the checking of e-mail to several times a day.But people are slow to change their habits. Nicolas Ducheneaut and Victoria Bellotti, two Xerox PARC researchers, found that even filters and search functions – features that have long been included in widely-used programs such as Microsoft Outlook – were used by only a minority because many people simply did not understand how they worked.Similarly, the longer people used it, the more likely they were to organise e-mails into folders, despite this being a fairly inefficient measure.Mr Drakos recommends the use of filters and good etiquette, but says the scope for solving overload is limited. “The main thing is to stop using e-mail for things it’s not meant for,” he says.The recent history of collaboration software is littered with examples of large, sophisticated and often expensive tools that seek to sideline e-mail and address “knowledge management” or “content management”. Mr Drakos says some of these have been less useful than hoped because staff simply continue to use e-mail for its informality and relative privacy (although he adds that the alternative tools can still often prove useful for record management and legislative compliance).Michael Muller, a scientist with IBM’s Watson Research Center, has been involved in numerous projects to design and test ways of collaborating. Mr Muller, an expert in “participatory design” with a PhD in cognitive psychology, recalls an early attempt at a replacement called the Coordinator.“The idea was to allow people to negotiate commitments: who would do what, and when,” he says.But it didn’t work, partly because it only provided for the formalised: “will you do this?”; “yes I will”; etc. It did not allow people to say “how are your children?” or “it’s a nice day today”.More recently, he was also involved in testing ActivityExplorer, an IBM product that supports collaboration linked to different messages, files and other objects, and attempts to offer a user-friendly alternative.The programme was envisaged as supporting projects lasting a week, but a group of 33 interns who used it over 15 weeks surprised Mr Muller and his colleagues.“By usage, they showed us things we never imagined. In part, in addition to these week-long projects there were also lunch dates, but also huge long threads of complex things that lasted for months…some were social and some of them were very work-related.”One development in e-mail’s recent history has been the huge popularity of mobile “push” e-mail, to which hordes of BlackBerry-addicted executives can attest. The phenomenon is so great that Microsoft is looking at software to support similar devices.This mobile migration also puts e-mail on a platform where it is competing with two very well-known alternatives – voice and instant messaging, the latter of which has already become a popular alternative on the desktop in many organisations.In fact, as people become contacted more frequently wherever they are – via mobile phones, BlackBerries and instant messaging – some researchers have concluded that the accompanying disruptions are reducing efficiency and increasing stress.Other researchers believe, on the other hand, that younger people are less bothered by this. IDC found e-mail is still more widely used than instant messaging (IM), but teenagers and young people in fast-paced work environments use IM more than e-mail. This could point to a trend towards younger staff pushing the adoption of communication and collaboration technologies inside the enterprise.“You get the new generation coming in and saying ‘I can be so productive with this’,” says Jane Gately, chief information officer at Ernst & Young.Ms Gately says this began with the mobile phone, but lately the BlackBerry has been one of the biggest examples. “BlackBerry is so much more – a consumer product that has hit the heart of the organisation, that has made a difference. The BlackBerry showed us that this trend exists, and to get comfortable with it.”While email being squeezed by newer communications technologies such as IM, there is another more powerful shift taking place in collaboration technology that could be the turning point for e-mail use as we know it – and one that might, finally, address the gap between the informality of e-mail and the formality of high-end knowledge management and collaboration suites.For example, wikis (websites that anyone can edit) are becoming a popular tool for collaborating on documents, while more executives are blogging to improve relations with staff and customers. Social networking tools, similar to those used in MySpace and Friendster, are being used to map “communities of practice” and identify areas of expertise within organisations.Samuel Aparicio, director of product management at Angel.com, a call centre systems provider, says the switch to wikis helps managers and executives keep in touch with projects “without being CC-ed to death” on every minute detail or change. Instant messaging, he says, also takes the load off e-mail. “IM allows for the more ethereal conversations to happen, from the trivial “Are you free for lunch?” to the urgent “Is anybody experiencing difficulties accessing this system?”The two biggest workplace e-mail vendors, IBM/Lotus and Microsoft, are moving quickly to develop new collaborative tools or, where necessary, adopt approaches such as wikis.Microsoft in late 2003 hired Ward Cunningham, the inventor of wikis, for a two-year stint and is expecting to introduce some wiki functionality in Office 2007, due for release in this year. IBM is also researching technologies such as wikis and social bookmarking, alongside its own functions such as ActivityExplorer, the software tested by Mr Muller and his colleagues.But far from turning their back on e-mail, many are looking at ways of enhancing it and using it more intelligently. Microsoft is developing tools that can monitor usage to determine whether each message is important enough to interrupt the recipient with an alert, and some smaller vendors have developed software to extract information from observing patterns of use, such as Morphix in the UK, whose software maps areas of expertise and interest among staff.Socialtext, which sells the wiki software used by Angel.com and is one of the more successful companies developing social, web-based tools for enterprise use, consistently reduces e-mail volumes by about a third, says Ross Mayfield, chief executive. At the same time, one of the selling points of Socialtext’s wiki software is that it can capture content within messages and store them within a wiki.“Over time, it will probably reduce e-mail traffic because people will have discussion groups in different types of software, or they’ll use IM,” says Chris Harris, a principal analyst at Ovum. “But the amount of communication is going to carry on rising.”"
670;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-04-05T19:59:56Z;Mac software gives users Windows access;;Apple Computer on Wednesday took aim at the mainstream personal computer market by introducing software that will allow customers to run Microsoft‘s Windows XP operating system on Macintosh computers.The move represents a challenge to PC rivals such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Lenovo, whose computers already run on the Microsoft operating system.It also marks a new chapter in the relationship between Apple and Microsoft, whose software rivalry took centre stage in the early days of the personal computer in the 1980s.Microsoft’s decision in the 1980s to license its DOS operating system to IBM and other PC makers led it to become the default choice for most computer users, while relegating Apple to a niche market of creative users.Windows powers more than 90 per cent of the world’s PCs, while Apple’s OS X proprietary system has just 2-4 per cent of the market.Michael Gartenberg at Jupiter Research said Apple’s announcement represented a “bold tactical move” to gain market share from PC rivals.”The Dells and the HPs of this world have never had to compete directly with Apple,” said Paul Jackson at Forrester Research. “Now they’re faced with Apple selling what are effectively Wintel [Windows/Intel] boxes.”However, some analysts cautioned that any gains for Apple were likely to be incremental.“Unless…OS X is [already] more appealing to you, you are probably not going to run out and buy a Mac,” said Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner. “For one thing, they’re more expensive.”Although Apple’s proprietary software platform has attracted a loyal cult following, its limited audience has long been seen as one of the key hurdles to mainstream success for the computer maker.Apple made the new software - called Boot Camp - available for download on Wednesday. The software, which will run on Macs powered by Intel chips, will be incorporated into an updated OS X due to be released later this year.Apple indicated on Wednesday that it intended to maintain a healthy distance from Windows in spite of the move.“Apple has no desire or plan to sell or support Windows, but many customers have expressed their interest to run Windows on Apple’s superior hardware now that we use Intel processors,” said Philip Schiller, vice president of marketing at Apple.In New York, Apple’s shares ended the day nearly 10 per cent higher at $67.21.
671;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-04-02T21:01:34Z;Intel seeks out fresh markets;;"Intel has begun a global push to sell its computer processors in emerging markets as the world’s biggest chipmaker searches for fresh areas for growth.Paul Otellini, chief executive, toured Latin America last week and unveiled a low-cost notebook computer in presentations in Argentina and Brazil. In Mexico, he introduced a cheap desktop computer that would be produced in partnership with local manufacturers.In addition, Intel launched a rugged Community PC platform last week to serve villages in India and held talks in Ghana on introducing low-cost computers there.Intel is describing the effort as its “Discover the PC” initiative “to make the benefits of PC technology more available to people in developing nations”.It amounts to the biggest push to date by its Channel Products group, formed in January last year to address emerging markets. Intel also created Digital Home and Digital Health divisions at the same time, to explore opportunities in those areas and offset slowing growth in its main PC business.“[Emerging markets] are a promising area for growth in terms of the numbers of people involved. The more technology we provide, the more people get engaged in technology and the more this takes off,” said Tom Beerman, Intel spokesman.Martin Reynolds, Gartner analyst, says that, while the move is significant, Intel’s main challenge is persuading users in developed economies to keep replacing their PCs.“Emerging markets are becoming important. Intel is preparing people there for a PC world; they’ve been pushing low-cost processors in developed markets for years and here they are also introducing them so they can get that next sale, when people get their second PC,” he says.Intel has been seeding emerging markets with investments and education initiatives. It is spending $100m a year on education projects overseas and announced a $50m venture capital fund in Brazil last week.It launched a $200m VC fund in China last year and has introduced an iCafé platform for easy upgrades of PCs in internet cafés there.Intel is also taking advantage of lower costs of manufacturing in emerging markets. In February, it said it would build a testing and assembly plant in Vietnam, joining others in Costa Rica, China, Malaysia and the Philippines."
672;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-03-28T23:35:56Z;Apple Computer loses technology chief;;Apple Computer announced that Avadis “Avie” Tevanian, its chief technology officer and the brains behind its OS X operating system, would leave the company at the end of the month.Mr Tevanian, who joined Apple almost ten years ago from NeXT, the computer company Steve Jobs founded after he was forced out as Apple’s chief executive in 1985, was leaving to pursue “other interests”.The company did not name a replacement.“I think this is going to be a loss for Apple,” said Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner.Mr Tevanian will become the second top executive to leave Apple just days before the company’s 30th birthday on April 1. Jon Rubinstein, the head of Apple’s iPod division, had previously announced plans to retire on March 31.The departures come at a sensitive time for Apple, which is under pressure to build on the success of its blockbuster iPod personal music player franchise.The company is also trying to carve out new market share for its core Macintosh computer brand after it introduced the first Macs powered by Intel microchips earlier this year. A new verison of the Mac operating system is due out this year.Meanwhile, Apple was yesterday preparing for the latest round in a long-running legal dispute with Apple Corps, the Beatles holding company, over the use of the Apple name.The companies will appear in a UK court today to argue about whether Apple’s iTunes music store violates a 1991 settlement that predated both iTunes and the internet, in which Apple agreed that it would not use its logo in connection with music distribution. ITunes recently passed the 1bn song downloads mark.Shares in Apple fell 1.3 per cent to $58.71.
673;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-03-23T01:14:26Z;Dell seals its first deal for PC rival;;Dell, the world’s biggest personal computer maker, on Wednesday announced the first aqcuisition of a PC rival in its 22-year history, with a deal to buy Alienware, a maker of souped-up computer systems for gaming enthusiasts and other power users.Alienware, known as a provider of high-performance, “bleeding-edge” computer systems, will operate as an independent unit within Dell, retaining separate development, marketing and customer service operations.Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner, said the move was uncharacteristic of Dell, which has built its business by selling mass-market PCs directly to customers over the telephone and internet.“This is a bit of a different spin from them,” said Mr Baker. “They are not buying volume, but what it does give them is a very profitable PC line. We’re talking $3,500 to $4,000 PCs in a segment of the market that is always willing to pay top dollar for the best possible performance.”Kevin Rollins, Dell’s chief executive, has acknowledged that the company needed to be “bolder” in order to regain investor confidence after it missed sales targets in two successive quarters last year – a slip it blamed in part on an overly aggressive shift towards lower-end PCs.Dell said on Wednesday that the acquisition would “satisfy the growing number of consumers and businesses seeking the highest-performance PC products”.Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Alienware had sales last year of $170m.Dell said Alienware, which has also based its business on a direct sales model, would continue to use its own manufacturing facilities, but would be able to take advantage of the purchasing power of its new parent.
674;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-03-07T16:38:52Z;Defragmenting of the industry gathers pace;;The wave of industry consolidation that has been a feature of enterprise software has begun to reach the mid market.Time was when small and mid-sized companies wanting enterprise resource planning software would have rarely looked beyond a mid-sized software company.While there is a global market for ERP in the enterprise, the mid-market remains highly fragmented. No vendor has more than 10 per cent, even when such large ones as Oracle, SAP and Microsoft are factored in.That is changing, however, as the wave of industry consolidation that has been a feature of enterprise software starts to reach the mid-market.JD Edwards, regarded by analysts as one of the few mid-market ERP vendors with a global reach, has been swallowed by PeopleSoft, only to see its new owner bought by Oracle.Microsoft’s mid-market strategy is largely based on acquired technology, in particular Navision and Great Plains. SAP, for its part, has said that it sees small and mid-sized companies as its main source of growth.Consolidation is also being driven by activity within the mid-market itself. US ERP vendor Lawson is in the process of buying Sweden’s Intentia.SSA Global has grown through a series of acquisitions. Sage, currently ranked as the third-largest ERP software company, has also built its international presence through acquisitions, especially in the Americas.“There is not currently a global market for ERP in the mid-range,” says Yvonne Genovese, a research vice-president at industry analysts Gartner. “JD Edwards was the closest but it covered only a limited range of industries.“The best-placed company to fill that space is Microsoft, but it has not done so yet. The market will remain fragmented until someone such as Microsoft steps up to the plate.”The large ERP vendors have used acquisitions to build bridgeheads into the mid-market, where IT buyers have also changed their buying behaviour, showing a greater willingness to buy from the largest vendors. The security of dealing with a large company is one reason.Jim Shepherd, an analyst at AMR Research, says: “Mid-market buyers have changed their outlook. They are much more concerned with the viability of their software supplier. Businesses might keep an ERP system for 10, 15 or 20 years, so they don’t want to deal with someone who could be gone in two years.”For CIOs, choosing the right ERP vendor means striking a balance, between features and performance, and long-term stability. Although very large companies can afford to customise their enterprise applications, smaller comapnies are less able to influence design of software.The large ERP vendors have also gained a reputation for arrogance in the mid market, adopting a take-it-or-leave-it approach to some customers.Smaller ERP vendors may be more open to making changes or additions to their software to meet a customer’s requirements.By focusing on the needs of a particular niche or geography, the hope is that customers will be able to use more of the software “as is”. Smaller companies do not have the time to embark on lengthy software projects.“Price and the speed of implementation are key factors in the mid market,” says Bettina Pickering, an ERP specialist at PA Consulting. “Smaller software vendors are more likely to work with their clients to try to understand their requirements and are prepared to do more work on integrating the technology.”Extensive use of custom code makes software expensive to support and to upgrade, regardless of the size of the customer. Vendors are aiming to make their software easier to deploy by building common components, and using local or industry-specific partners to manage customisation.Customers are realising that more business processes can be made to work with standard software modules and that the high cost of customisation often outweighs the benefits.Vendors such as Sage, which develops for the Microsoft Windows platform, also leverages off Microsoft core technologies to cut implementation costs.“In the mid-market, companies think in terms of integrating modular solutions,” says Klaus-Micheal Vogelberg, group CTO of Sage. “In tier one companies, solutions are customised to meet business requirements but often that is far more expensive than the software itself.”And CIOs with experience of previous ERP projects are more likely to want to deploy software off the shelf.“It is more common for companies to say ‘This is what I need, and I expect it to work out of the box’,” says Melvin James, ERP practice director at Diagonal Consulting, a systems integration firm and SAP partner. “A few years ago, everybody wanted something different.”This suggests the gap between ERP vendors and those specialising in the mid market will narrow, at least in terms of the functionality they offer.SAP, Oracle and Microsoft will continue to acquire to build their markets. Mid-tier vendors are likely to seek their own deals to build scale, and to provide a bulwark against acquisition.Mid-market buyers might move even further from the monolithic, heavily customised software model in favour of more standardised technology delivered over the internet.“It is always easier to add the functionality demanded by enterprises to software designed for smaller companies than to redesign enterprise software for smaller businesses,” says Zach Nelson, chief executive of online software company Netsuite.“Above all, software for the smaller company has a vital characteristic: ease of use.”
675;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
676;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-03-07T16:37:15Z;Drawing work and life together;;CeBIT, which opens tomorrow in Hanover and runs until Wednesday March 15, has grown to become the world’s biggest IT and telecoms fair.In its current form it is 20 years old, so its adolescence is behind it but there are important decisions to make about the road it will take in adulthood.It developed into an IT event from an exhibition of office equipment (CeBIT originally stood for Centrum der Büro- und Informationstechnik “Centre for office and information technology”) and has changed along with the industry it serves.The slogan for this year’s event shows the dilemma facing the organisers, and many exhibitors. “Digital solutions for work and life” embraces both business technology and consumer electronics.Since the end of the dotcom boom in 2001, much of the market for enterprise IT has been flat or in decline. But consumer electronics has enjoyed significant growth, driven by technologies such as MP3 music players and high definition television.“Historically, consumer entertainment and enterprise IT have been worlds apart,” says Gartner analyst Steve Prentice, who will be speaking at the conference. “But we are fast reaching the point where the two come together.”At CeBIT, convergence has led to overlapping themes in different halls. Some companies have taken multiple stands: Symantec, for example, will be in both the security and storage halls.For smaller exhibitors, however, this is not a practical option. “There has been a lack of clear segmentation of the halls, and that has not worked well in the past,” says Mark Muschelknautz, marketing director for business software company Mindjet. “The organisation does need to be transparent when you have 470,000 sq metres of exhibition space.For some exhibitors, though, the mix works well. “Some people think that you can segment the business user and the consumer, but after 6pm we all become consumers,” says Oscar Koenders, general manager for marketing at Toshiba’s European computer division.He adds: “There is the fairly traditional mix of B2B customers at CeBIT, but also a growing number of consumers, and we will be addressing both.” As well as computers, Toshiba will be showing projectors, video players and high definition television.Other exhibitors are happy to see convergence back on the agenda, despite attempts by the organisers in the mid-1990s to “re-professionalise” the show and attract business visitors rather than the general public.This led to a shorter event with higher ticket prices but the trend seems to have reversed, at least in part. This year there will be evening opening of selected halls aimed at teenage visitors, and the digital home hall is expected to be one of the busiest.“CeBIT plays to our strengths in voice, broadband and home media,” says Martin Kinne, chief executive of Siemens’ home and office communication devices. Last year, Siemens made an impact, bringing in Brazilian footballer Ronaldo to promote its wares.This year, the presence might be slightly lower key, with Siemens exhibiting alongside BenQ, which bought Siemens’ mobile phone division last year. But Mr Kinne still expects to do a significant amount of business, especially with network operators and internet service providers interested in Voice over IP and other advanced services.Mr Kinne expects a significant number of leads to come from overseas visitors. Last year, a third of visitors to Siemens booths were international. But for some vendors, that figure is as low as 15 per cent. This has led some companies to question CeBIT’s value as an international event, rather than a show for the, admittedly large, German market.The telecoms, broadcast and internet services market that provides the key customers to Siemens’ home and office communication devices division is very international. This helps explain the high level of overseas interest. It may be that visitors want to see German vendors on their home turf.For other companies, however, the focus for CeBIT is primarily on Germany, Austria and Switzerland or central Europe.Tim Pickard, vice-president for international marketing at RSA Security says: “We find that the most benefit for us comes from opportunities in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. We justify attending CeBIT on the basis of our German business.”For overseas exhibitors, this appears to be the pragmatic approach. Microsoft, for example, found that 82 per cent of its non-German requests for information came from elsewhere in Europe. But German visitors still generated more than 90 per cent of requests for further information.Microsoft treats CeBIT primarily as a German event, although Frank Mihm-Gebauer of Microsoft Germany points out that it is a critical event for the software company. One reason Microsoft is committed to CeBIT, he explains, is that it is a chance to speak directly with customers.As a company that sells through channels and partners, rather than direct to the public, this is an opportunity Microsoft values. But as Mr Mihm-Gebauer adds, the show does have to justify itself by generating new sales leads and ultimately, licence revenue for Microsoft.It is this hard-headed, metrics-based approach that persuades IT vendors to put, and keep, CeBIT on their agendas. Over the years, there have been some significant absentees from the event: Apple Computer will not be exhibiting, nor will Oracle, nor HP.But for companies which manage their CeBIT presence well, it can be a profitable, if exhausting, week. Amanda Jobbins, EMEA vice-president for marketing at Symantec, says she constantly asks her German marketing team for evidence that CeBIT generates business leads.So far, it has done so. “Our research shows that 25 per cent of visitors have come to CeBIT planning to invest in technology,” she says. “Up to 40 per cent of attendees are IT decision-makers or managing directors.”The event, she says, is a chance to meet channel partners and distributors, and raise awareness with the public and with the media. She stresses that making the most of the event requires thorough preparation.But the investment is worth it. “The opportunity pipeline for Germany shows a spike after CeBIT,” she says. “In terms of our German business alone, it is pretty compelling.”
677;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-03-05T22:35:52Z;Microsoft to unfold ‘Origami’ portable computers;;Microsoft is this week expected to unveil the blueprint for a portable computer sized between a mobile telephone and a laptop.The world’s biggest software company, working with several hardware manufacturers including Samsung, is set to unveil the plan on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the plans.However, some analysts warn that establishing a new category of low-cost personal electronic gadget is fraught with difficulty.“The PC world is littered with the bodies of devices that didn’t make it,” said Leslie Fiering, a Gartner analyst who had been briefed on the Origami device but would not provide details because of a confidentiality agreement.“A lot of things have to be executed flawlessly,” she said.Apple’s Newton was the most celebrated failure, while Microsoft’s Tablet PC, launched more than three years ago, has had only modest sales.Buzz about the Microsoft project, code-named “Origami”, began to emerge last week after bloggers discovered a promotional website created by Microsoft that contained hints about a “mobile PC running Windows XP”.Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering, a US research firm, said he expected the new gadgets to be priced between $400 and $1000, depending on specifications. The machines would run popular software applications, but their “real purpose” was to be wireless, allowing them to connect to online applications that Microsoft announced late last year.That could make the Origami project an important element in Microsoft’s increasing competition with Google, which is also said to have talked to electronics companies about devices to make its services more widely available than on PCs.Hardware companies have begun to show an increased interest in small computers powerful enough to deliver web browsing and other popular applications over wireless connections. Last autumn, Sony, the consumer electronics company, launched a line of small wi-fi tablet computers about the size of a paperback book. Nokia, the mobile handset maker, launched a small, Linux-powered tablet device.Another web teaser that went active last week indicated that Intel, the chipmaker, was preparing to unveil its own “ultra-mobile” PC tomorrow.“It’s really a long-term concept of a personal box that you can take with you anywhere,” Ms Fiering said of the Origami project.
678;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-02-28T19:28:06Z;Nokia increases handset market share;;"Nokia, the world’s biggest mobile phone maker, increased its market share during 2005 to levels not seen for more than two years.The Finnish company had 35 per cent of the handset sales, with 82m phones sold, in the three months to December 31, according to research from Gartner, the technology
analysts. This was its best market share figure since the second quarter of 2003.Second-placed Motorola’s share also increased, to 17.8 per cent, as it enjoyed success with cheap handsets in emerging markets, and elsewhere with its popular thin Razr model.However some of Motorola’s later ‘four-letter’ models, such as the Slvr L7, had been “misunderstood” by customers, said Carolina Milanesi, a principal analyst at Gartner. “It should have had the same response as the Razr – it’s doing well, but not as well as Motorola hoped for in some markets,” she said.Sony Ericsson, a London-based joint venture between its Japanese and Swedish parents, slipped from fifth into a close fifth place behind LG, after making some gains on the third quarter due to popularity of its Walkman-branded phones.Sony Ericsson, which has focused on selling higher end phones rather than on volume sales, yesterday said it would begin selling camera phones with Sony’s CyberShot camera brand and with blogging and search tools from Google.Total mobile phone sales reached record levels as developing countries adopted the devices in increasing numbers, with 816.6m handsets sold worldwide during the year,
a 21 per cent increase on 2004.Latin America was the fastest-growing region with a 40 per cent, while Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew at 39 per cent. The more mature markets of Western Europe and North America grew at 11 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, while Japan, considered a leader in mobile phone adoption, grew at a rate of just 3 per cent.The six biggest handset makers – Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, LG, Sony Ericsson and BenQMobile – increased their collective market share from 78 per cent in the first quarter to 84 per cent in the fourth quarter.The maturing of developed markets and surge in emerging markets explained by the biggest six mobile phone makers increased their collective strength, Ms Milanesi said, as developing markets were driven by price while maturing markets wanted technological innovation, both of which were difficult for small companies to achieve."
679;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-02-13T10:28:39Z;Cash cow threatened by own success;;"International roaming is a cash cow for mobile operators. Since European networks signed the first international roaming agreements in the 1990s, money earned from travelling subscribers has grown steadily.Gartner, a market research company, calculates that roaming accounts for 20 per cent of operators’ revenues.But success has led to accusations that networks are profiteering from travellers, through rates that can be 10 times those of domestic calls. Regulators, led by the European Union, have started to scrutinise roaming costs; the European Commission recently published tables of roaming fees to help consumers understand the costs.One reason the Commission has taken an interest in roaming charges is that more consumers are making use of them. Sometimes, they find the bills a shock. When first introduced, roaming was used mainly by businesses. But the proliferation of multi-band handsets means most subscribers to GSM networks now have the technology to roam.There is evidence that roaming costs more in Europe than elsewhere. International roaming does not, as yet, account for a large share of revenue for North American cellular operators. But in Asia, where it accounts for a more significant proportion of voice traffic, fees are lower and usage is higher.According to Neil Montefiore, chief executive of Singapore-based cellular operator M1, this is in part because intra-Asian roaming agreements were drafted more recently than their European equivalents, and so are set at a lower rate.Consumer demands also play a part. He says south-east Asia networks are under pressure to negotiate more favourable rates with countries such as India and China, where roaming charges are currently higher. “There is still a huge amount of suppressed demand in terms of pricing,” he says. “People don’t take their phones with them when they travel, or they switch them off.”Network groups such as Vodafone, the Asia Mobile Initiative (AMI), or the FreeMove Alliance in Europe, offer lower rates, but if the visited network is not in an alliance it might not be in its interest to cut its fees.Roaming traffic is rarely evenly distributed, even within a region. The sunny parts of southern Europe, for example, are significant beneficiaries of inbound roaming from colder, northern climes. But operators in small countries – even in popular tourist destinations – can find it troublesome and expensive to negotiate roaming access with larger neighbours, because they may gain only limited traffic from the deal.This has led to operators working through clearing houses which, in effect, deal with roaming on a wholesale basis. But these third parties levy a fee for their services, adding further to costs.“The roaming business is an 80:20 situation: 20 per cent of agreements generate the bulk of roaming revenues,” says Philip Sharp, chief executive of CAPE Technologies, a Dublin-based company that sells software enabling operators to manage their own roaming agreements. Irish mobile operator Meteor has installed CAPE’s software to handle connections to its three or four largest roaming partners directly, removing the need to use an intermediary.Demand for software that manages bilateral roaming arrangements is growing, not least because operators are looking to take costs out of roaming in order to pre-empt regulatory intervention.And operators face a further, technological challenge to roaming revenues in the form of Voice over IP. Although this, especially over wireless connections, might not become mainstream in the near future, even a small number of frequent roamers switching could cost cellular operators dear.“Operators do face competition from IP telephony and even calling-card companies,” says Shahar Florence, CEO of roaming company Starhome. “But today ‘classic’ roaming still has significant advantages over VoIP such as quality of voice, quality of service, single bills, and ease of use, but above all mobility, hence the price difference.” Businesses might not yet be ready to move to VoIP but they might be able to negotiate a better deal on roaming.On the Orange network, for example, companies can arrange specific rates based on their traffic patterns, according to Phillipe Bernard, executive vice-president of Orange Business Solutions. This is in addition to rates negotiated by the FreeMove Alliance, of which Orange is a member.Businesses can also save by opting to limit their roaming traffic to their home network’s partners. Vodafone’s data charges for using another Vodafone network, for example, are a little over one-third of the cost of using a non-Vodafone carrier.The company has also introduced Passport, a tariff aimed specifically at roamers.Such arrangements need careful scrutiny, however. According to Martin Gutberlet, research director at Gartner, deals such as Vodafone’s Passport saves money for travellers who make calls of longer than two to three minutes. For shorter calls, a regular roaming tariff will be more cost-effective.But lack of transparency can be as great a problem as the actual cost of roaming: companies do not like surprises about communications costs.If travellers know how much roaming can cost, they can make an informed decision on whether to make a call or download data. This is another area where technology can help.“One of the things we can provide to operators is an advice of charge notification,” says Bobby Srinivasan, chief executive of software company Roamware. “We don’t think it will diminish [roaming] usage, but it is information that businesses like to have.” Mr Srinivasan says that an operator has yet to sign up for the software, but he is confident operator that do will gain an advantage in an increasingly competitive market."
680;IT;Gartner Inc;2006-01-24T17:07:18Z;The answer now lies on the desktop;;Much has changed in the 10 years since knowledge management jumped from academic computer science to the mainstream of business technology.In the late 1980s and early 1990s knowledge management initiatives were largely the preserve of very large companies such as Shell, or government departments such as the UK’s Department of Trade and Industry. Only very large organisations could afford the time, resources and high-performance hardware needed to deliver a knowledge management project.Companies’ experiences with Year 2000 readiness programmes and the dotcom bust meant very large IT projects fell from fashion. Moreover, a number of large knowledge management programmes failed to deliver value, often because the systems were too slow and cumbersome to use, or too expensive to deploy to enough people to make them effective.None the less, Gartner, the market research company, believes “most leading organisations have implemented KM to support at least one critical business process, and many have enterprise-wide KM programs,” according to a note published on the outlook for knowledge management technology.The way companies think about, and implement, knowledge management, however, has changed considerably in the past couple of years, and it continues to evolve. Early knowledge management initiatives were almost always centred around large databases, often based on mainframes.Groups of knowledge management experts – sometimes known as “cybrarians” – would control what went into the knowledge management system, design keywords and meta tags to index the data, and often determined who could carry out a search.Although some companies benefited from such systems, many did not.“Large companies have spent a lot of money on knowledge management but one would question how many have shown a return on investment,” suggests Robert Gordon, chief executive of software company Mindjet. “A few years later people ask: ‘Whatever happened to that knowledge management system?’ It is a question of how you get the information down to individual knowledge workers so they are more effective. Often, you find people have been putting the data into the knowledge management system for five years but getting nothing back.”The solution, according to a growing number of business software vendors, is to bring knowledge management tools to employees’ desktops, rather than locking information away in a mainframe or central database. This is being reinforced by a trend among individual users to adopt their own search tools, such as Google, either because they do not have access to the central knowledge management system or because it is cumbersome to use.“There are companies that have achieved an immersive knowledge management experience,” says Whit Andrews, a vice-president for research at Gartner. “But other companies are approaching knowledge management in a much more opportunistic fashion. Perhaps the perfect example is desktop search.” He points out that younger knowledge workers used to technologies such as Google want tools to manage their information at their fingertips.Technology, though, offers ways to solve some of these problems. One intractable issue for most knowledge management systems is the need for users to place meta information and keywords in their documents, either as they create them or before they store them in the knowledge management system. Both are time consuming, and can mean busy employees do not keep the system up-to-date.Advances in database and content management software have gone some way to solving the problem. Modern systems can index documents in close to real time, helped by more powerful and cheaper server hardware.“When you upload a file to content system it is indexed by a text engine and keywords are extracted. It goes through an automated categorisation cycle,” says Rich Buchheim, senior director of product development for collaboration software at Oracle. “I don’t have to go through those extra steps. Fifteen years ago we didn’t have the capability to do that. It would have taken hours to do auto indexing. You had to shift the burden to the user.”Better software and faster hardware also makes it easier for knowledge management systems to handle data held across a range of computer applications, such as CRM and ERP, as well as as text or other documents on file servers. Rather than duplicating data into one single – and complex – knowledge management database, companies can build systems that pull together information from a range of sources.Such federated knowledge management systems will be vital in driving uptake of the technology, as well as improving the return on investment for companies that already use knowledge management, says Gartner’s Andrews. He also expects to see companies turn to simpler, “lighter” knowledge management technologies, possibly based around desktop search.Knowledge management is also likely to integrate far more closely with business intelligence software, for analysing the information, and with data warehousing and information lifecycle management software, to handle the data companies need to keep.And if companies want to gain the benefits of knowledge management, including capturing information held in the minds and private notes of the baby-boom generation, they need technology to provide staff with knowledge management through familiar tools.Andy Hayler, founder and chief strategist of data warehouse software company Kalido, points out that companies with effective knowledge management systems, such as consultancy firms, also have a strong collaboration culture. People used to working in multi-disciplinary, and often geographically disbursed, teams will take the time to learn a knowledge management tool.But companies that want to drive wider usage of knowledge management need to use technology to tie it in to the average user’s computer desktop.“A lot of this software struggles because people really want to be using email, or Google, or Excel,” he says. “If it is a system they are not familiar with, it is another barrier.”
681;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-12-29T18:09:46Z;BSNL fixes sights on mobile reach;;The offices of Bharat Sanchar Nigam, India’s state-run fixed-line operator, bear all the physical hallmarks of a slow-moving public-sector monopoly.The shabby furniture, desks in disarray, threadbare carpeting, and employees who appear to have no discernible duties, give a visitor the impression that the century-old telecoms behemoth has no intention of venturing beyond its stronghold in the fixed-line market, in which it has an 85 per cent share.The perception would be misplaced. BSNL, formed by the corporatisation of the Department of Telecom Operations in 2000, may not have the slick panache of private-sector telecom operators, such as Reliance Infocomm or Bharti Tele-ventures_which recently received a high-profile investment from the UK-based Vodafone. But BSNL is seriously challenging them in the cellular and broadband sectors.Realising that fixed-line growth has come to a standstill, BSNL has begun aggressively courting wireless and broadband customers. It hopes to add 60m mobile phone lines over the next few years, and has signed up 310,000 broadband users less than a year after launching the service. This compares with Bharti’s estimated 250,000 household subscribers.This year the company has spent US$3.3bn across its service areas.“BSNL came in as the underdog. They started on a pan-India basis, and didn’t start in the big cities,” said Kobita Desai, a senior analyst with Gartner Research. “Fantastic coverage is what they did.”One of India’s largest public-sector companies, BSNL generated revenues of US$7.9bn in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, a 6 per cent increase over the previous year. Net profit was US$2.2bn. The company expects revenue to grow 2-3 per cent.BSNL operates throughout the country except for New Delhi and Mumbai. It could have comfortably continued to focus only on its fixed line business - with its marginal net subscriber growth of about half a million users each year - particularly since as a 100 per cent government-owned company it would be fulfilling its social mandate of expanding coverage into rural areas.Instead, the telecom operator introduced its mobile phone service in 2002 and has become the country’s number three cellular operator with 13.3m subscribers. Bharti’s Airtel platform and Reliance Infocomm each have about 15.5m customers.“The whole world is moving towards mobile telephony,” Anil K Sinha, BSNL chairman and managing director, says. “The requirement of the day is that we increase revenues by entering fields which will be the future.”Two years ago, the company’s fixed-line business made up about 95 per cent of its revenues and the cellular component 5 per cent.The wireless portion doubled to 10 per cent in the 2004-2005 fiscal year. The company expects mobile phone revenue to grow to 14 per cent of the total for the 2005-2006 fiscal year, and about 20 per cent for the following year.BSNL is issuing a US$4.5bn tender for 60m GSM mobile phone lines, one-quarter of which will be reserved for its coming 3G service. The move, which would nearly double the number of mobile phone lines, seems ambitious even by Indian standards.India is the world’s fastest-growing cellular market. There are some 67m subscribers, with more than 2m being added each month.Mr Sinha says he is not worried BSNL will trigger a price war by adding the new lines, as average revenue per user (Arpu) is already on a downward trajectory. It fell to Rs390 (US$8.50) in June from Rs411 in March, a 3 per cent decline.“Once penetration trickles toward the rural side, Arpus will fall,” Mr Sinha says. “It’s a numbers game. We will increase the numbers and revenues will rise.”For an Indian public sector enterprise, BSNL is also showing uncharacteristic competitiveness in its plans to launch a fibre-to-the-home broadband service. The move should allow BSNL to hold its leadership position in residential high-speed internet services. State-run Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, which operates exclusively in Delhi and Mumbai, has about the same number of subscribers as BSNL.BSNL’s success is not entirely due to its own initiative. As a state-owned company, it has had access to a government fund, to which other telecom operators must contribute, aimed at improving services in the rural areas.
682;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-12-16T21:46:16Z;Xbox 360 outmanoeuvres its launch glitches;;A shortage of consoles and compelling new games, a lacklustre launch in Japan and early technology glitches have done little to detract from the successful global launch of the Xbox 360, according to video games industry analysts.The Xbox 360, Microsoft’s attempt to steal leadership in the games industry from Sony’s PlayStation, has become this year’s must-have Christmas gift in gaming circles in the US and western Europe. But the shortages and the resulting “buzz” they have created are partly a reflection of the slow ramp-up in production of the machines.“We don’t think this was staged but we’re a little surprised there hasn’t been more information about follow-up shipments,” said Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering in the US.Makers of the most sought-after Christmas gifts, such as the latest Nintendo hand-held games machine last year, generally kept retailers informed about extra shipments they were rushing out before the holidays, he added – something Microsoft had not done.Any unhappiness this has caused among retailers and potential customers, however, has been balanced by media coverage of unmet demand for the products, according to analysts.In Japan, where the new machines went on sale a week ago, early demand fell short of that in the US and Europe.According to Enterbrain, a video games research group, about 40 per cent of the 159,000 consoles shipped to Japanese stores were sold in the first weekend, a contrast with other markets where they sold out quickly.“That’s a disappointment for them but not altogether a surprise,” said Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner.However, by getting its new console to market before Sony, which has promised a new version of the PlayStation next year, Microsoft had succeeded in gaining early attention, most analysts said.Additional reporting by Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo
683;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-12-08T18:37:49Z;RIM in talks to end BlackBerry patent dispute;;Research in Motion, the Canadian maker of the iconic BlackBerry communications device, and NTP, the US-based patents company, could be edging towards a new settlement of their long-running patent dispute.RIM told Reuters that it had held talks through a court-appointed mediator with NTP, contradicting an earlier claim by NTP that no talks had taken place.Reuters this week quoted Don Stout, a patent lawyer and one of NTP’s co-founders, saying the two companies had not talked since June about any settlement.His claim was, however, rebutted in an e-mail by Mark Guibert, RIM’s vice president of corporate marketing: “As NTP knows, RIM and NTP had been communicating with each other through the court-appointed mediator during the last several days. We are precluded by law from discussing the substance of that exchange. RIM expects to continue communications through that channel.”The talks come as the judge in the case considers arguments from both sides and a request by NTP for an injunction blocking BlackBerry sales in the US, RIM’s most important market.Although RIM has insisted it has a “workaround” should an injunction be issued, concerns about disruption of sales of BlackBerrys and the BlackBerry “push email” service in the US have made both potential customers and investors increasingly nervous.Earlier this week, RIM’s shares sank to a five-week low after Gartner, the IT consultancy, advised its customers to suspend BlackBerry deployments until the legal outcome was clearer.Meanwhile, intellectual property experts – including Robert Greene Sterne, who has been following the case closely for his clients – have criticised the companies over the lack of a settlement.“RIM continues to play Russian roulette with BlackBerry consumers and partners,” he said. “They need to respect the patent rights of NTP, the inventor and property owner. Instead, RIM is acting like a patent squatter by pursuing a scorched-earth legal strategy that will in the end burn its users and stakeholders.”
684;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-12-02T01:01:59Z;Nokia expects 10% growth in handset sales;;Nokia, the world?s largest mobile phone maker, predicted that global mobile handset sales would climb by more than 10 per cent next year from the 780m units expected in 2005.?We expect the market to grow by 10 per cent plus next year,? Jorma Ollila, Nokia?s outgoing chief executive, told investors at the Finnish company?s annual capital markets day in New York on Thursday. Mr Ollila, 55, will step down nextThe updated Nokia estimates tie in with figures from several market research firms, including Gartner, which predicted last month that mobile phone sales would grow by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent next year, further dispelling investors? concerns that growth might slow as markets such as western Europe reach saturation point.The Finnish group, which has bounced back after misreading the market in 2004, added that it expected to further increase its market share buoyed by strong performance in emerging markets and in sales of advanced 3G handsets in Europe and elsewhere.Nokia also brought forward its estimate of when the global phone market would pass the 3bn mark by two years to 2008, mainly because of strong growth in markets such as China and India.Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, who will take over from Mr Ollila, predicted that the biggest handset makers would continue to outpace their smaller rivals in part because of the complexity of the industry and the need for sophisticated distribution networks and low-cost manufacturing operations.Other senior Nokia executives noted that this also meant Nokia had to strengthen its position in the US market.
685;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-11-23T16:46:33Z;Lex: Microsoft;;Xbox has proved an expensive game for Microsoft. Heavy investment in the console has generated a stream of losses since 2001. But the sheer scale and profitability of the core Windows and Office franchises - representing almost 60 per cent of revenues - has minimised the impact. The flip side is that, even if the new Xbox 360 performs strongly, it will take time to have a significant effect on the software group.Near-term, the launches of Windows Vista and Office 12 are more important. But further out it will become ever harder to grow the core franchises. Microsoft will become more reliant on its newer businesses. Servers already generate about $10bn of revenue a year - almost as much as Office.Meanwhile, Gartner estimates Xbox has a hardware and software market of $25bn-$30bn to pursue. Xbox 360 should be able to take advantage of its release ahead of Sony’s PlayStation 3 to gain market share in loss-making consoles. It should then become profitable as revenue from the sale of video games flows through. Xbox also lets Microsoft hedge its bet on the digital home of the future - giving it position in games consoles as well as PCs.The Xbox will not become what the iPod is for Apple - not least because iPod hardware sales are profitable rather than relying on future music revenues. Within Microsoft, Xbox is unlikely to rival the importance of servers as a third leg. But moving into profit would boost investors faith that Microsoft can develop attractive new businesses beyond the PC.
686;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-11-22T23:53:05Z;Hollywood strikes blow against web piracy;;The US movie industry won an important symbolic breakthrough in its fight against online piracy on Tuesday as it announced an accord with the creator of a technology that is widely used for copying movies and TV shows illegally over the internet.However, the deal between the Motion Picture Association of America and Bram Cohen, the software developer behind BitTorrent, will do little directly to block much of the movie piracy that currently takes place online, observers said.Allen Weiner, research analyst at Gartner, said “there is nothing you can do to shut off the illegal usage” of all the online networks that have been set up based on BitTorrent’s technology. He added that deals like that announced on Tuesday with Mr Cohen could instead usher in legitimate online networks with the official backing of the movie industry. That could lead to the creation of easy-to-use commercial alternatives to the illegal movie-sharing networks, in much the same way that Apple’s iTunes music service had become a legal alternative to the early “peer to peer” music sites.Mr Cohen’s freely-available software has become the basis for a web of online networks, known as “trackers”, that help users find movies and TV.By creating a quicker way to download data-intensive video files, BitTorrent’s technology has become the basis for the first widespread internet distribution of movies and TV shows. According to Mr Cohen, around a third of all the data that passes over the internet is connected with BitTorrent sites. When downloading a movie, the technology draws parts of the file from different sources simultaneously, reducing the bottlenecks that slow other networks.Under Tuesday’s agreement, the search engine on Mr Cohen’s own website, BitTorrent.com, will remove links to any pirated material. By acting to block piracy, Mr Cohen and his company “are leading the way for other companies by their example”, said Dan Glickman, chairman of the MPAA.The agreement could also lead to the eventual adoption of BitTorrent’s technology by the movie studios for new, legal services, said Mr Weiner. Mr Cohen, who has spoken out publicly again online piracy, recently raised $8.5bn from a venture capital firm to try to build a legal service based on the technology.
687;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-11-22T23:30:20Z;Sony Ericsson takes LG’s spot;;"Sony Ericsson has pushed LG Electronics out of the number four position in the global mobile handset market in the third quarter, helped by strong demand for its Walkman phone.The same data showed that the top two makers, Nokia and Motorola, continued to extend the gap with the rest of the pack.The Finnish manufacturer’s share of the market in the three months to the end of September rose to 32.6 per cent, up from 31.9 per cent in the second quarter. Motorola meanwhile grew its position from 17.9 per cent to 18.7 per cent, according to data compiled by Gartner.The success of the big two underscored how far behind Samsung, the third placed manufacturer, had fallen. Its market share dropped for the third consecutive quarter to 12.5 per cent. In the third quarter last year, Samsung displaced Motorola as the world’s second biggest handset maker but its fortunes have since gone into decline.Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner, said the South Korean handset maker’s woes were due to its failure to expand its product range, particularly towards emerging markets.“Motorola has rebuilt its market position by playing in all the regions, across all the technologies and at all the pricing points,” she said.But the success of the Sony Ericsson in the most recent quarter exposed a continued flaw at the Swedish-Japanese joint venture. Ms Milanesi said Sony
Ericsson had failed again to match production with demand, leading to a shortfall in its two most successful phones – the Walkman 800 and K750.The joint venture has been basking in the success of its W800 phone but it has a history of being too conservative in its market outlook and Ms Milanesi warned that it was about time senior executives attempted to meet the demand for popular devices. “It is a good problem to have but it can turn round and bite you and you will run into problems with your customers.”"
688;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-11-20T16:53:57Z;Reliance under pressure to place shares;;"Reliance Infocomm, India’s mobile phone operator, is under mounting pressure to carry out a planned pre-IPO private placement of shares by the end of the year to aid its expansion.While other mobile phone operators are moving quickly to expand their share of India’s market – one of the world’s fastest growing with 2.8m subscribers added monthly – Reliance is being accused of being too complacent.Bharti Tele-Ventures, the country’s leading wireless operator in revenue terms, received a $1.5bn injection of capital from Vodafone late last month while government-owned BSNL plans to issue a tender for 60m new lines next month.“Reliance should do this [private placement] as soon as possible,” said Kobita Desai, a senior telecoms analyst with Gartner Research. “They need the IPO to accelerate their expansion plans.”Reliance declined to give any details about the planned placement, but reports say the company could be planning to raise as much as $1bn from a share issue. Reliance said it might hold a stock market listing some time early next year.By subscriber numbers, Reliance recently pulled ahead of Bharti Tele-Ventures’ Airtel service. If Reliance, largely a CDMA operator, includes its small GSM service, the company has 15.5m subscribers, compared with Airtel’s 14.7m.However, a feud between Reliance Group’s Ambani brothers, Mukesh and Anil, which ended in the conglomerate being split between the pair, has delayed the wireless company’s efforts to more aggressively raise capital to finance expansion.At 65m subscribers, India’s mobile market is the third largest in Asia after China and Japan but remains far from saturated at only 6 per cent penetration.The FT earlier reported Reliance had secured commitments for its share placement from Citibank Private Equity, Carlyle, Deutsche Bank, CVC Ventures, Blackstone, and Temasek, Singapore’s state-owned investment company.However, analysts said Reliance would be better off linking up with a global telecom operator rather than an investment services firm, as Bharti had done through its partnership with Vodafone.“It makes more sense to get a strategic partner,” said an analyst at an Indian stockbroking firm. “They can share technology and brand products much
better.”Reliance’s CDMA format narrows the list of potential partners because most use the GSM standard. SK Telecom, of South Korea, and US-based Sprint are among the exceptions.As a late entrant in the mobile market, Reliance has also been forced to undercut the prices of incumbent operators to gain customers."
689;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-11-16T23:40:03Z;Consumer products to drive chip sales;;Global sales of microchips will reach $309bn in 2008, up 45 per cent on the $213bn recorded in 2004, according to the annual forecast of the Semiconductor Industry Association trade body.The SIA predicted a compound annual growth rate of nearly 10 per cent for 2005 to 2008. It sees sales increasing nearly 7 per cent to $227bn this year, having earlier predicted flat growth when an inventory build-up signalled a possible slump. Sales growth should rise steadily – by 8 per cent in 2006 to $245bn, by 10.5 per cent to $271bn in 2007, and by 14 per cent in 2008, it said.“Consumer products will be the major growth-drivers in the years ahead,” said George Scalise, SIA president. He cited cell phones, portable media players and digital TVs as the major products boosting the chip sector.“Consumers are now driving most of the advances in personal computers, which have become the hub of home technology,” he added.“Fast-growing consumer markets are expanding demand for leading-edge products for digital signal processing, flash memory, and power management.”The SIA anticipates digital TVs and MP3 players both enjoying 52 per cent growth rates next year, compared with 9 per cent for digital cameras, 10 per cent for PCs and 13 per cent for cell phones.Digital Signal Processors, the major products of Texas Instruments, should enjoy the strongest growth among semiconductors at 17.2 per cent as more are used in phones and a broader range of consumer devices.D-Ram memory-chip sales are expected to fall 10 per cent due to a “mild cyclical decline”.In a separate report, the Gartner research firm yesterday forecast modest growth during the next few years with a mild slowdown in 2007 when growth would be only 5.1 per cent, less than half the figure predicted by the SIA.Gartner said there was something of a void in semiconductor demand to be filled as the PC and cell phone markets entered maturity and lost their ability to fuel strong growth.
690;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-11-08T17:15:05Z;Regulatory noose tightens on IT;;Moves to tighten corporate information security – often driven by compliance and regulatory pressures – increasingly require employees to sacrifice a degree of privacy.Just as legislators in the US and Europe are asking citizens to accept greater surveillance through devices such as biometric passports and identity cards, so businesses are under greater pressure to monitor what their staff do with business information. This pressure is all the greater when it involves customer data.For CIOs and chief information security officers (CISOs), this poses an acute dilemma. The US Sarbanes Oxley Act requires companies to set up confidential mechanisms for whistle-blowers, for example. In European countries such as France, such devices are culturally beyond the Pale. If the telephone number or confidential e-mail box is hosted in the US, it might not even be legal.Other examples include rules that prevent companies moving employee data overseas, reading employee e-mails without first seeking a court order, or contacting customers by e-mail without their prior consent. “There is always the dynamic tension between public safety and personal privacy,” says Jay Heiser, a research vice president and security expert at industry analysts Gartner. “Each culture cuts that in a different way. Technology exacerbates the problem. When you have a business environment that extends across cultural and jurisdictional boundaries you are setting up a situation where there is conflict.”One of the most intractable problems is employee monitoring. Although normal practice in the US and the UK, in some European countries monitoring without prior consent is virtually impossible. Legal experts caution that consent has to be genuine: an employee is not consenting if the alternative is demotion or the sack.This means multi-national companies can find themselves having to operate multiple policies across their trading regions or add extra steps to their processes.“To save costs, we have one mail transfer agent in Europe. An e-mail sent from Paris goes out via London,” explains Michael Colao, global head of IT security at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, the investment bank.“The first call when an e-mail leaves the bank is to our global human resources system. We have to determine where the employee sits and what rules govern monitoring. If you send an e-mail outside the bank with the subject ‘internal use only’ from London it goes straight to our compliance department. We can’t do that in Madrid.”It is not only financial services that are affected. Microsoft, for example, trades in more than 100 countries. According to security and privacy head Peter Cullen, to meet the most stringent local rules, Microsoft has had to set the bar “very, very high” for its security and privacy policies. So its data privacy practices exceed what is required in many countries.Taking the high ground in issues such as privacy and securing customer data does no harm to a company’s reputation, but it entails costs. Californian State law 1386, which forces companies to tell customers if their data has been exposed, has effectively become an international rule. “In the event of triggering the circumstances of 1386 we have to tell all our customers. We can’t operate multiple policies so local laws become global,” says DrKW’s Mr Calao.Businesses also have to balance the fact that while some privacy and security legislation is specific, some is vague. Italian law, for example, specifies the type of password a company should use. In the UK, the law talks of taking “reasonable measures” to secure data. Yet both laws are based on EU data legislation.“Businesses have to have a strategy for managing risk, security and privacy that is aligned with their business objectives,” says Ray Stanton, head of BT’s global security practice.
691;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-11-08T17:12:30Z;Alan Cane: The consumer seems to dominate the future;;"Every autumn, many of Silicon Valley’s most distinguished technologists and venture capitalists (and some of the less distinguished) decamp to a carefully chosen European venue, a different one each year, there to rub shoulders for a few days with their peers from France, Germany, Japan, the UK and elsewhere.This is the Etre conference, now in its 15th year or thereabouts. Run by the same group that publishes the technology business magazine Red Herring, it is idiosyncratic to a degree unheard of in today’s diminished world of high technology jamborees.It breaks most of the rules in the conference manual but remains broadly successful and richly enjoyable. Why this should be so is a puzzle. Some suggest it provides an opportunity for the Valley’s aristocracy to hob-nob on neutral territory: others, that it is impossible to spend a few days away from the office in Rome, Versailles, Barcelona or Berlin without feeling rejuvenated.This year it was Athens, still sparkling after its Olympic odyssey. Over the years, successive Etres have formed a baseline for the significant thematic changes in the industry: the arrival of the personal computer and the rise of packaged software; the domestic PC and the growth of the internet; the telecommunications explosion, the emergence of open source software and now wireless systems and applications.The sessions and product demonstrations in Athens, however, suggest that at present we are experiencing an interregnum, a period of consolidation in the information technology business when no “big new thing” is on the horizon. Consider, for example, the following three developments that were on show in Athens.First, Sling Media. This US-based company has developed a television set-top box, decorously called the “Slingbox,” which connects to the internet allowing the consumer to watch the live video stream from his or her television over a broadband link on a personal computer anywhere in the world.Sling software makes it possible for the consumer to control the television remotely. Versions for the Apple Macintosh, and certain smart mobile phones and personal digital assistants will be available shortly. Why? You could well ask.Second, Allisblue, a Belgian-based company that has developed a technology enabling a subscriber to retrieve information of all kinds by sending an SMS message to the company. It essentially links SMS to e-mail. Allisblue has agreements with a number of consumer products and media companies including Endemol, the Netherlands company behind the “Big Brother” phenomenon. The subscriber texts a code word to Allisblue which contacts, say, Endemol, which, in turn, e-mails the subscriber the Big Brother e-magazine. Some will like this prospect.Finally, Oz Communications of Montreal, Canada: it has developed software that makes it possible to send and receive emails on mobile phone handsets just as if they were PCs. Oz’s software is already embedded in millions of mobile phones around the world.The breakthrough here is that this service is aimed at ordinary consumers rather than the business email market. As the company claims: “This is a new trend in the wireless industry. For the first time, the ordinary consumer can stay connected via email.”The connection between these three examples is that in each case the innovation is aimed at the consumer rather than the purely business user.According to the Gartner Group, the research consultancy, a new trend is on the horizon: the practice of introducing new technologies into consumer markets prior to industrial markets. “As a result,” Gartner says, “the majority of new technologies enterprises adopt for their information systems between 2007 and 2012 will have roots in consumer applications.”If Gartner is right, there are important implications for other sectors – the semiconductor industry, for example, will see demand driven by these applications over the next few years.The Slingbox has an obvious industrial function: to provide tired road warriors with free entertainment in their hotel rooms.But it is easy to see the implications for security of a device that can send quality video images over the internet to anywhere in the world.And while Allisblue’s technology today serves the not-too-serious purpose of e-mailing entertainment magazines, it could provide a new way of acquiring business information without going through the call centre.These developments, however clever and appealing though they are, represent pieces in the IT jigsaw rather than a whole new board game.The development of the IT industry has been driven by innovations that came in from left field rather than in linear fashion.It may take an Etre or two more before we can clearly see what is to be or not to be."
692;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-10-17T23:09:49Z;Dell fights to outpace rivals;;Growth in personal computer shipments at Dell, the US computer maker, failed to outpace the broader market by a significant margin for the first time in seven years in the third quarter, according to two big IT research groups.Although Dell continued to lead the PC industry in worldwide shipments, its shipment growth rate was 17.6 per cent, compared with an average growth rate of 17.2 per cent worldwide, according to Gartner, the IT consultants.“Dell normally has a premium,” said Loren Loverde at IDC, the IT research group, whose separate report showed similar results.Mikako Kitagawa, a Gartner analyst, said the change likely reflected a reduced focus on growing market share and an increased focus on profitability at Dell, which shocked Wall Street in August after second-quarter sales failed to meet forecasts in spite of aggressive price cuts.A Dell spokeswoman declined to comment on third-quarter shipments. However, she said the company’s strategy had not changed and that the company would “continue to drive balanced and profitable growth”. Dell is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on November 10.PC prices have fallen in recent years thanks to fierce competition between established computer makers like Dell and Hewlett-Packard and upstart rivals such as Acer, the Taiwanese computer group. Acer’s quarterly shipments shot up 54.5 per cent year-on-year, while the company ranked fourth in worldwide PC market share, according to Gartner.Shipments at Hewlett-Packard, which ranked second in worldwide market share, grew 18.5 per cent in the quarter.Gartner and IDC said that low prices and strong demand for portable notebook computers led to bigger than expected growth in personal computer shipments in the third quarter.However, they said tight margins and slowing economic growth were likely to lead to a weaker PC market next year.“The market is very price driven,” said Ms Kitagawa. “We don’t believe this is sustainable.”Gartner, which predicts 12.5 per cent growth in PC shipments this year, said it expected growth to slow to 8.9 per cent in 2006 as fewer people take advantage of low prices to replace old computers.
693;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-10-04T16:50:37Z;Ian Campbell of Nucleus Research;;One might expect Ian Campbell to be gleeful at last month’s $5.85bn takeover of Siebel Systems by Oracle, its enterprise IT rival.Three years ago last month, Mr Campbell’s company, Massachusetts-based Nucleus Research, published a highly critical study of the use of Siebel software.It found more than 61 per cent of “reference customers” it interviewed had not achieved a positive return on investment after more than two years, even though they were being promoted as success stories on Siebel’s website.This, it said, contradicted the company’s claims about the positive ROI average customers were achieving.Tom Siebel [the founder] was apoplectic. “It made for some good phone calls,” says Mr Campbell.In fact Mr Campbell owes Mr Siebel a debt of gratitude. The latter’s angry public reaction and a similar response at Germany’s SAP following another study of March 2003 helped put Nucleus on the technology consultancy map.Mr Campbell, a former research manager at IDC, the IT analysts, founded Nucleus in 2000, convinced of the need for quantitative assessment of investments, to complement the prevalent opinion-based approach.“Everything we do has some sort of number at its core,” he says. Its main tool, the ROI assessment, is a “great, impartial measuring tool, if done correctly.”In an IT context, the rigour and consistency of an ROI assessment has a particular resonance. “Some people will write whatever you want,” says Mr Campbell. And an inaccurate case study could result in a vendor losing its credibility with customers.Also, he says, the strategic and market-related analysis from the main IT research companies such as Gartner and Forrester Research tends to be general, but ROI assessments have to be done on an individual basis to have any value.Three years after the spats with Siebel and SAP, relationships have improved, he says. “Everyone now understands that we’re not out to get them, and we’re not going to lie to them.”In a sign the industry accepts the need for impartial ROI studies, Nucleus works not only for customers but also for vendors, including Microsoft, Siebel and Oracle.The respect Nucleus has won reflects the “rules of engagement” it established when it took on Siebel. “We follow a certain path. No vendor can say ‘Make sure the ROI is 200 per cent’,” says Mr Campbell.Even so, Nucleus’s work can still give customers and vendors pause for thought. Its study of customers of Salesforce.com, the fast-growing customer relationship management (CRM) service, supplied on demand over the internet, showed that a third would switch if they could find a better and cheaper alternative.“We quoted one customer who said it would take 30 minutes to switch to another provider. It’s not that Salesforce.com are doing poorly, but it needs to realise its tenuous hold on customers.”In general, Nucleus’s ROI studies suggest hosted CRM services such as Salesforce.com work better for smaller customers. As companies get bigger, and want to build on top of their CRM and integrate it with other systems, they should be thinking whether to bring CRM in-house.Nucleus has also looked at the ROI case for Venda, the hosted e-commerce service founded by UK serial entrepreneur Dan Wagner. “Does it make sense for anybody to create their own e-commerce system and support it, when they can outsource to Dan and pay a few thousand a month?” he asks.He is much less enthusiastic about the ROI case for two of the most-hyped fads: radio frequency identification, and Voiceover Internet Protocol.“I don’t think [tagging items with] RFID is a compelling ROI story for people other than a Wal-Mart,” he says. “When Wal-Mart [the world’s biggest retailer] moves from barcodes to tags it has positive ROI because of the high volumes, but very few companies fall into that category. Does Prada want an RFID tag on every one of its shoes?”VoIP is “wonderful”, he says, but questions whether there is an ROI case for it. “Yes, if you don’t have anything right now, you’d buy VoIP. But if you already have something, does it make sense to yank it out? Not yet.”Meanwhile, Mr Campbell refuses to gloat over Siebel’s takeover. “After our report there was a strong change in the way the company interacted with analysts, the press and customers,” he says. “I think they took what we said to heart.”
694;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-10-04T16:39:29Z;Businesses think the unthinkable;;When Peter Lowes, Deloitte Consulting’s outsourcing chief, advises clients on whether to outsource part of their business, he has them place a dot on a grid to pinpoint how core the function is and how much of it they do.If it is a core, high-volume activity, companies should probably consider becoming an outsourcer in it themselves, he says. Core but low-volume and they should keep it inhouse.Non-core, high-volume operations are better candidates for outsourcing, but businesses should look first at wringing more efficiencies internally, he adds, while non-core, low-volume functions are ripe for it.The problem is, “the dots are moving around all the time,” observes Mr Lowes.What businesses consider core – corporate crown jewels to be jealously guarded inhouse – versus what’s fair game to be contracted out, is a moving target.Two recent outsourcing deals concluded by Boeing, the US aerospace group, with technology services compatriot IBM and HCL of India show that nothing is off limits.The contracts are to develop systems for Boeing’s US defence contracts and its upcoming 7E7 Dreamliner passenger jet. They bear witness to the fact that even the capacity to innovate, hitherto considered the crucible of competitive differentiation, is fair game for outsourcing.A wave of so-called business process outsourcing is driving outsourcing further into the enterprise.“Companies are saying: ‘Our competitive advantage lies in knowing our customers and designing products [around] their needs. Everything else, they’re considering outsourcing,” says Lance Travers, at AMR Research.Outsourcing of IT-intensive functions such as procurement, human resources and finance and accounting systems is projected to grow at a brisk 9.7 per cent this year to $125.9bn in contracts, according to Gartner Group.This would outstrip the 7.7 per cent global growth in more mature IT outsourcing, spanning desktop computers, network management, data centre operation, and software support and development.With business-driven contracts has come a more expansive vision of outsourcing, with vendors contracted to deliver on business performance goals, as well as reduce costs.“It’s a different conversation from traditional IT outsourcing. The notion of business value is very much to the fore,” says Laurie Tropiano, IBM’s vice-president, business consulting services.Last year, US business information provider Dun & Bradstreet commissioned IBM to run key data processing operations with related customer services and financial systems. The seven-year $180m contract is contingent on IBM improving operational efficiency and customer service.“There’s a convergence taking place between consulting and outsourcing,” says Mr Travers.David Cearly, vice-president, emerging trends, at Gartner Group, says: “Companies are starting to think of their businesses in a more modular manner, [rather than] a vertically-integrated model.” It shows in the more discriminating way they are outsourcing.“We’re seeing a lot more discrete deals, where the network goes to one company, desktop [computers] to another and the data centre to a third,” says David Tapper, IT outsourcing director at industry researcher IDC.French carmaker Renault announced plans last year to farm out its IT infrastructure in three tranches to Atos Origin, Computer Sciences and Hewlett-Packard.Companies have recoiled from being beholden to a single supplier amid the recent spectacle of several aggregated one-stop-shop mega-deals unravelling in mutual recrimination, say analysts.But the trend towards smaller, shorter-term deals is also informed by the quest for quicker results and specialist expertise.Dutch financial services group ABN Amro signed a monumental $2.24bn IT outsourcing initiative last month, which divvied up tasks across a portfolio of discrete contracts. Chief information officer Lars Gustavsson said: “There’s no single vendor that can satisfy all [our] needs.”The pact was hailed as a landmark vote of confidence in offshoring.The Amsterdam-based bank entrusted the most valuable outsourcing contract yet to Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services for a record $250m to help run bank-wide software systems.
695;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-09-27T21:14:12Z;Sony dismisses concerns over its DVD plans;;Sony on Tuesday dismissed concerns about the future of its next-generation DVD standard after Intel and Microsoft threw their weight behind a competing format championed by rival Japanese electronics group Toshiba.Intel and Microsoft confirmed a report in some editions of Monday’s FT that they were endorsing Toshiba’s HD-DVD standard over Sony’s Blu-ray Disc.There would be “no impact” from Microsoft and Intel’s stated support for HD-DVD, Sony said on Tuesday, arguing that, among other things, its format offered better copyright protection.The decision by the personal computer industry’s two most influential companies to back HD-DVD poses another major challenge for Sony’s chief executive Sir Howard Stringer - less than a week after he announced a restructuring package aimed chiefly at reviving the group’s struggling core consumer electronics division.The division has been hit by the company’s failure to capitalise on booming demand for flat-screen TVs and by the success of Apple’s portable digital music player, the iPod.Analysts said that, while the Microsoft and Intel move was unfortunate for Sony, the support of content providers such as movie studios was more important. “It’s positive for Toshiba but it’s not decisive,” said Carlos Dimas, electronics analyst at CLSA in Tokyo. “What is going to decide the race is the content providersbecause they have to find the right technology in terms of IP [intellectual property] management and also in terms of economic efficiency.” Even if Microsoft supported HD-DVD, it would not be difficult to write software to enable PCs to use the Blu-ray standard, he said.Paul O’Donovan, analyst at Gartner, said even the backing of Microsoft and Intel did not give HD-DVD the commercial edge over Blu-ray. “The DVD recorder and games console market will be a much bigger driver than the PC market. A PC is fine for writing a movie or backing it up, but ultimately you want to play it on a DVD player.”The fact that Sony’s new PlayStation console would include a Blu-ray DVD player, was a major boost for the format.Mr O’Donovan also said computer industry backing could turn studios against the format. “If these HD-DVD drives are mainly ending up inside PCs, that is where they are going to be copied. Hollywood is likely to go with whichever format is least copiable.”Hollywood has split over the issue, with Time Warner, Viacom, Paramount and NBC Universal supporting HD-DVD, and Walt Disney, 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures and MGM, owned by Sony, backing Blu-ray.“I think that we are heading to a major format war,” Mr Dimas said.llegal copying has been widely supported by content providers.”Toshiba on Tuesday that the endorsement of Intel and Microsoft was likely to make HD-DVD the standard next-generation DVD.
696;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-09-27T16:11:40Z;SanDisk launches new music format;;SanDisk, the maker of flash memory cards most commonly used in digital cameras, has teamed up with EMI to launch a new music format that could eventually replace CDs and DVDs.The company on Tuesday launched its new “gruvi” music card, a finger-nail sized memory card pre-recorded with music and designed to play on mobile phones and hand-held computers.It is understood the first card to go on sale will feature the Rolling Stones.If music cards take off, the company plans to launch movie cards next year.The music card launch coincides with the push by the mobile handset industry to offer phones with in-built music and video players as well as memory card slots.Strategy Analytics estimates that 12 per cent of handsets sold this year will have a card slot, with more than 50 per cent in 2010.The music cards can also be played on laptops and personal computers, many of which include memory card slots as standard. Both Panasonic and Sony have introduced television sets with in-built card slots and BMW and Audi have integrated slots into car entertainment systems.Joe Unsworth, senior research analyst at Gartner, said memory cards could become a popular medium for transferring music and other data between devices around the home.“Its much simpler than setting up a wireless network. People understand how to use it - they can take the card out of the phone, walk over to the TV and plug it in. Its rudimentary.”The cards offer the music industry an new business model for promoting their back catalogue. Each gruvi card can hold around six albums worth of music and The cards also attempt to address piracy issues. SanDisk has teamed up with NDS, the maker of pay-TV content protection technology, to create a security system that links the cards to a internet server, which verifies that the content is authorised.Initially, however, the cards may be too expensive to gain mass attraction, with a single music card expected to retail for around $39.99.“It will be at least five years before the technology becomes cheap enough to rival CDs” said Pedro Vargas, director of mobile entertainment at SanDisk.Another problem may also be that the cards are simply too small for consumers to handle.“They are fiddly things, easy to drop and lose, and consumers may find it hard to justify paying $40 for something the size of a fingernail,” said Neil Mawston, associate director at Strategy Analytics.
697;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-09-20T15:42:06Z;Migration costs are the hitch;;Contrary to rumour, proprietary, licensed software is neither dead nor dying.Here’s a prediction from Gartner, the research group, to underscore the point: “Through 2008, Linux [the open source operating system that is a direct competitor to Microsoft’s Windows] will not be suitable for all desktops in 80 per cent of companies.”It points to the hundreds of thousands of applications and documents in companies’ computer systems that require Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer and Office to run successfully.It concludes: “Although many companies would like to pay Microsoft less of their IT budgets and have investigated open-source replacements like OpenOffice.org or Linux for their desktops, the migration costs frequently prove too high to make wholesale migration worthwhile.”An example from the UK will suffice. A year ago, Newham Council in east London signed a 10-year strategic relationship with Microsoft, bringing to an end an extended trial in which Microsoft products were compared with open source alternatives.A study by the consultancy Capgemini suggested that using open source software would provide only half the cost-savings of the Microsoft solution but would cost three times more to implement.That study was sponsored by Microsoft, and Eddie Bleasedale of Netproject, which devised the open source alternative, suggested at the time that the trial had been been a tactic to get a better deal out of Microsoft, a claim rejected by Richard Steel, Newham’s IT chief.One year on, Mr Steel has no doubt the decision was right: “When we announced our partnership with Microsoft, my decision received a hostile reaction from members of the open source camp, but I am more certain I made the right choice today than ever before.So how much open source or free software will companies be using over the next few years? Roger Fulton of Gartner puts the percentage in the “low teens”.The hard fact is that the benefits of open source software have been oversold. Proprietary software can have an the edge in terms of the financial return for both producer and user, security and performance.For the vendor, the economics of open source software, where money is made from selling additional features or services rather than the basic product can seem a little risky.Mark Webbink, deputy general counsel for Red Hat, which packages Linux for ease of use and sells it with a service contract, says proprietary software has a distinct advantage where special code has to be written for a specific application.He gives as an example a suite of dental software which had no other application in medical practice: “Red Hat will not go into these areas without the full financial support of the company wanting the product.”Martin Taylor, Microsoft’s general manager of platform strategy, argues that there has been a recent change in customer perception: “There has been a shift from a romantic love of open source to a more practical approach with customers saying they need technology to solve a business challenge.”He sees four main reasons why companies stay with Microsoft or return to it. First, cost: “People don’t think of Linux as free any more. They got excited originally about the opportunity to save money but they find it costs more to deploy, maintain and administer.”Second, reliability. Mr Taylor says problems arise if the user tries to extend or develop the system.Third, vulnerability to malware. Mr Taylor says Microsoft’s apparent weakness is simply a result of the huge number of Windows systems. In tests it fares well against versions of Linux, he claims. And Microsoft gets its patches out more rapidly.Finally, indemnification. Customers feel more secure if there are mutual contractual obligations. As Mr Longbottom puts it: “Knowing you have a full commercial licence means that when things go wrong, you know who to shout at.”IN A NUTSHELL: LINUX OR NOT?■ FOR: The most compelling reasons for switching to open source are the potential savings on licence fees.Even with volume discounts, the cost of licensing a proprietary program such as Microsoft Windows for a large organisation can swallow a significant chunk of an IT budget.Other advantages claimed for open source are greater robustness and reliability, faster resolution of bugs, and lower labour costs, as open source programmers tend to be cheaper and training costs are lower.■ AGAINST: Lack of technical support has traditionally been the big fear of businesses considering switching to open source.It is less of an issue today, as leading vendors and service companies now support the more popular products.However, even with outside help, businesses remain reluctant to embrace open source because of the time required to master a new program.Proprietary products tend to be more familiar and easier to learn and to use.
698;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-09-08T17:19:22Z;Sony launch upstaged by Apple latest;;The battle for dominance in the portable music market increased in volume on Thursday as Sony followed hard on the heels of Apple in unveiling new products to reinforce their position in the fast-growing market.Sony on Thursday unveiled its new flagship portable audio player and outlined its strategy to compete with market leader Apple.However, the presentation, in a trendy Tokyo live music club, had been upstaged by the overnight launch by Apple in the US of its iPod Nano, a pencil-thin version of the ubiquitous music player. Apple also unveiled its entry into the mobile phone world with the introduction of a Motorola iTunes handset.The nano features a colour display, capacity for 1,000 songs or 25,000 pictures, and a $249 price tag. A lower-powered version is also being issued.Steve Jobs, Apple CEO, said the nano was one-third the size of rival palyers.“They just changed the rules of the game completely. “Rival players are going to look big and clunky by comparison,” said Van Baker, analyst at Gartner.Sony is marshalling its resources to compete more strongly with Apple, which still dominates not only the US, but Sony’s home market of Japan. It will allow its designers to move away from using purely Sony-developed technology as it bids to move out of Apple’s shadow.Although Apple’s share of the Japanese market has slipped from its peak of 48.5 per cent in March, it was still number one with 39.4 per cent last month, according to a survey by BCN Research.Sony, meanwhile has raised its share from 6 per cent at the beginning of the year to 16.5 per cent.Last month, Apple launched iTunes in Japan, which attracted 1m downloads in its first four days and helped boost iPod sales.The new Sony Walkmans, which range from a 20 gigabyte model using a hard disc drive to a 2GB model that uses a memory card, are meant to be easier to use than the models that Sony launched in the spring.Sony aims to sell 4.5m units of the new players globally and claims it is neck-and-neck with Apple in the Japanese market for portable audio players that use memory cards.Koichiro Tsujino, co-president of Sony Connect, said Sony was kicking off a new phase in its portable audio business with the start of the Connect division and the launch of the new models.“We will pursue an open platform strategy,” he said. “So, we are completely reversing our strategy.”Although Sony was the first to launch portable players that downloaded music from PCs, it fell behind in the portable audio market.However, portable audio players are not as profitable as some of Sony’s earlier portable products and Mr Tsujino conceded that “the biggest challenge for Connect is how to create a value chain.”
699;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Apple’s new releases set to seal top spot;;"Apple Computer on Wednesday unveiled a much-anticipated Motorola cell phone that runs Apple's iTunes music software, as well as a sleek new music player that is thinner than a pencil.The new music player, dubbed the ""iPod nano,"" would replace the popular ""iPod mini"" and was seen to significantly raise the bar for competitors trying to topple Apple in the digital music player market.The iPod nano features a colour display, stores up to 1,000 songs or 25,000 photos and sells for $249, the price of the original iPod mini. A $199 version of the iPod nano can store up to 500 songs. Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, said the iPod nano was one-third the size of the iPod mini and about one third the size of music players from rivals such as Singapore's Creative Technology.""They just changed the rules of the game completely. Rival players are going to look big and clunky by comparison,"" said Van Baker, analyst at Gartner.Gene Munster, analyst at Piper Jaffray, said the iPod nano would help Apple solidify its control of the digital music player market for the next several years. Players from rival manufacturers, which operate on Microsoft software, have failed to catch on in any significant manner.""I think today Apple turned the corner. Nobody is going to come out with
anything as good as the nano in the next six months. Apple will almost double its installed base in that time and they'll have a lock on the market by then,"" he said.Apple had sold almost 22m iPods as of the end of June and has captured 74 per cent of the US digital music player market.The company's iTunes online music store has sold more than 500m songs and controls more than 80 per cent of the US market.As expected, Apple also introduced a Motorola iTunes phone that holds 100 songs.The phone will be available exclusively from Cingular Wireless, the largest US mobile carrier, for $249 with a two-year contract. Cingular customers will be able to transfer songs from their computers to their iTunes phone, but they cannot yet buy music over Cingular's network.Cingular said that the company would introduce over-the-air downloads once it upgrades its wireless network later this year and into next year.But it was not clear whether Cingular would make the iTunes music store available over its network, or where it would launch its own revenue generating service.Reports suggested that Motorola's iTunes phone was delayed because carriers were reluctant to allow Apple to gain a foothold in the mobile music market. A number of European carriers have already launched such services and several US carriers were expected to do so later this year.A report by Informa Telecoms and Media published on Wednesday predicted that music-enabled handset sales would rise sharply worldwide over the next five years, from 76m units in 2005 to 478m in 2010.""Launching this phone will enable Apple to target a much larger market,"" said Jerome Buvat, a Capgemini telecoms, media & entertainment consultant. ""By the end of the year, there should be around 40m-50m music-enabled mobile phones in western Europe, whilst Apple has sold around 20m iPods since its launch.""Microsoft on Wednesday pointed out there were already ""more than 70 music phones on the market today, from 41 device manufacturers, available through 68 mobile operators in 48 countries, based on Windows Mobile and Windows Media technology"".Apple shares hit an all-time high on Tuesday of $48.80 in anticipation of the announcement. Shares closed down 12 cents at $48.68 on Wednesday in New York."
700;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-08-25T09:58:10Z;Mobile phone sales rise 21%;;Mobile phone sales boomed in the second quarter of the year after robust growth in almost all regions of the world except Japan.Second quarter sales rose 21.6 per cent to 190m units, making it the second strongest quarter on record after peak sales of 195m in the fourth quarter of last year, according to Gartner, the technology research firm.In the mature markets of Western Europe and North America, sales were driven by people replacing older models, while in emerging markets growth was boosted by new customers taking advantage of falling prices.European sales rose 10 per cent to 37.4m despite a slow uptake of 3G video and internet-related services.“Users’ lack of interest in 3G services, such as video calling, meant they preferred 2.5G GSM phones to 3G handsets,” said Carolina Milanesi, Gartner’s analyst for mobile terminal research.North America experienced its strongest second quarter on record as sales rose 9.4 per cent to 35.5m. Combined sales in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa rose 37 per cent to 33.6m and in Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) increased 28 per cent to 48.3m.Japan was the only main region in the world that experienced a decline, as sales fell from 10.6m to 10m.“The strength of the world’s mobile phone market in the second quarter of 2005 reinforces Gartner’s view that it will reach 780m units by the end of the year,” said Ms. Milanesi.Among mobile phone manufacturers, the top two market leaders, Nokia of Finland and Motorola of the US, further strengthened their market share, together accounting for half of all global sales. Nokia’s global share rose from 29.6 per cent to 31.9 per cent, while Motorola extended its position from 15.7 per cent to 17.9 per cent.Samsung and LG’s shares also increased, while Sony Ericsson’s and Siemens’ fell.
701;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
702;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-08-22T18:01:08Z;Pricing pressures squeeze profits on PCs;;"Worldwide personal computer shipments are poised to grow 12.7 per cent in 2005, but industry revenues are expected to increase by a mere 0.5 per cent, according to a preliminary report on Monday from market research group Gartner.The study highlights the competitive pricing pressure that has squeezed the largest PC makers, causing industry leader Dell and smaller rival Gateway to issue tepid financial forecasts in recent weeks.Gartner said computer makers had been forced to push desktop PC pricing down to new levels in the struggle to wring growth out of a mature market.The report also said prices for notebook PCs, which
generate higher margins than desktop machines, were dropping more quickly than anticipated. George Shiffler, a Gartner analyst, said the quest for growth was forcing vendors to test the limits of PC price elasticity, a dynamic compounded by the fact that buyers have increasingly come to expect sharp price declines.In the US, Dell sells an entry-level desktop PC for as little as $299, while Hewlett-Packard’s lowest priced offering is advertised at $249.PC vendors have been buoyed by strong demand for portable computers, which are now more affordable for corporate and retail customers. Gartner said worldwide mobile PC units were forecast to grow 31 per cent in 2005.However, the report echoed previous warnings about the speed at which portable PC prices would decline. “The drop in mobile PC ASP [average selling price] has been particularly remarkable,” said Mikako Kitagawa, a Gartner analyst.The research group warned that price pressures was likely only to intensify if unit growth slowed.Gateway, the third-largest US PC maker, last week cut its sales forecast to reflect “competitive pricing pressure” among rivals. Only days earlier Dell said it had missed its quarterly revenue target because it had priced its PCs too aggressively.Dell also rattled investors by issuing a forecast for the current quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations. Hewlett-Packard, the second largest PC maker, last week reported better than expected results as it decided not to reduce prices as sharply as competitors."
703;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-08-11T22:32:15Z;Venture capitalists tune in to podcasts;;The nascent podcasting phenomenon was given a jolt in the arm on Thursday as several top Silicon Valley venture capital funds said they had invested in two start-up firms that aim to popularise and commercialise the tech industry's newest craze.The investments by Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, Charles River Ventures and Amicus Ventures, as well as several prominent high-tech denizens, represent a vote of confidence in podcasting, which some observers believe could transform commercial radio.Podcasts are independently produced audio shows uploaded to the internet so listeners can download and listen to them on computers or portable music players.“This is a whole new forum and medium. It's pretty hard to underestimate the potential for podcasting going forward,” said Michael McGuire, analyst at Gartner.The phenomenon, which takes its name from Apple Computer's popular iPod portable music player, has been a huge hit within a small tech-savvy circle, but the technology required to create, distribute and listen to podcasts remains too complex for mainstream adoption.The two start-ups that received funding, Podshow and Odeo, aim to simplify podcasting with software to create podcasts and enable listeners to download them to their computers.The two start-ups are notable for their pedigree. Podshow was founded by Adam Curry, the former MTV music channel host who helped popularise podcasting last year by co-authoring software that made it easier to download and listen to free podcasts. In May, he began hosting Adam Curry's PodShow, a talk radio, comedy and music broadcast on Sirius satellite radio.Odeo founder Evan Williams started Blogger, the blog-hosting site that helped launch the web-log craze. Odeo will also help match advertisers with new podcasts or enable podcasters to charge subscription fees creating a business model for a medium that is almost completely free today.Podshow raised $8.8m from investors including Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins. John Doerr and Ray Lane, two Kleiner Perkins managing partners, have joined Podshow's board. Odeo did not reveal how much it received from Charles River Ventures and Amicus.
704;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-08-02T21:59:11Z;Handheld computer shipments rise 32%;;Worldwide shipments of handheld computers rose 32 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter, according to the Gartner research firm, putting the PDA (personal digital assistant) market on course for a record year.Gartner said 3.6m units shipped, with 15m likely by the end of 2005, surpassing the record 13.2m shipped in 2001.PDAs have seen many of their functions included in mobile phones and the Gartner figures excluded such “smartphones”, which are part of the much larger handset market.It said shipments of Research in Motion's BlackBerry e-mail devices grew 65 per cent in the quarter to 840,000 units, making it the leading vendor with a 23 per cent market share.PDA sales slumped between 2002 and 2004, but Todd Kort, Gartner analyst, said a combination of factors had led to a recovery.“Wireless PDAs are increasingly seen as an adjunct or alternative to notebook computers, while favourable exchange rates have enabled more Europeans to purchase PDAs at an attractive price,” he said.
705;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-07-18T22:44:48Z;Falling prices open new PC markets;;Falling personal computer prices attracted new buyers in Asia and Latin America and prompted an unexpected surge in worldwide PC shipments in the second quarter, a trend that could contribute to sustained growth, market researcher IDC said on Monday.IDC attributed the greater-than-expected 16.6 per cent rise in global PC shipments to strong demand for laptop computers and falling prices for desktop units. IDC in May said shipments would grow 12.3 per cent in the quarter.Analysts had long believed that the current growth cycle was largely due to current PC owners upgrading their old computersor switching to portable PCs.But IDC and Gartner, a rival research group, said better-than-expected second-quarter shipments pointed to a surge in new users in various emerging markets.“Falling prices are a factor in opening up new markets and attracting new buyers,” said Charles Smulders, analyst at Gartner.Industry observers had believed recent gains in PC shipments would ease once owners had upgraded their machines. But Loren Loverde, analyst at IDC, said the growth in new users had the “potential to provide some longer term growth”.However, Gartner cautioned that growth in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe while better than expected would not be enough to offset an expected slowdown in the replacement PC market, which accounted for an estimated 65-70 per cent of all PC shipments.Mr Loverde said PC shipments in Asia, not including Japan, had hovered in the 13-14 per cent growth range in recent years. However, early estimates suggest PC shipments in Asia grew17-19 per cent in the most recent quarter.Gartner said PC shipments grew 17 per cent in Asia,25 per cent in Latin America and almost 19 per cent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.IDC cautioned it would not change its long-term forecast until it was certain thatsecond-quarter growth could be sustained.IDC's current forecast calls for PC shipments to grow 11.4 per cent in 2005, down from 15.2 per centlast year.IDC also forecast long-term growth of 8-9 per cent annually from 2006-09.The two research firms also reported that Dell continued to tighten its grip on the sector's top spot as it increased its market share lead over rival Hewlett-Packard.Dell's market share increased to 19.3 per centin the second quarter, up from 18.2 per cent in the same period last year,said IDC.Meanwhile, HP's market share remained stable at 15.6 per cent.
706;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-06-29T10:28:18Z;The end of the world is not nigh;;"The case of Gary McKinnon illustrates that computer crime is an international problem.Mr McKinnon, 39, appeared before a court in London this month, accused of hacking into computer systems run by the US military and Nasa in 2001 and 2002. He will return to court on July 27, where he faces extradition to the US. The US authorities claim that his actions cost them $1m.His case, however, is unusual: few hackers face criminal proceedings, let alone extradition. Often, companies that fall victim to cyber crime prefer to avoid the negative publicity that a prosecution would bring.None the less, the threat posed to businesses by hackers and cyber-criminals is a significant one. Estimates by Symantec’s Security Response Lab suggest that the number of mass e-mailer and “blended” threats increased by 400 per cent last year. Symantec’s labs receive between 200,000 and 250,000 submissions of suspect code from customers every month.Businesses, though, need to be wary of letting the fear of cyber crime act as a barrier to technological innovation. According to Gartner, the technology market research company, the risks associated with a number of new technologies are being greatly exaggerated. In turn, this is deterring companies from using innovations that could help them enter new markets, or help them become more efficient.Gartner researchers John Pescatore and Lawrence Orans have identified five “over-hyped” threats: voice over internet protocol; mobile malware; Warhol worms that make the internet unreliable for traffic – named because they give their designer their 15 minutes of fame; regulatory compliance and mobile hotspots. In each case, the hype surrounding the threat is not backed up by reality, the researchers say.
■IP telephony is unsafe: Gartner says that security attacks on internet-based phone systems are still very rare. “There have been a number of articles in the trade press about evesdropping on IP calls, but that is highly unlikely,” says Mr Orans.Listening in on a voice over IP call means having access to the local area network, either because they are physically in the building or because they have hacked into the local area network.“It is unnerving to think of someone listening in, but of course they could also snoop on e-mails,” says Mr Orans. Moreover, the hacks that allow a criminal to evesdrop on an IP call, usually by spoofing an IP address, are detectable. Picking up a wiretap on an analogue office phone system is rather harder.
■Mobile malware will cause widespread damage: With the number of mobile phones in use worldwide heading towards 2bn, the potential impact of mobile malware could be enormous. But mobile anti-virus and anti-malware software represents a huge opportunity for the anti-virus industry.Mr Pescatore says that developing software for mobile devices is a way for these companies to gain sales outside a PC market that is now relatively flat.But chief information would be wrong to invest heavily in local, mobile antivirus software, Gartner says. The number of smart phones and GPRS-connected PDAs – considered the most vulnerable devices to PC-style malware – remains small. Gartner estimates that just three per cent of consumers and knowledge workers have such devices. The smartphone market is also fragmented: researchers do not expect to see a large increase in malware unless one software platform accounts for half the market.Gartner argues that the best place to deal with mobile malware threats is in the network, not on the device itself. Furthermore, CIOs should demand that their wireless providers offer such protection. In the meantime, the malware risk should not deter companies from deploying smartphones.
■Warhol worms will make the internet unreliable for business traffic: “This is an example of where you don’t want to delay or can a project because of an overhyped threat,” cautions Mr Orans. “We have seen examples, such as the SQL slammer that infected computers every eight and a half seconds and did most of its damage in the first 10 minutes. But even then, the internet didn’t collapse.”Gartner says that there have been no live Warhol worm outbreaks since. Companies should continue to switch their wide area network traffic from private circuits such as MPLS and frame relay to internet VPNs, with the switch driven by lower costs and greater flexibility. “Don’t stay away from the net for business purposes,” says Mr Orans. “There were problems a few years ago, but we now know how to respond to threats and how to take appropriate precautions.”
■Regulatory compliance equals security: Gartner sees the pressure to spend on regulatory compliance as a potential problem for companies, because compliance with legislation – such as the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act – does not automatically equate to better security. Companies risk looking at compliance as an IT security issue when in reality it has more to do with how the company is run. “Regulation oftentimes leads to increased reporting, but that is not the same as increased security,” cautions Mr Orans. He points out that Senator Paul Sarbanes himself has criticised the way some companies use the Act as a scapegoat for all manner of IT problems.Regulations, Gartner says, will only rarely address the detail of how IT works, and will also reflect reality only at the point when legislation was drafted. In practice, IT security threats are constantly changing. “Focus on building a secure system and then document the process to show regulatory compliance,” advises Mr Orans.
■Wireless hotspots are unsafe: Some wireless hotspots are undoubtedly unsafe, the report’s authors concede. But this is not news. Threats such as spoof hotspots, used by hackers to collect personal information, have been around some time. It is only when someone coins a neat name for the phenomenon that the threat makes the headlines and moves up the corporate agenda. In this case, “evil twins’ trips off the tongue far more easily than “spoof wireless hotspot”.Corporate users can protect themselves, by using VPN technologies and hotspots that support encryption and the 802.11x security standard. “Businesses want to encourage people to use hotspots, but to use them smartly,” says Mr Orans. In short, don’t believe the hype."
707;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-06-28T11:17:41Z;Computacenter says consumers holding back;;Shares in Computacenter fell sharply on Tuesday after the computer hardware and services reseller painted a gloomy picture of the current quarter and warned there would be no improvement this year.In the latest of a series of warnings, the company said “difficult” trading conditions had continued into the second quarter and forecast that sales for the first half would be 10 per cent lower - although it added that the final figure would “rely heavily on the last few days of the quarter”.In midday trade the shares were down nearly 19 per cent at 188¼p.”The improving trend seen at the end of the first quarter was not sustained and product sales in the second quarter have been below our expectations,” the group said in a trading update. More details about trading and strategy would be discussed at its analyst day conference on July 5, the company added.In April Computacenter cautioned that first quarter sales would be 10 per cent lower as customers bought fewer expensive products, following an earlier warning that unless trading improved full-year profits would be “substantially” lower than last year’s £64.6m. The group repeated the profit warning in its latest statement saying it did not see trading conditions improving for the remainder of 2005.UK-based Computacenter, like many of its rivals, has suffered from a slowdown in corporate spending on computer equipment.Industry analysts at Gartner have forecast PC sales would expand on average just 5.7 per cent a year from 2006 through 2008 compared with average growth of 11.3 per cent from 2003 through 2005.At the same time, a number of computer hardware manufacturers are moving towards the Dell model of selling their products directly to customers rather than using resellers like Computacenter.Reacting to this climate, Hewlett-Packard - Computacenter’s main hardware supplier - tightened its terms of trade with the company for this year. That is expected to result in a £10m fall in profit.In response, Computacenter has been trying to build up its managed services business, which installs computer systems and provides technical support - but this is not expected to make a significant impact on profits for a couple of years. But the company said on Tuesday that the division was growing at a “lower level than anticipated”.
708;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-06-21T22:40:56Z;Cisco's AON technology to aid networks;;Cisco Systems, the world's leading internet equipment maker, on Tuesday unveiled new technology designed to make networks more “intelligent” in order to help corporate customers manage diverse business programmes.The new technology, dubbed application-oriented networking, would make networks faster and more secure by enabling them to read and prioritise data from application-to-application messages flowing within a network such as purchase orders, investment transactions or shipment approvals.Analysts said the technology, which would be embedded into Cisco's routing and switching equipment, represented an important shift from traditional networking gear, which moves data across networks by reading the internet address attached to the outside of each packet of information.Roy Schulte, a research fellow at Gartner, said that by making networks as intelligent as the infrastructure software the companies depend on to manage their data, Cisco's AON technology could change software design and information technology management practices in fundamental ways.Over a shorter term, AON technology blurs the line between infrastructure software and networking technology, said Sandra Rogers, a research director atIDC.Charles Giancarlo, chief technology officer, said Cisco started developing AON technology because most of the software used by corporations consisted of “stovepiped applications” designed to manage customer information, financial records and purchasing data which often did not speak the same language and thus had trouble communicating. Mr Giancarlo said by being able to read entire messages as they passed across a network, AON technology would enable corporations to respond to changing business conditions more quickly. John Chambers, chief executive, said it was “one of the most fundamental changes in my lifetime”.By delivering a product that can handle traditional middleware tasks, Cisco hopes it can garner a share of corporate IT budgets usually earmarked for infrastructure software.Cisco said International Business Machines, the world's largest computer group, and SAP, the world's biggest enterprise resource planning software maker, would develop products compatible with AON.
709;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-06-21T17:12:56Z;Tom Online in Hollywood deal;;Tom Online, the internet portal controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing, the tycoon, plans to continue to upgrade its wireless entertainment content in China after signing an exclusive agreement with the internet unit of Warner Bros this week.The portal, listed on Nasdaq and in Hong Kong, announced on Monday it had won the right to distribute the Hollywood studio's online services to China’s growing number of internet and mobile users.Wang Leilei, Tom Online's chief executive, said on Tuesday the deal with the producer of the Harry Potter movie series would enhance the group’s entertainment content – one of its biggest revenue sources – for its 60m paid mobile users. “So far we have been focusing on music. Our deal with Warner Bros will help us broaden our services,” Mr Wang said.Tom Online is the internet arm of Tom Group, Mr Li’s media flagship. It derives most of its sales from wireless internet services such as mobile games as well as text and multimedia messaging. Half of its wireless revenues come from entertainment-related content downloads.China’s wireless data industry is expected to grow from an estimated $3.76bn in revenue in 2004 to $5.26bn in 2005 and $9.25bn in 2009, according to Gartner, the technology consultancy. Most analysts expect forecast a strong big boost for the sector to receive a strong boost when third-generation mobile services begin in China.Under the deal with Warner Bros Online, Tom Online said the partners had launched a Chinese website for the studio which will allow users to download ringtones and images related to Warner Bros movies and characters.Tom Online is also looking to develop mobile games based on those characters with Indiagames, the Indian game company which sold a majority stake to Tom Online last year.Jim Noonan, senior vice-president and general manager of Warner Bros Online, said it decided to work with Tom Online because of its expertise in the market. “The Chinese marketplace has extremely sophisticated tastes when it comes to online and wireless technologies, and in many cases they are their preferred mediums for consuming entertainment,” said Mr Noonan.Tom Online’s Mr Wang said while the deal with Warner Bros would extend its content offerings, “it won’t be a large part of our revenue because we are already looking at signing similar deals with other entertainment content ­providers”.Mr Wang said the group would continue to focus on developing music content, such as ringtones and video downloads. It plans to train its own web-based pop singers, feeding into a current fever for internet-only songsmiths in China.Tom Online has benefited from strong growth in wireless subscribers in China, which had 335m mobile users at the end of last year. However, revenue growth has slowed due to the government’s recent crackdown on some mobile content providers and falling demand for mobile phone messaging services.In the first quarter of this year, Tom Online's revenue rose to $35.3m, up 36 per cent from the same period in 2004 and 2 per cent from the previous quarter.
710;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-05-25T17:32:25Z;Doubts over Nokia’s latest device;;"Nokia, the world's leading mobile handset maker, yesterday signalled a strategic shift when it unveiled its first portable device without a built-in mobile phone.The new pocket-sized communications device, dubbed the Nokia 770, will enable users to connect to the Internet using a Wi-Fi wireless network.The launch represents a significant departure for the Finnish company which has focused on the mobile phone market since exiting the PC and TV markets years ago.It is the first non-cellular portable device launched by Nokia since it ceased making televisions in 1997 and is due to go on sale in the US and selected European markets in the third quarter priced at $350.Unlike Nokia's traditional handsets, the Nokia 770, which Janne Jormalainen, Nokia's vice president of convergence products, described as ""more of a PC than a phone,"" does not contain a cellular radio chip and uses the Linux operating system rather than Symbian software.Speaking at the launch of the device in New York, Mr Jormalainen said the decision to base the new device on the 'open source' Linux operating system reflected Nokia's belief that Linux ""is the best platform for this type of non-cellualr device.""Initially Nokia expects consumers to use the device, which is a little longer and thinner than a packet of cigarettes and runs for about three-hours on a rechargeable batter, mainly for browsing the Web and sending and receiving email - it includes a stylus-pen and handwriting recognition software.However future versions will also include VoIP Internet telephony and IM (Instant Messaging) software.Nevertheless, industry analysts gave tablet a lukewarm reception and questioned if there was a market for the device, which has relatively low-memory capacity and no keyboard.Ben Wood, an analyst at Gartner, pointed to the failure of similar products - Toshiba's Libretto in the late 1990s and Sharp's Zauraus PDA earlier this decade.""It is a bit of a no-man's land for devices in that it is neither a PC or a phone and where others have failed in the past.""Mr Wood said he thought Nokia had stopped short of shipping the first version of the device with VoIP - allowing users to make very low-cost phone calls over the internet - for political reasons because it could upset its core customer base.One of the most interesting aspects of the launch is the use of a Linux-based operating system. Nokia will make available its 'Maemo' Linux software toolset available to developers - a move Mr Jomalainen said signaled Nokia's decision to actively embrace the 'open source' movement and the Linux operating system for future non-phone products.""Nokia is interested in dipping its toe in the open source community to build up a Linux ecosystem around the device in the hope it will open up new development paths,"" said Mr Wood.Meanwhile, Nokia saw its market share in the mobile phone market in the first quarter dip again in the first quarter against the last three months of 2004.Data released by Gartner showed the Finnish company sold 54.9m devices giving it a 30.4 per cent share of the market in quarter to the end of March. This was down from the 33 per cent share it had in the fourth quarter last year, though Gartner put this down to a traditional first quarter weakness.Nokia had been rebuilding its dominant position in the market towards the end of las tyear after its share slipped below 29 per cent in the first quarter of 2004. Motorola retained second spot with a 16.8 per cent market share, well ahead of Samsung on 13.3 per cent.Overall mobile handset sales reached 180.6m in the first three months of the year, a record for the period, prompting Gartner to lift its full-year forecast for handset sales from 730m to 750m units."
711;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-05-20T15:16:35Z;Vodafone launches simple phone;;Vodafone will next week go back to basics and hope to tap into pent-up demand with the launch of two simplified handsets aimed at older users who are put off by the increasing sophistication of mobile phones.The world’s largest mobile phone operator will launch Vodafone Simply in the UK, Spain and Portugal, offering a choice of two stripped-down phones, that will only make voice calls and send and receive text messages, linked with some of its simpler pricing plans. It will roll the offering out to six other territories over the summer.Vodafone said the phones were targeted at those in the “35 to 40 plus” age group with higher than average incomes who were being put off mobile phones as they became more complicated as technological advances increase their functionality. It could not put a figure on the size of the market.The mobile industry is currently rolling out its latest 3G technology, which offers much faster speeds and will enable users to download video and music tracks, make video calls and watch live TV feeds, with advanced phones that double as cameras and video recorders.The simple phones have been developed after extensive research and feedback with customers in the UK, Spain, German. A survey of 1,200 people in the UK found that more than half the over 55s believed advances in modern technology made life more complicated, although almost all of them accepted those same advances helped them keep in touch with family and friends.Ben Wood, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research group, welcomed the move. “This is a positive move because operators really do need to listen to customers more. The generation gap between younger, more savvy users and older users is going to be bridged by this.”Vodafone will also hope that the initiative could go some way towards addressing the issue of customer loyalty. Operators lose more than a quarter of their subscribers on average as contracts come up for renewal because the market is driven more by the type of handsets available.Rival operators gave a mixed response to the initiative. “We are comfortable with the offerings we already have in the market,” O2 said.But others were more supportive. Niall O’Keeffe, vice-president consumer marketing at Orange said “Anything that makes the customer’s experience easier is always a good thing. Orange Switzerland launched a similar product, Mobi-Click, last year and it has proved very popular.”T-Mobile added: “It is an interesting move which is seeking to address a central issue in the mobile market [loyalty]. There are lots of approaches to this and we prefer our own.”The two phones, made by Sagem of France, have large screens with bigger text and symbols, cues on screen including information on how strong the signal is and three dedicated buttons that take users to the most commonly used functions: messaging, address book and back to the main screen.
712;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-05-12T17:04:33Z;HP's font of all knowledge ready for Dell;;Vyomesh Joshi, the undisputed heavyweight of the global printer industry, was in an assertive mood this week as he discussed Hewlett-Packard's plans to fend off rivals.The head of HP's printing unit confidently told a group of analysts that innovative products, reallocating resources and recently announced job cuts would enable HP to strike back at competitors from a position of strength.But there was one competitor in particular looming large at the analyst meeting. Above all, analysts wanted to know how HP planned to compete with Dell, the giant PC maker that has set its sights on HP's lucrative printing franchise.“Dell is going to be a formidable competitor in the US printing market,” says Peter Grant, analyst at Gartner.Observers got a hint of Dell's disruptive potential a few months ago when HP's printer unit reported less than stellar first-quarter results. Sales within the company's leading business unit rose a mere 2.7 per cent, while operating margin fell from 16.4 per cent to 15.4 per cent. Even worse, HP said it would have to resort to price cuts to regain market share.This was not Mr Joshi's vision for the $24bn-a-year printing division whose powerful brand and innovative products dominate most markets in which it competes.But a number of factors are combining to put the squeeze on HP's crown jewel. The US printer market is maturing most personal computer owners already have printers and rivals such as Epson, Lexmark and Canon are moving aggressively to cut prices.More significant is Dell, which has taken advantage of its direct sales business model to sell printers in an attempt to chip away at HP's lucrative ink supplies business. Dell's printer foray has grown from nothing a few years ago into a business with more than $1bn in sales.HP is also competing against a growing number of so-called ink “remanufacturers” that sell refilled ink cartridges at a discount to the prices HP charges for new supplies. HP, which reports second quarter earnings on Tuesday, can ill-afford to let competitors chip away at its lucrative printing profits, which accounted for about three-quarters of the company's total $4.2bn profit in 2004, even though the printer group brought in less than one-third of its $80bn sales.The wildly profitable printer business has helped prop up other units in the company, particularly PCs and the troubled corporate computer and storage business.Mr Joshi has moved quickly to respond to the challenges. HP began offering price rebates on its popular inkjet printers and this month announced that 1,900 workers had taken voluntary severance packages as part of a larger effort to trim fat and reallocate resources to low-cost countries such as Malaysia. Mr Joshi declined to discuss whether HP could make additional cuts.HP this week unveiled a line-up of laser and inkjet colour printers aimed at small and medium-size businesses, with a promise for further launches throughout the year.HP is confident that despite price competition, its ability to innovate gives it a significant edge over rivals such as Dell, which relies on partners to supply intellectual property.But not all analysts are convinced. Angele Boyd of research group IDC argues that price remains the key factor in the consumer and small business market, which accounts for about two-thirds of HP's printer and supplies sales. “Innovation is important but price is more important and Dell has a powerful model,” she says.Dell has made solid progress with its inkjet printers, which have captured roughly 15 per cent of the US market, and is now targeting laser printers with prices up to half what HP charges for similar products.Mr Joshi retorts that Dell's printer business is tiny compared with HP's and is barely breaking even selling printers and supplies to consumers and small companies.Although Dell has made impressive headway, it must learn how to sell printers independently of PCs and to push into the corporate market, where HP dominates and innovation matters.No one is writing off the champ at this point. Mr Grant says HP has a powerful brand and the experience to adapt to Dell's aggressive pricing tactics. The key challenge for HP's printer unit will be to get back into fighting form.
713;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-05-03T17:47:54Z;Dial ‘0’ for assistance if this all confuses you;;Working under pressure to achieve the often contradictory aims of reducing costs and improving service is the burden shouldered by most customer contact centres. The difficulty many organisations have in achieving these goals has driven the rapid growth of the offshore outsourcing of call centres, but moving operations overseas is just one solution.In fact, call centre agents are only one channel of communication with customers, along with e-mail, web self service and voice portals that use speech automation technology.“You have to get the correct channel balance between the different components,” says Adam Klaber, global customer relationship management partner for IBM Business Consulting Services. “In a perfect world we would like to be able to speak immediately to a person, but similar service can be obtained with a much lower cost mix of channels.”IBM analysis puts the average cost of an agent at $6 a call, whereas speech automation can cost between 75 cents to $1.50. Similarly, Daniel Hong, voice business analyst at Datamonitor reports that offshore call centres can reduce transaction costs by between 25 and 35 per cent compared to domestic services, but that self-service speech-enabled technology can be 15 to 25 per cent cheaper again.Chuck Berger, chief executive of Nuance, a speech technology provider, claims a $5 call with a US-based agent might cost one-tenth of that once automated.While such savings might sound very attractive to the cost-conscious, Alexa Bona, research director at Gartner, warns that there are hidden costs when automating processes. “People don’t realise that when you offer a self-service solution you often need to hire more expensive agents,” she says. “They will be dealing with more complex problems that require judgment or more detailed technical capability to answer. You cannot take your existing agents with their existing skill sets and make them answer more complex inquiries for the same salary.”Ms Bona says that the key to achieving targeted savings lies in ensuring that automated processes are tailored to customers’ needs, and can respond to a broad range of demands with suitable information. This can require a large up-front investment and must be followed by a constant updating process that reflects product and market changes. “You can potentially save 15 to 25 per cent by offshore outsourcing,” she says, “but if you pick the right processes, you can save up to 40 per cent with speech recognition and get payback within a year. However, if you do an unprepared process you can pay 15 to 20 per cent more than using agents in your own country.”Speech automation can be critical for dealing with high volume, low transaction customers. For example, Littlewoods Bet Direct, a UK online betting site, takes 80 per cent of its calls in the five minutes before the start of an event.It channels customers placing bets of £5 or under to NoQ, a service based upon a VeCommerce voice application, leaving agents to deal with its higher stake customers. Phil Morgan, the company’s operations director, reports that this has cut the cost of a call from £1.50 when placed through a domestic outsourcing service to only 40 pence.“Once people experience the speed and convenience of the system, they tend to choose it as their preferred channel, a bit like cash machines,” he says. “It has solved the problem of making low stake gambling commercially viable and helped manage high peaks. It gives us the edge in being able to guarantee to all customers that we can take their last minute bets.”Recent research of managers responsible for call centre operations conducted by Intervoice, a voice technology provider, revealed that while 93 per cent of respondents believe that customers want to speak to a human being, 88 per cent believe customers will never be happy being held in a queue. But a majority regard voice automation in call centres as a better long-term solution to offshoring and three-quarters believe that voice technologies will replace many of the tasks performed in call centres.Mr Klaber says that industries such as aviation and retail have reached self-service levels of 70 per cent, which spreads those costs very widely, while Mr Berger says that Nuance’s most successful clients have achieved 90 per cent, but adds they have worked hard on marketing it as the new way to do business.A survey by ScanSoft, a voice technology provider, showed that the cost of implementing its speech systems was between $0.5m to $5m while average annual savings were $1m and the average payback was nine-and-a-half months.A further incentive for companies to invest in automated procedures is a potential decline in quality in the offshore market.Mr Hong says that as the offshore call centre market matures, it moves to rural areas, where there will not be such high quality staff. “Companies that have offshore call centre operations can further reduce costs with speech,” he says.Paul Barnes, director of Fluency Voice, a provider of speech technologies, points out that every year offshoring gets more expensive, while speech technology gets better and cheaper. “They are still different channels and the best approach is often to blend them,” he concludes.

One technology is likely to be more equal than the other.?Additional reporting by Maija Pesola

717;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-04-20T07:12:41Z;Retailers set the pace in US and Europe;;Wal-Mart, Metro and Tesco may be dominating the headlines when it comes to RFID in retail, but before long they will find others following hard on their heels.Gartner’s latest retailer survey forecasts that within two years almost one-in-three major retailers will be tagging cases or pallets and by 2010 that figure will have risen to two-thirds.“We also found that almost half of retailers questioned wanted to be doing something around item tagging by then as well,” says John Davison, vice president and research director for retail at Gartner G2. “It is going to be difficult, but item level is certainly on the agenda.”“Item level” is seen as offering the greatest potential for delivering benefits by both cutting theft and improving on-shelf availability of high value, multiple choice items such as DVDs and apparel.Working with Kurt Salmon Associates, Germany’s Metro chain carried out an analysis of its early RFID trials held at its “Future Store” in Rheinberg near Düsseldorf: “The main benefits come from item level tagging,” says Gerd Wolfram, IT strategy director for Metro’s IT subsidiary, MGI Metro Group Information Technology. “It is less easy to quantify the benefits for case tagging in the supply chain.”According to the KSA analysis, item level tagging was able to improve product availability by up to 14 per cent and reduce theft by up to 18 per cent, but cost is a major drawback: “Smart shelves are never empty,” says Dr Wolfram, “but the investment is huge, and they are not affordable today.”Tesco has already tested item-level tagging with DVDs and improved on-shelf availability at two test stores by 50 per cent - although, as CIO, Colin Cobain admits, with year-on-year sales of DVDs increasing by 35 per cent, accurate estimates of improvements due to RFID are difficult. Tesco is now extending this scheme to 10 stores to try to quantify the exact benefit of RFID.Apparel, with its complex size and colour variations, is an obvious candidate for item-level RFID allowing rapid and accurate in-store stock checks to improve replenishment.Metro has piloted item-tagging with fashion house Gerry Weber while House of Fraser is also working with its logistics service provider Exel, testing tags on sample batches of clothing imported from China.“The technology is still not totally reliable,” says Paul Richardson, Exel’s divisional director for department stores and fashion. “With a lot of development work we’ve improved read-rates from 50 per cent to close to 100 per cent, but I’m not confident that this level is sustainable in a mass roll-out.”While item-level schemes are still largely experimental, case and pallet tagging supply chain schemes are growing more rapidly. Wal-Mart currently has 137 suppliers sending tagged cartons to three of its Texas distribution centres (DCs). Further extension is planned for June when six more DCs supplying 250 stores come on stream. By 2007 all of Wal-Mart’s US suppliers are scheduled to be tagging cases.Smucker’s Foods has now been tagging its supplies to Wal-Mart - as well as Target and Albertsons - for more than a year. “We’re able to track cases from our production line right to the shelf,” says chairman Timothy Smucker. “Wal-Mart is being very upfront about sharing information but we’re all learning together. We have to be in RFID.”Wal-Mart and other US retailers have been criticised by some for “mandating” its suppliers to tag cartons, but its approach also highlights some significant differences between supply chain systems on either side of the Atlantic.In Europe, goods are generally moved on shrink-wrapped pallets or in reusable trays, while in the US both are rarities and container loads of stacked cartons are the norm.“There is a valid business case for tagging reusable crates in Europe,” says Ard Jan Vethman, European RFID leader at Capgemini, “and it is also a neutral proposition for suppliers since the crates are usually owned and financed by the retailers who will benefit.”Capgemini has worked with Dutch grocery chain Schuitema, partly owned by the Ahold group, on a number of RFID projects and has found that tray tagging is a key area for making quantifiable returns on investment.“We expect to see more reusable tray pools tagged within the next year,” adds Vethman, “although with the very large pools - which can reach 18m on trays - there will need to be investment first in a suitable infrastructure for track and trace.”European early-adopters, such as Metro, Tesco, and Marks and Spencer, have all focused on reusable assets rather than the disposable cartons favoured in the US. Metro started tagging pallets last November, with 20 suppliers shipping a range of goods - both grocery and apparel - to nine of its distribution centres. “Metro is moving forward but progress has not been as quick as initially hoped,” adds Julien Bourdiniére, manager responsible for RFID developments at Kurt Salmon Associates, who has been closely involved with the Metro project.An additional issue for European retailers is that the latest approved operating frequencies provide just 10 channels for RFID use compared with 50 in the US. A “listen before talk” protocol must be adopted to prevent interference and, while tag readers may have a range of only three to four metres for read/write activity, they can “listen” for signals anywhere up to 100 metres away.“There are significant technical issues around operating frequencies,” says Martin Swerdlow, chief executive of Integrated Product Intelligence (IPI), a consultancy which has been involved with many early European retail pilots. “In areas where there are many distribution centres and dozens of dock doors to be equipped with RFID then we can expect some very challenging conditions,” he says.While Metro has started tagging pallets - with plans to move to cases at some unspecified time in future - Tesco is focusing on trays. High value goods are packed into trays and details of the contents written to the tag. This information is read as the trays leave the depot and on arrival at the store as part of the company’s “secure supply chain” initiative.Although in January this year Tesco announced an order for 4,000 RFID readers from ADT and plans to roll-out the system to 1,300 stores and 35 distribution centres (DCs) this year, currently just one DC and 13 stores are using the system: roll-out is expected to accelerate in coming months as supply of readers improves.“We are not planning to tag cases or cartons at this stage,” says Colin Cobain. “We have set up a working group with suppliers to explore opportunities but we want developments to be collaborative.”Gartner’s Mr Davison makes the same point: “A lot of initiatives in retail really have no return on investment. RFID could well be one of those. What is more significant is the process change it has triggered in companies like Wal-Mart and Metro. At Wal-Mart one of the greatest benefits has been that new shifts know where the previous shift stacked in-coming merchandise. The problem was really poor communications, but it has been highlighted and solved by RFID. If companies think RFID will solve a business problem then by re-examining the processes they may well find there is a faster and easier way of identifying the solution.”
718;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-03-23T08:20:23Z;Chris Nuttall: Slugging it out to be the processor inside;;I have just bought a new computer from Hewlett-Packard.It had Intel inside, but it could equally have been an AMD processor, like the one that came with the previous computer I bought. After all, is there any difference in performance in processors per gigahertz to the naked eye?I also went to the Intel Developer Forum this month. Intel was inside the Moscone Center in San Francisco and AMD was outside. Again, there was no difference in performance.Inside, Intel had a panel on virtualisation technologies hosted by a Gartner analyst.Outside, AMD held a rival panel on virtualisation technologies, hosted by the same Gartner analyst.Craig Barrett gave his last big keynote speech at IDF as Intel’s chief - he steps down in May.But AMD was waiting with a stretched limo outside straight afterwards to ferry journalists to a briefing on its big announcements at CeBIT, the IT trade show in Hanover which ran from March 10 to 16.Pluckily and painfully predictably, AMD is always trying to gatecrash its bigger rival’s party.At previous IDFs, it has tried simple stunts such as setting up coffee carts with its logo outside the Moscone and serving free cups of Java. This year, it got more serious.Five aircraft buzzed the Moscone and tried to write AMD Turion 64 in the sky. The wind blew the smoke away before they could even complete the celestial branding exercise.But a curious thing happened, as I thought I saw the smoke reforming into some different names - was it Centrino or CenTurion? Pentium or Athlon or Pentathlon?Funny how the products of INTegrated ELectronics and Advanced Micro Devices sound like prefixes and suffixes sometimes.Their battle is a global one. Intel has been keeping AMD outside in Japan, we learned this month.The Fair Trade Commission there said Intel’s Japanese subsidiary had been anti-competitive in offering lower prices to five OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) if they stopped or reduced purchases from AMD. Intel has said it might challenge the ruling as it has worldwide implications.Intel’s chips are in four out of five PCs sold round the world, but AMD’s market share in Japan rose from 17 per cent to 22 per cent between 2000 and 2002.After putting the squeeze on OEMs, Intel’s share increased to 89 per cent in 2003, according to the commission.The week after IDF, Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee were both inside the Game Developers Conference at the Moscone Center, resolving to have a battle over their claimed superiority for gamers.AMD was showing off with demos of 64-bit games running on its processors, Intel was demonstrating a game running faster on one of its dual-core processors.But it didn’t do either any good, as a monstrous crow called IBM was already inside everything else.Nintendo’s president announced an IBM processor would power its next-generation Revolution console. Microsoft has already settled on a multi-core IBM chip for its next Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation3 will be taking advantage of IBM’s revolutionary Cell processor, whose nine cores put Intel and AMD’s dual-core processors in the shade somewhat.Intel and AMD were thus confined to their regular territory of performance-obsessed PC gamers, but determining which should be inside is becoming unfamiliar ground now the speed benchmarks formerly used to judge them are falling away.Processor speeds are currently topping out at 3.8Ghz - Intel has been encountering problems with heat generation, the higher it goes with speed. What’s more, gamers are more likely to appreciate the speed of the Nvidia or ATI graphics processor (GPU) inside than the CPU as they watch their environments being rendered.So, instead of being judged on their Roadrunner speeds, Intel and AMD these days ask to be valued more for their multifarious Wile E. Coyote methods of getting performance improvements.These include 64-bit, hyperthreading, dual core, virtualisation, cache and input/output improvements, as well as the added chipsets that create the platformised processors Intel claims are its future.They represent both innovation and obfuscation - the different combinations of features make it ever harder to judge who is coming out on top.And as demand for processors in mobile phones and consumer electronics grows, the battle for the PC motherboard seems more of a sideshow than the main event these days.But if you’re thinking of buying a computer, help may finally be at hand if you feel totally confused by now by the relative merits of processors.ECS, the Taiwanese motherboard maker, unveiled a card at CeBIT that allows AMD and Intel chips to sit on the same platform. Unhappy with your Intel processor, just add an ECS daughter card to the motherboard and plug your AMD processor in instead.So, in future, that racket inside your computer won’t be the fan whirring away, it will be Intel and AMD - both inside - fighting over the jumper switches.
719;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-03-23T08:20:23Z;‘Hype’ over offshore centres revealed;;Few topics have been the subject of so much hype - and concern over potential job losses - in western economies as the apparent surge in popularity of offshore customer service centres, especially in India.But new research from Gartner suggests the offshore element represents only a tiny fraction of the worldwide market for customer service outsourcing market - less than 2 per cent this year, increasing to less than 5 per cent in 2007.The overall market is set to grow from $8.4bn in 2004 to $12.2bn in 2007, said the IT research company, highlighting some of the “myths and realities” of customer service outsourcing. Up to 2008, it says, 60 per cent of organisations that outsource parts of the customer-facing process will encounter customer defections and hidden costs that outweigh any potential savings they derive from outsourcing.“Our research shows there are significant risks associated with outsourcing customer service,” said Alexa Bona, research director at Gartner. Most companies neglected to manage the customer service experience sufficiently and often locked the organisation into long-term outsourcing contracts without conducting appropriate pilot testing.She also pointed to risks related to knowledge management and retention, accentuated by much higher staff attrition rates at outsourced contact centres than at in-house facilities, and advised organisations new to business process outsourcing to start by outsourcing onshore. “Don’t be lured by the apparent cost appeal of placing end-to-end customer services processes in the cheapest offshore locations without conducting a thorough assessment of the transition methodologies of the offshore provider, as well as your own ability to manage offshore relationships.”Other researchMention the word “compliance” and vendors’ mouths start to water. Now we know why: US organisations will spend close to $15.5bn on compliance-related activities in 2005, according to AMR Research. Each company will spend on average between $250,000 and $500,000, but some are spending much more because they are using compliance mandates as an excuse to clean out the stables and implement more radical changes.“Companies that see the big picture will put these mandates to work for them and use them as a catalyst to improve or even rethink many parts of their organisations,” says John Hagerty, vice-president of research at AMR.Technology spending is a major part of compliance investment, ranging from 28 per cent of total spending for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance to 42 per cent for HIPAA, the new set of regulations designed to protect patient information in the US health sector. Nevertheless, investment on internal staff is the largest budget item. In 2005, more than 80 per cent of companies expect to have an executive-level compliance officer.There is a “huge pool” of unmanaged data on laptops, mobile devices, and USB memory keys, according to a new report from Butler Group, a research consultancy. The management and security of this data must be tackled immediately, it says in Managing the Storage of Information, as “many mobile devices lack the necessary protection from the dangers found outside the workplace.”“Regulatory requirements also mean that the ability to recover data easily and in a presentable format is more of an imperative,” argues the consultancy. It claims that an inability to source and format data with sufficient integrity can cost an organisation both financially and legally as regulators crack down on failure to discover and retrieve information.How much is mobile content worth? “A conservative estimate is that the mobile content market in Europe is worth €3bn today,” according to Frank Boulben, European vice-president for brand and consumer marketing at mobile operator Orange and a founder member of the Simpay mobile payment system. He was speaking at a roundtable discussion on mobile payment.Industry newsFujitsu is hardly a world player in software but a deal with Germany’s Software AG could change that. The two companies plan to collaborate in the field of software integration and jointly produce a suite of software to allow customers to implement a services-oriented architecture.SOA is the IT industry’s latest three-letter acronym and the idea is attracting a lot of attention. Put simply, an SOA provides a blueprint for redesigning the IT function in terms of business services rather than viewing IT as just a collection of systems and applications.Research firm Gartner says the deal makes a lot of sense as the two companies have complementary strengths. Fujitsu has business process management technology while Software AG has its Tamino XML database, which will form the basis for the first new product to emerge from the deal, a metadata repository.Fujitsu is a major software player in Japan, but has struggled in its attempts to move into North America and Europe. The alliance with Software AG could gives the Japanese giant greater visibility in these two markets, according to Gartner. Software AG, best-known for its Adabas and Natural databases, has tried to reinvent itself around application integration software but has struggled to make much impact on its own because of its small size.Finsiel, the fallen star of Italy’s IT services industry, has finally found a new owner, Gruppo Cos, which specialises in call centres. The deal comes as a relief for incumbent carrier Telecom Italia, Finsiel’s previous owner, which had struggled for years to find synergies between running a telephone network and selling IT services.A decade ago, Finsiel had a billion-dollar turnover and was one of Europe’s largest IT services firms. But its business came almost entirely from lucrative IT contracts from Italy’s then huge public sector. Its tight grip on this market was forced open by European Union directives on competitive tendering and the fallout from “tangentopoli”, a huge corruption scandal that rocked Italy’s state industries and town halls in the mid-1990s.Finsiel’s dolce vita came to an end and the Rome-based group went into a long-term decline - its 2003 turnover was just €729m.Gruppo Cos, which also recently acquired Telecom Italia’s call centre business, trumped EDS and Accenture in the final round of bidding for Finsiel. It is paying just €130m to acquire Finsiel through a joint venture with an Italian investment bank.Products and servicesTexas Instruments, the US semiconductor company, has introduced a single-chip system that will enable mass-market mobile phones to offer voice calls over wireless local-area networks (Lans) too. This feature has been added to some mobile phones already, but typically the more expensive ones. TI is offering a choice of two single-chip systems for so-called voice over wireless Lan (VoWLan).“This (VoWLan) becomes increasingly important to make the ‘one phone’ or ‘universal phone’ concept a reality,” said Marc Cetto, general manager of TI’s mobile connectivity solutions business. “We expect consumers will soon be able to use only one phone for their mobile, office and home phones.”The company says its chips offer smaller size at a lower cost and longer battery life than current solutions. Samples of the chips are expected to be available in the third quarter of this year, with mobiles integrating them likely to be released in the second quarter of 2006.IBM has opened its Blue Gene supercomputer to commercial users who can now access the facility on a pay-as-you-go basis as part of the US computer company’s On Demand initiative. IBM says the aim is to bring supercomputing to customers in market segments that have traditionally not been able to afford to access a supercomputer.Using On Demand, customers can remotely access Blue Gene through a highly secure and dedicated virtual private network and pay only for the amount of capacity reserved.Singapore mobile operator M1 has introduced new tariffs to encourage the take-up of third-generation (3G) mobile. From April 1 till the end of the year, the first five minutes of every video call (incoming and outgoing) will be free. After that, calls will cost S$0.15 per minute, which is lower than the cost of a normal call during peak periods. For video calls made to and received from other mobile networks, the rate of S$0.15 per minute will apply for the whole call.The video call rate is currently S$0.40 per minute, but Neil Montefiore, M1 chief executive, said: “We have reviewed the video call rate in response to customer feedback and market developments…we have decided to introduce more cost incentives for 3G video calls and data usage in general.”
720;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-03-23T08:03:42Z;Getting smart is all about using your intelligence;;“No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others that have been tried from time to time.”The words of Sir Winston Churchill might strike a chord with all those trying to introduce “information democracy” into the modern enterprise.How much simpler it would be to have “information monarchy” - keeping it in one small group’s hands - or “information communism” - where everyone shares the same information, but at such a debased level that it ceases to be any use.Neither is a real option for the modern organisation, however. Each has a large, maybe enormous, store of data that can give valuable insights to users across the organisation, helping them and their company address problems more quickly and exploit opportunities better.If all workers can do this to carry out their respective roles, and when information is uniform and consistent across the enterprise, true “information democracy” could be said to have been achieved.That is the theory, at least. The technology that is meant to help companies get there is business intelligence (BI) software, and judging by the pitfalls that many organisations fall into when implementing it, theory and practice are a long way adrift.“If you ask organisations what they want to use BI for, better decision-making is the top answer,” says Frank Buytendijk, research vice-president at Gartner, the IT analysts. “But most organisations are not making better decisions now than they did five years ago.”At Gartner’s recent BI summit in London, it revealed the five “fatal flaws” for companies implementing BI. The biggest one? Thinking there are only five (the research company identifies seven).There is no doubting the interest in BI - the London event drew 750 attendees and there was a similar shindig in Chicago earlier this month. That is partly because, more than ever, enterprises need BI to be successful now.Mountains of data, growing at 30-50 per cent a year for many enterprises, the increasing burden of government regulation and compliance obligations, competition and customer demands are focusing attention on the need for timely - and often real-time - information, and in plenty of detail.It is not that enterprises have ignored BI over the past decade - one of the problems looks to have been haphazard and chaotic over-investment. The record number of competing or overlapping BI tools that Gartner has found in one organisation is 23.There has also been a widespread failure to realise that any system drawing on a reservoir of data needs some guarantee about the purity of the resource. “There have been a lot of difficulties behind the scenes,” says Kevin Strange, another Gartner expert. “There is a need to allocate resources to look at data quality, and comb through the data to get the right information coming into the data warehouse.”Customers have further reservations: “BI is often presented as a solution that gives you one version of the truth,” says Gabriel Fuchs, chief analytic officer at La Suisse, the Swiss insurance group, and a long-time user and implementer of BI. “But what you get is BI islands, and a lot of different systems that can’t communicate with each other. It often works very well at departmental level, but it rarely works at the corporate level.”Mr Fuchs adds that the tools are very good, but too complex for all but 15-20 per cent of users. These “power users” can take advantage of the tools’ sophisticated analysis and data mining features, but the rest will simply use it as a reporting engine. The result is a great deal of “shelfware,” unused or underused software, sitting around in enterprises.A further problem, he says, is that there are no really easy-to-use models for working out the return on investment for a BI application. In their absence, he says, a key indicator is to see how many people are using it: “If you have 100 licences and only 25 people are using it, it is just not going to work.”Some things are changing for the better, however. Mr Buytendijk and colleague Howard Dresner say it is promising that many large organisations are standardising on a smaller set of tools, deployed to a larger group of people. “It has been such a mess that people need to clean up,” says Mr Buytendijk.The pressure of regulations such as the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, in financial services, the Basel 2 capital adequacy rules, has encouraged companies to “fix up” their practices, he says, even if they are still using BI tactically rather than in a strategic way across the organisation.Improvements in the technology, along with increased computer processing power, are also helping companies at the sharp end of the regulators’ recent muscle-flexing. For these companies the need for speed and detail - or granularity in IT jargon - is becoming paramount.“We are going through a BI journey at the moment,” a business systems executive at one big European bank told the Gartner summit. “We want to ensure we can join financial and business numbers together.” The executive spoke of pressure to “drill back” into detail from relatively high-level, summarised reports, with the intervals between updates coming down from four hours to 15-25 minutes.This real-time, or near real-time, monitoring of business activity - which is akin to pointing a telescope back into the business - is being used by very few companies yet, apart from call centres, says Elaine Fletcher, practice manager for BI at LogicaCMG. Banking is one sector that is leading the field, she says, and activity focuses on “rear-view mirror” analysis designed to monitor and understand patterns.More automotive vocabulary is being borrowed by the BI sector for another key trend - the “corporate dashboard,” a kind of portal for presenting key performance indicators to executives that appears to generate more enthusiasm among business users than independent experts. Mr Buytendijk says the concept recalls the “executive information systems” of the 1980s, with the same mistakes made again - notably, if the dashboard is simply applied on top of poor quality, poorly integrated data. “It’s right at the top of the hype cycle,” adds Mr Dresner. “Why do executives want dashboards? Because their friends have one.”But Mr Fuchs at La Suisse says that, providing the data are reliable, dashboards can give a “nice overview that is simple, standardised and easy to understand.” They are also easier to maintain than the old executive information systems, he says.The investment in modern dashboards needs not be huge, and the savings can be large. An adviser at one big European oil producer told the Gartner summit that it had invested less than $1m in dashboards for tasks such as controlling and improving maintenance, and is saving more than $7m a year.In contrast CPM, or corporate performance management, seems to find favour more with analysts - especially Gartner, which coined the concept in 2000 - than with users. This is not a replacement for BI but encompasses both it and budgeting and planning tools too, so that enterprises have, in the words of Butler Group, another IT research company, “one eye on the past and another on the future,”.That is one interpretation, at least, of CPM, and a Gartner survey of BI spending plans, released at the Chicago event, suggested this will be a priority for many businesses.But for Mr Fuchs it is an acronym too far. “CPM is very much a repackaging of BI,” he says. “It tries to automate BI activities by defining and implementing the processes behind them. It’s just too big and messy and like BI, it’s going to work on a departmental rather than corporate level. How can you efficiently compare performance between different departments that work with different and individual key indicators? Add to this the political aspects within an organisation, and you understand why there is more talk than action.”As for the onward march of “information democracy” within companies, the balance between simplicity and sophistication will remain vital. Gartner says interfaces need to become simpler to satisfy the demands of a large community of casual users, but should be sophisticated enough to deliver value and insight.Ever ready with a new term, it looks forward to an era of “information magnetism,” where useful insights “find” users based on their roles and preferences. This will be a good thing, it says, as more casual users will benefit from BI, improving administrator-to-user ratios.In most democracies, however, there is no obligation on individuals to use all the sources of information available. Mr Fuchs believes the majority of enterprise workers will be happy to access standardised BI reports, leaving the “power users” to do the sophisticated analysis and then distribute the results to people who might need it.Unless their boss tells them to do otherwise, of course. Who said enterprises were ever democratic?Soapbox article by Gabriel Fuchs
721;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-03-23T08:03:42Z;Many players jostle for a small slice of a growing market;;"Business intelligence has been part of the enterprise software landscape, in one form or another, for as long as 30 years. But unlike other key business software markets, such as infrastructure databases or desktop productivity applications, business intelligence has been slow to mature.While other software markets have consolidated, usually within their first 10 years, fragmentation remains a key characteristic of business intelligence. IDC calculates that the business intelligence market was worth $3.9bn in 2003, with growth at 5 per cent. However, there is no single player dominating the market. In fact, competition in business intelligence is growing as mainstream enterprise software companies, and in particular SAP and Oracle, invest in business intelligence products.The largest business intelligence vendor, measured by revenues, is Business Objects. The company’s acquisition of Crystal Decisions has almost doubled turnover to over $400m annually. The next-largest vendor is Cognos, at $300m, followed by Hyperion at around $240m. However, these figures do not include business intelligence software sales from the likes of Oracle, Siebel, SAP or Microsoft. IDC figures, for western Europe in 2003, place SAS second in the market after Business Objects and rank SAP fourth, ahead of Hyperion.Most of the enterprise software and infrastructure vendors do not break out revenues by individual product lines. However, the importance of business intelligence to the enterprise software companies cannot be overstated. Oracle executives used the high-profile platform of the company’s OracleWorld conference in San Francisco last December to brand Oracle business intelligence as a separate product, in order to attract orders from companies that might not use the Oracle database or applications. SAP continues to see BI as an important area for growth.Keith Gile, US-based analyst at Forrester Research, says that business intelligence software is moving into new areas of companies’ operations. Forrester divides business intelligence into three layers: strategic, tactical and operational, with the user’s tolerance to data latency one of the key differentiators. Strategic planning can readily make use of data that might be weeks old; operational BI users might need data that are close to real time.Mr Gile points out that most business intelligence software sold so far has been developed to help companies with their strategic decision making. This is where the pure-play business intelligence vendors have, so far, done well.The BI specialists have, though, made fewer inroads into areas where tight integration with transactional systems is a must. Mr Gile classifies this as tactical and operational business intelligence. The need for close integration with other enterprise computing applications, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or supply chain management favours the enterprise software companies. “The best-of-breed business intelligence vendors are good at aggregated data,” he says. “We are seeing the [enterprise software] platform vendors play more at the tactical and operational levels.”At the operational level especially, CIOs are faced with a choice not just between a business intelligence specialist and an enterprise software company’s offerings, but also in-house development. Forrester estimates that only 5 to 10 per cent of companies use business intelligence at the operational level. Those that do are likely to write their own code.Research by Gartner suggests that this is changing. The analyst house predicts that most organisations will aim to use packaged business intelligence software, rather than bespoke applications, by 2007. But Gartner stresses that companies should develop a business intelligence strategy, and then conduct a “build versus buy” analysis before making a choice between writing a program in house and buying in a package.Interest in packaged business intelligence - whether from an enterprise software company or a specialist - is being driven by greater maturity in supporting technologies. “Business intelligence has needed a lot of other technologies to mature and come into place,” says John Kopcke, chief technology officer at business intelligence vendor Hyperion. “When we first went into decision support systems, we had to find the data and had to assume that the user had a terminal to get to that data. Now there is richness of data sources, and the browser is ubiquitous. So the underpinnings are in place for the business intelligence market.”Gartner expects the business intelligence market to grow steadily over the next three years, with spending on business intelligence boosted by sales from the enterprise applications and database vendors, as well as by growth from the pure-play business intelligence companies.The market opportunity for both specialists and general software companies is large. Current estimates from the main analyst houses suggest that between 5 and 15 per cent of staff within businesses have access to business intelligence tools.The real growth opportunity lies in persuading CIOs that there is a business case for delivering business intelligence to the remaining 85 per cent. Achieving this will require significant changes, both in how business intelligence is sold and how it is delivered.Mr Gile maintains that the pure-play software companies will not be able to expand business intelligence take-up to any significant extent, unless they move away from a per-user licensing model. And all the BI vendors will have to work harder to deliver business intelligence functionality to a much wider user base.Here, database and enterprise software companies will have an advantage, if customers’ staff are already familiar with their interfaces or portal applications. And vendors such as Business Objects are making much of their integration with Microsoft’s desktop tools as a way to increase the reach of BI.The specialist vendors also emphasise the advantage of opting for one, integrated business intelligence environment, which can in turn serve as a window on to other enterprise applications, especially for non-specialist vendors.Predictions from Gartner support this. Although database and enterprise software companies will expand their BI revenues between now and 2008, the specialists, with revenues of close to $2.2bn, will continue to outsell enterprise software vendors by five to one. Integration with multiple data sources remains the specialists’ key selling point. “By its very nature business intelligence is about bringing information together from multiple sources,” says John Kopcke at Hyperion."
722;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;CRM adapts to pay-as-you-go;;When US-based Siebel Systems moved late last year to deliver its customer relationship management (CRM) package as an online service for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it marked an important step in the development of hosted application services. For the CRM market leader to acknowledge, albeit belatedly, that smaller businesses could benefit from better CRM put the seal of approval on this “pay-as-you-go” approach to using business software.According to Gartner, 30 per cent of US SMEs will be using some form of on-demand service to support their CRM initiatives by the end of 2007.Online service pioneers, including Salesforce.com and RightNow Technologies, grew in stature during 2004 and showed that it was possible to deliver simple IT applications through the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. The supplier takes full responsibility for providing software and hardware resources, security and back-up and the customer pays according to how much they use the application.This approach obviously appeals to organisations that either cannot afford, or do not want, to take responsibility for application development and IT support.“We see it as a utility - like electricity. You don’t have a power station in your back garden - so why not use the internet as the utility to deliver the services you want without the complexity of a huge IT department,” says Phill Robinson, senior vice-president of global marketing at Salesforce.com. “We are not really a software company - we are more like a telephone company with 213,000 subscribers.”CRM he adds, is an example of an application which is usually associated with larger companies. Making it available as a pay-as-you-go service opens the door to a wider market.Salesforce “subscribers” come in all shapes and sizes and some are very enthusiastic about the service. “We use Salesforce to manage our student database. It has allowed us to use the business model we preferred. We wanted to run a successful business - but balance it with a particular lifestyle,” says Lucy Carter, managing partner of the Oxford College of Marketing.“We have no office or headquarters - we run completely virtually with staff dotted all over the country. But now when we have a new contact, it is filed in the student database and we all have access to it. We can manage them through the process because we know what they have been sent and the stage they have reached,” she says.“We do more than just sell courses - we also want to help students with career development But with spreadsheets and paper records, we could not do this in a structured way. As we have grown, we needed a way of tracking the conversation with the student and this is what Salesforce has given us. But it is more than getting at the information easily - it has actually allowed us to do the job.”Not surprisingly the growing market for online services has attracted big players including Microsoft, Oracle and, of course, Siebel. But they have found there are significant differences between the large enterprise and the SME markets.“We knew hosted services worked for large organisations and decided to build a strategy for SMEs around hosting. SMEs are resource constrained. They have a small or no IT departments, have less capital and less assets and yet, they must compete in the same arena as larger enterprises,” explains Bruce Cleveland, global head of on-demand services at Siebel.SMEs, he says, also have a different approach to buying technology. “SMEs tend to buy products based on testimonials - they do not have resources for research. At least 50 per cent prefer to buy from a local reseller.”Gerry Carr, marketing manager for CRM solutions at software developer Sage, also sees differences in the SME approach to IT.“In the SME sector there are all sorts of small vertical markets and they look for a lot of technology out of the box. They don’t want to get involved in large projects and employ IT experts. Hosted services are obviously appealing to this market - but it is still a minority,” he explains.“But there are advantages - all you need is a web browser and a good technology solution. For the smaller business it is fine - but it does have limitations.”Mr Carr adds that once companies reach a certain size, they are likely to need some sort of customisation and then the costs can rise. “If you start scaling above 25 users you could see a large monthly bill and this might be the time to bring it in house,” he says.Mr Robinson from Salesforce acknowledges that growing businesses need scope to scale up their IT support. “We sell to big enterprises too. The economic benefits are just as compelling for larger companies,” he says.One approach to scalability is to offer the option of bringing the application service in-house when it reaches a certain size.“There are some important questions for SMEs to ask before they commit to a hosted service. How long do I want to rent? How many restrictions am I prepared to accept? And how comfortable am I having my core business data outside the firewall?” says Brad Wilson, general manager for Microsoft’s CRM product.”We work on a multiple business model where companies can start by hosting the application and then transfer to an internal service when it grows. In the end hosting is about hiding complexity and making the software easier to use.”One way or another hosted services, and in particular CRM, look set to grow as an important way to deliver IT support. “In five years time, every application will be delivered this way,” says Mr Robinson.

724;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-03-03T18:41:49Z;Labels demand a bite as Apple calls the tune;;"Only recently Steve Jobs was seen as a saviour by the world's largest music labels. Beset by internet piracy and slumping sales, the music industry was in need of salvation when Mr Jobs, Apple Computer's chief executive, arrived with his iTunes online music store.The user-friendly service was an instant success, introducing millions of paying customers to the world of 99-cent digital downloads. Two years later, customers have bought more than 300m songs from Apple's online store, giving Apple a 65-70 per cent share of the digital music market. Toss in 10m iPod music players and Apple has emerged as a giant in the marketplace.But the world's big music labels have mixed feelings about its success. They believe the computer-maker has become both so profitable and so powerful in this market that they should push to raise wholesale prices to capture a larger share of the spoils. Apple is understood to be angry at the move.The clash highlights growing tensions as the music industry and Mr Jobs compete for position in a digital media marketplace that is only beginning to be established.It pits Apple's powerful music platform against labels struggling to redefine an industry being turned upside down by new technologies. Michael McGuire, Gartner analyst, says: ""It is far too early and way too volatile to say who will win. The momentum right now is with Apple, but Apple also depends on the record labels for content.""The record companies say introductory wholesale prices for digital downloads - thought to be 65-70 cents per track - were set low to stimulate demand for online music sales. Now, the success of Apple's music store has prompted concern that digital download prices may be too low.It is not yet clear by how much the labels hope to raise prices, but rates paid for mobile phone ringtones are roughly 10-15 per cent higher than digital downloads. Some executives would like to introduce variable pricing for online music sales so they can charge higher wholesale prices for top hits and other special tracks.The music industry's move suggests several labels believe demand for online music is robust enough to withstand higher prices, although online sales are estimated to account for about 2 per cent of total music sales. However, at least one label says it will not raise prices.Word of the pricing move comes as the European Commission has announced it will investigate allegations that Apple is unfairly charging up to 20 per cent more for music downloads in the UK than it does in the rest of Europe. Apple charges UK users about 83p a track compared with about 52p in France and Germany. Apple says its pricing was based on ""the underlying economic model in each country"".Industry analysts believe any move that would drive the prices higher could have an adverse effect because most consumers who buy music over the internet now expect to pay no more than 99 cents (52p) to download a song to their computers. ""It's a fool's errand to force Apple to raise prices above $1,"" says Phil Leigh, analyst at Inside Digital Media.Mr Leigh says a price increase now would redirect consumers towards internet piracy, which is estimated to cost the music industry about $2.4bn a year.The number of illegally downloaded music tracks still far outstrips legal online sales, in spite of the growing popularity of internet music stores and an aggressive industry campaign to sue pirates.But record companies may believe the so-called $1 per track price barrier is, in fact, mythical. Also, industry research indicates that iTunes' paying customers are not the same aficionados who steal files through pirate services.Increasing their cut may be only part of the reason why some labels would push for higher wholesale prices. There is also mounting worry in the industry over Apple's growing clout in the digital music market.Neither Apple's music store nor its iPod player are compatible with other products and services and labels are concerned Apple will become too powerful if consumers continue to buy into its digital platform.""There is a real fear that Steve Jobs is the only one out there with any real traction,"" says one music industry official. ""It's got to a point where interoperability is vital.""The most notable alternatives include monthly subscription services, such as Napster and RealNetworks's Rhapsody. They use interoperable music formats and let customers listen to as many songs as they want on their computers for about $10 a month. Subscribers who pay a bit more can listen to their music on portable players as long as they continue their subscriptions.Music labels are reluctant to endorse one business model over another, but it is noteworthy that they are not looking to increase subscription service charges.Mr Leigh argues that monthly services allow consumers to browse through vast quantities of music, offsetting one of the main advantages of illegal peer-to-peer services. Subscription services also provide recurring and relatively predictable revenue streams.The digital music market will become more crowded this year. Music labels have already signed deals with wireless phone carriers in Europe and the US to roll out music streaming and download services to mobile phone subscribers - a market that dwarfs the number of iPod owners.The eventual winners and losers in this market remain unclear - but one certainty is that the tension between Apple and the labels marks the beginning of the battle for dominance in the digital music market."
725;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-03-02T18:46:13Z;Motorola seizes Samsung's place;;Motorola regained its position as the world's second-largest mobile phone maker in the crucial fourth quarter last year, pushing rival Samsung of South Korea back into third.The US handset maker sold 31.7m units, securing a 16.3 per cent market share in the three months to the end of the year, which included the key Christmas period, far outstripping Samsung's market share of 12.2 per cent.The data released on Wednesday by Gartner, the technology research house, shows a swift turnround in fortunes for Motorola, which in the third quarter had seen its share of the market slip to 13.4 per cent, allowing Samsung to clinch second spot for the first time with a 13.8 per cent.Ben Wood, principal analyst at Gartner, said the US manufacturer had been helped by the halo-effect of its well-received RAZR V3 handset in Europe and North America.?RAZR V3 did not deliver millions of units for Motorola rather it is an iconic product that helped re-establish its brand,? he said.The US group was also helped by aggressive pricing in markets in Asia-Pacific and Latin America.Mr Wood said Motorola's push into emerging markets with handsets for less than $40, announced recently, meant Samsung would be hard pushed to regain the second spot unless it changed its strategy of staying with higher margin units.?Samsung is very, very competitive and would love to be number one so it could lead to a strategic shift on their part, but right now Motorola has seized the initiative,? he said.The data from Gartner, considered one of the main yardsticks for the industry, also confirmed that Nokia, the world's largest handset maker, was continuing to stabilise its market share at the end of 2004 after a disastrous start to the year.The Finnish company secured 33 per cent of the market in the fourth quarter, down slightly from the 34.7 per cent a year earlier. Nokia's failure to read customer trends led its market share slip to just under 29 per cent early last year.Fourth-quarter sales left Nokia in top spot for the year with a 30.7 per cent share, Motorola on 15.4 per cent and Samsung on 12.6 per cent.
726;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-02-27T21:54:50Z;Labels try to raise prices for music downloads;;Some leading music labels are in talks with online retailers to raise wholesale prices for digital music downloads, in an attempt to capitalise on burgeoning demand for legal online music.The moves, which suggest that the labels want a bigger slice in the fledgling market's spoils, has angered Steve Jobs, the Apple Computer chief executive who is behind the popular iTunes online music store.But music executives expressed caution about their ability to push through unilateral price increases. Among the biggest groups, Universal Music and Sony BMG are known to be particularly reluctant to disrupt the market for downloads. One top label said it would not raise wholesale prices now because the market was not yet mature enough for a price increase.The three other music labels which also include EMI and Warner refused to comment.Analysts, meanwhile, are warning that price rises could exacerbate internet piracy, which is thought to cost the industry about $2.4bn a year.Music industry executives said introductory wholesale prices for digital tracks had been set low to stimulate demand for online music sales but the success of Apple's music store had prompted concern that they may now be too low. The effort suggests several labels believe demand for online music is robust enough to withstand higher prices, despite the fact that online sales are estimated to account for about 2 per cent of total music sales.Michael McGuire, analyst at Gartner, said the move could backfire because consumers who buy music over the internet have become accustomed to paying 99 cents or less to download tracks.Wholesale prices are thought to be about 65c. ?It seems to me to be singularly bad timing,? he said, adding that a price increase now could send music fans back to underground peer-to-peer services where they could get illegal music tracks for free. The number of illegally downloaded tracks still far outstrips legal online sales, despite an aggressive industry campaign to sue people who illegally share music.The efforts to raise prices appear in part to reflect frustration over Apple's wildly successful music strategy. Its online store has sold more than 200m songs and accounts for about 65 per cent of all legal downloads.These sales have been instrumental in turning the company's iPod digital music player into the world's hottest consumer product. ?Our music is not something to be given away to sell iPods,? said one industry insider.Many in the music business also expressed concern over Apple's growing clout. This stems from the fact that Apple's music store and player are not compatible with any others. One fear is that Apple will become too powerful if consumers continue to choose its digital music platform. Apple declined to comment.It was not immediately clear by how much the labels hope to raise prices but one executive said rates for mobile phone ringtones are roughly 10-15 per cent higher than digital downloads.Others said the labels wanted to introduce variable pricing for downloads so they could charge higher wholesale prices for top hits and other special tracks.

Deadline for completion of articles: March 9We plan to include the following features:Cover story package1-5. Business intelligence
As enterprises grapple to make sense of their past investments in BI, we look at the outlook as the ever-growing data mountain, compliance and regulation increase the pressure on companies to use BI correctly for monitoring and understanding their businesses in real time. A second article will look at vendor selection issues from the perspective of CIOs - should they choose pure-play BI vendors or the enterprise software giants? Also, there will be two interview pieces with the chief executives of SAS Institute and Business Objects. And we hope to take a look at BI “competence centres” within companies - identified as a growing trend by Gartner but are there any enterprises out there prepared to talk about their competence centre? Package by Andrew Baxter, Michael Dempsey and Stephen Pritchard6. News sectionRegular review of new products and services aimed at enterprise IT customers, and recent independent research results.

CIO panelOnce a month a leading group of CIOs from the UK and Europe -The Deloitte CIO panel - will give up to the minute views on a topical issue.9. Opinion ColumnAlan Cane’s Viewpoint columnMain theme: IT for SMEs, Part TwoIn the second of this three-part series we look at how some topical trends in enterprise IT and telecoms and their relevance to, and adoption by, the SME sector worldwide.10. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)Various flavours of Voice over Internet Protocol have made the transition from nice idea to useful service. In particular, cut-price IP telephone services from companies such as Vonage and Skype have generated yards of press coverage and brought some savings to SME customers and consumers alike. But IP-based telephony promises a barrage of other benefits: ‘Follow-me’ hotdesking, SIP-based instant messenger presence services, and even video conferencing. Big businesses have struggled to make these services work, so will SMEs fare any better? Ben King11. RFID in the supply chainSMEs have become inured to the successive waves of supply chain technologies that large customers have forced them to adopt. The next mandate will require SMEs to apply radio frequency identification tagging. What will implementation of RFID entail for SMEs and will they get any benefits? Nuala Moran12. Enterprise softwareForget pricey enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, for many SMEs the software that runs their business is a simple Excel spreadsheet. Recognising the traditional suspicion of SMEs towards enterprise software, the big vendors have tried for many years to come up with new channel strategies and product offerings designed to conquer this notoriously difficult market. Success has mostly been modest, but analysts believe prospects are looking more favourable, particularly now that big vendors are adopting simpler pricing strategies and have largely dropped their “rip and replace” approach in favour of products that coexist with existing software. Geoffrey Nairn13. DatabasesLeading database vendors IBM and Oracle are looking to the SME market for expansion, and downsizing their products accordingly. But as in the ERP field there is the threat of Microsoft - which has ambitions in the SME market – and also there is emerging open source database technology, notably MySQL, which is reckoned to be approaching some sort of reliability. This competitive market gives SME lots of choice - but how do they choose the best option? Philip Manchester14. Mobile workingHere we look at the extent to which SMEs are mobilizing their workforces and the ways in which this differs from the approach taken by big corporations. The impression is that so far SMEs are using mobiles only for voice and e-mail, but that this is expected to change quite quickly. And might SMEs move faster than big corporation precisely because they have much smaller investments in existing fixed-line IT systems? Neil McCartney15-17.

728;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-02-23T07:58:53Z;It’s hard to measure the efficiency of moving targets;;"Many organisations claim productivity benefits from mobile technology. However, the majority of claims relate to field-based staff such as engineers, inspectors and sales staff. It would be surprising if there were no productivity improvements there.Figures for office-based staff who travel as part of their job are harder to find but are available. However, they are usually based on staff identifying additional productive time without any base figures to compare.“Industry has a widespread lack of databases, bad data that is not kept up to date and no culture of measuring things,” says Shirley Dex, professor of longitudinal social research at London University. “Most companies can’t say what effect changes in working practices have on productivity because they couldn’t measure productivity at all.”Nick Jones, vice-president and fellow at Gartner agrees and says that organisations are bad at measuring performance in many contexts and are not good at knowing the cost of time. “If you don’t know that, you are not well placed to measure productivity of mobile technology,” he says.Atos Consulting recently ran an internal trial with 3G mobile datacards. It found that 85 per cent of users converted downtime – non-productive or non-working time – to productive time, saving an average of two to three hours a week.In 2004, Research in Motion commissioned independent research from Ipsos Reid on return on investment from its BlackBerry mobile electronic mail device. This showed that the average end user converted 54 minutes of downtime into productive time each day. Assuming a five-day working week and 50 working weeks per year, this equated to 196 hours per user per year in recovered downtime. It also increased the efficiency of their teams by 29 per cent, which equated to $21,750 per user per year based on international employee productivity data.One company that did take base measurements was Intel, the computer chip manufacturer. To determine whether there was a business case for updating its mobile technology, it upgraded 100 users across all functions to the latest wireless enabled notebooks. In performance tests it found that its users were able to complete a set of common tasks 37 per cent faster on average. Logs showed that employees were saving two hours and eight minutes a week, which is about 5 per cent, and equates to 100 hours a year of extra work time available for each knowledge worker.“That can be significant if you have a company with tens of thousands of employees,” says Martin Curley, Intel’s global director of IT innovation, who was responsible for the trial. “That kind of benefit can be a significant competitive advantage. For 25,000 knowledge workers, that is equivalent to adding 1,250 experienced employees to the payroll.”In response to criticisms from user organisations about the lack of productivity from information technology, the Information Work Productivity Institute (www.iwproductivity.org) was set up in April 2003. Its objective is to study information work productivity and profitability. It is sponsored by Accenture, Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft and Xerox.“The sponsoring companies realised that in the past we haven’t done a very good job of measurement,” admits Craig Samuel, chief knowledge officer at HP Services. He says measurement allows targets to be set and progress monitored. This helps business leaders to have confidence that they are selecting the investment options that offer the best returns.Traditional productivity measurements are based on outputs, such as sales or engineer visits per week or the number of customer problems solved in the first call.“You need to look at more than just quantity of outputs, as you are also interested in quality,” says Mr Samuel. “You need to measure how work is done, not just what is done. Just overlaying existing business processes with mobility will not unlock the full value potential. Do not think about re-inventing the business process, think about re-inventing the work itself.”The institute has already developed a “Clear” methodology for the five dimensions of productivity. These are Consistency of execution; Leverage of resources; Efficiency of operating; Alignment of capabilities and business goals; and Relevance of outcomes to goals. Consistency, leverage, alignment and relevance all contribute to effectiveness.Research shows that efficiency is primarily driven by group collaboration technologies, such as groupware, team collaboration, internet telephony and mobile computing.Effectiveness is aided by enterprise computing technologies, such as enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, business intelligence and document management and core communications technologies such as electronic mail and search engines.Analysis of financial data suggests that efficiency has a significant impact on improvements in return on equity and effectiveness had a significant impact on improvements in gross margins, operating margins and return on assets.“Although it is a catalyst, technology only contributes 10 per cent of the solution,” says Mr Samuel. “Between 20 and 30 per cent of the solution is processes and the rest is people, culture and behaviour. But all three have to be addressed.”Productivity is important, says Mr Jones at Gartner but the objective of mobile applications is also to explore new capabilities or opportunities. They are not just about cost savings or measurable return on investment, because organisations are trying to acquire new skills. “The key is to start out by agreeing what you would like to achieve and your success criteria. You then measure it before and after so that you can determine what you have achieved.”"
729;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-02-15T18:29:43Z;Tech rivals prepare to march to same tune;;"It may not be the bridal march, but last Monday music seemed to herald a closer relationship between Nokia, the world's number one supplier of mobile phones, and Microsoft, the software giant.In Cannes the two fiercely rival technology groups agreed to work together to allow digital music to be easily transferred between personal computers and phones, both hoping to profit from the potential boom in handsets that play music.Nokia was not alone in following the music in Cannes. Sony Ericsson, the world's sixth-largest mobile maker, also announced it would start marketing handsets under Sony's Walkman brand.So why is music suddenly top of the mobile agenda? After all, Nokia launched its first music phone, the 3300, in 2002 and in many mid-range phones a music player is now standard. Yet Peter Löfström, a salesman in the Phone House store in Stockholm, says few customers ever ask about the feature. “Many don't know it is there,” he says.The push partly reflects the need for the phone manufactures to find new features to excite users to upgrade their handsets. Camera phones, the last major innovation, have been on the market for more than four years. As Ben Wood, a researcher at Gartner explains, “it is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate yourself with a camera; there has been a commoditisation of the feature”.The rush to music is also a reflection of events outside the industry, most notably the success of Apple's iPod, which has defined the market for the portable digital music player. Phone manufacturers see themselves taking a chunk of this market.The ever-shrinking cost of memory capacity means it is now economical to store a more useful music library on a mobile handset. For example, Sony Ericsson says that for any phone to have the Walkman brand it must be able to hold at least 10 CDs' worth of music.Nokia's latest moves also highlight the change in the environment around the handset, such as the progress made by Loudeye in establishing a music catalogue and a platform that can enable telecoms operators to deliver music wirelessly. Then there is the alliance with Microsoft, which will enable users to download on their PC's and then transfer to a Nokia phone.But not everyone is convinced about the scale of the music boom. The iPod has sold about 10m units since its launch in 2001, compared to handset sales of more than about 650m last year. Moreover, it is questionable how much the telecom operators will be able to earn from music downloads.As Mr Wood points out, the deal with Microsoft underlines just how PC-centric the model of digital music has become. Perhaps rather than trying to use music to create new revenue streams, the operators will see the devices as a way of attracting younger users to their networks.But does the tie-up with Microsoft mean Nokia has abandoned its resistance to using the US group's software on its handsets? And if so, does it run a greater risk of seeing the mobile handset business turn into a mirror-image of the PC business?The sight of a Microsoft executive on the Nokia stage was a shock to many in Cannes this week. “You just couldn't have imagined this happening a year ago,” one watcher remarked.This week's link with the software giant extended into the corporate software business to make it easier for Nokia handsets to receive and send e-mail and synchronise with PCs.Last year's slip-ups, when Nokia missed trends such as the popularity of the clamshell handset design and mid-market camera phones, may have made it re-evaluate key ideas. Analysts suggest the increasing number of Nokia executives with experience outside the Finnish group has also made it more open to collaboration.Yet on Monday, Nokia was still keen to stress that the co-operation did not extend to handset operating systems. Rather, it is a question of compatibility between specific software programmes. For example, Windows Media Player will not be installed in the Nokia handsets, rather Nokia's software will be able to read Windows Media Audio files.If anything, some analysts suggested the move could even weaken Microsoft's case to get mobile handset makers using its mobile operating system. Richard Windsor of Nomura said: “We think this is a body blow to Windows for Mobile as this announcement will allow Nokia devices to perform as well as Microsoft in corporate e-mail.” Yet the sight of Microsoft and Nokia agreeing to collaborate is a sign of how far both companies have come in their new openness to industry partnerships and how far the convergence of mobile communications and computing may yet change the technology landscape."
730;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-02-14T07:42:24Z;Strong mobile sales boost global PC shipments;;Worldwide PC shipments in 2004 increased 11.9 per cent from 2003, due to strong mobile PC sales, according to preliminary results by Gartner. Overall fourth quarter 2004 PC sales were in line with projections, despite some weakness in the US consumer market. Overall lower prices, better performance and wireless accessibility accelerated mobile sales.Dell strengthened its lead in the worldwide vendor market with solid performance in all regions. In the fourth quarter, falling component prices allowed Dell to further lower prices and gain margin and market share.Hewlett-Packard’s PC shipments increased 12 per cent in 2004, however the company did face some challenges at the end of the year. In the fourth quarter, HP’s growth rate was lower than the worldwide average due to slower sales in its key US and Europe, Middle East and Africa (Emea) markets.During the fourth quarter, IBM announced that it would sell its PC business to the Lenovo Group of China. Lenovo will move up to third place in the worldwide PC market rankings after the acquisition is completed. In November, before the IBM-Lenovo announcement, Gartner forecast that three of the top 10 PC manufacturers worldwide would leave the business by 2007.In the US, PC shipments totalled 62.3m units in 2004, an 8 per cent increase from 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the consumer market showed mixed results, with weaker than expected desktop growth, but very solid notebook market growth.In the Europe, Middle East and African (Emea) region, PC shipments totalled 61.7m units in 2004, a 14 per cent increase from 2003. In the fourth quarter, shipments totalled 19.5m units, a 12.6 per cent increase from the fourth quarter of 2003.During 2004, there was double digit growth throughout the year. The market in Europe was strengthened by favourable exchange rates, strong mobile growth and by businesses finally replacing their PCs. However, with small and medium businesses leading the growth again in the fourth quarter, it is clear the replacement cycles is coming to an end.In 2004, Dell and Acer gained most share, acquired in the mobile PC segment. Both increased their total market share by 1.5 per cent compared to 2003. Hewlett Packard faced profitability challenges during 2004 and recorded the lowest growth among the top five vendors.In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Emea market saw weak desk-based consumer growth. However, this was balanced out by very strong demand for consumer notebook PCs, driven by low entry-level price points. On a vendor basis, Acer produced the strongest market growth yet again, with 35.5 per cent year on year growth in the fourth quarter.It posted strong growth in shipments of desktop PCs and extended its lead in the Emea mobile PC market. Hewlett-Packard’s market focus remained inconsistent with a poor quarter compared with its main rivals. Despite achieving strong growth in the consumer PC market, HP’s shipments of commercial PCs were flat year-on-year, leading to only single digit growth overall.The EMEA PC market continues to be dominated by the larger players as the top 10 PC vendors gained almost 4 percent market share over the rest of the market. In 2005, Gartner foresees growth in EMEA to slow down creating a very challenging environment, which will become even more competitive as IBM/Lenovo reveals its strategy.In the Asia/Pacific region, shipments increased 13.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2004. Both China and India showed strong growth. During the fourth quarter, many vendors typically stimulate demand with aggressive prices and accessory bundles.Latin America showed the strongest fourth quarter growth, with PC shipments increasing 24.7 per cent. Gartner analysts said PC ownership continues to be driven by increased awareness, cheaper and more available credit, lower prices and the appearance of new brands, such as Gateway in Mexico.Charles Smulders, vice president of Gartner’s Computing Platforms Worldwide Group. Ranjit Atwal, analyst of Gartner’s Computer Platforms group in London. These results are preliminary. Final statistics will be available soon to clients of Gartner’s PC Quarterly Statistics Worldwide by Region program. For more information, visit www.gartner.com.
731;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-02-03T00:02:15Z;US warns on risk of net-based telephony;;The US government has issued a strong warning about the security risks associated with internet-based telephony, one of the fastest-growing communications technologies.Internet-based telephony known as voice over internet protocol, or VoIP promises lower costs and greater flexibility by using existing data networks. But a report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which develops technology guidelines for US government agencies, warns of the ?inherent vulnerabilities? of VoIP.?VoIP systems can be expected to be more vulnerable than conventional telephone systems, in part because they are tied in to the data network, resulting in additional security weaknesses and avenues of attack.?The warning from the institute is likely to prompt some companies, agencies and consumers to reassess plans for adopting the technology.According to Gartner, the market research group, spending by US companies and public-sector organisations on VoIP systems will grow to $903m this year, up from $686m in 2004. Investment in hybrid systems, which handle VoIP and traditional calls, will grow from $1.5bn to $2bn.By 2007 Gartner expects 97 per cent of new phone systems installed in North America to be VoIP or hybrids. The Telecommunication Industry Association predicts that 26m users will have VoIP by 2008.While the technology proliferates, the government is concerned managers do not fully grasp the security implications.In its report this week Nist says a main source of confusion ?is the (natural) assumption that, because digitised voice travels in packets just like other data, existing network architectures and tools can be used without change?. It warns: ?VoIP adds a number of complications to existing network technology and these problems are magnified by security considerations.?Firewalls and intrusion detection systems used to protect data networks often interfere with voice calls by delaying information as it travels across the network. This leads to calls breaking up or being dropped. In addition, firewalls are no defence against internal hackers.Unless calls are encrypted, anyone with physical access to an organisation's local area network can attach monitoring equipment and tap into calls. While this is in theory possible with traditional telephone networks, access to switching equipment is easier to control.Nist's report, signed by Donald Evans, commerce secretary, warns agencies that essential telephone services, ?unless carefully planned, deployed and maintained, will be at greater risk if based on VoIP? because the internet is in general less reliable than the public switched telephone network.Noting that ?an especially challenging security environment is created when new technologies are deployed?, Nist recommends using separate voice and data networks when feasible.
732;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Building blocks for the future;;"“This is the industrial revolution for software,” says Toby Redshaw, vice-president of information technology strategy at Motorola, the US electronics group. He is talking about the rise of “service oriented architectures” (SOAs) a method of building IT systems that relies not on big, integrated programs but on small, modular components.The analogy is a good one. Industrialisation led to huge productivity gains but also impoverished craftsmen whose skills were no longer valued. The emergence of service-oriented software will also cut both ways: cheaper, more flexible computer systems combined with a painful adjustment for artisan-programmers who get left behind.Moreover, Luddite-style resistance is futile.“SOAs are going to happen. You can’t say: ‘We won’t do that.’ It is inevitable,” says Daryl Plummer, a research fellow with Gartner, the market research and consulting group.The forces driving change can be seen in every IT department: systems that are rigid, inflexible and costly to change, chief information officers under pressure to do more with less.The City of Chicago spent five years updating its IT systems. It bought an enterprise resource planning system, a revenue management system, a customer relationship management system and a host of other software packages designed to speed the work of city government.Everything worked well until city managers started asking for information that required dialogue between two or more systems. Building links between systems required weeks of work by $200-an-hour programmers. The average cost of linking two systems was $100,000.To Chris O’Brien, a former management consultant who is now the city’s chief information officer, this seemed hopelessly inefficient: “What’s the point of having all that data if you can’t bring it together in a way that the average manager can use?” he says.The story is typical. Most organisations run on a hodge-podge of departmental systems accumulated over many years. Building bridges between these “islands of automation” is slow and expensive.Increasingly, this is a headache for CEOs as well as CIOs. In a recent poll by The Conference Board, the business research group, nearly 90 per cent of business leaders said their top priority was increasing organisational speed, flexibility, and adaptability. But how can they achieve this when IT systems are set in concrete?In Chicago, Mr O’Brien and his team have taken their first tentative steps towards a more flexible world by creating a dozen or so modular services. Each has standard interfaces and can be used by any of the city’s systems.For example, the city’s website includes a facility for paying parking tickets online, supported by software that checks the amount you owe, charges your credit card and routes the money to the appropriate municipal bank account. Realising that this could be used by other city departments, the CIO asked his team to turn it into a service.The programmers first had to decide how much of the software could be reused in different contexts and how much was specific to its existing function.Once this was accomplished, the reusable part was wrapped in a layer of Extensible Mark-up Language (XML), an industry-standard system of tags and labels that can be understood by any computer system.The result is a service that can be used by any of the city’s computer systems. Instead of writing near-identical software every time they need a payments engine, developers can simply plug into the service over the city’s computer network. “It took us two weeks to build and it has been reused at least seven times,” says Mr O’Brien.Motorola is further ahead. It has developed 108 services so far and envisages a day when the company’s entire IT infrastructure is based on thousands of similar modules interacting over the network.Changing the system to accommodate new business processes will then become a drag-and-drop exercise requiring no programming skills. Mr Redshaw envisages a day when tasks that now require weeks of software development can be carried out in a few hours by a new breed of “business process analysts”.As every historian knows, however, revolutions rarely run as planned. There is a huge difference between building a few modular services and moving to a full service-oriented architecture.First, there are technical hurdles to be overcome, such as deciding what constitutes a service. Include too little functionality and a service is unlikely to be useful. Include too much and it may be unusable outside the context for which it was originally written.Bear in mind that the software industry has tried modularity before. Object-oriented programming – all the rage in the 1990s thanks to the rise of languages such as C++ and Java – is based on similar ideals: flexibility, ease of maintenance, reuse of code.But the “objects” in an object-oriented software program were too obscure to be understood by non-programmers. Software remained the province of specialists. In contrast, the “services” in a service-oriented architecture should be recognisable even to the uninitiated.“A service should be something that a user can understand, such as a query or a transaction,” says Steve Bass, CIO at the New York Board of Trade, the commodities exchange that is also moving towards an SOA.Mr Plummer at Gartner makes the distinction between “atomic services” that do one thing (“check temperature” or “check credit authorisation”) and “composite services” that involve a number of steps. The City of Chicago’s payments engine falls into this latter category.He adds: “Moving to an SOA is not just a technology initiative, it is a business initiative. What services do you need to run your processes? Where are you going to get them from? What happens if a service goes down? How long would it take you to recover?”These are questions that the average application developer is hardly qualified to answer. Developing an SOA will therefore require close co-operation between IT departments and business units, often a tricky proposition.In addition, while XML in theory provides a lingua franca that any computer system can understand, communication is impossible without shared meaning. This means agreeing on standard definitions throughout the company.When a service is asked to look up the “list price” of an item does it need net of tax or gross? Inclusive or exclusive of shipping? Good until what date? There are no short cuts, warns Mr Redshaw: “We recruited a world-class data architect to drive all of this but, even so, with hindsight I wish we had started a lot earlier.”Even when these gritty details have been worked through, a fully-developed SOA will require rules and, therefore, more software governing access rights to services, security, quality of service and more besides.It is this architecture that differentiates an SOA from a mere collection of modular services.The software industry has been quick to sense an opportunity. Big software companies such as BEA Systems, IBM, Oracle and Microsoft jumped on the bandwagon last year. They have been joined by a host of start-ups offering products to help manage SOAs.Examples include Systinet, which offers a central registry to keep track of the services available; Amber Point, which monitors service levels; and Infravio, which among other things offers load-balancing, services management and security tools.Companies serious about moving to an SOA will need these or similar products. CIOs will have to explain to their bosses why, in these penny-pinching times, another handful of software vendors should be added to their roster.Says Mr Plummer, wryly: “I said this was going to be more efficient. I didn’t say it was going to be simpler.”This is a fair point. Developed economies have become massively more productive since the dawn of the industrialisation, but they have also become more complex. Software may now be facing the same transition as big, integrated applications are broken into smaller, more flexible modules.Yet the biggest pitfalls on the road to a service-oriented world could be behavioural rather than technical. Turning existing applications into modular services requires programmers to change habits formed over years of education and practice.“When you build an application you look at it in isolation. When you build a service you have to look at who will use it and how they will use it. It requires new skills and a new mindset,” says Tom Erickson, Systinet’s CEO.The emergence of SOAs will also shift the balance of power between IT departments and business units. When new applications can be built easily by business process specialists, what is the role of the programmer, the systems architect or even the CIO? Notes Mr Redshaw: “We are trying to get people to embrace things that could make their jobs go away.”BAT steps up to new platformBy William KnightA company’s geographical dispersal can cause problems for IT, but British American Tobacco (BAT) is implementing a service oriented architecture (SOA) to gain a consistent platform for its global systems, without constraining local regions which retain significant autonomy.With more than 300 brands, BAT covers 180 markets with 87 factories in 66 countries, and building IT infrastructure is an ongoing task. Kevin Poulter, application technology manager with worldwide responsibility for application infrastructure and technology components, says BAT was disillusioned with “traditional” methods.“Momentum in our organisation has come from people finding integration expensive and difficult,” he says. “The approaches we were using were too expensive and too slow.”BAT’s SOA project began nearly three years ago and has progressed incrementally by consultation and by winning the hearts and minds of technicians and management.SOA can be a daunting concept and Mr Poulter says gradual introduction served to keep personnel on side and ensured the business units were fully engaged.Even for technical staff, an SOA might represent a considerable shift in philosophy, and he stresses the need to take matters slowly. “There is an interesting tension because you have people used to traditional packaged applications. The hurdles have been getting the right level of understanding about what it [SOA] means.”The project accelerated as benefits emerged. “We are trying to do it incrementally; put in place the right infrastructure components to let us manage and control it, and still deliver results from an incremental investment,” says Mr Poulter. Infrastructure components deployed include Blue Titan Software for registering and managing services and Cast Iron Systems’ Cast Iron Application Router as an integration tool for creating services.The company has just reached the stage of implementing services – using Skyway Software’s development environment – and this serves to illustrate that, when implementing an SOA, results do not necessarily come quickly. While admitting they have more work to do before they have a “full blown” SOA, Mr Poulter says the Australian and South African business units have delivered integration solutions more efficiently and with lower development costs than previously.BAT is encouraged to move forward with the project, “A full SOA is a natural consequence,” says Mr Poulter. Such is the strength of the SOA model that BAT’s original architectural vision has remained intact. “A few things evolved, but we haven’t changed much in three years,” he says.BAT’s determination to implement a consistent infrastructure upfront has created an excellent platform for the future, and the company can now apply SOA to business solutions on a broader basis. “We are working with SAP [the big German enterprise software company] very closely on this and have a strategic relationship in place to work on a common SOA vision,” says Mr Poulter.He aims to create a growing registry of software services that the business units can utilise and build on. “Demand will come from local and global projects and their business requirements, not the central strategy team,” he says.Mr Poulter believes SOA is an inevitable technology that all companies will eventually embrace. He sees BAT’s move to SOA as the first steps to an “infrastructure of the future,” providing stronger integration between system level, application layers and business processes."
733;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-01-26T07:45:32Z;Convergence ‘brings big savings to telcos’;;"Telecoms carriers can make huge savings by converging their networks, and create a platform for substantial new growth, according to research by Bain, the US-based consultancy. Companies could save between 20 and 50 per cent of their total operating costs, it says.“Carriers today support a myriad of networks, each with separate billing systems, unique provisioning systems, distinct product development groups, different physical equipment and locations, and so on,” said Ron Kermisch, a partner in Bain’s global technology and telecommunications practice. “Convergence will eliminate disparate networks by bringing them all on to one common, packet-based network, which will produce dramatic cost savings.”Bain’s conclusions follow more than three years of work with telecoms clients, and independent research, from which the company has built a detailed economic model. The research covers what Mr Kermisch called a “representative sampling” of telcos, primarily in North America and Europe.With telcos “hitting bone” in their attempts to cut costs, they needed something that would dramatically change their cost structure, he said. Network convergence provided this. “The savings were larger than we thought they would be,” said Mr Kermisch. “It is striking how much redundancy there is in organisations to support all these networks.”While the savings are substantial, the benefits of convergence for carriers go beyond reduced costs. Convergence will enable carriers to compete effectively in the managed services market – worth an estimated $70bn in the US alone – a critical emerging opportunity for telecommunications companies. For carriers that are battling for enterprise customers, selling such services could be their only organic growth opportunity, said Mr Kermisch.Bain uses US terms to identify three types of carrier with different competitive positions to address this market. The newest competitors – companies such as Global Crossing and Level 3 – are converged by definition, and offer a full suite of services on an integrated IP network. Then come the RBOCs (regional Bell operating companies), which have most to lose, says Mr Kermisch. They need to carefully manage the consumer voice-based revenues they have won over the past few years and defend themselves against local access line substitution.Finally the IXCs (interexchange carriers, or largely long-distance carriers such as AT&T and MCI) will, out of necessity, be the most aggressive in going after this opportunity. They have the customer base where convergence is most relevant – enterprises – and they are in the most difficult financial condition. Convergence also provides them with the foundation to go after the local market if they so choose.To read more details on the Bain study in an opinion article by Mr Kermisch and colleague Paul Smith, click here for the Soapbox section.Outsourcing: Europe has overtaken the US as the leading market for outsourcing contracts, according to TPI, a UK consultancy specialised in outsourcing. In 2004, Europe took 49 per cent of the market for large deals worth more than €40m, while the US had 44 per cent. The value of the contracts awarded hit a record high of €58bn worldwide.IT workers in the US and Europe are right to be concerned about the growth of offshore outsourcing as TPI’s figures show that 40 per cent of the contracts awarded in 2004 on which it advised contained an offshore element. In these deals, around 38 per cent of the contract value moved offshore.In similar vein, Frost & Sullivan calculates more than 820,000 IT jobs were lost to lower-cost countries in 2004 from the US, Japan, the UK, France, Germany and Hong Kong.“Losing customers is becoming a painful experience that operators can ill afford,” says a report out later this month from UK-based research consultancy Analysys. It estimates that excess customer churn hit European mobile operators with €4.5bn in unnecessary costs and €5.6bn in lost revenues in 2003. This represented 8.6 per cent of total mobile revenues, according to the consultancy. It defines excess churn as “all churn in excess of 12 per cent, which is the best churn rate achieved in a European market.”Eddie Murphy, author of the report, Retaining Customers and Minimising Churn: Strategies for Mobile Markets, says: “Losing fewer customers than competitors over a prolonged period is an effective way to continue growing revenues in a saturating market. “There is a strong correlation between lower churn than competitors and better performance in customer numbers, revenue and earnings.” he addsThe report shows that an operator which improves churn by nine percentage points compared to the average of 21 per cent could increase revenues by 25 per cent to €4bn from €3bn. But when churn rises to 35 per cent its revenues halve.More on: www.analysys.com.Brazilian mobile market: Global System for Mobile (GSM), the mobile standard used in Europe, looks set to overtake the two other mobile standards in Brazil, despite being introduced years later.Brazilian regulator ANATEL says GSM has already overtaken Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) to become the second most widely used mobile technology in Brazil. At current growth rates, it could overtake Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) by the end of the first quarter. Introduced in 2002, five years after CDMA and seven years after TDMA, GSM had 18.75m users in Brazil, a 30.65 per cent market share, by November 2004. This compares with CDMA’s 18.16m (29.67 per cent) and TDMA’s 23.91m (39.07 per cent).Brazil’s mobile growth has accelerated since the launch of GSM, and the country is now the world’s fourth largest mobile market, according to the organisers of the 3GSM World Congress 2005, to be held in Cannes from February 14-17.

CIO’s spending plans: Chief information officers expect IT budgets to increase by 2.5 per cent in 2005, and believe their focus will be on supporting business growth and results, according to a survey by Gartner Executive Programs (EXP), a unit of Gartner. In the past few years, CIOs have had to focus on internal efficiency and cost control, while preparing their organisation for an economic upswing. CIOs also voiced concerns about their relationship with the CEO and whether they have the right people to meet current and future business needs.Gartner EXP surveyed more than 1,300 CIOs representing $57bn in IT spending, covering more than 30 countries. It has presented the findings from the survey in the report “Delivering IT’s Contribution: The 2005 CIO Agenda”.“Business expectations are now forcing CIOs to transform the IS organisation and2005 is the year where CIOs must deliver more value and become a contributor rather than a commodity,” said Marcus Blosch, group vice-president and research director for Gartner EXP. “They must do this without large up-front investments and CIOs are turning to business processes and business intelligence to meet this challenge.”Gartner said contributing to business growth starts by providing secure, high quality and cost effective IT services. This is mandatory and a baseline for IT’s credibility. It is reflected in the top technology priorities for 2005, where security features at the head.ContractsNew base stations for old: Ericsson, the Swedish mobile equipment company, has won a supply and systems integration contract to replace 10,000 of T-Mobile Germany’s base stations.“Ericsson will modernise and increase efficiency in T-Mobile’s GSM network to pave the way for future business growth,” said Bert Nordberg, executive vice president, group function sales and marketing at Ericsson.The company said the challenge in replacing existing base stations with the latest GSM/GPRS technology was to do so “without causing disturbance in the service quality for the customers of T-Mobile”.The replacement operation begins this month and is to be completed in three years. T-Mobile Germany is the German arm of Deutsche Telekom’s mobile business.Industry newsSiebel’s SME push: If at first you do not succeed... Siebel Systems is once again trying to boost sales of its customer relationship management (CRM) software with smaller and medium-sized enterprises.The CRM giant has unveiled a new SME strategy designed to overturn the perception that its CRM software is overkill for SMEs and its salespeople are only interested in big deals. “Penetrating this market is a key component of the next phase of growth for Siebel Systems,” says Mike Lawrie, CEO of Siebel Systems. The US vendor estimates that only 2 per cent of US small businesses have implemented CRM.For this, its third attempt to crack the elusive SME market, Siebel is employing a three-pronged sales strategy: its own salesforce, a network of regional value-added resellers, and IBM, its long-standing partner and a respected name in the SME market. Siebel hopes to get SMEs interested both in its hosted solution, Siebel OnDemand, and its traditional on-site software.Analysts see the move as a belated response to the success that start-ups such as Salesforce.com and RightNow have had in the SME market by remotely hosting CRM software. Microsoft is also a growing threat with its a well-received CRM product aimed at SMEs.“To convince SMEs that it is serious about this market on its third attempt, Siebel must deliver on its promises,” says the Gartner Group.

US banking deal: JPMorgan Chase, the US financial giant, is acquiring Vastera, a US company that specialises in global trade management (GTM) technology and services.The deal, worth $129m, seems an unusual departure for a bank but it reflects the growing importance of technology in managing global trade and complex supply chains.

Push-to-talk mobiles: Motorola, the US mobile equipment company, has launched two new push-to-talk mobiles offering walkie-talkie style communication over mobile phone networks. Push-to-talk (see article in our Mobile Working section) is useful for communicating instantly with a group of business people, such as truck drivers or engineers. and is also an ideal way of keeping in touch with a group of skiers on the slopes.The C698p is a tri-band phone with two high-audio speakers to provide improved sound for business calls, or for listening to music on its built-in MP3 music player. The C381p is a mass-market phone with extra features like being able to pull in contacts from a PC contacts database.Snowboarders have not been left out by the company either.It says that next winter, they will be able to switch between their Apple iPod music playlist and ordinary mobile calls in mid-air, through an association with Burton Snowboards, a snowboarding equipment and clothing maker.Together the two companies have developed special jackets, helmets and beanies (hats) which provide wireless connectivity using the Bluetooth short-range radio standard. The garments will include removable control modules, which can be operated easily to receive a call, without the snowboarder having to get his or her hands cold. The control modules will communicate wirelessly with a mobile or mobile-based device via Bluetooth.“For snowboarders, using a mobile or an iPod in cold temperatures can be a significant challenge,” says Motorola. But perhaps not as big a challenge as answering a call safely while airborne.

The flaws were quickly fixed but the consultancy warns that users need to be aware of the security risks. “Enterprise security managers should discourage its use altogether,” Gartner advises. Similar desktop search tools from Yahoo! and Microsoft are also seen as potential security risks.Groupware initiative: Japanese software companies rarely make an impression outside Japan but Tokyo-based Cybozu hopes to change that with a new version of its groupware product, Share360.The software is available not just in Japanese, but English, Simplified Chinese, Spanish and half a dozen other languages, It is is aimed at SMEs or branch offices of large enterprises that need a multi-lingual capability and runs on Windows, Linux or FreeBSD operating systems. Cybozu is hardly a household name in the West but it claims more than 1.5m users in Japan.EventsDigital divide conference: The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is to hold the fourth World Telecommunication Development Conference (WTDC) in Doha, Qatar in March 2006. It will bring together the ITU’s 189 member states and nearly 290 development sector members to establish information and communication technology (ICT) projects to reduce the digital divide between rich and poor countries.The conference will also set the agenda for the activities of the ITU Telecommunication Development Bureau for the following four years. “The WTDC provides an important opportunity for the ITU to further its commitment to bringing the benefits of information and communication technologies to all of the world,” said Yoshio Utsumi, Secretary-General of ITU. The conference will be held from 7 to 15 March 2006 and will be hosted by Qtel, the largest public telecommunication provider in Qatar. Regional meetings will be held in 2005.

734;IT;Gartner Inc;2005-01-14T06:56:42Z;Samsung Electronics? full-year profit surges;;Samsung Electronics, Asia?s biggest electronics maker, on Friday announced a sharp increase in full-year profit but continues to face a gloomy future of narrowing handset margins and falling flat-panel display prices.The South Korean company earned Won10,786.7bn (U$10bn) in net income last year, an 81 per cent increase from 2003. Annual sales rose 32 per cent to Won57,632.4bn.The market reacted positively to the news, with Samsung shares gaining as much as 3.5 per cent on Friday morning.The full-year results were better than expected, but the outlook for the consumer electronics giant remained grim as intense competition puts pressure on prices of its core products ? computer chips, mobile phones, and flat screens.Net income for the fourth quarter fell to Won1,825.4bn from around Won1,900bn in the same quarter from the previous year, a reflection of a slowdown in the company?s growth momentum.Operating profit at Samsung?s semiconductor business more than doubled to Won7,480bn last year, with margins just above 40 per cent. But the unit?s fourth-quarter profit fell 18 per cent from the previous quarter, as chip prices began to fall.The global semiconductor sector saw a 23 per cent increase in sales to a record US$218bn in 2004, according to market research group Gartner, but memory chip prices are expected to slide more than 30 per cent this year to below manufacturing cost.The outlook for Samsung?s flat screens unit looks equally bleak. Industrywide overcapacity is driving the prices of flat screens lower. Samsung, the world?s biggest maker of liquid crystal displays, said prices for its large-size flat panels fell between 10 per cent and 14 per cent in the fourth quarter. According to industry research group DisplaySearch, last year?s capital spending on LCD equipment worldwide rose at the fastest pace since 2000 although demand was not growing fast enough to absorb the increase in supply.Samsung, which has overtaken Motorola as the world?s second-largest mobile phone maker, also saw its handset margins squeezed last year by higher marketing costs and a price war launched by its bigger rival Nokia to regain market share.Samsung?s share price has lost around 30 per cent since hitting a record high of Won637,000 on April 30 but the company remains optimistic.It expects LCD prices to recover by the second half of this year and its handsets margin to rise in the first quarter. It is planning to launch 15 high-end mobile phone models and aims to sell 100m handsets in 2005, up 16 per cent from last year. Despite a moderate decline in chip prices expected this year, the company forecasts a 9 per cent increase in semiconductor sales to Won6,010bn.
735;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Hacker attacks are not bad news for all;;"Network security and internet telephony will be among the most sought-after technologies as corporations and telecommunications carriers move to upgrade their networks in 2005.Overall demand for data networking gear is expected to grow by only 8-10 per cent in 2005 as corporations and carriers continue to replace traditional circuit-switched networks with packet-based systems.Demand for greater bandwidth to carry voice, storage, and streaming-video traffic is also driving investment.But if overall growth is forecast as modest, demand for network security is expected to grow more than 20 per cent, driven by a seemingly endless wave of viruses, worms and hacker attacks that has prompted IT managers to safeguard the networks they operate.?There is a definite amount of pain associated with these worms,? says Lawrence Orans, networking analyst at research group Gartner.Network equipment makers have responded aggressively to this new opportunity.Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks acquired several small security firms in 2004 in a bid to develop a comprehensive set of hardware and software products aimed at improving network security.Cisco has been moving to embed security features into its routers, while Juniper was considered to have better technology to secure virtual private networks (VPNs), which enable companies to connect remote sites and people together over a public network.A number of small security groups such as Check Point Software, CyberGuard and Internet Security Systems were also expected to benefit from heightened security fears.Analysts expect these equipment makers in 2005 to release more products that safeguard networks from intrusion and cope with intruders should they penetrate a network's outer defences.Internet telephony is expected to be another bright spot, with corporate spending on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) systems growing an estimated 31 per cent to $4.5bn in 2005, according to research group IDC.Cisco leads this market with a roughly 30 per cent share, as many of its US customers switch from traditional voice technology.But the industry leader's efforts to convert corporations will be slowed by two factors: it lacks a direct sales force in many regions outside the US; and many companies are unlikely to toss out their current systems until they are due to be replaced over the next several years.With nearly every major telecoms carrier committed to converging their networks on to a single IP network over the coming years, the telecoms market has become increasingly important for data networking equipment makers such as Cisco.CIBC World Markets said recently that many carriers would start buying much of the gear required for the transition in 2005.IDC estimated that carrier spending on next generation networking gear, not including legacy technologies, fibre and construction costs, would increase by 10 per cent to $35.7bn in 2005.Of the key next generation technologies, investment in internet telephony was seen to be leading the way with 60 per cent growth, followed by local area network switching at 35 per cent and optical networking gear at 26 per cent growth, said IDC.After years of false starts, Cisco finally seemed to be making inroads in the carrier market, but rivals such as Lucent, Alcatel, Nortel and Siemens have long established carrier relationships and reputations for reliability.Another challenge for the large equipment makers was seen in the intensifying competition from Asian manufacturers, most notably China's Huawei Technologies, which has taken advantage of its low cost base to push prices down.Cisco has cautioned that even as it expects to grow by 10-15 per cent annually through to 2008, the company expects that competition from Asian rivals will put pressure on gross margins for several years."
736;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-12-15T07:58:53Z;What impact does IT have on corporate governance?;;"The term corporate governance is typically used in conjunction with terms such as risk, compliance, creative accounting, Sarbox, IAS, DPA, regulatory requirements, prison, stakeholders, Parmalat and Basel 2. There are more than 6m pages on Google that refer to it.Definitions of corporate governance include: a way to ensure that lenders of finance get a return on their investment; the system by which business corporations are controlled; the relationship of a company to its shareholders and society; promotion of corporate fairness, transparency and accountability; the “hot button” for selling anything to CxOs.What we have seen is the emergence of roles such as chief compliance officer, chief risk officer and chief governance officer. Less visible is how IT is playing a strategic role in supporting good corporate governance.Interesting facts are emerging in this respect. Gartner estimates that $2bn will be spent on IT projects in respect of Sarbox (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) compliance alone in Europe. A study by the Economist Intelligence Unit shows that only 27 per cent of senior executives ask for input from their IT department when planning major deployments.Clearly there is a “disconnect” between the level of IT spend and the level of IT influence in respect of corporate governance. So one answer to the question posed by this article is that IT (as in the department) has very little impact. It would appear that IT people are brought in purely as implementation specialists after the planning process is complete.This is unfortunately the wrong answer and as this subject matures, stakeholders are likely to cite the lack of IT involvement as a prima facie example of poor corporate governance.It is one thing for the directors to claim that they are in control of their business, but quite another to demonstrate it. The auditing requirement associated with corporate governance can be delivered only if every relevant IT system has governance functionality in-built. Also, there needs to be consistency between the governance outputs of the various IT systems if the aggregated picture is to make sense.In short corporate governance has architectural implications for an organisation’s IT infrastructure. We are talking of a serious “drains up” overhaul on the IT investment to date. Failure to do so will result in each “governance update” sending a shock wave of problems through the IT infrastructure.The good news is that most corporate IT architectures have been “suspended in amber” during the recent technology nuclear winter, and so are due for an overhaul anyway. Driving out costs, getting closer to the customer and security concerns are all driving architectural reviews. Governance should be added to the list. Ultimately this will fall into the remit of the IT governance officer, but that’s a scare story for the future.Corporate governance could well go down in history as the issue that initiated the “golden era of IT”, whereby the IT department played an instrumental part in rebuilding trust in capitalism. This puts CIOs in a quandary: Do they keep quiet despite knowing the consequences? Do they break protocol and insist they are involved in the planning process? Or do they look out for a “keen as mustard” outsourcer on to whom they can offload the risk? As usual, the future of business is in the hands of the CIO.Ade McCormack (ade@auridian.com) is an IT-value consultant and author of ‘IT Demystified - The IT handbook for business professionals’ available via www.auridian.com/book and all good business bookstores."
737;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-12-15T07:44:27Z;Ecosystems - own one or join one;;IT professionals must make increasing contributions to corporate goals of revenue, profit and cash flow. Gartner finds that some of the most heated debates between the IT organisation and business operations centre around the issue of change - mostly IT’s inability to respond timely and effectively to it.For years IT has responded to business change by implementing new technology and applications. This has resulted in a lengthening of the IT change cycle at a time when pressures to change in the business cycle has continued to shrink. A number of advances offer hope of progress, however, we believe it is changes in the field of software that can have most impact in providing the agility businesses need to keep pace with change.Major changes are happening in the business applications software industry that go well beyond technical issues. Users of packaged applications are seeking more agility in adjusting to changes in enterprise policies and strategies. At the same time, IT is still under pressure to cut costs or maintain current budgets. The result of this activity is that acquirers of packaged business applications are shifting IT projects from large multi-year marathons to rapid deployment gap applications, and reconfiguration of existing systems to meet these demands.In this, new technologies built around component software architectures will for the first time offer organisations the ability to develop, test, use, re-use, add, and modify functionality needed to serve the business without having to redesign the systems from scratch. As the needs of the business move, so can the software applications be developed in a synchronized fashion.Makers of applications software that help companies manage tasks from payroll to inventory to customer relations, like SAP, Oracle and Microsoft, must carve smaller pieces out of their large packages to adjust to these demands. For this to take place, services oriented architectures (SOA) are a prerequisite. This provides the structure to rapidly develop software applications, not from scratch, but from modifying existing software and only adding specific new functions to support the required new process.Gartner believes that through 2009, organisations that incorporate service-oriented development of applications principles in their development of business applications for internal and external consumption will achieve related process efficiency increases of at least 15 percent.The vendor response to this requirement has been varied – from consolidation exercises such as Oracle’s unsolicited – but now agreed – bid to acquire rival PeopleSoft - to the announcement of major changes to large software packages occurring over a number of years, for example SAP’s change from R/3 to mySAP ERP. As the vendors make the necessary changes in the applications, they must also ensure that those pieces can plug into other products, possible even competing products, as companies cherry-pick more specialised programs from different vendors and have them operate together seamlessly.This shift will have significant implications for both users and business application vendors. Gartner expects consolidation of software vendors across three areas of capability – software technology, business process, and business strategy related to IT. This is already starting to happen with large vendors creating what Gartner terms “ecosystems” where they shape the environment and create frameworks and standards within which other vendors operate.These ecosystems will initially be developed around major providers of services and business applications such as IBM, SAP, and Microsoft. Application stack wars have already erupted among these vendors who are all vying for customers, ISVs (independent software vendors) and VARs (value-added resellers) to adopt their form of the “application technology stack” consisting of technologies that formerly are associated with application development (e.g. integration middleware, application servers). Recent agreements by PeopleSoft and IBM just reinforce the focus now being placed on the ‘stack’ and the partnering around the ecosystem.Ultimately, ecosystems will consist of both large and small vendors who will depend on each other to thrive. To survive, smaller or point solution focused vendors will increasingly select to exist in an ecosystem where they adjust to an environment that will include business application functionality, technology and services (e.g. PeopleSoft’s recent announcement to adopt IBM’s Websphere).Likewise companies buying software will be faced with buying into an ecosystems rather than making an individual purchasing decision for an application to meet a specific need.Type A (leading-edge), type B (mainstream) and type C (conservative) enterprises will adopt the next-generation applications at a different pace. Gartner believes type A enterprises will move quickly to implement early SOA styles and therefore be the first to consider ecosystems. Type B enterprises will begin to refocus their architectures and rebuild infrastructures during 2005, but wait for wide availability and stability of new applications before beginning implementation in the 2007 frame.Type C enterprises will wait until next-generation approaches are proven and mainstream, but by 2010 most will adapt their architectures and infrastructures to begin implementing these new applications and thus will live in one or more of the major ecosystems that have evolved by that time.Yvonne Genovese is Gartner’s vice-president, business applications
738;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-12-15T07:17:37Z;Nokia bounces back in mobile phone sales;;Worldwide mobile phone sales surpassed 167m units in the third quarter of 2004, a 26 per cent increase from the third quarter of 2003, according to Gartner. Historically, the third quarter is seldom strong according to the Gartner research, with the industry expecting sales to be flat in preparation for Christmas demand.However, all regions apart from Japan registered year on year growth. New handset models and decreasing prices fueled replacement sales in mature markets such as western Europe and North America. In Asia, central Europe and the Middle East, emerging markets continued to add new subscribers.Market leader Nokia regained ground and lifted its market share above 30 per cent after two consecutive quarters of declining market share. Samsung had a strong quarter and overtook Motorola to become the second biggest mobile terminal vendor worldwide. Samsung’s move into second place was a result of strong global performance, delivering an increasing spectrum of products based on multiple technologies.Motorola slipped to third position, but remained the market leader in North America, boosted by the strength of the Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (Iden) market. Gartner believes the inventory Motorola built in the channel at the end of this quarter puts it in a good position to fight back for second position in the fourth quarter.Siemens recovered from a slip in the second quarter and lifted its market share to 7.6 per cent. It surprised the market with a particularly good quarter in the Americas, nearly doubling its market share in North America.LG had a positive quarter and regained fifth place from Sony Ericsson. Sales were mainly driven by strong results in North America, strong performance in the 3G market in western Europe and solid sales in the remaining regions.In western Europe, replacement sales were fueled by availability of new models and decreasing pricing. North America experienced another record quarter, growing 22.6 per cent over the same quarter in 2003.Operators continued to aggressively add subscribers through handset and service promotions, and several vendors launched new products during the quarter.Asia Pacific saw healthy growth driven by countries such as India, the Philippines and China. Operator promotions to encourage both new and replacement subscribers, such as free SIM-cards swaps in countries without Mobile Number Portability (MNP) and price cuts by handset vendors, contributed to the results.In Hong Kong and Australia, operators offered heavy subsidies on wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) handsets to encourage service adoption.In Japan, sales dropped 12.8 per cent compared to the same quarter last year, when sales peaked driven by new demand for camera phones. Vendors are struggling to maintain profitability due to lower margins on 3G handsets compared with 2G.Brazil and Mexico continued to be the driving forces in Latin America. Mobile phones are becoming more affordable and the total sales of mobile phones reached an all time high with 17.2m units, a 66 per cent growth year on year.Research conducted by Carolina Milanesi, analyst for mobile terminals research at Gartner Ben Wood, principal analyst at Gartner.Additional information is in the Gartner Alert “Market Share: Mobile Terminals Worldwide, 3Q04.” This Alert is available on Gartner’s Web site www.gartner.com.
739;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-12-07T07:52:18Z;Lasting chance;;Whether you’re are watching the latest Robbie Williams music video or surfing the web on your handset, mobile operators want you to do far more with your phone. Having spent E100bn buying 3G licences across Europe at the height of the telecoms boom, it is little surprise that operators have spoken widely and loudly about the revenue opportunities from third generation services.However, operators are anxious that 3G will do more than just increase revenue. They are hoping that the next generation service will help them take costs out of their businesses and deepen their relationships with customers. Since the mobile phone began taking off in the early 1990s, operators have been locked in a self-perpetuating and costly business model of expensive handset upgrade cycles, rising costs of running large customer service centres and relatively high “churn”. Almost a third of mobile users switch networks every year.Mobile operators are hoping that customers’ use of wireless internet will help reduce their costs. “Operators are encouraging their users to manage their subscriptions via the phone itself although some customers may still prefer to speak to a real person,” says Ben Wood, analyst at Gartner, the technology research house.New entrant 3, which is pioneering the adoption of 3G services in several countries, believes the faster download speeds of 3G will mean its consumers will interact far more with their operator via the wireless internet, reducing their need to ring the operator’s call centre. “We are moving away from the traditional way of life that is on 2G,” says Bob Fuller, chief executive of 3 in the UK. “Eighty per cent of our customer interaction is on the handset and we will be moving to interactive billing on the handset.”Other operators have similar ambitions, hoping that pre-pay phone users will get used to checking via their mobile operator’s portal to see how many minutes they’ve got left rather than making a call to the operator’s customer service centre. Eventually users will be able to view their entire bills online and top up their phone over the wireless internet. Each call to a customer service centre can cost the operator an average of £5, so this can quickly begin to have a material financial impact.3G services, it is hoped, will also allow operators to differentiate themselves more from their rivals as they tailor content services to suit their customer bases. In the 2G world, it was essentially network call quality that differentiated one mobile operator from another. In the new world, operators believe they will be able to score valuable points with their customers by having the most exciting and enticing services accessible, via easy-to-use wireless portals.If they can get this right, operators believe they will be able to target the right customers - higher spending youth for example - and be able to hold on to them for much longer as user loyalty begins to transfer away from the mobile phone to the operator-branded services that run on the device. If the strategy works then churn, a significant unwanted cost for operators, should start to fall.”What 3G allows you to do is create brands again,” enthuses Fuller at 3. “It will be like TV channels or newspapers. Some operators will be like The Times others will be like The Telegraph.”The move to 3G may seem to be good news for handset makers - companies such as Nokia hope to stimulate interest in the latest devices by launching better and faster phones with higher-quality cameras and screens, bigger memory capabilities and slicker designs. But in the long run, 3G may mean that customers exchange their handsets at a slower rate, so that operators are not forking out expensive handset subsidies every time their customers want the latest phone. Success here could start to reduce subscriber acquisition costs, potentially enabling operators to start increasing their earnings margins.Mobile operators and retailers estimate that mobile phone users change their phone at least once every two years. But, Brian McBride, managing director of T-Mobile in the UK, believes 3G-powered phones with much larger storage capabilities will help slow the replacement cycle. As more users personalise their phones with colour photo albums or downloaded music or video clips, operators hope that this personalisation will make users much more hesitant to change phones, simply because of the hassles of transferring reams of data from one handset to another.”The replacement cycle helps the handset vendors but not the operators,” says McBride. “We are trying to slow down the replacement cycle. We have already moved to 18-month contracts.”Anssi Vanjoki, executive vice-president of multimedia at Nokia, concedes that, partly because of these trends, the recent acceleration of the handset upgrade cycle is now probably at an end. “The handset cycle is starting to be very stable,” he says. “It is now just under two years and it will not continue to go down.”rob.budden@ft.comThree goals for 3G- Reduce churn: almost a third of mobile users switch networks every year- Cut customer service centre costs: each call costs the network operator an average of £5- Lengthen the replacement cycle: mobile users change phones a least once every two years
740;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-12-01T17:52:18Z;Nokia market share bounces to 30.9%;;Nokia, the world's largest maker of mobile phones, continued to regain lost market share in the third quarter with its global share of handset sales again rising above 30 per cent, up from its recent low of 28.9 per cent in the first quarter.But Samsung, South Korean manufacturer, significantly increased handset sales over the period, for the first time displacing Motorola from number two spot.In data released on Wednesday by Gartner, the technology research house, Motorola's market share fell from 15.7 per cent to 13.4 per cent in the second quarter, enabling Samsung to clinch the number two position with a 13.8 per cent market share.Gartner said Samsung had been helped by its continued strong position in Europe as well as very strong sales through Verizon Wireless, the leading mobile operator in the US.Nokia's global market share hit 30.9 per cent, taking it closer to its 35.8 per cent all-time high reached in 2002. Gartner said the rebound was a sign that the handset maker was succeeding in stabilising market share losses, following cuts to its handset prices earlier this year.?These are the price cuts kicking in,? said Ben Wood, principal analyst at Gartner. ?Nokia are making sure they are leading the market place, but we have not seen a fully refreshed product portfolio and they will need that to generate growth again.?Gartner said mobile phone sales continued to boom, with sales of devices hitting a record 167m in the three months to the end of September as customers in the established markets of western Europe and the US upgrade to the latest phones and as emerging markets such as China and Latin America add millions of new subscribers every month.Gartner said it now expected handset sales to be well above 650m for this year. ? Separately, Nokia on Wednesday announced it would invest up to $150m over the next four years to build its first manufacturing plant in India, reflecting the country's growing importance as a market and a manufacturing base for high technology.?India's position at the heart of a rapidly growing mobile communications region makes it an attractive option for establishing our new manufacturing facility,? said Pekka Ala-Pietil?, president of Nokia in New Delhi.
741;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-11-30T19:17:27Z;Fully programmed to help;;"Forget holding on while listening to music or selecting options by tapping numbers into your telephone when you phone customer support. In future, our queries will be answered by going online and communicating with a computer.For companies, automated internet-based customer service offers big financial benefits. Resolving a billing dispute by phone typically costs $100, and even simple phone queries cost an average of $4.50, according to Gartner Group, the US research company. E-mail and interactive voice response are cheaper at $2.50 and $1.50 respectively, but web self-service costs only 65 cents.Moreover, web-based self-service can handle sudden surges in call volumes, where traditional call centres are quickly swamped. It also offers a consistency of response that is hard for call-centre teams to match, as workers have varying levels of expertise and aptitude. Once a web-based service has identified a customer through an ID or account number, it immediately calls up details of their equipment and previous contact, and can push the case to the right level of priority according to pre-set conditions. Each customer receives a personalised response.Yet persuading people to take their queries, complaints and disputes online requires a big cultural leap. For anything involving sensitive personal information, for instance, customers still prefer to talk to a human being rather than an automated system.For a vast range of queries, however, advocates say the technology is ideal - and people are now more accustomed to using it.Self-service has taken off, from cash dispensing machines to photo-processing kiosks, and people are turning to web banking and online shopping for airline tickets and holidays.""The big attraction of web self-service is not being left holding on the phone for half an hour,"" says Fran Howarth, a practice leader at London-based Bloor Research. ""You get speed, convenience and an immediate answer. It's the next logical step and people are taking to it quite easily.""Until recently, it was expensive and difficult for companies to provide web-based customer service, so online customers have typically been left to telephone or visit a shop when things go wrong. Booking flights electronically is easy, but few companies allow changes to bookings online.Now a number of software companies with backgrounds in customer relationship management or business process engineering are entering the market. BroadVision, a California-based technology company, offers software applications that enable non-technical employees to set up user-friendly web self-service systems. ""The challenge is to ensure the system understands the query, and that the response is personalised,"" says Ruud van Hilten, director of business consulting services at BroadVision.The idea seems to be proving popular with customers. BroadVision says one of its customers, a large European telecoms company, has reduced call centre queries by 8.5 per cent by encouraging customers to access the web to check their account balance, order a new handset, or report a faulty line or change of address. ""Once people have used the service they are twice as likely to use it again, indicating that they like it and find it helpful,"" says Mr van Hilten.Web self-service can help organisations become more efficient by swapping processes that require human intervention with flexible, automated systems. It also creates an audit trail that tracks business processes and helps ensure compliance with policies and regulation.Further, automated systems can passively collect market research data, noting commonly asked questions and monitoring the issues of greatest importance to them. They can be programmed to ask customers what they feel they are not getting and what they would like in future, helping identify problems more quickly.What effect do such systems have on call centre staff? Poor service from call centres is regularly cited as a cause of customer frustration and dissatisfaction. Staff turnover levels are high, creating additional costs in recruitment and training. Advocates say that online systems can allow call-centre staff to provide a better service, since they are freed from answering routine queries and can focus on complex tasks.But Mr van Hilten acknowledges it may be difficult to persuade some people to opt for web self-service, and says careful thought needs to go into marketing. ""You don't want to have a 'dispute bills' button on your website, and you should probably avoid the increasingly common tactic of not offering phone numbers for customers to call,"" he says.Customers need to be confident that web self-service will work quickly and easily. ""It's not about abandoning people to sort things out for themselves, making them consult a list of frequently asked questions, or letting them fall through the cracks into a black hole,"" says Mr van Hilten. ""And you wouldn't give exactly the same response to an individual customer as to a large multiple account holder.""Security concerns are also a worry. ""People are worried about having their details stolen or even identify theft, which is likely to become increasingly common on popular consumer sites,"" says Bloor's Ms Howarth.Some customers are deterred by a lack of personal service online. Lost or forgotten passwords or personal identification numbers, for instance, account for more than half of calls to call centres. ""These people would probably prefer to get an e-mail response rather than holding on the phone to talk to a person,"" says Ms Howarth.Telecom Italia is planning to use BroadVision for large account holders such as schools and hospitals, whose queries can be complex and laborious to answer. Alberto Ostorero, Telecom Italia's application architect, says: ""Previously such queries took months to resolve and often we couldn't even find all the information needed. Web self-service helps answer queries quickly and easily."" Telecom Italia's staff are testing the system before it is opened up to public sector customers.However, Mr Ostorero believe the consumer market is not ready for the service yet. ""Most of our customers are not the internet generation,"" he says. ""I'd like it, but I can't imagine my mother going online to ask about her phone bill and the same goes for many others.""For certain queries - think about arranging medical insurance or the final details of a mortgage - people will always be wary of web-based self-service. It seems human beings will always have a place in customer support.A SATISFYING ONLINE WAY OF SLASHING COSTS"

So it is hardly surprising that, after a nine-year struggle, the Seattle-based software giant is reviving its goal of being as ubiquitous in the car as in the office.With electronic devices and communications systems proliferating in the automotive industry Peter Wengert, marketing manager of Microsoft's automotive unit, says: ""Car companies are looking for a standard platform, and what better place to look than the largest software company in the world?""Thilo Koslowski, automotive analyst at Gartner, the research group, forecasts that by 2012 at least 9m new cars and lorries in the US - or more than half of annual production - will be fitted with electronic communications devices, known as telematics. At present, about 3m vehicles, out of a total of 220m on US roads, have such devices, mostly in the form of navigation systems.Microsoft ""potentially has a huge opportunity"", says Mr Koslowski, pointing to a trend towards providing telematics through mobile devices, such as mobile phones, instead of having a device embedded in a vehicle. Microsoft has become a significant player in mobile telephony in recent years.Microsoft set up its automotive division in 1995, developing such products as the AutoPC, a personal computer mounted on the dashboard. But despite some successes, Microsoft Automotive has not shone. The automotive electronics market has not grown as quickly as expected, and Microsoft has suffered from its reputation as an 800-pound gorilla. ""The market perception has been that Microsoft wants to own the customer,"" says Mr Koslowski.That may now be changing. ""They've learnt to be more humble,"" says Egil Juliussen, analyst at Minnesota-based Telematics Research Group.According to David Cole, chairman of the Centre for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Microsoft is ""trying to get smarter so what it brings has a higher probability of success"".Microsoft agreed in August to support a four-year research project by Mr Cole's centre on issues such as the collection and analysis of motor vehicle warranty data, product innovation and marketing. One purpose of the project, says Mr Cole, is ""to help make Microsoft better known in the industry and to make it smarter as a supplier"".Microsoft has also faced much tougher competition in the car than in the office. Although the automotive version of the Windows operating system has gained a sizeable presence, motor manufacturers have had many alternatives.Japan's three biggest carmakers - Toyota, Honda and Nissan - set up a non-profit group in September to develop an international standard for the software that operates a car's electronic systems.General Motors' OnStar technology offers many features similar to those developed by Microsoft, including driving directions, wireless phones and remote diagnosis of vehicle performance.Several smaller companies, including QNX Software Systems of Ottawa and California-based Wind River, have developed operating systems for cars. International Business Machines' Automotive Software Foundry, launched last year, is designed to smooth the accelerating convergence between vehicles' mechanical and electronic systems.Still, Microsoft is undeterred. Mr Wengert sees many of these companies either as niche players or, as in the case of OnStar, as potential customers rather than rivals. A recent report from Telematics Research, a research group, supports that view, saying ""telematics is a tough nut to crack for automotive manufacturers because it is not their core business"". It adds: ""Failed hardware designs from over-engineering and lengthy development cycles have resulted in major market delays, high support costs and unsatisfactory sales.""Microsoft's advantage, says Mr Wengert, is that ""we're able to deliver a bigger piece of the pie, an end-to-end telematics system"". The new system for cars supports a range of applications and carmakers, including Mercedes Benz and Toyota, who have begun installing it in selected models (see below).In a sign that some manufacturers are reluctant to put too many eggs in the Microsoft basket, however, BMW decided earlier this year to bring digital music into its cars through Apple's iPod adapter rather than the Windows-based Portable Media Centre - even though the German carmaker's chief executive, Helmut Panke, sits on Microsoft's board.Mr Koslowski says Microsoft's success in telematics will depend on its willingness to fit into the automotive industry culture, where the brand of the manufacturer, rather than the equipment supplier, is paramount.He says Microsoft will also need to give its automotive unit a higher profile in its business plan and corporate structure. ""The automobile will be a critical element of any mobile strategy.""Mr Juliussen at Telematics Research concludes that ""Microsoft will do fine"". But, he cautions, ""don't talk about a dominating position. Nobody in the auto industry has a dominating position"".To read the first article in the series click here.WINDOWS EVEN REACHES UNDER THE BONNETThe latest version of Windows Automotive is designed to support navigation systems, music players and an array of other in-car electronic devices. The operating system includes voice recognition software and supports the Bluetooth wireless communications technology. Digital music stored in personal electronic devices can be downloaded through a USB connection on the dashboard.Besides the software, Microsoft offers content through its msn.com portal. This includes an extensive automotive section, including car prices, local traffic conditions and the cheapest petrol prices in neighbourhoods across the US. The company says the autos site draws 10m visitors a month.Microsoft’s reach also extends beyond consumer electronics to dealer management systems and vehicle design software. It is designing a remote diagnostic system that can alert drivers to potential problems under the bonnet, while beaming valuable data on a vehicle’s performance to manufacturers.Ten carmakers - including Mercedes Benz, Toyota and BMW, but not General Motors or Ford - have installed elements of Windows Automotive in a total of 23 models.For instance, Windows controls the navigation systems in BMW’s latest 7-series and the new Mercedes S-Class. Voice-recognition software in Citroën’s C5 and Xsara models allows hands-free use of a mobile phone.Microsoft gained another significant foothold in July when Fiat agreed to install its telematics platform in all Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lancia cars, starting with next year’s models."
743;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-11-09T18:22:00Z;Check Point to choose Belarus for R&D centre;;Check Point, the Israeli internet security company that is quoted on the Nasdaq, plans to set up a research and development centre in Belarus.Gil Shwed, the founder and chief executive of Check Point, in New York to meet investors, said the company expected to set up the Belarus R&D facility shortly following the success of a recent project undertaken by a team in the country.While several western IT companies have tapped the computer and network security expertise in places such as Russia and Hungary, Check Point is believed to be the first to establish a research and development centre in Belarus.The Belarus facility, which Mr Shwed said would employ between 20 and 30 security software experts, would join Check Point's existing R&D centres in Tel Aviv and San Francisco, US.The San Francisco facility was added when Check Point acquired the Zone Labs firewall software business earlier this year.Meanwhile, Check Point has also announced another new component in its Perimeter, Internal and Web security strategy with its Total Access Protection endpoint security initiative.Check Point claims the new software component will allow companies to defend all their network-connected personal computers against attack regardless of their location, ownership or the way they are connected to the corporate network.?Enterprises face increasing demands for anywhere/anytime connectivity from a wide assortment of PCs and small mobile devices, many of which are unmanaged,? said John Girard an industry analyst with Gartner.?Security policy must be evaluated and enforced on every access request, wired or wireless, from inside or outside the corporate firewall,? he said.
744;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-11-03T03:43:35Z;Heated debate over savings;;The Linux world has long claimed that dramatic cost savings result from implementing its operating system. Microsoft sought to refute the figures and the resulting argument only served to detract from the real strategic issues surrounding modern flexible computer systems.Cost savings ranging from 40 per cent to 80 per cent have been attributed to implementing Linux. However, by far the largest saving results from hardware. Organisations are typically replacing an old server, with a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processor running a version of the Unix operating system from the same vendor, to a server running Linux on an x86, architecture.This architecture uses the same microprocessors, produced by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, that power personal computers and are therefore produced in great numbers at low cost. But Windows, SCO Unix, HP-UX (Hewlett-Packard’s version of Unix) and Sun Microsystems’ Solaris also run on this architecture.“Moving to Linux can save a lot of money, but it is very easy to lose sight of the fact that they might have saved most of that money anyway simply moving from a dated RISC architecture to an Intel compatible architecture,” says Andy Butler, vice-president at Gartner. “Why throw away a stable, proven, trusted implementation of the operating system when you can get 80 per cent of the savings and still retain familiarity of the operating system?”Don Jenkins, director of product marketing for business critical servers at HP, points out that because Linux and Windows originated on the personal computer platform, they will run on smaller machines than HP-UX. This advantage for Linux is becoming less of an issue, he says, as Unix is adapted for smaller machines.Although unsupported copies of Linux can be downloaded at no cost, most organisations will purchase it with support at a commercial price. It is hard to compare the cost of operating systems, especially at the enterprise level where subscriptions apply, but the list price of Linux can often appear to be less than its competitors.“Big organisations especially, will find that Microsoft and Unix vendors will haggle,” says Mr Butler. “Although we would not generally encourage it, the reality is that often people will use Linux pricing as a lever to get a better deal.”It is not enough to look at just the cost of the operating system, but at the cost of the application software that will run on top of it. Open source software that runs only on Linux may be available at no cost. Mr Jenkins says that this applies in the technical market and in websites that can use very low cost web servers.Mr Butler warns that organisations need to look very carefully at various Linux added-value tools and utilities, such as failover, clustering, workload management and capacity-on-demand. “Even if an organisation could save money by running Linux,” he says, “by the time other software costs are taken into account, it could pay more for the Linux version of a software stack than for the same or a comparable products running on Windows.”Of course, some open source software runs on Microsoft Windows. Mr Butler points out that if an organisation wants to get significant financial benefits by running Open Office, it does not need to go to Linux, because it runs well on Microsoft Windows.Even looking at the total cost of buying hardware and software is not enough, as it makes up only about 20 to 30 per cent of the total cost of a system. “It is lifetime cost that matters, not a comparison of the two cheques you might write,” says Mr Butler. “There are many scenarios where the cost of administering and maintaining a Linux software stack may be much more expensive then the comparable cost of Unix or Microsoft Windows.”Chris Ingle, a systems consultant at IDC, notes that the main cost of a system is people. “You can get the Unix to Linux hardware savings by moving to Microsoft Windows,” he says, “but it still won’t affect the main area of savings, which is administration costs. If you end up employing the same number of staff, you will only be left with the hardware saving, whatever operating system is running.” He says the key ratio of administrators to servers is usually lower with Unix or Linux, but it is possible to get a comparable ratio with Windows, if it is configured correctly.Michael Hjalsted, director of servers at Unisys, the computer services company, points out that the initial cost of the operating system over a five-year life of an enterprise solution is almost irrelevant. He warns that experience of running enterprise Linux solutions is scarce, so organisations have to pay a premium.The cost savings claimed for Linux are almost entirely the result of hardware costs that can mostly be realised with other operating systems. Linux brings choice to the Intel-compatible platform, which is good for user organisations. Depending on circumstances, it may allow complete systems to be built and operated at either a lower or higher cost than other systems. The choice of Linux as operating system should be made as a strategic decision.
745;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-10-27T20:59:15Z;Window of opportunity for Linux;;The government has become the latest battleground for an epic contest between an industry giant and its less well-regimented challenger.Microsoft's Windows has long been the dominant desktop operating system and is increasingly being used to run larger corporate computers, known as servers. But Microsoft's position has come under assault by Linux, foremost among open-source software.Thursday's report from the Office of Government Commerce, saying that open-source software such as Linux is a viable desktop alternative for most government users, gives a significant boost to the challenger.Open-source software is free but it is most commonly distributed for a fee, along with technical support, by suppliers such as Red Hat and SuSE.It is already used widely and can be found in mobile phones, personal data assistants and point-of-sale systems at local retailers.It is also used to enable electronic commerce transactions, ensure shipments reach their destination and to provide mission-critical services for many large companies. Many popular internet sites are hosted on Linux-powered servers.Few expect the growth of Linux to slow down. Even Microsoft noted in a recent regulatory filing that Linux deployments outpaced the growth of servers running Microsoft.IDC, the market research firm, noted that while Windows remained the dominant corporate and government desktop system in Europe, growth in demand for Linux servers in Europe was expected almost to double by 2008.And Gartner, a rival research firm, has predicted that some 40 per cent of large financial services organisations will have deployed Linux by next year.The government of Paris has threatened to switch to Linux, although some have suggested the city made the threat to force Microsoft to lower its prices.Bergen, Norway's second city, has chosen Linux for its health and welfare and educational networks. Munich is switching 14,000 desktops over from Windows to Linux, to achieve more independence from producers.In the UK, Microsoft has a memorandum of understanding with the government under which negotiations for licensing and servicing agreements with departments can go ahead.Microsoft is in talks with the Department for Work and Pensions, for example. The agreement comes up for renewal next year and an announcement on a new agreement is expected shortly.Linux is an even greater threat to Microsoft in developing countries, such as China and India, with price-sensitive markets where, although large numbers use Windows, few pay licence fees. Microsoft recently announced it would produce a simplified and low-priced version of Windows XP in India to fend off competition.
746;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-10-19T22:25:29Z;Qualcomm to sell chips to Siemens;;Qualcomm, the US mobile phone chip maker, is to begin selling chips to Siemens for use in the German company's 3G handsets.The deal represents a breakthrough for Qualcomm, which pioneered CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology and has been seeking to sell its next generation 3G chips into the European handset manufacturing market.Siemens, the world's fourth-largest mobile phone maker, currently buys all the chips for the three 3G phones it has launched from Freescale Semiconductor, spun off from Motorola this year.The deal with Qualcomm is non-exclusive, so Siemens will be free in future to buy chipsets for 3G phones from Freescale or other suppliers. But the German handset maker said it planned to launch 3G phones running on Qualcomm chipsets in the second half of next year.Qualcomm, which also collects royalties whenever 3G phones based on the W-CDMA or CDMA 2000 technology standard are manufactured, already provides 3G chips to 21 mobile device manufacturers.Its customers include Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, the South Korean handset makers that are among the fastest growing mobile phone manufacturers in the world, but it has struggled to gain a foothold in the European market.Alan Brown, analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm, said: ?This is positive for Qualcomm because in the past they have been kings in their own domain of CDMA 2000 [the US wireless technology]. But they are now moving into the territory that was GSM [the mobile standard adopted across Europe].?Qualcomm shares closed down 1.8 per cent at $42.80 on Tuesday.
747;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-10-12T20:23:28Z;Valley duels with Hollywood over net piracy;;Silicon Valley's technology companies have long seen the government in Washington DC as the ultimate big company.There was a time when that meant avoiding all contact with politicians and the bureaucracy. But they are learning to lobby in Congress, most recently in a battle royal over a proposed change to US copyright law that they fear could have a chilling effect on new technologies. And, for the moment at least, the Valley appears to be winning.At issue is a proposal known as the Induce Act that aims to crack down on peer-to-peer file-sharing networks such as Grokster, Morpheus and Kazaa, which enable digital pirates illegally to swap songs, films and other content over the internet. Last week a relieved industry learnt that a senate judiciary committee has shelved the bill.The planned legislation would have held liable anyone who encouraged others illegally to reproduce copyrighted material. But critics say the Induce Act had been written so broadly that it could also have ensnared electronics manufacturers, software developers and hardware manufacturers.The stand-off is another sign of the tensions between technology companies in Silicon Valley and content-owners clustered in Hollywood. According to Markham Erickson, who represents Google, Yahoo, a handful of chipmakers and a group of telecommunications companies, the entertainment industry miscalculated when helping to draft the initial version of the law.?It was such sweeping legislation, with tertiary liability concerns, that it brought in a lot of other players on our side that would not normally get involved in copyright issues,? he says.Mike McGuire, an analyst at Gartner, agrees. ?The tech guys realised they had to get more involved to protect their right to innovate.?The Induce Act's opponents claim that products such as Apple Computer's popular iPod music player, Microsoft's instant-messenger software and Tivo's personal video recorder could all have run foul of the law as it was written. Mark Cuban, the internet billionaire, recently warned Silicon Valley denizens that their livelihood was at stake if the legislation passed.Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Association, has called the act the biggest threat to technology and innovation in 20 years. And ISPs controlled by large telecommunications companies have joined the battle as well.The proposed law threatens to roll back a 1984 US supreme court decision which established a legal precedent that continues to protect almost all products used to make copies.That court ruling found Sony's Betamax video-cassette recorder to be legal even though people were using it to copy television shows and films. The court ruled the device could not be banned because it also had a number of legal uses.A lower US court last year pointed to the Betamax precedent when it ruled that peer-to-peer software had legal uses and companies such as Grokster and StreamCast Networks, which created Morpheus software, were thus not liable for their users' illegal file-swapping behaviour.The response of the record labels and film studios was two-fold. Last week, they asked the US supreme court to take up the case. The entertainment industry also found an eager supporter in Orrin Hatch, the Republican senator who co-sponsored the Induce Act.Mr Hatch has said he wants to craft ?a technology-neutral law directed at a small set of bad actors while protecting our legitimate technology industries from frivolous litigation?.The uproar over Mr Hatch's original bill was so loud that he asked the entertainment industry to hammer out a compromise in co-operation with a group of software companies, computer makers, consumer electronics groups, internet service providers, venture capitalists and civil liberties organisations.But despite intense talks, the parties were unable to agree on how to define, codify and punish the ?bad actors? without putting at risk those developing legitimate technologies. Part of the problem is that the peer-to-peer technology that has so riled the music and film industries is seen as one of the key technologies that will define the direction of the internet.?The future of the internet is peer-to-peer. That's where all the new applications are,? says Alan Davidson of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a civil liberties group.Mr Hatch has said he would pursue the legislation next session. But critics hope other members of the senate judiciary committee have taken note of the strong and united opposition from the technology sector. If so, it would be arare and sorely neededvictory for Silicon Valley in Washington.
748;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-09-23T17:40:21Z;Business warms to cheaper calls with VoIP;;A high percentage of companies are adopting Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony in an effort to cut costs and take advantage of the technology's advanced features, according to a global survey.The survey published this week by AT&T, a US telecommunications group, and the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit, reveals that 43 per cent of companies are using, testing or planning to implement VoIP within the next two years. Another 18 per cent plan to implement VoIP in the longer term.The results, based on responses from 254 senior executives, appear to confirm that a broad group of companies of all sizes and in all sectors and geographies have accelerated plans to adopt the technology over the past 18 months.?The question is no longer if but when VoIP will become the new standard for voice traffic,? said Cathy Martine, AT&T's senior vice-president for internet telephony.The report does not identify individual companies but banks and Wall Street firms including Bank of America, Barclays Bank and Lehman Brothers have been in the forefront along with IT and communications companies.The report, titled Voice over IP comes of Age also suggests interest in VoIP goes far beyond big US companies in these sectors. For example, 60 per cent of the survey respondents came from companies with annual revenues of less than $500m, 40 per cent came from Europe and the top five industries represented by respondents were professional services, manufacturing, transportation, energy and financial services.The results also tie in with research from Gartner Dataquest and others that suggests a fundamental shift is under way in the telecoms industry with far reaching implications for traditional telecoms providers.Gartner recently predicted that voice revenues from traditional telephone networks would drop slightly through 2008 while VoIP revenues would jump by 38.6 per cent over the same period.VoIP uses the same technology used to route data over networks and is much more efficient than traditional voice telelphony that requires a dedicated end-to-end connection for each call. Studies have suggested VoIP can cut corporate telecoms costs by more than 30 per cent.But advocates, and the survey respondents, argue that VoIP should not be judged on cost savings alone. For example, the report notes that ?bringing voice and video together on the PC desktop unleashes an array of new capabilities that can radically improve communication among employees?.
749;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-09-02T18:30:43Z;Latin America lifts Nokia market share;;Nokia clawed back some of its lost market share in the second quarter, buoyed by the popularity of its handsets in the booming mobile markets of Latin America, according to industry figures released on Thursday by Gartner, the technology research house.But the Finnish handset maker is still suffering in western Europe as rivals Motorola, Samsung and Sony Ericsson continue to make inroads into its home turf.Whereas Nokia has traditionally commanded a western European market share of about 50 per cent, according to undisclosed Gartner figures, Nokia's share in Europe is now believed to be significantly less than 40 per cent.Over the three months to the end of June, Nokia's market share of global handset sales climbed almost one percentage point to 29.7 per cent compared with the previous quarter as handset price-cuts introduced earlier in the year started to take effect.Ben Wood, analyst at Gartner, said Nokia had also widened its lead in China, the world's largest mobile market, by improving its retail distribution in smaller towns and cities.Motorola's market share slipped slightly to 15.8 per cent quarter-on-quarter as its focus on profitability hurt sales.But Gartner said the world's number two handset maker had experienced strong sales in North America and Latin America.Samsung, the Korean company that holds the number three ranking, more or less held its market sharequarter-on-quarter, falling 0.4 percentage points to 12.1 per cent.Sony Ericsson's market share climbed one point during the three months to 6.6 per cent, buoyed by strong demand for its phones in western Europe.Worldwide, handset sales surpassed 156.4m during the quarter, a 35 per cent increase on the same period last year.Gartner estimates global handset sales will climb to 620m this year, although the research house said it could not rule out sales exceeding 650m units if the current market momentum was maintained.Last year global handset sales reached a record-breaking 520m.The strong growth in sales is being driven by continued growth in mobile phone users in emerging markets such as China, India, Latin America and eastern Europe.But many established markets in western Europe and North America are also buoying global sales as replacement cycles for handsets continue to shorten.In highly penetrated markets, many users are upgrading to the latest phones with colour screens and in-built cameras.However, Mr Wood warned that the replacement cycle for mobile phones in established markets typically between 18 and 24 months could start to widen from the end of next year as the pace of mobile phone innovation started to slow.
750;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-09-01T22:45:54Z;Gloom lifts as Hynix turns corner;;Is the gloom finally lifting for Hynix Semiconductor, South Korea's debt-laden chipmaker? That is thequestion investors are asking since the once crisis-ridden company reported record earnings for the second quarter.Improved market conditions and tough restructuring have helped Hynix report profits at the operating level for the past four consecutive quarters, confounding sceptics who doubted it would recover from the brink of bankruptcy in 2001/02.Hynix was kept afloat bya series of controversial bail-outs by state-backed banks. Now the faith and the loans of those creditors is finally being repaid, analysts say.?The company has turned the corner,? said Yu Chang-yun, an analyst at BNP Paribas Peregrine. ?Concerns about the company's earnings, financial status, under-investments and countervailing duties have all been cleared.?According to market research firm Gartner, Hynix overtook US rival Micron Technology in the second quarter to become the world's second-largest maker of D-Ram chips, behind its local counterpart Samsung Electronics.Hynix commands a 17 per cent global market share, against Samsung's 30 per cent, Micron's 15 per cent and Infineon of Germany's 14 per cent.?Hynix has become a top-tier D-Ram maker by emulating Samsung's business model,? says Nomura Securities analyst Kim Gee-soo.Its focus on high value added products such as flash memory chips, CMOS image sensors and LCD driver chips has improved Hynix's operating margins to about 40 per cent, slightly lower than Samsung's 47 per cent but much higher than Micron's 10 per cent.?Even if PC demand falls, such premium products will maintain strong prices, helping us tide over cyclical downturns,? says James Kim, a director at Hynix's investor relations team.The company has turned its under-investment of the past few years into a virtue by increasing the productivity of existing facilities.Its spending has been onlya quarter of the capital expenditure of Micron and Infineon over the past three years.The company's plan to build with ST Microelectronics, Europe's largest chipmaker a plant worth $2bn in China, is expected further to reduce worries about Hynix's long-term competitiveness.Analysts say the planned Chinese plant would help the company to avoid tariffs imposed by the US and Europe, and potentially Japan, which allege that the company has received state subsidies a charge denied by Hynix and the South Korean government.The Chinese plant will also pave the way for Hynix to catch up withits rivals in 300mm wafer production technology, which enables more chipsto be made from a single silicon wafer. Hynix expects to produce 12-inch wafers in the Chinese plant in the first half of 2006.The chipmaker is also modernising its local plant to produce 300mm wafers and is finalising a technology licensing deal with Taiwan's Promos to take about 50 per cent capacity from the Taiwanese company's new 12-inch plant.But with such large increases in capacity planned around the world, there are increasing fears of a supply glut amid falling demand for PCs and highoil prices.According to iSuppli, there will be 47 facilities producing 12-inch wafers by 2006, up from an estimated 24 plants this year.?D-Ram prices are likely to remain strong until the end of 2004 but the industry may be over supplied next year,? says Nomura's Mr Kim.But Hynix officials believe it is well-positioned to weather a global downturn.?Even if market conditions get worse, we will be OK this year and next,? says Hynix's Mr Kim.He forecasts operating profit of more than Won2,000bn ($1.73bn) this year on sales of Won6,000bn.Cost-cutting and the disposal of non-core assets have also increased Hynix's chances of survival. It has agreed to hand over its non-memory operations to the private equity arm of Citigroup for $830m, following earlier sales of its flat screen and handset operations.The proceeds have helped reduce outstanding debt to Won2,500bn from more than Won6,000bn two years ago.Hynix's turnround has begun to draw interest from international investors, as creditors consider selling their 80 per cent stake. Hynix officials said they were in talks with several investors including rival D-Ram makers to attract investment. Hynix was almost sold to Micron in2002 but the board blocked the $3.4bn deal.?Ultimately, the massive bail-outs were not futile,as the turnround has proved to be quite successful,?says Mr Yu.
751;IT;Gartner Inc;2004-08-24T18:03:24Z;Vonage reveals deal on router;;Vonage, the US-based broadband voice over internet protocol pioneer, on Tuesday announced deals with two equipment companies designed to make it easier for consumers to switch to VoIP services.As part of the agreement, Linksys, the home networking equipment maker owned by Cisco, and rival Netgear will both offer new “converged” devices that combine the technology needed to set up a wired or Wi-Fi wireless home network and a VoIP broadband phone connection in one box.The new wireless routers, with twin VoIP phone ports, are expected to go on sale shortly in the US and will cost about $100.Both companies will also offer phone adapters that work with a broadband internet connection and let users plug in a traditional desktop or cordless phone to make calls over the internet.Vonage, which has about 235,000 VoIP lines in service and is adding about 1,000 users a day, said on Tuesday its services would now be sold at Staples, the office supply chain. The moves come a day after AT&T, the US telecommunications group that last month announced it would stop marketing traditional phone services to consumers, said it would offer its CallVantage internet phone service through Best Buy stores across the US.The projected market for VoIP telephony is growing rapidly in the US where there are already an estimated 30m households with broadband internet connections, a figure that is expected to grow to almost 60m within the next four years.Analysts expect VoIP services eventually to take a significant share of the market for home phone services up to 17 per cent by 2008, according to estimates from Gartner, the industry research firm.However, independent VoIP providers such as Vonage face growing competition from established cable and telecommunications companies, including the “Baby Bells” that sell high-speed internet access and are eager to add VoIP to the services they already offer their customers.
752;IT;Gartner Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
