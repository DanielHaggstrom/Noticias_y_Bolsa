Several economists argued the data would moderate any hawkish shift at the US central bank.Since January, the S&P 500 utilities index has lagged behind only the healthcare sector, rising 14 per cent.The payroll figures moderately lowered expectations that the US central bank would increase rates by March next year, as eurodollar futures for the date rose.“While the data is a significant disappointment, most participants will want to place the numbers in the context of a string of strong numbers,” Alan Ruskin, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, said. “Nonetheless, this is the kind of data that staves off risks of a more hawkish Fed at the September Federal Open Market Committee.”Barclays strategists note the utility sector is the most negatively correlated sector to higher interest rates. Investors tend to use utilities as a proxy for the bond market as most companies in the sector have stable dividend yields, Barclays says.NRG Energy climbed 2 per cent to $30.99, Xcel Energy rose 2 per cent to $32.41, PG&E advanced 2 per cent to $47.90 and American Electric Power increased 1 per cent to $53.68. In afternoon trading, the 30 utility stocks on the S&P 500 were all higher.Strategists with RBC Capital Markets added the strong August rebound, which sent stocks to record heights, was showing evidence of a peak. The benchmark S&P 500, for instance, has struggled for direction over the past four days and has ended lower on most.“Rapid sector rotation is likely to remain the dominant technical theme within the equity market, consistent with the pattern of the last few years,” RBC’s Robert Sluymer said.Michael Kors shares were under pressure after it said Sportswear Holdings would sell its remaining stake in the company.Sportswear was the largest shareholder with a 52 per cent stake when Michael Kors first went public.Michael Kors shares fell 4 per cent to $76.67, although analysts with Wells Fargo said the sale could benefit the company if it chose to purchase its Chinese licensing rights, which are jointly held by Sportwear, Michael Kors himself and chief executive John Idol.“There are fewer conflicts of interest, and it seems less likely the price paid will be biased [to be too high],” Paul Lejuez, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said.Gap followed Michael Kors lower, declining 5 per cent to $44.29, after the retailer said same-store sales at its Old Navy, Banana Republic and namesake chain missed Wall Street forecasts in August.Overall, same-store sales fell 2 per cent, compared with expectations for a 1.7 per cent gain. The company blamed its Gap brand for the weak results, where comparable sales fell 6 per cent – more than offsetting an improvement at Old Navy.Analysts with FBR Capital Markets warned increased clearance items could weigh on margins, despite new autumn apparel arriving in stores this September.Rival mall-based retailers also declined on Friday. Urban Outfitters fell 2 per cent to $39.27, American Eagle slipped 2 per cent to $14.16 and Abercrombie & Fitch declined 1 per cent to $40.70.US discount retailer Family Dollar slid after it said it had rejected a sweetened $9.1bn bid from rival Dollar General, citing competition concerns.Shares in Family Dollar fell 1 per cent to $79.01, Dollar General declined 3 per cent to $62.67 and Dollar Tree rose less than 1 per cent to $55.26.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 2,000.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 17,088.09. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was little changed at 4,562.66.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
1;XEL;XCEL Energy Inc;2011-11-22T17:47:05Z;US utilities risk backlash, says report;;Utility bills for US consumers are set to rise more rapidly as companies meet new environmental requirements and invest in ageing infrastructure, creating a risk of political and public backlash, a leading consultancy has warned.Mounting customer discontent could lead to regulators clamping down on corporate earnings or demanding greater benefits for consumers before they approve merger and acquisition deals.Public satisfaction with electricity suppliers has already been declining in recent years as bills have risen.Michael Britt of Oliver Wyman, the consultancy, said there could be a sharper “rate shock” to come.The consultancy calculates that average bill increases would need to accelerate to 5.5 per cent a year to pay for strengthening the power grid and meeting new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency on emissions from coal-fired power plants.Electricity price inflation at that rate could lead to utility bills leapfrogging expenditures such as meals out and vehicles to become the sixth-largest cost in US household budgets.In the European Union, energy bills have become an increasingly acrimonious political issue, and there are signs of similar tensions flaring in the US.A group called the Raging Grannies, for example, has been protesting against the 15 per cent rate increase in North Carolina proposed by Duke Energy, now in the process of taking over Progress Energy in a $26bn deal.Consumer opposition has also hit Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities’ plan to buy neighbouring NStar for $4.7bn. Hundreds of thousands of Northeast customers were left for several days without power after tropical storm Irene in August, and then again after a snowstorm in October.Travis Miller of Morningstar, the investment research group, said: “Regulators have never been eager to raise rates for customers, but the balance for them is getting tougher. They are forceful in demanding infrastructure investments to improve customer service, but they are also demanding the lowest rates possible.”He pointed to the rate decisions facing Duke, and other companies such as Xcel Energy of Minnesota, Westar Energy of Kansas and National Grid of the UK in New York, as test cases of regulators’ attitudes.Other factors likely to drive up bills include rising natural gas prices, which at about $3.30 per million British thermal units are well below what many analysts see as a sustainable long-run level.Renewable portfolio standards, which compel generators to produce a set proportion of their power from sources such as wind and solar, can also increase electricity prices because they are often higher cost than coal or gas-fired generation.Steve Sawyer of the Global Wind Energy Council, an industry group, said that in areas of strong wind and plentiful land, such as west Texas or Colorado, wind power could be cheaper than fossil fuel generation even without subsidies.However, he added, costs would be higher in the Pacific states or in the north-east.Mr Britt said utilities would have to work with regulators and politicians to explain the impact of energy policy decisions such as emissions regulations.“They need to understand that the cost of ‘having it all’ may be too great for consumers,” he said.

However, continuing claims dropped to 4.41m from 4.63m last week, significantly better than the 4.6m consensus estimate.“We’re getting a lot of mixed signals at the moment,” said Andrew Neale, partner and portfolio manager at Fogel Neale Partners. “The data are still not looking great. Earnings estimates have been cut so I am not surprised if companies are beating the reduced forecasts.”Volumes were relatively low, suggesting a lack of broad investor conviction.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent to 1,070.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.2 per cent to 10,138.99 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.7 per cent to 2,175.40.Same-store sales for the past month from the big retail chains came in mixed on Thursday, helped by warm weather and promotions around the Memorial day holiday. June is traditionally a clearance month for retailers.Macy’s, Nordstrom, JC Penney, Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Brandsall beat analysts’ average estimates.Macy’s rose 3 per cent to $18.44, Limited Brands rose 2.2 per cent to $24.21, JC Penney advanced 6.7 per cent to $23.24 and Abercrombie was up 7.8 per cent to $35.45. Nordstrom fell 0.2 per cent to $33.69.However, Costco, Target and Gap came in below expectations.Target dropped 0.8 per cent to $50.02 and Gap was down 7.6 per cent at $18.22. Costco still rose 2.6 per cent to $55.71.“June [figures] were lacklustre at best,” said Robert Samuels, senior retail analyst at Phoenix Equities. “Given that retail has significantly underperformed the market over the past month, we think a lot of the bad news is already in most of these names. However, we think a round of earnings cuts is in store for the back half and 2011 as spending remains choppy.”Wells Fargo was down 0.1 per cent to $26.64 as the fourth-largest US bank by assets said it would cut about 3,800 jobs and close its consumer finance business. The bank said it would take a related charge of $185m, including $137m in the second quarter.Citigroup was up 1.8 per cent to $3.97 after the bank was reported to have agreed to sell about $900m of its private equity portfolio to Lexington Partners as part of an ongoing plan announced last year to reduce its balance sheet.Walt Disney added 0.6 per cent to $33.34 as it said it planned to appeal against a judgment on Wednesday against the media company.A jury in a California court awarded damages of $270m to UK-based Celador Entertainment after a dispute over profits from Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?H&R Block was one of the session’s biggest fallers as the stock sank 8.2 per cent to $14.22. The leading tax preparer said Russell P. Smyth resigned as chief executive. Alan Bennett, a director, will take his role.The company recently reported a 2.3 per cent decline in earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, which usually accounts for most of its annual profit.Technology stocks were some of the session’s worst performers.Micron Technology, a maker of semiconductors, dropped 2.3 per cent to $8.69, Nvidia Corp, a visual computing technologies group, was down 3 per cent to $10.31 and Juniper Networks, a network infrastructure company, erased 0.2 per cent to $25.43.Apple retreated 0.2 per cent to $258.09 even as the computer device maker elaborated on its Asia expansion plans. It said its Shanghai store, which is opening this weekend, is one of “many” it plans in the country.“The Chinese consumer’s love of luxury goods is an enticing opportunity for Apple,” said Mike Abramsky, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Xcel Energy, an owner of utilities assets that operate in eight US states, gained 1.1 per cent to $21.60 as the company restated its earnings guidance for the full year of $1.55 to $1.65 per share.

4;XEL;XCEL Energy Inc;2009-10-12T23:34:52Z;The US: States chart own course on climate change;;At the start of the year, the US energy industry was looking to Congress and the Obama administration to set the tone for the future of energy in America with a swift passage of the Waxman-Markey climate bill.But political posturing and infighting has meant there has yet to be any significant movement on that front.That does not mean there has been no movement on charting a new course for energy.Even as carbon legislation remains stalled, companies are getting on with energy efficiencies and alternatives. Squeezing efficiencies out of energy use is not a new field, but it has never been more popular.Jim Davis, president of Chevron Energy Solutions, has been involved in energy efficiency for more than 20 years – since 2000 at Chevron, the US’ second-biggest oil company.“We’ve been green before green was hip and cool,” he jokes. Chevron has improved its energy efficiency by 28 per cent since 1992, resulting in $3bn in annual energy savings in 2008. “Energy saved is energy found,” he says.Chevron is the only one of the majors to have carved out a niche serving the US public sector, improving efficiencies everywhere from public (state) schools to military bases to offices of the federal government, the largest consumer of energy in the world.Despite headlines hyping the importance of “renewables”, Mr Davis says it is even more important first to make the US more energy efficient. “It doesn’t make sense to put solar on rooftops of a very inefficient building.”To improve efficiencies, companies are doing everything from installing energy-efficient lightbulbs, airconditioning or heating systems to caulking windows to prevent leakage and putting jackets on water heaters to enable the water to retain its heat longer.Many are using smart meters to ensure the best use of power. These meters allow customers to see how much their power use is costing them at any moment, to encourage them to, for example, do the laundry later, when renewables, such as wind, are supplying the grid.Utilities are using new technologies to see precisely how much power is being used at any given time, to provide the right level of supply, and where the outages are so they can immediately fix them.This is all part of the “smart grid” concept of improving the efficiency of the electrical system by increasing the observerability by both producers and users, says Jeff Taft, smart grid chief architect at Accenture, the consultancy.He is leading an effort to build a smart grid in Boulder, Colorado, acting as consulting chief engineer for Xcel Energy’s SmartGridCity project, which is bringing together 70 or more pilots of new technologies to improve efficiencies across the city. “It’s a testing laboratory,” says Mr Taft.Except that the $100m project is being carried out in a real city and is expected to be permanent, as Boulder seeks to be among an intelligent cities network Accenture is promoting around the world.Across the US, entire states are moving ahead without Congress.About 30 states are imposing renewable and/or alternative portfolio standards. These require electric utilities to generate a certain percentage of their power in those states from renewable or alternative energies.California is leading the pack, with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signing an executive order on September 15, directing the state to increase its standard to 33 per cent by 2020.Carbon legislation is expected in the US at some point to complement these efforts, but how much it will raise the cost of fossil fuel-based energy and how quickly remains to be seen.“The challenge for the country is finding the right balance,”’ says Charles Swanson, Houston office managing partner for Ernst & Young.He says it is crucial that the US migrate from fossil fuels and into renewables without raising the cost of energy so much that the US becomes uncompetitive. “Walking that fine line is the challenge.”But Amy Myers Jaffe, energy expert at Rice University, notes that the US has for years had cheaper energy than Europe and Japan, yet that has not increased the US competitiveness, as can be seen by the demise of US carmakers.“Those countries already have higher energy costs than the US, and it hasn’t made any difference at all,” Ms Jaffe says. “It is not a meaningful distinction.”She notes that nobody worried about the US’ competitiveness last year when oil and natural gas prices were at record highs, but if climate legislation pushes up prices suddenly, everyone against the Waxman-Markey energy bill expects it will create a competitiveness problem.“Why weren’t we worried about being competitive last year, when prices were so high?”Considering all the giveaways to the coal industry contained in the Waxman-Markey bill that passed through the House and is now being debated in the Senate, Ms Jaffe says the US would be better off without such a bill. If the bill contains exemptions that let coal continue to pollute, that would be worse than doing nothing.If left to an even playing field, she says, natural gas, which is cheaper and increasingly plentiful with new technology, would be likely to supplant coal use because it is going to be less expensive than coal and has about half the carbon emissions as coal.“If you actually care about climate, we would be better off doing nothing instead of passing Waxman-Markey.”
5;XEL;XCEL Energy Inc;2008-09-03T04:12:39Z;GOP battle cry of faith and service;;It was not the swansong that George W. Bush may have wanted, but it was probably more than John McCain would have wished.The US president was beamed into the Xcel Energy Convention in St Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday night, unable to hear or see the standing ovation.But in a short speech from the White House he praised the presumptive Republican nominee’s story as one of service above self. And he acknowledged, jokingly, the sometimes tense relationship he has had with the Arizona senator: “He is not afraid of telling you when he disagrees. Believe me, I know.”So began the real first night of the Republican National Convention, an evening that reinforced government reform, faith, and service to the country. Leaving nothing to chance, Mr McCain’s motto – “Country First” – was lit up along the periphery of the convention centre. The phrase was also repeated in speeches by two of Mr McCain’s most vocal supporters: senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and former senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee.Tuesday night also marked the return to the kind of political attacks that dominated the presidential race in the weeks before hurricane Gustav forced both campaigns to restrain themselves.Mr Thompson, the former presidential candidate – now a relentless supporter of Mr McCain – gave the highly charged crowd alternate servings of humour and red meat. His speech, which was focused on building up Mr McCain’s character, attacked Mr Obama directly.He drew loud roars when he described Mr Obama as the “most inexperienced nominee in the history of the United States”, and mocked his demurral on the subject of when human life begins: “We need a president who doesn’t think that the protection of the unborn or a newly born baby is above his pay grade.”Mr Thompson ridiculed Mr Obama’s pledge to cut taxes for 95 per cent of voters and hit out at politicians who give “teleprompter speeches” for “America’s critics abroad”. The audience knew exactly who he had in mind.But perhaps the toughest attacks against Mr Obama were launched by Joe Lieberman, the “Independent Democrat” who, as an actual Democrat, was Al Gore’s running mate in 2000. Now Mr Lieberman is one of Mr McCain’s closest allies on the campaign and had been considered on a shortlist of potential running mates.Mr Lieberman called Mr Obama a “gifted and eloquent young man” who could do great things for the country in the future. But: “Eloquence is no substitute for a record, not in these tough times in America.”It was also a night in which Republicans rose to the defence of Mr McCain’s running mate, Alaska governor Sarah Palin.Mr Thompson said: “She’s the only nominee in the history of either party who knows how to field dress a moose – with the possible exception of Teddy Roosevelt. She’s from a small town with small-town values. But apparently that’s not good enough for some of the folks out there.”Compared with the start of the Democratic convention last week, the Republicans launched an unusually direct and, at times, savage, attack on their opponents. The evening set the tone for what looks like being a highly partisan general election on behalf of candidates who have billed themselves as bipartisans.
