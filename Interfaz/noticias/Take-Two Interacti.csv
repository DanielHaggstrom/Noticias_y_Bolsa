0;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2019-05-13T21:23:53Z;Take-Two profit beats but sales forecast falls short amid Fortnite competition;;Take-Two Interactive Software beat earnings expectations in its most recent quarter but delivered a sales outlook that fell short of Wall Street’s forecast, as the video game industry grapples with the popularity of Fortnite and new entrants to the “battle royale” market.The company said Monday it recorded net bookings in the March quarter of $488.4m, up 19 per cent year-over-year but missing analysts’ average estimate of $506.5m.However, net bookings for the fiscal fourth quarter were inside Take-Two’s forecasted range of $450m to $500m, and adjusted earnings per share of 78 cents surpassed a consensus estimate of 75 cents.In its first quarter, Take-Two expects net bookings of between $310m and $360m. Analysts were looking for a stronger forecast of $418.3m.Take-Two, whose portfolio includes Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K, cautioned that its operating results in fiscal 2020 are seen coming in below the prior year, with chairman and chief executive Strauss Zelnick citing a tough comparison due to strong sales of Red Dead Redemption 2.The game was the best-selling title in the US last year and ranked fifth during the first three months of 2019, according to NPD.Mr Zelnick added in a statement that Take-Two is “actively investing in emerging opportunities such as Private Division, mobile games, eSports and geographic expansion that have the potential to be enormous drivers of growth”.Game makers are facing growing competition from online and free-to-play games such as Fortnite that are winning over players and pressuring sales of traditional console games. Epic Games said in March that Fortnite, a popular “battle royale” game, had 250m registered users.Electronic Arts, the company behind well-known sports titles Fifa and Madden NFL, also issued a downbeat revenue forecast last week, while sales in the most recent quarter were stronger than anticipated. The company has benefited from the early success of its own “battle royale” games — a format in which players fight each other until only one remains.Take-Two’s net income in the fourth quarter dropped to $56.8m, or 50 cents a share, compared with $90.9m, or 77 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.The company said continued demand for Red Dead Redemption 2 and the “outperformance” of Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K19 supported the quarter’s operating results.During an earnings call, Mr Zelnick said lifetime net bookings for NBA 2K19 are expected to be the strongest for any 2K Sports title. He also said Red Dead Redemption 2 has sold more than 24m units globally.Shares in Take-Two were down 0.8 per cent in after-hours trading.
1;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2019-02-05T22:17:46Z;Game makers’ shares hit in battle royale with ‘Fortnite’;Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive deliver disappointing sales forecasts;Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive delivered disappointing sales forecasts amid stiff competition from the likes of Fortnite, sending shares of the video-game makers and their peers tumbling on Wednesday.Traditional video game developers have faced a growing threat from online and mobile games that are increasingly winning over players. Epic Games, creator of Fortnite, said in November the free-to-play “battle royale” game had more than 200m players with registered accounts.EA was also dealt a blow in the December quarter when it delayed the release of Battlefield V by about a month to November 20. The company said it sold 7.3m copies of Battlefield V during the fiscal third period, about 1m fewer than hoped. In December, Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Take-Two’s Red Dead Redemption 2 and Activision Blizzard’s Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII outsold Battlefield V, according to NPD.“Our launch didn’t resonate as strongly as we would have liked it to with players, and we were never truly able to catch up. And as our competitors continued to build momentum, whether that was Fortnite or Red Dead Redemption 2 or Call of Duty, we continued to stall from where we needed to be,” EA chief executive Andrew Wilson said on an earnings call.California-based EA cut its outlook for full-year net revenue to $4.87bn from $5.15bn. It also projected net bookings of $1.17bn in the March quarter, while analysts were looking for $1.47bn, according to FactSet.Take-Two said its fourth-quarter net bookings were expected within a range of $450m to $500m, falling short of analysts’ average estimate of $609m.Shares in EA slipped 13 per cent, while Take-Two Interactive lost 10 per cent of its value in early trading in New York. The downbeat forecasts also sideswiped shares in Activision Blizzard, which were down 9 per cent, and Ubisoft, which fell 9 per cent in Europe.The success of Red Dead Redemption 2 helped Take-Two, also known for Grand Theft Auto, register stronger earnings and sales than expected during the holiday quarter. Net bookings more than doubled to $1.57bn.Take-Two chief executive Strauss Zelnick, when asked about Fortnite, told analysts that he was “not worried at all about someone else establishing a free-to-play approach”.“We get competition from every form of entertainment and other activities that people engage in that take them away from consuming our titles,” Mr Zelnick said. “I don’t believe for a minute that our results when they’re great, or our results when they’re less than great, are being influenced positively or negatively by another hit title in the marketplace. It’s just not the way entertainment works.”EA, the company behind the Fifa and Madden NFL franchises, launched its own “battle royale” game in Apex Legends on Monday to compete with Fortnite and similar games. EA also noted a 15 per cent increase year over year in the number of Fifa Ultimate Team matches played during the quarter.Growth in digital drove an 11 per cent increase in EA’s third-quarter net revenue to $1.29bn. Net bookings, however, dropped 18 per cent to $1.61bn, missing analysts’ expectations for $1.75bn.Net income was $262m, or 86 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $186m, or 60 cents a share. Analysts were looking for earnings per share of 73 cents, according to a Refinitiv poll.
2;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2018-08-03T16:54:03Z;Take-Two Interactive revs to record high;;Nearly five years after its release, Grand Theft Auto V keeps kicking into high gear, bolstering publisher Take-Two Interactive’s quarterly revenue and sending its shares to an all-time high on Friday.Take-Two shares shot up to $130.43 in early trading in New York, their highest ever, before trimming those gains slightly to trade up 10.16 per cent at $124.75.The jolt comes a day after the company reported a year-on-year rise in net income from $60.3m or 56 cents a share to $71.7m, or 62 cents a share, in the three months to the end of June. Net bookings, a key operational measure of sales, came in at $288.3m, higher than the $258.4m that analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected.The company credited the solid performance — coming in the first quarter of its fiscal 2019 — to “ better than expected recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K18, as well as robust ongoing demand for Grand Theft Auto V, which is now approaching 100 million units sold-in to date,” said chairman and chief executive Strauss Zelnick.That prompted the company to boost its full-year guidance for net bookings. It is now looking for net bookings between $2.7bn and $2.8bn, up from $2.67bn to $2.77bn. Analysts had estimated $2.77bn, per Thomson Reuters.The results underscore the continued resonance that the Grand Theft Auto franchise has had with gamers, more than two decades after the first version was released, as well as the strength of other Take-Two games like the NBA 2K series. It is also banking on a “creative milestone” later this year when it releases Red Dead Redemption 2, which is already garnering hype in the gaming industry and community ahead of its October release.They also offer some relief to investors who feared that the rise of games like Fortnite would undercut some of the big gaming companies’ momentum. Mr Zelnick told investors on an earnings call Thursday evening: “We’re always worried about the competition. We never take anything for granted and we don’t claim success early. We do our best to create phenomenal entertainment and market it effectively, and then we explain what happened.”Take-Two shares are up 13.4 per cent so far in 2018 after zooming 122.7 per cent higher in 2017.

Not that Mom and Pop seem to be noticing. Last week, the video games company Take-Two Interactive Software and the home security company ADT arranged to repurchase shares held by activist investors – Carl Icahn at the former and Keith Meister of hedge fund Corvex Management at the latter. Dan Loeb negotiated the same type of deal at Yahoo earlier this year.Shares in all three companies dropped at least 4 per cent on the news of the buybacks. What is nice for the activists, though, is that these transactions were carried out at the closing price from the previous trading day. Cue howls of protest about preferential treatment. But lost amid the recriminations is the fact that the companies quickly retired large blocks of stock at prices that are likely to have been favourable – an event that will boost earnings per share and so should also help remaining shareholders.The three companies had hefty buyback programmes already in place. The press releases for ADT and Yahoo indicated that the repurchase of the activists’ stock would fall into those authorisations. Perhaps the market had already accounted for the elimination of those shares. However, by taking the activists’ investments in a single transaction, the companies probably got a lower price than waiting to buy in the open market, since the prices could be expected to move up over time. Put another way, more stock could be retired for the same dollar cost.The 12m shares Take-Two – the company behind the Grand Theft Auto series – acquired from Mr Icahn represented a whopping 13 per cent of its stock outstanding. It will be distinct from its existing repurchase programme, which is just 7.5m shares. Yet its price fell 5 per cent anyway. Will management slacken off with Mr Icahn and his three representatives on the board gone? Or perhaps Mr Icahn saw no more low-hanging fruit left to pluck so he jumped ship? Each is a plausible explanation. Still, it is a perverse reaction when Take-Two’s forward earnings per share estimate has jumped 11 per cent.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
4;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2013-11-26T18:04:45Z;Icahn sells stake in Grand Theft Auto developer;;Carl Icahn has sold his stake in Take-Two Interactive Software, the games developer behind the Grand Theft Auto franchise, for $203.5m while boasting that his presence in the company’s boardroom proved the value of activist investing.Take-Two shares have more than doubled since Mr Icahn began buying in 2009, and are up more than 50 per cent this year alone amid excitement over Grand Theft Auto V, which beat sales records on its launch in September.In contrast to many of his other investments, however, Mr Icahn has never publicly pressured Take-Two for major strategic changes, despite speculation when he began buying that he could agitate for a takeover of the company.Take-Two bought back the 12.9 per cent stake directly from Mr Icahn in an unprecedented extension of its buyback programme.Three Icahn representatives – Jim Nelson, SungHwan Cho and Mr Icahn’s son Brett – are stepping down from the board after three and a half years. Take-Two initially invited Mr Icahn to name directors in order to head off a damaging proxy fight as it was struggling to recover from a profits warning.Mr Icahn’s decision to cash out his profits comes while analysts remain bullish on Take-Two’s prospects.“Investors are beginning to ask, ‘what’s the next story?’ after the release of Grand Theft Auto V,” said Edward Woo of Ascendiant Capital Markets, “but it is such a big blockbuster that it gives the company resources to invest and a lot of money for buybacks.”Take-Two was advised by Liontree, the media-focused investment bank founded last year by Aryeh Bourkoff, UBS’ former head of US investment banking.Icahn Enterprises on Thursday released an analysis of shareholder returns at the 20 companies where his representatives have taken board seats over the past five years, claiming that they have outpaced the S&P 500 average by 10 percentage points a year.Take-Two returned 15 per cent annually over the period that Icahn board members held their seats, according to the figures. Annualised returns ranged from 200 per cent at Herbalife, the nutritional supplement seller, to minus 81 per cent at Dynegy, the Texas power company that failed to find a buyer and collapsed into bankruptcy.The average annualised return for shareholders during the periods of Icahn board members was 28 per cent, double the average returns from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway over the same periods, and more than the 18 per cent from the S&P 500.The data “responds to those that question the efficacy of including activists’ designers on public company boards of directors”, Icahn Enterprises said.
5;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2013-09-20T16:21:33Z;Rockstar boss realises his bank robber dream;;Asked as a child what he wanted to be when he grew up, the now head of Rockstar Games said “a bank robber”.While that ambition was never realised, Sam Houser has made a fortune by giving people the opportunity to steal cars, kill policemen and generally cause mayhem in Rockstar’s blockbuster video game franchise Grand Theft Auto.This week the release of Grand Theft Auto 5 broke the sales record set last year by Activision Blizzard’s Call of Duty to become the fastest-grossing entertainment franchise in the world.Take-Two Interactive, which owns Rockstar, said on Friday that the game – including depictions of murder, cannibalism and torture – had generated sales of more than $1bn, exceeding analysts’ expectations after rave reviews.The figure means Rockstar has already recouped its marketing and development costs of $270m, about the same amount that it cost to make the films Avatar and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Mr Houser, a 41-year-old who lives in New York with his wife and three children, has expertly marketed his games and exploited controversy around their violent content. But he has kept a low personal profile and rarely grants interviews.In Jacked: The unauthorised behind-the-scenes story of Grand Theft Auto, author David Kushner described how Mr Houser cultivated an edgy culture at Rockstar that parallels some aspects of its games.“For the holiday party in December 2006, they filled a nightclub with strippers in Santa outfits and red hot pants. Festive young employees took turns swallowing shots from a giant ice luge,” Mr Kushner recounted.Mr Houser was educated at £21,000-a-year London boys school St Paul’s, where he was a classmate of George Osborne, the UK chancellor. His mother is the British actress Geraldine Moffat, who appeared alongside Michael Caine in the 1971 film Get Carter.His first involvement with GTA came in the 1990s while working for BMG Interactive, the video games unit of German media group Bertelsmann.BMG Interactive bought the rights to the original version of GTA from Scottish studio DMA Design. Mr Houser played an important role in preventing the game from being cancelled after it ran over budget and was plagued by delays.When the game was finally released in 1996, the company hired the publicist Max Clifford to plant stories about its violent content in the tabloid press. The Daily Mail described it as a “criminal computer game that glorifies hit-and-run thugs”. The controversy even reached the House of Lords.Though sales of GTA were surging, Bertelsmann decided to exit the video games business in 1998 and Mr Houser was instrumental in engineering the sale of BMG Interactive to the Nasdaq-listed Take-Two.Promoted to become one of Take-Two’s most senior executives, he renamed BMG Interactive as Rockstar Games and recruited the Scottish developers behind GTA through the outright acquisition of DMA Design.He then hired his younger brother Dan as lead writer on the GTA series, which has sold more than 135m units over the past 17 years. Rockstar has also generated healthy revenues from its other titles such as the Red Dead series and LA Noire.“They’ve carved out a niche for themselves that is unique within the games sector globally,” says Brian Baglow, director of the Scottish Games Network and a former Rockstar employee. “There are very few companies that are taking the risks they do.”
6;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Grand Theft Auto steals Call of Duty record;Video game sales exceed $800m on launch;Grand Theft Auto V has broken the sales record set last year by Activision Blizzard’s Call of Duty to become the fastest-grossing entertainment franchise in the world.Take-Two Interactive, which publishes the GTA series, said on Wednesday that the latest instalment of the violent crime saga had generated sales of more than $800m, exceeding analysts’ expectations after rave reviews.That figure beats the $500m sold by Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 in 2012, ending the Activision title’s four-year run as the hottest property in video games. Aided by a higher price tag and a dedicated fan base, blockbuster games have outpaced movies and album launches in recent years.“GTA games are an event, much like the biggest franchises in the movie space, the game has a massive following and a widespread audience,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, games analyst at IHS. “Demand remains high due to the long period of time between each release in the series. This keep the game fresh for consumers and gives Rockstar [the developer] time to build a great experience.”GTA V’s debut comes at the tail-end of the hardware cycle begun by Microsoft Xbox 360 in 2005 and Sony’s PlayStation 3 in 2006, creating a potential customer base of 250m gamers who own the consoles needed to play. A new generation of Xbox and PlayStation consoles will be released in November when Microsoft and Sony launch their latest hardware.“Top end games releases in the same category as GTA have been thin on the ground this year, so there is some pent up demand for big-budget console experiences,” said Mr Harding-Rolls. “It shows that blockbuster games on home consoles still have a powerful following and it suggests next-gen consoles have a healthy future even with significant competition for time and spend from other devices and content.”The figures mean that Scottish developer Rockstar North has already recouped its $270m (£170m) development costs, which had made it one of the most expensive games on record.Wedbush Securities earlier this week had predicted that Take-Two would take the rest of the month to generate $800m in sales from the game. Take-Two’s shares rose 1.2 per cent during the day on Wednesday and another 3 per cent to $17.77 in after-market trading. The market value has risen more than 50 per cent in the year to date.The success of GTA V comes at time of flux for the games industry. In August, US retail games software sales grew 23 per cent over the year earlier – the first like-for-like growth since November 2011 – thanks to the release of titles such as Electronic Arts’ Madden NFL.EA on Tuesday appointed a new chief executive who is expected to guide the console publisher into the fast-growing markets for mobile and social games, while Zynga, which once dominated Facebook gaming, is struggling amid the shift in play from desktop PCs to smartphones.Digital games companies such as Supercell, developer of Clash of Clans, and King, which produces Candy Crush Saga, are finding rapid success with different models that allow players to download games for free to their mobile devices and charge subsequently for the purchase of power and extra lives for players.These games are often cheaper to develop and offer higher margins, thanks to the cheaper distribution offered by Apple’s App Store and Google Play for Android devices. However, the cost of creating a console title now rivals the expense of a Hollywood blockbuster film, raising the stakes for developers.Ensuring a hit partly relies upon creating enough buzz at launch, at which GTA’s makers have excelled with more than 8,300 games stores opening their doors at midnight in the US this week to sell the title to queues of eager customers. As well as receiving stellar reviews by gaming industry press, GTA V has been hailed by cultural commentators as the latest example of how electronic entertainment can match or even better movies in artistic accomplishment.“We are incredibly proud of Rockstar Games’ creative achievement and could not be more pleased with the success of this launch,” said Strauss Zelnick, chairman and chief executive of Take-Two.

First-quarter earnings were up 54 per cent.That helped lift related media stocks. Time Warner was up 1.5 per cent to $36.93 while Cablevision gained 2.7 per cent to $37.14.But wider markets were weighed down by energy and material stocks as the sectors continued to lose ground in the wake of China raising its interest rates for the third time since October.Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s biggest copper miner by market capitalisation, was down 3.2 per cent to $53.89 as copper prices softened. The S&P materials index was down 0.9 per cent.The S&P energy index shed 1.2 per cent, the worst performing sector of the session, as Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, declined 0.6 per cent to $88.49.That left the S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent to 1,320.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1 per cent higher to 12,239.89 while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.3 per cent to 2,789.07.There was also an element of profit-taking after four consecutive sessions of gains fuelled by strong economic data, healthy earnings reports and deal news that led the S&P up to fresh 2½-year highs on Tuesday.The interest rates rise in China also “reminded everyone how big an inflation problem some emerging economies really have”, said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management.Financial stocks lost ground in the session, led by Wells Fargo after the bank announced that Howard Atkins, chief financial officer, was retiring.Wells Fargo said the move was “unrelated to the company’s financial condition or financial reporting” but the stock still lost 2.8 per cent to $33.13.Elsewhere in the sector JPMorgan Chase was down 1.4 per cent to $45.11 while the S&P financial index fell 0.7 per cent.Disney was not the only household name to report healthy earnings. Coca-Cola said net income had more than doubled to $5.78bn, or $2.46 per share, in the fourth quarter, boosted by the acquisition of its North American bottling operations. The beverage company reported healthy sales growth, particularly in the emerging markets. The news sent its shares up 0.5 per cent to $63.15.Investors on Wall Street also had their eyes on NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, which suspended trading briefly before announcing that it was in the advanced stages of merger talks with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange.NYSE stock was up 14 per cent to $38.10 while the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s primary options-trading venue, was lifted 4.3 per cent to $25.51.That news followed on from a merger announcement the previous day between the London Stock Exchange and TMX Group, operator of Canada’s largest stock exchange.Wall Street extended its losses after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, began testifying before the House Budget committee. Mr Bernanke said the drop in unemployment in recent months was encouraging but cautioned that it would take several years for hiring to return to normal.In other earnings news, Polo Ralph Lauren was up 8.3 per cent to $125.35 after reporting strong sales over the Christmas season and raising its 2011 operating margin.But not all reports were positive. Computer Sciences saw one of the biggest losses in the session, falling 14.3 per cent to $48.43, after the IT company missed revenue estimates and cut its earnings forecast for the year.Ingersoll-Rand, a maker of cooling systems, fell 5.7 per cent to $46.25 after reporting weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings.Shares in St Joe Company, a Florida real estate developer, lost 7 per cent to $27 after saying late on Tuesday that it was considering a sale of the company.American International Group lost 3 per cent to $41.11 after the insurer said it would take a $4.1bn charge to boost reserves.Take-Two Interactive Software, a video game maker, rose 1.5 per cent to $14.76 after reporting earnings that beat expectations.
8;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Xbox regains lead in console battle;;Microsoft’s Xbox 360 led console sales in the US last month for the first time in more than two years as Nintendo continued to suffer supply problems for the Wii.Microsoft sold 422,000 Xbox 360s in February compared to sales of 398,000 for the Wii and 360,000 for Sony’s PlayStation 3, according to research company NPD.Nintendo told the Financial Times last month it had been operating “hand-to-mouth” in supplying retailers with products in January and February after 3.8m Wiis were sold in the US in December.“On the Wii hardware side, we are back to a situation where demand is exceeding supply and we’re going to be in that situation through to the end of March,” said Reggie Fils-Aimé, president of Nintendo of America.However, analysts were sceptical that supply was Nintendo’s only issue.“We believe that the problem lies deeper than that, as sales of staple titles such as Wii Fit with Balance Board and Wii Play were well below historical levels,” analysts Wedbush Morgan said.“Unlike the PS3, with multiple high-profile exclusives and the newly announced Move controller, and the Xbox 360, with [the] Project Natal [controller], the Wii lacks an important upcoming catalyst,” they said.Microsoft’s Xbox was the top selling console for the first time since September 2007, when its exclusive title, Halo 3, was released. PS3 sales were up 30 per cent on a year earlier in spite of reports of supply problems at retail level. Wii sales were down 47 per cent on February 2009 and overall hardware sales were down 20 per cent on a year earlier, while software suffered a 15 per cent fall.Software sales have fallen in 11 of the past 12 months in the US due to a lack of blockbuster titles and lower spending by recession-hit consumers and a collapse in sales in the music genre.“Honestly, I had expected the industry to perform somewhat better this month,” said Anita Frazier, an NPD analyst. “Nonetheless, strong new releases and Easter gift buying bodes well for industry performance in March.”Major releases in March include Battlefield Bad Company 2 from Electronic Arts, Square Enix’s Final Fantasy XIII and Sony’s God of War III. Take-Two’s Bioshock 2, set in an underwater dystopia called Rapture, was the top-selling game, with 750,000 sales in February of which 75 per cent were for the Xbox 360, NPD said.Sony this week unveiled its motion controller – the PlayStation Move – and said it would sell it with a camera and game for less than $100 this autumn.
9;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations.

The Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent higher at 2,252.67.US commerce department reported a 2.2 per cent rise in third quarter GDP, versus an expected 2.8 per cent increase, shares were buoyed by positive housing data.Existing home sales rose 7.4 per cent in November, beating analysts’ 2.9 per cent forecast.“Home sales took a big leap and that’s obviously adding to the buying momentum,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.While the GDP data was a “negative surprise . . . it still doesn’t subtract from the fact the fourth-quarter GDP is probably going to come in much higher than expected,” he added.Home builders surged on the positive data. KB Home added 6.9 per cent to $13.80, Pulte Homes gained 4.7 per cent to $9.86 and Lennar rose 3.2 per cent to $13.27.Jabil Circuit was another big mover after the electronics manufacturer forecast higher earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter.The company predicted earnings would reach a minimum of $0.20 a share, beating analysts’ expectations. Its shares jumped 14.4 per cent to $17.18.Take-Two Interactive Software forecast a larger than expected fiscal first-quarter loss, leading to losses in early trading. The company announced late on Monday that it would sell its Jack of All Games distribution unit to Synnex for $43.3m to focus on core products, such as the Grand Theft Auto and Bioshock games.Take-Two has recently been the subject of takeover speculation after activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed last week he had built up an 11.3 per cent stake in the company.Take-Two pared the early losses and closed up 0.7 per cent at $9.50.

11;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2009-12-22T21:25:29Z;Capcom warning as launch postponed;;The heavy guns of Activision’s videogame Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 scored a direct hit on Tuesday when Japanese rival Capcom postponed the launch of its own titles to avoid competition, triggering a large profits warning.The highly successful launch of Modern Warfare 2 last month saw the game pull in $550m in sales in its first five days, according to figures released by Activision, sucking up the funds that gamers had available to spend on other new titles.Capcom’s profits warning highlights both the hit-driven nature of the video-game industry and the knock-on effects of a big launch. The releases of games such as Bioshock 2 from publisher Take-Two Interactive and Splinter Cell: Conviction from Ubisoft were pushed back until after Christmas to avoid Activision’s game.The increase in competition in early 2010 has now led Capcom, one of Japan’s largest independent game software publishers, to postpone the release of its own Lost Planet 2 to the second quarter, missing its end of March financial year.Capcom had been counting on 3.7m sales of Lost Planet 2. It also postponed the release of two other games and revised down its sales forecasts for a fourth.“Capcom believes that delaying the launches of its own titles will avoid competing with these new games, maximise the sales volume of the new Capcom games, and preserve the value of the brands associated with these games,” the company said.Capcom cut its sales forecast for the year to March 2010 by 32 per cent to Y65bn ($708m). It said that operating profits would be 61 per cent below its previous forecast at Y6bn and net profit would be 77 per cent lower than expected at Y2bn.The warning came as the market closed, leaving its shares unchanged at Y1,447 in Tokyo.Kazuhiko Abe, Capcom’s CFO, said that there was no issue with the development of Lost Planet 2, which was ready for release on schedule, but rather it was a strategic decision to maximise sales.In video game jargon, Lost Planet 2 is a third-person shooter – based on gunplay with the player-controlled character visible on screen – set in a science fiction universe. Its natural audience is similar to that of the Modern Warfare and Bioshock franchises, which are first-person shooters.Capcom also said it would take an exceptional charge of Y4.5bn, partly offset by a Y1.8bn tax refund, to cover restructuring costs in its amusement arcade business.Videogame software has grown rapidly as an industry and had global sales of $32bn in 2008, according to market researcher Media Control GfK.Investors have become frustrated by the risks of game publishing, however. For example, Take-Two made a large profit in 2008 with the success of Grand Theft Auto 4, but fell to a $138m loss this year without a similar hit.

Analysts had predicted it to hold steady at 10.2 per cent.“Because the payroll data is out of step with most other employment indicators, this suggests a strong seasonal factor influence in the report,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. “As such, this report does little to change our double-dip risk assessment.”Big Lots added to the early optimism on Friday after the clearance retailer raised its outlook for the holiday season.The group, which sells manufacturers’ excess inventory at discounted prices, also posted quarterly results above estimates.Demand had remained strong during the recession and lower freight costs also boosted gross margins, the company said. Its shares jumped 19.3 per cent to $28.08.Retailers in general disappointed Wall Street this week as the results of the Thanksgiving shopping period emerged. More than 80 per cent of retailers missed their November sales estimates. For the week, Abercrombie & Fitch was down 9.6 per cent to $36.13 and Macy’s lost 5.8 per cent to $15.98.Concerns over the Dubai debt crisis soon evaporated this week, but the market was pulled in opposite directions by conflicting economic indicators.Pending home sales unexpectedly rose, manufacturing data came in worse than expected and the services industry showed a surprise contraction. More private jobs were lost than had been expected, but fewer people filed claims for unemployment benefits.Over the week the S&P 500 still managed to gain
1.3 per cent, the Dow was up 0.8 per cent and the Nasdaq climbed 2.6 per cent.Marvell Technology, which makes chips for wireless routers, also helped lift the market on Friday, gaining 9.3 per cent to $18.06.The company posted higher-than-expected quarterly results and said it had seen increased demand across all of its markets.Bank of America climbed 2.8 per cent to $16.20 after the lender sold $19.3bn of securities as part of its plan to pay back government bail-out funds.Smith & Wesson, the gun maker, moved back into the black in the second quarter after demand for firearms increased.Analysts said President Barack Obama’s election could have momentarily boosted the industry because fear of future regulation had prompted a rush in gun sales.However, the company’s outlook for the next quarter was bleaker than analysts had been expecting, and its shares were down 15.6 per cent to $4.45.Take-Two Interactive Software, the video game maker behind “Grand Theft Auto”, was one of the Nasdaq’s biggest losers.Its shares plunged 29.1 per cent to $7.74 after the company warned that its fourth-quarter results would miss expectations.Comcast has been in focus this week after it finally sealed a deal to take control of NBC Universal from General Electric. Comcast shares gained 8.4 per cent to $16.13 this week."
13;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2009-03-04T22:28:57Z;Activision;;"Collecting points in a computer game serves little purpose other than bragging rights over other players. Yet big tech companies often behave the same way, building up large piles of cash in the name of flexibility. However, Activision – the world’s largest publisher of computer games since merging with Blizzard Entertainment last year in a deal that gave French media conglomerate Vivendi 54 per cent of the company – may be tempted to use the $3bn of cash lying idle on its balance sheet. Successful integration of Blizzard has boosted management credibility with investors, while the credit crunch has helpfully lowered valuations for potential targets.Who might be in the gunsights? Activision’s recent success has been built on the Guitar Hero franchise (with over $1bn in sales worldwide), and Call of Duty, a soldiering shoot ’em up. So the sporting games of Take Two might round out its portfolio. With Take Two shares currently worth $500m, it would also be a finger in the eye of competitor Electronic Arts, which eventually withdrew a $2bn bid for the company last year.Yet profitable and growing Activision has typically pursued a strategy of buying small studios or intellectual property. Indeed the rights to Guitar Hero were picked up for a mere $100m. It has then concentrated on a narrow selection of big franchises, plus Blizzard’s World of Warcraft – which boasts 11.5m online users and means that half of group operating profit now comes from a stable subscription base. Lossmaking Electronic Arts, by comparison, has been a serial acquirer.So Activision should resist letting its cash burn a hole in its pocket. If it must spend, beyond the odd small, opportunistic bargain, then its own shares on a not unreasonable 16 times prospective earnings may be a better bet than empire building. It can always wait for peers to run out of lives.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

15;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2008-12-18T21:50:25Z;Wall St slips lower on struggling oil stocks;;General Electric sparked a sharp afternoon sell-off on Thursday as Standard & Poor’s negative credit rating outlook led investors to question which other companies could be vulnerable.Several big financial and industrial names came under heavy selling pressure in the wake of the move, which extended a commodities-led retreat.“If a titan like GE is susceptible in the current environment, it makes you wonder who else is,” said Steve Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investments.Shares in GE, one of the few companies in the world to retain a triple A credit rating, fell 8.2 per cent to $15.96.S&P, the credit rating agency, affirmed the rating but said there was a one in three chance it could cut it in the next two years.The move helped drag the benchmark S&P 500 index back beneath its 50 day moving average, a key technical level that was surpassed earlier in the week for the first time since shortly after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.The S&P finished down 2.1 per cent to 885.34, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.5 per cent to 8,604.99 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.7 per cent to 1,552.37.The energy sector led the declines as crude oil fell below $36 a barrel for the first time since July 2004 in spite of the Opec oil cartel’s record 2.2m barrel-a-day production cut.Massey Energy and National Oilwell Varco were among the biggest losers, off 11.4 per cent to $13.83 and 12.4 per cent to $22.86, respectively.Materials also staged a retreat as base metals fell. ArcelorMittal shed 4.7 per cent to $25.04 after Barclays downgraded its view of the stock to “equal weight”.“In our bear case scenario, we note the possibility that ArcelorMittal violates its debt covenant,” said Dana Guido, Barcalys analyst. “We stress that we find it highly unlikely that ArcelorMittal would actually breach its debt covenants . . . but, in our opinion, balance sheet concerns are likely to prevent significant outperformance in the months ahead.”Industrials also came under pressure from the latest profit warnings in the sector, this time from Ingersoll-Rand and Pentair. The manufacturers lost 4.7 per cent to $15.59 and 4.6 per cent to $23.75, respectively.The latter disclosed plans to cut about 1,600 jobs and close facilities as it prepares for a 15 per cent drop in profit next year.FedEx fell 2.1 per cent to $62.60 even after the delivery group disclosed second-quarter earnings that were broadly in line with expectations lowered by a profit warning last week, when the shares tumbled 16.8 per cent. The shipping company said it would cut executive salaries and freeze hiring in 2009.Among the big names to come under pressure, Caterpillar lost 5.6 per cent to $42.16 after unveiling plans to cut hundreds of workers.Semiconductors also did badly. Intellost 6.6 per cent to $14.26 after Jefferies cut its recommendation on the stock to “underperform”.Elsewhere in technology, Take-Two Interactive Software disclosed an an unexpected fourth-quarter loss and warned profit next year would be lower than forecast. Shares in the Grand Theft Auto video game publisher sank 26.2 per cent to $8.91.Although the leading indices posted big declines, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index – known as Wall Street’s fear gauge – fell 5 per cent to 47.34, its lowest level since October.Despite the losses elsewhere, defensive stocks held out after more largely downbeat economic data on unemployment and manufacturing provided fresh insight into the depth of the recession.Investors dipped their toes into the healthcare, utility and consumer staple sectors, all of which found positive territory.Soft drink bottlers were among the best performing defensive names after Coca-Cola Enterprisesraised its earnings outlook and unveiled a well-received restructuring plan.Its shares rallied 8.3 per cent to $11.58 while peer Pepsi Bottling Group jumped 7.7 per cent $21.01.Conagra Foods advanced 1.9 per cent to $16.55 after Citigroup named the stock as its favourite in the large cap branded food sector, highlighting that it traded at a 23 per cent discount to peers on an earnings basis.
16;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2008-09-15T18:41:52Z;Car theft gamemaker falls as EA ends pursuit;;Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto video game series, lost almost a quarter of its value on Monday after rival Electronic Arts ended its seven-month pursuit of the company.EA said on Sunday it had abandoned talks over a deal and would not continue with its bid.Take-Two shares fell 24 per cent in New York to $16.57.Analysts lowered their target prices for Take-Two and suggested it had made a strategic error in the talks.Standard & Poor’s analysts, referring to the performance of the Grand Theft Auto IV game, said: “We believe negotiations became more difficult after Take-Two was unwilling to budge on its position after it exceeded expectations in its most recent quarterly results.“We think that Electronic Arts will be hurt by not having Take-Two’s Grand Theft Auto nor being the market leader in the video game industry following the merger of Activision and Vivendi Games to form Activision Blizzard.”Citigroup analysts said that, while a deal was dead for now, they believed EA would return at a later date. Take-Two was a good strategic fit, with sports franchises needed by EA and was being run by a turnround team who saw an acquisition as an exit strategy, they said.In an interview with the Financial Times, Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two chairman, said it was EA who had refused to budge in not raising its offer.He said: “They approached us and they stayed at a price and they never budged, in fact they reduced it. That’s not typically the way deals get done”.He said EA continued to be in discussions with other parties regarding its process to consider strategic alternatives, but said he was not in a position to name possible suitors.EA, the publisher of titles such as the Madden NFL football game and The Sims, had been fighting to acquire Take-Two since February, when it offered to pay up to $26 per share, or about $2bn.The companies started formal talks over a deal last month, after EA allowed to expire an unsolicited tender offer it had made to buy Take-Two at the slightly lower price of $25.74.The Federal Trade Commission ruled in August that it would not oppose a deal between the two companies, a move some analysts had felt was the main obstacle to a takeover.EA said on Sunday that after reviewing Take-Two’s financial materials and hearing presentations from management, it had “decided not to make a proposal to acquire Take-Two and has terminated discussions”.

He said Take-Two’s business had strengthened since EA first made its unsolicited offer.Throughout the saga between the two companies, investors have tried to calculate whether EA would be willing to pay more than $26 per share – or whether a deal would close at all.Shares of Take-Two have traded below $26 since late June and had dropped below $22 in recent trading sessions. Shares in the publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series closed at $21.89 on Friday.The company has had a volatile 18 months. Shareholders ejected top management in early 2007 over lacklustre results and questions over graphic content in the company’s games. Several of its former senior executives were caught up in an accounting scandal.Its third-quarter results came in stronger than expected on heavy sales of Grand Theft Auto 4 but the company cut its outlook to reflect the delayed release of another game.Vivendi, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with Activision Blizzard, which was formed in July when Vivendi closed on a deal to meld Activision, Electronic Arts’ major competitor, into its own gaming business. Activision, which publishes the popular Guitar Hero video game franchise, announced last week that it would buy UK game developer FreeStyleGames.
18;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2008-08-29T17:10:18Z;Square Enix in friendly offer for Temco;;"Tecmo, a Japanese video games developer known for gratuitous gore and highly-sexualised female characters, has received a takeover bid from a larger rival as consolidation accelerates in the industry.Square Enix said on Friday it would make a friendly offer for at least 50 per cent of the company provided that Tecmo’s board accepted its offer by September 4. Tecmo replied that it was considering its response to the offer, which values its equity at Y21.7bn ($200m).If successful, the deal would unite Tecmo’s Dead or Alive fighting titles and Ninja Gaiden action adventures, with Square Enix’s Final Fantasy series of role-playing games. Tecmo’s franchises are popular in the US and Europe – an important attraction for Square Enix as it seeks to produce titles that will have broad appeal worldwide.The deal is the latest merger between companies struggling with the high cost of creating games for next-generation consoles such as Sony’s Playstation 3 and Microsoft’s Xbox 360.France’s Vivendi recently merged its games business with Activision Blizzard of the US, while Electronic Arts is in talks to buy US rival Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series, for about $2bn.Square Enix has struck at a difficult time for Tecmo. Tomonobu Itagaki – the company’s star developer, whose long hair, leather jacket and sunglasses are not the usual attire of a Japanese salaryman – quit Tecmo at the start of June. He then sued his former employer for alleged non­payment of a completion bonus for Dead or Alive 4. Tecmo denies that such a payment was due.Last week, Yoshimi Yasuda, Tecmo’s president, announced he would step down for personal reasons on the day of the company’s interim results presentation.It was Mr Yasuda’s resignation that prompted Square Enix, which had been talking to Tecmo about a deal since May, to make the unusual move of making public its friendly offer before Tecmo’s acceptance. “We were worried about what would happen to our discussions,” said Yoichi Wada, president of Square Enix.Square Enix is offering Tecmo Y920 a share, a premium of 30 per cent to Tecmo’s share price before the bid was announced. That is equivalent to 22 times Tecmo’s own earnings forecast for 2008. Analysts said the deal was not expensive, because Tecmo has Y11.5bn in cash on its balance sheet.“Square [would only be] paying Y12bn in net cash for a business with Y2.5bn in annual operating profit,” said Pelham Smithers, an analyst at brokerage Pali International.Tecmo shares rose by their daily trading limit of 14 per cent to close at Y806; Square Enix shares added 2.6 per cent to Y3,610."
19;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2008-08-18T18:13:36Z;EA bid for Take-Two lapses;;Electronic Arts on Monday said it would no longer stand behind its $24.75-a-share takeover offer for rival games maker Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series, though it also edged a step closer to starting direct negotiations about a deal.The latest manoeuvring between the two games companies pointed to a potential breakthrough in a stand-off that has lasted nearly six months, since EA first went public with its unsolicited all-cash offer.Wall Street continued to anticipate that the long siege would end in an agreement. Hopes for a sweetened bid from EA faded, however, as the company said it would let its formal offer, for $25.74 a share, lapse on Monday night. Take-Two’s shares slipped on Monday, falling 69 cents to $2.15In a letter to Strauss Zelnick, chairman of Take-Two, John Riccitiello, chief executive of EA, said he was not prepared to stand behind the original offer “given the passage of time” since it was made, and that EA needed to carry out due diligence before being able to confirm the price. In a hint that the company might consider lowering its bid, he added: “We no longer believe we can integrate Take-Two ahead of the important holiday season.”“Much as we warned, the passage of time has eroded the value of this offer,” an EA spokesman added.The move came after Mr Zelnick wrote to his EA counterpart over the weekend offering to make a presentation to EA’s board outlining what he called Take-Two’s “strong operational and financial performance,” adding: “I believe our presentation will enable you to understand better the value of our Company to EA.” Take-Two has rejected EA’s offer as too low.The presentation, Mr Zelnick added, had been prepared by Take-Two as part of a review of its strategic alternatives, and that “other participants” have been involved in the process. However, despite the company’s efforts in recent months to flush out alternative bidders, no white knight has emerged.The signs of movement in the stand-off between the two companies followed a call that Mr Riccitiello made to Mr Zelnick last Friday, according to one person close to the situation. The call led Take-Two to make its offer to provide the more detailed management presentation, according to this person.On Monday, the two sides were still in discussion about the terms of a confidentiality agreement that EA would have to sign before Take-Two would agree to make the in-depth financial presentation.

Eleven million units had been sold to retailers by May 31, with around 8.5m sold through to consumers.GTA IV’s sales beat the $300m recorded by Halo 3, the previous record-holder, in its opening week. The movie Iron Man, released at the same time as GTA IV, earned $201m globally in its first five days.Take-Two reported $539.8m in second-quarter game revenues, compared to just $205.4m in the same quarter in 2007. Analysts had expected revenues of $499m.”Take-Two’s performance has exceeded expectations through the first half of fiscal 2008, clearly demonstrating the creative, operational and financial strength of our business,” said Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two chairman.The company raised its forecasts for the full year to $1.4bn-$1.5bn in revenues and earnings per share of $1.65 - $1.85, up from from $1.25bn-$1.4bn and $1.35 to $1.55 per share. For the current quarter, it expected sales of $325m - $375m, compared to the analyst consensus of $322m gathered by Reuters Estimates.The company’s management has rebuffed an offer from Electronic Arts, currently worth $25.74 a share, saying it undervalued the company.EA has extended a tender offer to shareholders until June 16 but has so far found few takers.On Wednesday, it reported it had reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that would allow regulators time to study the proposed deal.Take-Two shares were down 0.4 per cent in after-hours trading in New York at $27.53.
21;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2008-05-27T22:39:49Z;Video game developers push for tax breaks;;British video games developers are redoubling pressure on the government to address a lack of tax breaks and skills that could set the industry even further behind foreign rivals.Fifteen video games companies have now joined “Games Up?”, a lobbying group led by Tiga and Elspa, the trade bodies for developers and publishers respectively.The backers include many of the industry’s biggest names, from local groups such as Eidos (part of SCi Entertainment) and Codemasters to global giants Electronic Arts, Take Two Interactive and Ubisoft – even though several of these companies have been lured to Canada by tax rebates and grants from the Montreal government.Last week the US state of Georgia approved legislation offering tax credits of up to 30 per cent for entertainment productions, such as films and games. Richard Wilson, chief executive of Tiga, the UK trade association for games developers, said Georgia’s announcement was “emblematic of the increasingly unfair competition that the UK games industry faces”.He said the success of Canada’s progressive tax scheme for developers helped its games production industry overtake the UK’s as the world’s third largest in 2006, and South Korea is now not far behind.The games market was worth £16bn in 2007, according to Tiga, while UK-made games generated £4bn globally from £1.4bn in inward investment between 2006 and 2008.It cited figures by Games Investor Consulting that suggested if its proposals on skills and tax credits were implemented, the UK games industry would receive an additional investment of £220m over five years, creating an additional 1,500 jobs, rather than the projected decline from 10,000 UK developers today.Even with the recent launch of Grand Theft Auto IV, a big-budget blockbuster developed in Scotland by Rockstar North and published by Take Two, the UK’s development industry is past its heyday, as developers of past successes such as Tomb Raider relocate overseas. “All our key competitors offer tax breaks and grants, putting UK developers at a disadvantage,” said Mr Wilson.He added that the government “at the very least” should follow the example of France, which last December cleared 20 per cent tax relief for developers through the European Commission.

They also exceed opening weeks for the film and book record-holders, Spider-Man 3 and the Harry Potter series.GTA IV’s success is expected to give a significant boost to sales of the two consoles on which it has initially been released – Sony’s PlayStation 3 and Microsoft’s Xbox 360.It may also embolden Take-Two’s management, which has described a $2bn takeover bid by Electronic Arts, the largest video games publisher, as undervaluing the company.“Grand Theft Auto IV’s first-week performance represents the largest launch in the history of interactive entertainment, and we believe these retail sales levels surpass any movie or music launch to date,” said Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two chairman.The game, from Take-Two’s Scottish developer Rockstar Games, tells the story of an eastern European immigrant called Niko being sucked into a life of crime in Liberty City – a virtual version of New York. It has earned unprecedented ratings from critics.GTA IV’s sales beat the $300m recorded by Halo 3, the previous record-holder, in its opening week.Global sales on April 29, its opening day, of 3.6m units worth $310m compared with $170m in US sales for Halo in its first 24 hours.Iron Man, released last weekend as Hollywood’s first blockbuster of the summer film season, took in $104m at the US box office in its first three days and $201m globally in its first five days. Spider-Man 3 had a record US debut of $151m on the same weekend last year.Comparisons are difficult, given the $10 average price of a cinema ticket and the $60 charged for the basic version of GTA IV.Films also make more money as they become DVDs and are sold to TV and cable channels, although Grand Theft Auto will have new revenue streams.Additional episodic content will be released online for the Xbox 360 and the publishers will profit from in-game advertising and associated music sales.

24;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2008-03-28T19:38:44Z;Electronic Arts turns heat up on Take-Two;;Electronic Arts on Friday took a tougher line with its $2bn takeover target Take-Two, warning a poison pill introduced by the board of the rival video game publisher was increasing the risk for its shareholders.EA said it was amending its tender offer for Take-Two shares in the light of the adoption of the poison pill this week and Take-Two postponing its annual meeting by a week.It said its offer was now conditional on the poison pill – a rights issue that would dilute Take-Two’s shares – being redeemed or made invalid. It also extended its $26-a-share offer by a week to April 18, the day after the annual meeting. “The actions of the Take-Two board may increase the risk for their stockholders by delaying a potential transaction,” said Owen Mahoney, head of corporate development at EA.EA also revealed that only 5,000 of Take-Two’s 74m shares have been tendered since the offer was made on March 13.Analysts said the derisory number was not significant.“People will wait, they have already showed their willingness to go higher [from $25 to $26],” said Brent Thill, Citigroup analyst.Take-Two shares have risen nearly 50 per cent since EA’s offer became public on February 24.Mr Thill said he believed the steps being taken by the two companies were ploys that would lead to negotiations where they would “meet somewhere in the middle” on a higher valuation.However, Michael Pachter, analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities, warned there was a real chance EA could abandon the possible deal, and the fact that EA had not been building a significant stake in Take-Two was an indication it would be willing to walk away.
25;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2008-03-27T20:07:18Z;EA urges Take-Two to negotiate;;Electronic Arts has again urged Take-Two to negotiate after the rival video game publisher recommended that its stockholders not tender any of its shares to EA and help its $2bn takeover bid.Take-Two said on Wednesday that its board had thoroughly reviewed EA’s $26-a-share offer for the company and had unanimously determined that it was inadequate.It said it would explore alternatives, which could include a merger with other companies or remaining independent.The company had wanted to put off any discussions until after the April 29 release of its Grand Theft Auto IV game, a title expected to be the industry hit of the year.But on Wednesday, Take-Two said it was willing to begin preliminary talks now with interested parties.The board also adopted a “poison pill” rights-issue agreement designed to thwart attempts to acquire control of the company at “an inadequate price for all stockholders”.Take-Two said the rights would become exercisable if a party commenced a tender offer, as EA has done, that could result in the party owning 20 per cent or more of the shares.John Riccitiello, EA chief executive, told the Financial Times that he did not blame Take-Two’s management for trying to get the best value for shareholders.But he added: “When a company [like EA] offers a 60 per cent premium that’s really hard to say no to. How I think is: unless you’ve got a really good way to get that much money or more in really quick order, you should be really negotiating to get the best outcome.”
26;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Games industry chases tax deals to halt exodus;;Britain’s games industry is intensifying calls for the government to grant tax breaks to help prevent a brain drain to Canada after SCi, the UK’s largest games publisher, became the latest company to shift production across the Atlantic.Earlier this month SCi, owner of the Lara Croft Tomb Raider franchise, announced plans to cut 25 per cent of staff, mostly in the UK, while increasing investment in Canada.“The UK has become a very expensive place to develop games,” said Ian Livingstone, creative director at SCi. “ Look at the top 20 best-selling games – not one of them is being developed in the UK.”Unhappiness over the country’s games environment comes as the sector braces itself for potential criticism in a government report out on Thursday on the effect of computer games and the internet on children.The games sector often comes under fire for the violent content of some of its output and for encouraging children to adopt a sedentary lifestyle, adding to a sense that the government does not value the industry.“We make the UK economy a small fortune but are still treated as pariahs,” said Ian Baverstock, chief executive of Kuju, one of the UK’s larger developers. “Why they go on giving tax breaks to the film industry but not to us, I don’t understand.”SCi is the latest company to join the UK exodus, which has seen US publishers Electronic Arts and Take Two move their European headquarters out of the country. Only one of SCi’s four key games franchises – Championship Manager – is still developed in the UK.Championship Manager employs about 50 people in Britain, compared with new development studios re-cently opened in Montreal, which are expected to have staff of 350.EA recently consolidated its remaining studios in the UK into a single building, and has about 450 development staff in the country, compared with more than 1,000 in Canada.Many companies have been rushing to locate new projects in Canada, where regional governments are offering games companies lucrative tax deals. Companies can get about 30 to 40 per cent of their wage bill refunded if they move there – one of their most substantial costs – while employees are offered income tax holidays for up to five years.The moves helped Canada overtake the UK in 2006 to become the third largest region for games development in the world.Canadian subsidies have already substantially shrunk the French games industry, where, since 2000, 45 per cent of development studios have gone out of business and an estimated 1,500 development staff have moved to Canada. The UK industry, which employs about 21,000 people and generates £2bn ($4bn) in revenues, is worried it could suffer the same fate.“The Canadians have driven a tank over the French Citroën and have now parked on our lawn,” said Peter Jackson, director-general of Elspa, the trade body for the UK’s games publishers. “It is becoming very challenging to keep core development studios here.”Ministers have been reluctant to consider subsidies, however, saying they planned instead to challenge Canada’s tax breaks through the WTO. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it was taking steps to ask the European Commission to investigate the issue as a matter of priority.But the games industry fears this process could take too long to be of help.“In 10 years’ time we might have a ruling. At that time we will be on the fifth version of the PlayStation, and whether we will still have a games development sector in the UK will be a moot point,” said Jason Kingsley, chief executive and co-founder of Rebellion, one of the UK’s largest games developers.
27;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Departure of EA takeover chief;;Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest independent video game publisher, has announced the departure of a key figure in its fight to gain control of rival Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series of games.EA said that Warren Jenson, chief financial officer for the past six years, was leaving the company and that a successor would be announced shortly. It gave no reason for the change.Mr Jenson had been leading the $2bn takeover bid for Take-Two with John Riccitiello, chief executive, and his departure comes as a surprise.EA said Mr Jenson would help with the transition to his replacement and would close out EA’s fiscal year, which ends next Monday.A regulatory filing re-vealed EA reached a transition agreement with Mr Jenson last week. He would continue to receive his base salary of $595,000 a year with benefits until September 30 unless he took up a new job.Mr Riccitiello has made several management changes since he succeeded Larry Probst as chief executive a year ago. He has reorganised the company into four different “labels” with separate heads and this month appointed a chief operating officer, John Pleasants, to lead the company’s global publishing operations.Mr Jenson is a high-profile CFO, having served in that position in companies as varied as Amazon.com, NBC and Delta Airlines.

The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,243.87.“The overall sentiment picture suggests that although there is scope for a short-lived rally, equities are by no means out of the bear trend,” said analyst Sreekala Kochugovindan of Barclays Capital. “Sentiment is only marginally below crisis levels and there is a risk that once the euphoria of [the Federal Reserve’s liquidity action] subsides, investor focus could return to the continued problems of financial sector woes and the effect of a mild bout of stagflation.”Credit Suisse characterised said the Fed’s action – which sparked a massive rally in stocks on Monday – “does not address the fundamental problem of solvency, in our view. The two critical issues are that US housing still looks overvalued and that we think banks need to deleverage.”Until the Fed-induced rally, the market had retreated for three successive sessions as investors were unnerved by reports of margin calls at hedge funds and soaring home foreclosures.Financial stocks ended lower after a volatile day’s trade. The S&P financial index fell 2.1 per cent, while an index of investment banks fell 1.8 per cent.Among big bank stocks, Citigroup fell 1.3 per cent to $21.21, JPMorgan, fell 0.6 per cent at $38.61, while Bear Stearns fell 2.2 per cent at $61.58.Shares in the government sponsored mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae closed lower in active trade.Both Fannie and Freddie fell sharply this morning after media reports said they might have to issue more than $10bn in new stock this year as the lenders continue to serve as a backstop for the deteriorating housing market.Freddie Mac fell 0.6 per cent to $20.04 despite comments from the company’s chief executive that it had sufficient capital and had no plans to raise more capital through a share sale. Fannie Mae, Freddie’s larger rival, fell 4.4 per cent to $21.04.Countrywide, the mortgage lender which Bank of America has agreed to buy, fell 7.1 per cent to $4.75. Fitch, the ratings agency, cut the lender’s rating to BBB- from BBB+ after the market closed.American Eagle, the clothing retailer, said its fourth-quarter profit fell 6.4 per cent as it increased discounts to clear out unsold merchandise. The earnings were in line with expectations and the shares gained 4 per cent to $17.94. Healthcare company WellPoint fell 1.7 per cent to $46.45 after Fitch changed its outlook on the company from “stable” to “negative”. WellPoint warned early this week that 2008 earnings would not meet forecasts because of higher medical costs and fewer subscribers than expected.JPMorgan downgraded a number of airlines, including American, Northwest and Delta. Shares in American fell 12.8 per cent to $9.31. Northwest fell 16.2 per cent to $10.25 while Delta was down 16.4 per cent at $10.13.Shares in Take-Two Interactive gained in afternoon trade, rising 1.1 per cent to $24.91, after the video game publisher raised its outlook for 2008. Take-Two reiterated that it had rejected a $2bn buy-out offer from rival Electronic Arts.Dow component Caterpillar said after the close of the previous session that 2008 sales and earnings would top earlier forecasts. The heavy equipment maker also raised its long-term sales goal. Shares rose 3.6 per cent to $75.25.The pharmaceuticals sector came under pressure after Wyeth and Progenics

29;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2008-03-12T03:11:06Z;Take-Two raises earnings forecast;;Take-Two, the video game publisher that has become a $2bn takeover target, on Tuesday raised its 2008 forecasts on the strength of pre-orders for its Grand Theft Auto IV title.The GTA series – was “the industry’s biggest hit”, said Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two chairman, on an analyst conference call, and GTA IV would be released on April 29 as expected.“We are confident it will exceed the expectations of its most devoted fans and will set a new milestone,” he said.GTA and its developer RockStar Games are seen as the main attraction for Electronic Arts in its bid to acquire the company. It was twice rejected last month by Take-Two’s board with offers of $25 a share and then $26.Mr Zelnick repeated on Tuesday that EA’s offer undervalued the company. He has said Take-Two is open to talks with EA from April 30, the day after GTA’s release.EA has warned it could walk away from its proposed deal if it cannot win control earlier and maximise possible GTA revenues through its more powerful marketing and distribution business.Take-Two said it was raising its 2008 fiscal year guidance to $1.25bn to $1.4bn in revenues and $1.35 to $1.55 in earnings per share. It said this was due to its first-quarter results ending January 31 exceeding expectations and better-than-expected pre-orders for GTA IV.The company reported first-quarter revenues of $240.4m, down from $277.3m a year earlier and a net loss of 52 cents per share, compared to a 30 cents loss in the first quarter of 2007. Its second quarter forecast of $450m to $500m in revenues and earnings of $1 to $1.10 a share were above Wall Street expectations of $460m in sales and 99 cents in earnings per share.Take-Two shares rose 1.5 per cent in after-hours trading to $25.01 on the news.
30;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2008-03-09T21:08:16Z;Take-Two’s severance plan puts EA on notice;;Electronic Arts will be recalculating the cost and benefits of its proposed $2bn acquisition of Take-Two on Monday after the rival video game publisher announced a generous severance package for its employees.In a regulatory filing late on Friday, Take-Two said its board had approved a package for employees in the event that they lose their jobs as a result of a take-over. They would receive as much as one-and-a-half times their salary and bonus for up to 18 months.EA has already expressed its “surprise”, and analysts and corporate governance experts had raised eyebrows, at the compensation package Take-Two’s management team won for itself last month while talks with EA were being held in private.Salaries and possible bonuses were more than tripled and restricted shares were awarded worth millions of dollars. The executive team is not included in the new severance terms.Take-Two’s severance packages are similar to the change of control packages announced by Yahoo for its employees last month, a move described in one lawsuit brought against the internet company as being part of its effort to thwart Microsoft’s takeover bid by increasing the cost by at least $1bn.EA has said it sees synergies in Take-Two’s corporate and publishing organisations, meaning there would be opportunities for job cuts as EA’s more powerful publishing arm takes over distribution of the titles from Take-Two’s studios.EA prizes Rockstar Games, developer of the Grand Theft Auto title, but has been coy about its plans for 2K Sports, which duplicates many of the games offered by its EA Sports label. It has also declined to give estimates for savings it could make or for the initial costs of merging the two organisations.There has been little activity since EA went public with its takeover bid two weeks ago and Take-Two revealed it had rejected its offer of $26 a share, which was a dollar higher than an initial bid.Unless EA raises its offer further, analysts expect little to happen until the release of Grand Theft Auto IV on April 29. Take-Two’s management has said it is prepared to open talks with EA on April 30 and that EA’s rejection of this offer shows it is trying to acquire the company at a significant discount before the year’s most anticipated game is released.EA has said that Take-Two will be worth less to it if there is no early agreement that enables its stronger marketing arm to maximise sales of the game worldwide.“We don’t think time is the friend of Take-Two,” Warren Jenson, EA chief financial officer, told the Financial Times.He described the company as “sub-scale”, in an industry where scale increasingly mattered, and warned EA could walk away from the deal: “That is certainly an option, Take-Two is depreciating as an asset,” he said.Brent Thill, Citigroup analyst, said EA’s bid was part of a period of “accelerated consolidation” among video game publishers as they strived to maximise revenues from the millions of next-generation consoles now in gamers’ hands.He pointed to Activision’s $19bn combination with Vivendi’s games division, expected to be completed in the first half. “You are going to come down to two main vendors – EA and Activision Blizzard,” he says.He added that most deals made public resulted in higher bids, “and that’s what it’s going to take to get this deal done”.Ben Feder, Take-Two chief executive, defended the new compensation packages he and other top executives had been awarded. He told the FT that discussions about it had predated any indication of interest from EA.“At the end of the day, it’s all to be voted on by shareholders,” he said.Mr Feder was put in place as chief executive after major shareholders, dissatisfied with Take-Two’s financial performance, removed the old board at its annual meeting a year ago. He said he had launched a $25m cost-cutting programme, reorganised the company, made a preliminary settlement over outstanding litigation and improved its product portfolio.”I would love to see this through, most turnarounds take about 18 months and we are about 10 months into this one. It’s a work in progress, but we will do whatever the shareholders wish us to do.”

The benchmark index declined 3.5 per cent in February and has fallen 9.3 per cent this year.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.9 per cent this week to 12,266.39. The index fell 3 per cent in February.The Nasdaq composite shed 1.4 per cent this week to 2,271.48 and has declined 14.4 per cent this year.The worst consumer confidence reading in 16 years, soft economic growth data, higher jobless claims, soaring oil prices and falling home sales and house prices all contributed to the gloom.Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, sparked a sell-off in financial stocks when he said there would probably be some bank failures, and urged lenders to increase capital.An index tracking regional S&P 500 banks fell 6.2 per cent on the week, while a broader index of financial stocks fell 4.9 per cent to 6-week low.Losses incurred by a wheat trader and a suite of analyst downgrades sent MF Global 39.9 per cent lower to $17.55 this week. Ratings agencies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s lowered their credit ratings on the brokerage.Record losses at government-sponsored mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and problems at Thornburg Mortgage added to concerns about the health of the housing market.Shares in Fannie Mae, which this week reported a $3.6bn fourth-quarter loss, fell 3.7 per cent to $27.65.Smaller rival Freddie Mac posted a quarterly loss of $2.5bn and issued a bleak outlook for the year ahead.“Today’s economy represents one of the most severe housing downturns in American history,” said Richard Syron, chief executive. Shares fell 5.4 per cent to $25.18.Thornburg Mortgage, which specialises in exotic home loans, fell 17.6 per cent to $8.90 after it said it might have to sell assets to meet lenders’ demands for in-creased collateral.Credit worries intensified after AIG, the world’s largest insurer, reported a $5.3bn loss owing to $11.5bn in writedowns on derivatives. AIG’s shares fell 4.1 per cent to $46.86.UBS, which on Friday said credit-market losses at financial firms might top $600bn, said the writedown at AIG was “also the clearest indication that banks are not the only ones to suffer potential losses”.Bond insurers endured a roller-coaster week. Moody’s and S&P affirmed the triple-A ratings of Ambac and MBIA, although uncertainty surrounding the Citigroup-led plan to rescue Ambac worried investors.Ambac’s shares rose 4 per cent on the week to $11.14 and MBIA added 6.5 per cent to $12.97, despite saying it could incur claims payments amounting to a significant portion of its reserves.Assured Guaranty soared 14.4 per cent to $25.65 after Wilbur Ross agreed to buy up to $1bn in shares. Assured is less exposed to the subprime market than its larger rivals.In the broader market, RH Donnelley lost more than half its value after the Yellow Pages publisher reduced its earnings forecast and scrapped plans for a dividend. Its shares fell 59.4 per cent to $7.09.Technology and media and companies provided some light in the darkness.Take-Two Software, the video game publisher, sur-ged 43.6 per cent this week to $26.50 after it received an unsolicited $2bn offer from rival Electronic Arts. Take-Two rebuffed EA’s offer, saying it undervalued the company, and filings revealed it has since received other, informal approaches. EA’s shares fell 5 per cent this week to $47.29.Technology consulting company Sapient rose 19.2 per cent to $7.38 after it said first-quarter sales would exceed analysts’ estimates.Novell rose 12.7 per cent to $7.41 after the Linux software distributor reported fiscal first-quarter profits that beat estimates.3Com leapt 15.8 per cent to $3.29 after the Wall Street Journal said Bain Capital and Huawei Technologies planned to reapply for ap-proval to buy the networking systems and services provider in a $2.2bn deal.OmniVision Technologies, which makes image sensors, jumped 26.5 per cent to $15.86 after its earnings surpassed estimates.But Sprint Nextel slid 20.2 per cent to $7.11 after the third-biggest US wireless carrier posted a $29.5bn net loss for the fourth quarter.

Take-Two’s board had rejected it as “inadequate” on Friday.The world’s biggest independent video games publisher warned that the value of the deal to EA would dissipate if it could not be completed soon.EA is keen to finalise a deal in time for the launch by Take-Two of Grand Theft Auto IV on April 29. This would give its global publishing and distribution business time to boost sales of the most anticipated title of the year in the industry.“We would sell more of it; we have subsidiaries in places that, given their scale, I don’t think they’ve ever visited,” Mr Riccitiello said.However, Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, argues the real reason behind EA’s need to complete a takeover bid quickly is the strength of Take-Two’s 2K sports game franchises.While EA leads in sports games sales with titles such as Madden NFL, Take-Two’s 2K titles have earned better reviews in some cases for their more innovative game-play.“The real urgency in getting this deal done is the launch of basketball games in the autumn. It doesn’t make sense to market two of them: they want to eliminate the competition in sports,” he told the Financial Times.The acquisition of Take-Two, and what is expected to be the best-selling game of the year, would be expected to keep EA as the number one publisher, a position threatened in December when the merger between Activision and Vivendi’s games unit was announced.The two sides said the $18.9bn merger would make the new company, Activision Blizzard, “the world’s largest, most profitable, pure-play video game publisher” with about $3.8bn in combined revenues in the 2007 calendar year.The merger is expected to be completed in the first half but a combination of EA and Take-Two is expected to have about $4.8bn in revenues in their 2008 fiscal years.The Activision/Vivendi deal was seen as auguring a period of consolidation in the industry, but at the time EA denied any connection with its reopening of takeover discussions with Take-Two.“We’ve been in an on-and-off dialogue for a year,” Warren Jenson, chief financial officer, told the FT.Mr Riccitiello said he opened talks last March as the newly appointed chief executive, but called them off to turn his attention to reorganising EA into four new divisions or “labels”.He completed the company restructuring in November and reopened discussions with Take-Two’s management in December.Mr Riccitiello expressed surprise at a much-improved compensation package Take-Two’s board awarded to the management team this month after rejecting EA’s initial $25 a share offer.Analysts also voiced concern on Monday at how the lucrative employment terms for the heads of Rockstar Games, the developer of Grand Theft Auto, would fit in with EA’s compensation schemes and whether the group could retain such talent.“It’s not going to get cheaper to work with these guys,” said Mr Riccitiello, who noted that the developer had survived six CEO transitions in five years. “We see them as the asset, the key part of the deal within RockStar, we have great respect for them and expect them to stick around,” he added."

Shares in the bond insurer soared 19.7 per cent to close at $14.58.But S&P said Ambac‘s triple-A rating was still at risk because of the uncertainty surrounding its plans to raise fresh capital. Ambac’s shares closed 15.9 per cent higher at $12.41.Strong performances from energy, industrial and pharmaceutical stocks supported the broad-based rally.Alcoa enjoyed the biggest gain among components of the Dow industrial average. Shares in the aluminium company closed up 6.3 per cent at $38.85 after the European Commission cleared the proposal by New Zealand’s Rank Group to buy Alcoa’s packaging and consumer business for $2.7bn.Other aluminium makers also rallied.

34;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
35;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2008-02-25T19:45:48Z;Video games M&A;;Has John Riccitiello, chief executive of Electronic Arts, been taking lessons from Steve Ballmer?The Microsoft chief’s bear hug on Yahoo bucked the tech sector’s tradition of friendly mergers. Now EA is taking a similar approach with games publisher Take Two Interactive Software. First came the private exchange of letters. Having been rejected, EA has gone public. Its latest missive even echoes Microsoft’s passive aggressive style, thanking Take Two for its “courteous tone” before putting the screws on the management to agree a deal.Like Microsoft in software, EA is used to being top dog in the video games world. Having long relied on a stable of big sports and movie tie-ins, however, it has to expand its offering, particularly in action and role-playing games. Meanwhile, competitors are bulking up. Activision recently agreed a merger with Vivendi’s games business.Buying Take Two at $26 a share would be a quick way for EA to acquire, rather than develop, an established games brand – in this case, the Grand Theft Auto series. EA’s argument that scale counts is strong. Its direct distribution network is powerful, particularly outside the US. Extra resources should help increase the frequency with which Take Two’s best titles are updated.The big risk EA faces, as does Microsoft, is a culture clash. Rockstar Games, Take Two’s big in-house development studio, is the brains behind GTA. Keeping its programmers happy is crucial to the success of any deal. In this, EA’s task looks easier than Microsoft’s. Incorporating another studio into the existing stable should not involve too much upheaval.But EA may have a fight on its hands. A 50 per cent premium is attractive but, at 18 times forward earnings, it is no home run. Unlike Yahoo, which still trades below Microsoft’s offer, Take Two has already leapt ahead of EA’s bid.Post and read comments on this Lex
36;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2008-01-11T23:22:53Z;SCi in talks to raise capital as shares plummet;;SCi Entertainment, the UK’s largest computer games publisher, was yesterday understood to be in talks with a strategic industry partner to raise new working capital, as its shares fell to a five-year low.The deal could be similar to SCi’s sale of a 10 per cent equity stake to Time Warner in December 2006, which raised around £45m for the group.The deal also gave SCi access to Time Warner’s distribution network and rights to some high-profile intellectual property.SCi said that, while takeover talks had ended, it was exploring “certain commercial and strategic opportunities” that had come up as a result of the discussions. The company is believed to have been talking to CDC, the Chinese games company, as well as NBC Universal, the US film studio. It also had talks with Ubisoft of France last year until Ubisoft ruled itself out in October.The plans emerged as SCi shares halved in value, following a profits warning and an announcement that the company had ended talks for a potential takeover.Delays to the launch of four games, including the next Lara Croft title, Tombraider: Underworld, mean the company could need additional funding of around £30m, said Robert Brent, analyst at SCi’s house broker, KBC Peel Hunt.Mr Brent expects the company to make a loss of around £19m for 2008 due to the delays, although it should recoup this with profits of at least £20m next year.Nevertheless, the warning has raised questions about SCi’s viability as an independent company, and the shares fell to 62p, their lowest level since 2003. More than 17m shares changed hands, compared with average daily volumes of 1.1m.SCi is not the first games publisher to delay the launch of titles as the sector struggles to make the transition to the next generation of games consoles. Sales of Sony’s new PlayStation3 have been slower than expected, and games developers have had difficulties in getting games to work smoothly on the new consoles. Electronic Arts and Take Two in the US have already had to put back some launches, including the next version of Take Two’s popular Grand Theft Auto series.However, SCi is also struggling to make the transition from a niche games company to a publisher with global reach. It became the UK’s largest games publisher in 2005 after buying larger rival Eidos, but still lacks scale in the US, for example.“This transition is a challenging period for all, but for smaller companies it is greater because they don’t have the resources to change their release schedules without repercussions,” Mr Brent said.Some investors believe SCi should drop its publishing activities to focus just on developing its well-known games franchises, including Tombraider, Hitman, and their new best-selling game Kane & Lynch. Publishing can offer higher margins and more control over games, but without sufficient global scale it can be difficult to realise these benefits.Citigroup is acting as adviser to SCi in the fund-raising talks.
37;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2007-12-03T21:52:11Z;Activision-Vivendi games deal boosts rivals;;Shares in video game publishers rose on Monday amid speculation that the merger of Activision and Vivendi’s games division to create the largest publisher would trigger an industry shake-up.Analysts welcomed the deal as “game-changing”, but warned that Vivendi’s World of Warcraft game it hinged on had an unpredictable future. Activision shares rose 13 per cent to $25.03 in morning trading. Vivendi shares rose 1 per cent to €31.71 on Monday. In a complicated deal, Vivendi is injecting its games business into Activision to create a new company valued at an estimated $18.9bn, Activision Blizzard. Vivendi is also buying $1.7bn worth of shares to generate cash for a subsequent tender offer.Activision shareholders will be offered $27.50 a share in a buyback that could lift Vivendi’s stake in the new company from 52 per cent to 68 per cent.Take Two Interactive, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto game and the subject of frequent takeover speculation, rose 6 per cent, while Ubisoft shares rose nearly 10 per cent at one point in Paris on speculation that Electronic Arts would increase its 15 per cent stake in the French publisher.Shares in EA, the world’s biggest video game publisher, fell 1.5 per cent to $55.30 as investors digested the prospect of the emergence of a larger rival.Brent Thill, Citigroup analyst, said in a note: “Smaller publishers like THQ and Take-Two could benefit as global media companies are likely to kickstart their video game acquisition strategies post Vivendi’s move”.Jonathan Weitz of media consultants IBB said: “The environment has been right for the last year or two for media companies to take greater stakes in video game publishers.”Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision, who will head the enlarged entity, said Activision would have had to risk hundreds of millions of dollars to try to duplicate the success of Blizzard Entertainment’s online fantasy hit, World of Warcraft. The game has 9.3m subscribers and has made Vivendi the only western publisher to show a significant profit in Asia.Michael Savner of Bank of America Securities said the deal was a game-changer but Vivendi’s own endgame was unclear and World of Warcraft could fall out of favour with players. Brent Thill said it generated about 75 per cent of Vivendi Games’ revenues, but questioned how long the phenomenon could last.Additional reporting by Adam Jones in Paris
38;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2007-06-12T20:30:23Z;Record bond yields sink Wall Street;;"Wall Street slumped on Tuesday, as the 10-year bond yield reached its highest level in five years, and cast a bearish pall over equities.Rate-sensitive stocks, such as utilities, real estate investment trusts, home builders and some financials were on the defensive.Bearish sentiment was also reflected in lower transport stocks and a further pullback in the steel sector.Stocks largely tracked the change in bond yields on Tuesday. When yields showed signs of stabilising during the early afternoon, stocks turned higher. But, late on Tuesday, when yields rose to fresh highs, that ultimately sank stocks.The S&P 500 index closed 1.1 per cent lower at 1,492.99.Telecoms and utilities were the weakest main industry groups in the S&P.Concern has been growing among stock traders that higher yields would slow merger and acquisition activity as financing costs for deals increased. The past week has seen just $1.8bn in announced M&A deals, the lowest since November.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said: “Investors relying on mergers and acquisitions to boost prices are likely on edge wondering whether the decline is a result of rising interest rates or summer
doldrums.”Stephen Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investment Group, said: “Private equity could become more selective about new deals.”The rise in rates has also prompted investors to calculate whether equities still look attractive compared with fixed-income securities that now offer higher yields.Mr Wood said: “Fixed income has become more attractive, but stocks still look better. The prospect of stronger growth in the US has been behind the rise in yields.”David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: “The stock/bond decision has become more finely balanced after the bond market shake-out.“Relative to bonds, equities offer reasonable but not compelling value.”Bond traders said the May retail sales report, due on Wednesday, and consumer prices data, released on Friday, would provide the market with some fundamental news to place the recent rise in yields in context.Mr Shairp said: “The equity pullback may have further to go, as markets come to terms with the carnage in the fixed-income markets and they have a chance to digest their gains since March.”On Tuesday, equity volatility rose. The Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Vix index of S&P volatility gained 12.2 per cent to 16.50, but closed below last week’s peak of 17.09.Quarterly option contracts expire this week, and that could also spark sharp moves in the S&P index said analysts. Technology and blue chips both closed lower.A narrowing in second-quarter guidance from Texas Instruments, down 2.1 per cent at $35.04, hurt chip makers.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.9 per cent lower at 2,549.77.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1 per cent at 13,295.01. Of the Dow’s 30 stocks, 27 closed lower on Tuesday, led by a 2.6 per cent fall in AT&T to $39.08. The Dow Transportation Average lost 1.9 per cent, and closed at its lowest level since mid April.A bright spot among blue chips was a 1.2 per cent rise to $22.20 in Intel as it bucked the sell-off in other chip-makers. McDonald’s up 0.45 per cent at $51.48, and Alcoa, up 0.1 per cent at $39.34 were the other Dow stocks to close higher.In earnings news, Lehman Brothers reported net income rose 27 per cent over the past year to a record $1.3bn. The stock rose 0.5 per cent to $76,06, and pared an earlier rise to $78.19. The stock remains 2.6 per cent lower for the year and set a high for the year of $85.80 in early February.The bank said its diversified operations helped offset a 14 per cent fall in its fixed income revenues, from bonds, derivatives and credit products, due to ”continued weakness in the US residential mortgage business.”Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, said that while it boosted home loans by 15 per cent in May compared with a year earlier, its foreclosure rate had doubled. Shares rose 0.7 per cent to $38.10.Yahoo fell 1.1 per cent to $27.05 as its annual shareholder meeting was held.Starbucks rose 0.7 per cent to $27.74, rebounding from an earlier decline when Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its “conviction buy” list.Uniphase rose 3.5 per cent to $13.47 after a brokerage upgrade.Shares in Take-Two Interactive gained 2.1 per cent to $19.33 after JPMorgan upgraded the video game publisher to “outperform”.Dean Foods fell 4.3 per cent to $31.07 after it cut earnings estimates for the second quarter and the year because of higher milk prices.Shares in American Commercial Lines fell 9.1 per cent to $26.27 after the transportation company also cut its earnings outlook."

The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to close at 1,514.14 and edged closer to its record level of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Georges Yared, chief investment officer at Yared Investment Research said good earnings and guidance for the coming quarter should support stocks and that the S&P was building up to moving higher towards its 2000 record peak.Within the S&P, telecom, and financial stocks led the major sectors higher, while materials lagged.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that while all 10 major S&P sectors were still trading near their recent highs, “many seem to be rolling over a bit.”They said: “Financials, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and health care have all had slight declines after hitting overbought levels, and it will be key to see how they react to resistance levels.”The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 2,547.42, and shrugged off weakness among semiconductors stocks. Earnings and lower guidance from Applied Materials did weigh upon technology for much of on Wednesday and the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 0.2 per cent, following a slide of 1.1 per cent on Tuesday.Applied Materials, a chipmaker, reported better-than-expected earnings, but its guidance for sales disappointed investors. Its shares were down 3.1 per cent at $19.17.Meanwhile the Russell 2000 index of small companies rose 0.7 per cent at 820.29 and rebounded from its lowest closing level in more than a month on Tuesday.A number of stocks were in the spotlight on Wednesday when Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment company, said it had invested in Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific, two railroads, and also bought stock in Wellpoint and raised its holding in Johnson & Johnson, two healthcare companies.Norfolk Southern rose 1.65 per cent to $56.79, Union Pacific gained 0.9 per cent to $119.39 and the S&P railroad index rallied 1.3 per cent, taking its gain for the year to 25.1 per cent.Wellpoint gained 1.6 per cent at $84.86, while Johnson & Johnson rallied 2 per cent to $63.05.Edward Lampert, the hedge fund manager, said late on Tuesday that he had purchased 15m shares of Citigroup. This prompted the shares to jump 4 per cent to $54.91. Analysts believe that the banking conglomerate could now become the next high-profile target for activist investors, given its underperforming share price in recent years. Such a move would show that even the biggest companies were not immune to activist pressure.Meanwhile, George Soros, another of the most famous hedge fund managers, said his stake in Microsoft had doubled, and the stock rose 0.55 per cent to $31.07. Mr Soros had lowered his holdings in Oracle, and shares were up 0.8 per cent at $18.99, while he had sold shares in Ebay, down 0.75 per cent at $33.25, and Take-Two Interactive, and shares in the video game maker slid 0.2 per cent at $19.08.Another big investor, Carl Icahn, a well-known activist, said he had purchased a large slice of Anadarko Petroleum, boosting its shares by 1.6 per cent to $47.20, and also bought shares in CSX, the railroad finished up 1.4 per cent at $46.40. Mr Icahn also disclosed that his stake in Time Warner, had been cut by nearly half. Its shares in the media group rallied 1.55 per cent to $21.60.In takeover news, Bausch & Lomb agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus for about $3.7bn in cash. Shares in the the maker of eye-care products jumped 9.8 per cent to $67.50.“We believe pressure on operating cash flow, as the company struggles to recapture lost market share, creates significant risks in terms of return on capital for an acquiring firm and we do not expect any higher offers,” said Robert Gold, medical devices analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.After the closing bell, Hewlett-Packard said second-quarter profit fell 6.5 per cent after a tax gain in the year- earlier period. In after-hours trade, shares in the computer maker were 0.7 per cent lower at $44.86, after a rise of 1 per cent in regular trade.Shares in Amazon closed 4.4 per cent higher at $63.22, after the online retailer said it plans to launch a digital music store later this year and sell songs without copy protection restrictions.In earnings news, Compuware reported a 20 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings and its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $10.67.Shares in Federated Department stores rose 1.2 per cent to $62.69 after its first-quarter profit rose more than 5 per cent, but missed analysts’ estimates.
40;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2007-04-13T19:43:29Z;Fallout from console wars;;War, what is it good for? The cynical answer is suppliers’ profits, particularly if they are backing the winner. That certainly holds true in the never-ending battle for the hearts, thumbs and wallets of video gamers. Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo have a lot riding on the success of the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii consoles, respectively. But so do the game developers behind them.The big four US game developers – Electronic Arts, Activision, THQ and Take-Two Interactive Software – have a combined market capitalisation of $26bn. Unlike the last phase of the console wars, in which Sony’s PlayStation 2 took an early lead that it never lost, the outcome this time is uncertain. What is clear is that the PS3, which is both late to the market and relatively expensive, looks unlikely to take the 69 per cent market share enjoyed by its predecessor. As of December, its share was an estimated 10 per cent.The issue for games developers is whether the Xbox 360 or the Wii will be the main beneficiary. The Wii’s success to date has some negative implications for them. Nintendo develops a larger proportion of its games in-house and independent developers tend to make less money in terms of sales per console. Research house 2K Advisors calculates that, for example, Electronic Arts made about $39 in sales per Nintendo console between 2000 and 2006. The corresponding figures for Sony’s and Microsoft’s hardware were $60 and $73, respectively.Electronic Arts and Take-Two must hope the Xbox 360 benefits most from the PS3’s apparently weak start. Activision is more balanced but would still benefit more from the Xbox 360 doing well. On 2K’s calculations, only THQ appears agnostic to the outcome, with similar sales per console across all platforms. That would make it the natural choice for investors who do not feel confident enough to second-guess the geeks.

Ryan Brant, its former chairman and chief executive, in February became the first former CEO to be convicted on options-backdating charges.The company has also underperformed compared with its industry peers, despite the success of Grand Theft Auto, whose latest instalment will be released in October.Paul Eibeler, Take-Two’s chief executive, was ousted Friday by Mr Zelnick, as promised by the group of institutional investors that led the boardroom takeover.
42;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2007-03-11T20:21:15Z;SAC Capital;;Take-Two Interactive Software is most well known for a video game series called Grand Theft Auto, in which players get to fire big guns and drive fast cars. These days, with the company’s founder convicted of falsifying business records and losses piling up, Take-Two’s thrills and spills are a little closer to home. Little wonder that shareholders are kicking up a fuss.What is unusual is the make-up of the coalition planning to overthrow the current board. Standing alongside fund manager OppenheimerFunds – which owns almost a quarter of Take-Two’s stock – are decidedly un-mainstream hedge funds such as Steve Cohen’s SAC Capital.Mr Cohen is famous for often generating thumping returns with an investment horizon measured in hours. The move into activism is in keeping with a broader trend of hedge funds and private equity houses spreading into each other’s territory. Private equity dabbles in minority equity stakes and credit funds these days. Meanwhile, SAC has hired a team from Ripplewood Holdings to build its private equity capabilities. In an interview given last year, Mr Cohen said that returns from rapid fire trading are not what they used to be – mainly because so many others are at it.In branching out, SAC at least benefits from a strong brand. Many others in the growing ranks of the hedge fund industry are less well established. Generating “alpha” – individual outperformance as opposed to market tracking – is harder as competition intensifies. Even mainstream asset managers are launching cheaper funds that make use of shorting stocks these days. Achieving alpha in this more competitive environment encourages, for example, investing in less liquid assets. As long as clients are agreeing to longer lock-ups, hedge funds can do this. But that creates dangers of its own, particularly when the appetite for risk abates. Passengers who feel the need for speed should pick their driver carefully.

Shares in Chevron rose 1 per cent to $68.33 and ConocoPhillips closed 2 per cent stronger at $68.30.The mood was somewhat subdued by a smaller-than-expected reading of last month’s private sector jobs growth from ADP.“It is a consolidation day with no real news after a big run [on Tuesday],” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The payroll numbers were a little disappointing but the market is waiting for the more important jobs data released on Friday.”The S&P 500 Index closed 0.3 per cent down at 1,391.97.Deere & Co advanced after Lehman Brothers raised its rating on the farming equipment maker from “equal weight” to “overweight” because of rising corn prices.

But the vast majority of the mispricing occurred before mid-2002, when the Securities and Exchange Commission tightened the rules for reporting such grants.Government attorneys profess not to be concerned, saying they can argue that there was a conspiracy to hide the backdating that continued well beyond the 2002 cut-off, but some defence attorneys say they hope to argue that some prosecutions are barred by the statute of limitations.“Time is becoming a precious resource,” says Henry Hu, a securities law expert at the University of Texas law school. “The statute of limitations is not something a judge will just extend.”The time limit issue is gaining greater currency as more cases move from the investigative to the prosecution phase.Since mid-February, the former general counsels of Monster Worldwide, parent of the online job group, and McAfee, the antivirus software group, and the former chief executive of games developer Take Two have all faced criminal charges, and more cases against individuals are expected shortly.Criminal charges against companies are rare, and the SEC has not brought any civil corporate cases either. The five commissioners are said to be having difficulty reaching a consensus on the size of the fines that should be imposed.Meanwhile, the SEC has largely been content to let companies hire outside lawyers to do independent investigations and wait for the results. Walter Ricciardi, the SEC’s deputy enforcement director, says enforcement staff have been focusing more resources on those companies where the backdating seems particularly egregious or widespread and on those firms where the staff are not satisfied by the progress or independence of the company’s own investigation.One key issue that has not yet been resolved is how the SEC and prosecutors will handle company executives who engaged in backdating but did not profit personally.So far the only case of this kind was the first investigation into widespread backdating at Brocade, the world’s largest maker of data storage switches. A recent appeals court decision in an Enron-related case has raised questions about whether employees can be charged with fraud if they did what their client or company bosses wanted and did not profit personally.“The question that still remains is, are we going to start seeing more cases like Brocade, where there is significant backdating but it doesn’t benefit the backdaters as we have seen in Apple Computers?” says John Coffee, Columbia University law professor. “The cases we’ve seen so far all involve self-dealing. [The appeals court decision] is an obstacle for cases that don’t.”So far the criminal options cases have focused on executives who personally benefited from the options backdating and were personally involved in the process. Several have either admitted or been accused of falsifying documents, a key detail that makes it easier for the government to win cases.In that sense, the stock options cases reflect a marked shift from the accounting scandals this decade when few lawyers faced criminal charges. By contrast, general counsels have so far been a prosecutor’s most common target.“General counsels have replaced accountants as the safeguards that failed,” says Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC enforcement attorney with law firm Shulman Rogers.“The real question is whether we will see anyone other than the general counsel charged …These cases are not about the underlying integrity of the business.”Several of the former general counsels – most recently Myron Olesnyckyj of Monster – have pleaded guilty and co-operated with the government, raising the possibility that prosecutors may be seeking evidence that will allow them to move up the corporate chain of command.

It was pulled from retailers’ shelves last year after a hidden sex scene was discovered.Sales of Bully elsewhere in the US may benefit from the publicity and Take-Two shares were 1.75 per cent higher in midday trading in New York.Shares of Electronic Arts, Activision and THQ were also higher on the back of strong September sales of video games in the US, according to the NPD research company.Software and hardware sales were up 29 per cent and 70 per cent respectively on a year earlier.Electronic Arts, the world’s largest video game publisher, saw a 16 per cent year-on-year increase in sales in September helped by a 16 per cent rise in sales over the previous month of its latest Madden NFL football game.Elizabeth Osur, video games analyst at Citigroup, attributed the rise to a weak September 2005 and strong demand for games for the Nintendo DS handheld console, the PlayStation2 and Xbox 360.Nintendo’s DS sold 403,000 units, well ahead of the Sony PSP handheld console at 153,000 units.More than 250,000 units of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 were sold for total sales of 2.7m in the US since its launch in November 2005, giving it a substantial installed base ahead of the release of Sony and Nintendo’s next-generation consoles in November.

However, people familiar with his group’s plans said he and other hedge funds invested in Time Warner hope shares will rise by the end of this year on the back of improvements at AOL and the planned listing of a stake in Time Warner Cable.Comcast, the largest US cable group, has seen its shares soar this year, yet market confidence in the cable sector has not fed through to Time Warner, and a partial listing might change that.Jana Partners, one of the three hedge funds that teamed up with Mr Icahn in an audacious attempt to seize control of Time Warner’s board in spite of a joint stake of less than 2.5 per cent in the group, sold about $90m worth of shares, reducing its stake to 0.6 per cent.Of the other two hedge funds, Franklin Mutual slightly added to its stake. SAC has not reported its latest holdings yet, but is believed to have held on to its position.Although Mr Icahn agreed to end his proxy fight in February, he left open the possibility of renewing it in the future.Mr Icahn also reported that his funds had increased their stakes in Cendant, and took new stakes in Take-Two Interactive Software and Symantec.

48;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Two more IT groups in stock-option probe;;An online technology news network and a leading video games publisher have been sucked further into the gathering storm over stock-option grants.San Francisco-based CNET Networks said it expected to restate financial statements to correct errors related to accounting for stock-based compensation.Take-Two Interactive Software, based in New York, announced it had received notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission of an informal investigation into certain share options granted by the company from January 1997 to the present.More than 60 companies have disclosed investigations into their share-option policies.Many of them are in the technology sector and around half are based in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley.The inquiries are centred on the timing of awards, in particular the possible backdating of grants to a low point in the company’s share price to improve the chances of recipients profiting from the options.Improper accounting of this could lead companies to overstate their profits.CNET had earlier established a special committee of independent directors to review its stock-option practices and related accounting.It said on Monday the committee had reached the preliminary conclusion that actual measurement dates for certain stock options granted between 1998 and 2001 differed from the recorded measurement dates.The effect is that CNET expects to record non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expenses in reporting periods from 1998 onwards, taking into account the vesting of the options in subsequent years.The company said it believed the charges were material and it expected to restate results for 2003, 2004 and 2005 and possibly earlier years, as well as the first quarter of 2006.It said it would not be able to file its quarterly report – Form 10-Q – for its second quarter “on a timely basis”.Take-Two, best known for its Grand Theft Auto series of video games, said it had already set up an internal review, with independent directors, to look into its stock-option grants.The company said it would co-operate fully with the SEC investigation.While CNET shares dropped initially, they recovered to be 4.6 per cent higher at $7.94 in midday trading in New York. Take-Two shares were down nearly 4 per cent at $9.71.
49;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Take-Two settles over Grand Theft sex scenes;;Take-Two Interactive, the creator of the Grand Theft Auto video game franchise, will not suffer financial penalties for including hidden sex scenes in one of its most popular titles following a settlement announced yesterday with US regulators.Shares in the company plunged more than 14 per cent in after-hours trading, however, after it reported a widened quarterly loss.The hidden scenes in Take-Two’s Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, which featured the game’s main character engaging in sex with in-game girlfriends, sparked outrage among parents’ groups when they were discovered last year.They prompted an investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission, which alleged that the company had inappropriately marketed the game as suitable for minors.Under the settlement announced yesterday, Take-Two said it had agreed not to misrepresent a video game’s age rating or content in the future. It agreed to submit future games to review by rating authorities but said it would not pay any fine.Paul Eibeler, chief executive, said Take-Two was pleased the matter had been resolved. “We look forward to putting this behind us and concentrating on what we do best, creating interactive entertainment,” he said.The settlement came as Take-Two reported a net loss of $50.4m for the second quarter compared with a loss of $8.2m a year ago. The company said weak sales and low retail prices ahead of the release of a new generation of gaming consoles had contributed to a “difficult business environment”.
50;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2005-09-07T22:25:18Z;Take-Two Q3 losses double;;Take-Two, the video games publisher, saw its losses double in a third quarter marred by the controversy over its biggest franchise: Grand Theft Auto.The best-selling Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was taken off the shelves by retailers including Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Gamestop, in July, when hidden sex scenes in the game were revealed by hackers.The discovery led to its rating being changed to “adults only”.Paul Eibeler, chief executive, told a conference call with analysts on Wednesday that the re-rating had been challenging for the company but it had taken immediate action to comply a modified version of the game is due out next week.Take-Two's third-quarter net loss to July 31 doubled to $28.8m from $14.4m a year earlier. Net sales increased 6 per cent from $160.9m to $169.9m.The loss of 41 cents a share was worse than analysts' expectations of 38 cents, as polled by Thomson Financial. Sales also fell short of forecasts of $175.6m.Grand Theft Auto's release on the Xbox console and PC platform helped sales during the quarter, as did the release of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on multiple platforms and Sid Meier's Pirates for the Xbox.Take-Two was also forced to revise down its guidance for the full year due to delays to key titles.It said Bully for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox needed additional development time, while the Japanese launch of GTA:San Andreas had been pushed back into the next fiscal year.The company now expected net sales of $1.22bn to $1.27bn for the year to October 31 and 85 to 90 cents in earnings. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.13 on sales of $1.31bn.Following the announcement, Take-Two shares were down nearly 7 per cent in after-hours trading in New York at $22.50.
51;TTWO;Take-Two Interacti;2005-07-20T22:37:04Z;Take-Two lowers forecast;;"Take-Two Interactive Software lowered its fiscal third-quarter guidance on Wednesday after a key software ratings board slapped an adults only rating on the company's controversial Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas video game, which contains sexually graphic content hidden within the game.The US video game maker said subsidiary Rockstar Games would stop making the current version of the game and offer a patch to prevent players from using unauthorised third-party software available on the internet to access the sexually explicit material.Take-Two said a new version of the game with enhanced security features to prevent unauthorised modifications was expected to be ready in the company's fiscal fourth quarter. The Grand Theft Auto franchise accounted for about 30 per cent of Take-Two's sales in 2004, according to regulatory filings.The video game maker said it expected to post a loss of 40-45 cents per share on sales of $160m-$170m for the quarter ending July 31. Analysts had been expecting Take-Two to report a quarterly loss of 6 cents per share on sales of $213m.Shares in the company were down about 6 per cent at $25.40 in after hours trading.Hard-hitting Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – one of the most popular video games ever - already had a ""mature 17+"" rating because of its gratuitous violence, strong language, strong sexual content and drug use.Controversy over the game reached new heights over the past few weeks after it emerged that a software modification available over the internet - dubbed ""hot coffee"" - allowed players to have their characters engage in sex acts with a ""girlfriend.""Hillary Rodham Clinton, the US senator, last week stepped into the controversy and pledged to introduce legislation to control the sale of violent video games to underage players. The Parents Television Council, a media watchdog group, had demanded that Take-Two recall the title.Other critics had called on the Entertainment Software Rating Board, which is responsible for video games ratings, to change Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas from mature 17+ to a adult only 18+ rating. Take Two said it cooperated fully with the ESRB investigation, which prompted Wednesday's ratings change.A Take-Two spokesman on Wednesday acknowledged the company created the sexually explicit content and that it remained on discs sold to the public. But he said the graphic material was supposed to be edited out of the final version and was not intended for public use."
