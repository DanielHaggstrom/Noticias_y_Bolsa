0;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Anthem boosted by move away from Obamacare exchanges;;Health insurer Anthem lifted its full-year profit guidance on Wednesday after delivering upbeat earnings on the back of lower medical costs and a move away from Obamacare exchanges.The Indianapolis-based company said net income climbed 30 per cent from a year ago to $1.3bn in the three months ended in March. That translated to earnings of $4.99 a share, up from $3.73 a share in the year ago period.Adjusted for one-time items the company posted earnings of $5.41 a share, handily topping analysts’ estimates of $4.88 a share, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.Revenues were little changed at $22.5bn and broadly in line with estimates.The company, which began to exit Obamacare markets last year, said that membership in its individual health plans fell by more than half to 755,000. However, the move helped boost the company’s profit as costs declined. Anthem said its benefit expense ratio — a measure of the company’s cost on claims against the premium it earns — decreased by 220 basis points to 81.5 per cent.“We are pleased with our first quarter 2018 financial performance, which reflects our commitment to strong medical cost performance by effectively leveraging community based innovative and integrated clinical and value based care models across our markets,” said chief executive Gail K. Boudreaux, who took over in November.For the full year the company now expects adjusted earnings of $15.30 a share, up from its previous estimate of $15 a share.The results come at a time of flux in the industry after CVS Health agreed last year to buy Aetna in a deal that is expected to shake-up the US prescription drugs business.The industry is also looking to lower costs and now faces stiff competition as e-commerce juggernaut Amazon, JPMorgan and Warren Buffett’s investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway said in January that they would team up to form a not-for-profit healthcare group with the aim of lowering bills for their almost 1m employees and “potentially all Americans”.Anthem shares, which are little changed year-to-date were up 0.8 per cent in pre-market trade.
1;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2017-10-18T19:06:40Z;Anthem to launch own pharmacy benefits manager, shares hit new high;;Anthem shares hit a fresh all-time high before trimming their gains on Wednesday after the health insurer said it would launch its own pharmacy benefits management company that would result in annual savings of $4bn.Shares in the Indianapolis-based company jumped as much as 6.4 per cent to $199.23 before trimming back those gains to trade abut 3 per cent higher at pixel time.Anthem said it will begin offering a “full suite” of pharmacy benefits manager solutions from 2020 when its current contract with Express Scripts expires. PBMs act as middlemen between insurers and large employers. The company had previously indicated that it might not renew its contract with Express Scripts.“Through the process of evaluating many PBM options in preparation for the expiration of our current contract, we determined that our scale and experience best position us to deliver an innovative solution, and the launch of IngenioRx will allow us to break through what is now a complex and fragmented landscape,” said chief executive Joseph Swedish.Anthem also announced a five-year agreement with CVS Health, which rivals Express Scripts, that would work in collaboration with IngenioRX.“It appears as though the two companies will team up to leverage their combined scale to receive favorable drug pricing from manufacturers,” Michael Baker, analyst at RaymondJames said of the news.The new contract is expected to result in savings of more than $4bn a year once Anthem has fully migrated to the new platform, said Brian Griffin, executive vice president on a call with analysts. That is up from previous forecasts for savings of $3bn. The company expects that 20 per cent of the savings will accrue to shareholders and the rest will “work its way to help with the affordability of healthcare of our customer base”.Policymakers in the US have rebuked pharmacy benefit managers for a lack of transparency on drug prices and questioned whether the savings are passed on to customers. Pharmaceuticals and PMB’s have pointed fingers at each other for driving up healthcare costs.The move comes after Anthem — which has previously considered whether to extend its deal with Expess Scripts and that is set to expire at the end of 2019 — filed a suit against Express Scripts last year to recover damages alleging that it had been overcharged.CVS Health shares rose 2 per cent to $74.13, while Express Scripts shares rose 1 per cent to $57.85.Read more: Pricing row shines spotlight on US pharmacy benefit managers
2;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2017-07-23T11:37:31Z;US health insurers shrug off chaos over Obamacare;Share prices outpace the market as groups focus on other areas of their businesses;"Shares in US health insurers have outpaced the broader stock market rally, shrugging off the chaotic debate over the future of Obama’s signature healthcare law.The sector’s big five companies, including Aetna and Humana, have enjoyed share price rises of more than 30 per cent since the election, having stepped away from participation in unprofitable parts of the Obamacare system and thanks to improvements in other areas of their business.While the long-term fate of Obamacare’s individual insurance markets and expanded government-backed Medicaid programme hang in the balance on Capitol Hill, the insurers are being rewarded by investors for having stabilised their profit margins.“The hit from regulatory changes is behind them,” said Ana Gupte, a healthcare analyst at Leerink Partners. The decline in margins, which resulted from the Obamacare rules and regulations on coverage has “levelled off”, she said.Investors have focused, in part, on growth from a different government-backed programme, Medicare, which is largely unaffected by Republican lawmakers’ back-and-forth over whether and how to “repeal and replace” Obamacare. Insurers have been adding customers to their Medicare Advantage plans for senior citizens.Medicaid programmes that provide health insurance to low-income Americans have also proved lucrative, as insurers add members to the managed care programmes they operate under state contracts — although the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare would be thrown into reverse under the Republican reform plans floated so far.But the companies still face profound uncertainty over the way US healthcare will change under Donald Trump. The administration could take steps to further affect regulations on health coverage in the near term.Yet even as the latest Republican reform bill collapsed in the Senate last week, UnitedHealth Group, considered an industry bellwether, exceeded Wall Street’s expectations in its second-quarter earnings report. The company, which also operates a medical services arm known as Optum, recorded net income of $2.28bn, or $2.32 per share, up 30 per cent from the same three months in 2016. UnitedHealth Group revenues were up nearly 8 per cent at $50.1bn, even after it forewent business by withdrawing from several Obamacare insurance marketplaces.Since inception, the Obamacare insurance exchanges, which enabled some 20m Americans to purchase cover, often with government subsidies, have proved to be more of a headache than a boon for business. More sick people than expected and too few young, healthy individuals signed up for plans, skewing the balance of risk in insurance pools.However, an analysis of insurers’ first-quarter earnings by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests these marketplaces are becoming more profitable, as higher premiums and slower growth in the rate of patients’ medical claims lift pressure on the margins.As signs of near-term reform grew less likely this year, Aetna and Humana, whose proposed tie-up was blocked by a federal judge in January, opted out of the exchanges for 2018. Mark Bertolini, Aetna’s chief executive, told Yahoo Finance last week that there would need to be a “stable and predictable market” for the insurer to return in future years.The essential briefing for decision makers on global healthUnitedHealth filed 2018 plan rates in just two states after abandoning most of the exchanges in 2017. Connecticut-based Cigna filed to participate in six.Of the big five, Anthem is most exposed to the Obamacare exchanges; the insurer holds licences for the popular Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in several states. However, Joseph Swedish, Anthem chief executive, told analysts in April that the company might be forced to reduce its service area or exit some markets if subsidies are cut by the Trump administration. Insurers have until the end of September to commit to state exchanges for 2018.Those who filed to remain were projected to ask state regulators to approve premium increases of between 28 and 40 per cent, in part to account for uncertainty in Washington as well as rising healthcare costs, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman.Stephen Hemsley, UnitedHealth chief executive, told analysts last week that policy changes in Washington, including healthcare and tax reform, could have an effect on 2018 earnings. “Certainly at this stage in the national conversation, speculation about any outcome here would just be that,” he said."
3;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2017-05-07T04:03:12Z;Pricing row shines spotlight on US pharmacy benefit managers;Anthem dispute with Express Scripts shifts focus in battle over high drug prices;They are the self-styled scourge of high drug prices, but US pharmacy benefit managers are coming under attack from both sides of the negotiating table. Tensions between the pharmaceuticals industry and PBMs have been rising steadily in recent years, as each group blames the other for fuelling the rapid inflation in healthcare costs. But two weeks ago, the largest PBM, Express Scripts, found itself subject to a different line of attack, this time from its biggest client.Anthem, the second-largest US health insurer by market value, said it would not renew its contract with Express Scripts when it ends in 2019, which will slash the number of patients the PBM represents from 85m to 65m.The decision was the culmination of a drawn-out dispute between the two companies, which had seen Anthem sue Express Scripts for charging “massively excessive prices” and generating “an obscene profit”. Shares in Express Scripts, which has a market value of $36bn, lost roughly 10 per cent of their value following the announcement. The stock has since recovered a portion of its losses after Anthem held out the possibility of re-entering talks, but it is still down 17 per cent over the past 12 months. Ask most Americans to name their pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM, and they will struggle, yet companies like Express Scripts, CVSHealth’s Caremark and UnitedHealth’s Optum play a major role in setting the ultimate price of drugs in the US. PBMs work as middlemen on behalf of health insurers like Anthem, and for the large employers that foot most of the bill for medicines in the US. They operate by amassing large groups of patients from multiple clients and turning them into a single negotiating bloc, which they use as a powerful bargaining chip to wring large rebates from pharmaceutical companies. If drugmakers want their medicines to be included on the lists or “formularies” controlled by PBMs, then they often have to return large sums.Drugmakers that refuse to cough up can find themselves frozen out of the formularies and prevented from accessing tens of millions of patients at one stroke, so they tend to pay out, albeit reluctantly. By the end of the negotiations, the net amount paid for many drugs can be significantly lower than the list price.The model is a quirk of the all-private US health system, with many other developed countries relying on quasi-governmental organisations to negotiate the price of drugs, such as the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. But every drugmaker in the world has to enter price negotiations with American PBMs if they want to sell their products in the largest and most profitable healthcare market. The Anthem dispute centres on whether the insurer is being overcharged. According to figures released by Express Scripts last week, the PBM earns about $10 for every Anthem prescription compared to roughly $4 for its other clients. Express Scripts argues that it was simply abiding by the terms of the 10-year contract. When the deal was signed in 2009, Anthem agreed to forgo future savings in exchange for a $4.7bn upfront fee, the PBM says. The essential guide for decision makers in health — straight to your inbox every Friday“Anthem was taking a gamble that drug inflation would stay low,” says Steve Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts. “They would have had a lot of upfront money and good rates if they’d been right, but they gambled incorrectly.” Some analysts believe the loss of Anthem portends trouble for Express Scripts, and not only because the insurer last year accounted for $2.2bn of its earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation — almost a third of the total. Express Scripts will go from number one to two in the PBM league table, and the shedding of 20m patients threatens to significantly reduce its bargaining power. “We believe the loss of Anthem could have negative implications for Express Scripts’ ability to retain customers given the uncertainty on its ability to continue to deliver the economics it currently does at a much smaller size,” says Rob Stuyck of Cleveland Research. Dr Miller says the Anthem account is negotiated separately from its other groups of patients, so there will be no knock-on effect. Other clients are happy, he says, as evidenced by last year’s 98 per cent retention rate. However, critics of the industry argue that billions of dollars of savings could be found if middlemen like Express Scripts were forced to take a smaller cut, or removed from the equation altogether.Andrew Left, the prominent short seller from Citron Research, had until recently bet against Express Scripts’s shares and believes the stock price has further to fall. Mr Left says Express Scripts is playing “both sides of the same coin” because it generates revenues through fees from its insurer and employer clients, and from rebates via drugmakers. “PBMs are the John Gotti of the pharmaceuticals industry, because they don’t create anything and they’re skimming money off from both sides,” he says, referencing the infamous Italian-American gangster. Dr Miller replies that Express Scripts returns the vast majority of rebates to its clients. The latest battle comes amid an increasingly rancorous relationship between PBMs and the pharmaceuticals industry. Drugmakers are being asked to pay more in rebates each year, and so they raise their list prices to protect their profits. That in turn leads to higher costs for patients, who must personally contribute “out of pocket” payments for medicines, which are linked to the drug’s list price, not the one negotiated by the PBM after rebates. Such payments can run into tens of thousands of dollars a year for patients with illnesses such as cancer. Drugmakers say it is unfair for them to be the sole target of patient anger when PBMs are increasing their profits while providing no contribution to the discovery of new medicines. The industry trade body, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), is running an advertising campaign with the slogan, “Share the savings — your insurer doesn’t pay full price for medicines, so why do you?” Robert Zirkelbach, head of public affairs at PhRMA, says the rebate system needs to change. At the moment, the drugmakers who pay the most end up with coveted “preferred” slots on lists of medicines controlled by PBMs, making them more likely to be dispensed by pharmacies. “We think we need to move to a value based system where companies are paid on how well the drug works,” says Mr Zirkelbach.There are two types of drug price that matter in the US healthcare system — the list price, and the net price. Drugmakers argue that few customers actually pay list prices that have been rising so dramatically in recent years. The system is analogous to the new car market, they say, where no one pays the “sticker price” on the windscreen.The pharmaceuticals industry says people should instead look at the net amount paid after accounting for rebates, discounts and other price concessions. Last year, total spending on medicines in the US hit $450bn, an increase of almost 6 per cent compared with 2015 according to a report published on Thursday by QuintilesIMS, the healthcare data group. However, roughly $127bn of that was handed back by drugmakers via rebates and other discounts, according to the report, meaning the net amount spent was some 28 per cent lower at $323bn. The average increase in the list price of a drug was 9.2 per cent last year, whereas the typical increase in the net price was much lower at 3.5 per cent, the report said. However, drugmakers tended to offer much smaller rebates and discounts for newer “specialty” drugs for diseases such as hepatitis-C, cancer and HIV, the report found. 
4;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;Express Scripts rallies after Anthem holds out hope for reconciliation;;Express Scripts investors breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday after the pharmacy benefit manager’s biggest client said it was hoping for an amicable solution to their ongoing legal dispute.Shares in Express Scripts tumbled nearly 11 per cent earlier this week after the company said US health insurer Anthem plans to move its business when their current contract expires at the end of 2019.However, the stock bounced back 2.5 per cent on Wednesday after Anthem signalled during its earnings call this morning that there is still a possibility it could stick with Express Scripts.“We’ve not made a final decision with respect to any vendor,” said chief executive Joe Swedish. “We’ve not ruled anyone in or out. I think that covers the entire spectrum of vendor possibilities and I’ll leave it at that.”Express Scripts has been in a legal dispute over its contract with Anthem, one of the five large US health insurers, which claimed that the PBM had been overcharging it by billions of dollars. PBMs work as a middleman and negotiates on behalf of health insurers and employers to secure deals on drug prices from pharmaceuticals companies, but the industry has been criticised recently amid claims it keeps too great a share of the savings for itself.Mr Swedish said on Wednesday that Anthem is hoping for “an amicable resolution” to the legal dispute.“We did issue the RFP [Request for Proposal for a new PBM service provider] during the first quarter and we expect to receive all responses during the first half of the year,” said Mr Swedish. “It is important to note that we have not ruled anyone in or out as the best strategic option for the company going forward. After we received the responses to the RFP, our pharmacy team will thoroughly and thoughtfully analyze what has been proposed in order to decide how to construct the best pharmacy solution for our members.”
5;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T06:59:50+0000;Cigna ends Anthem merger, sues for more than $14bn;;The fight will apparently go on. Health insurer Cigna said it will pull the plug on its planned merger with rival Anthem, following a judge’s decision that blocked the merger on antitrust grounds. At the same time, it launched a lawsuit against Anthem to seek a reverse $1.85bn termination fee and additional damages “in an amount exceeding $13bn.”To which Anthem has responded – not so fast.Cigna said in a statement that the damages it is seeking includes lost value to its shareholders as a result of Anthem’s alleged breach of their merger agreement – including lost deal premium, the missed upside opportunity from the hoped-for combined company and information about Cigna’s inner workings that Anthem gleaned through the deal process.Cigna further elaborated in a statement that Anthem was obligated under the terms of the merger agreement to “use its reasonable best efforts to secure regulatory approval for the transaction and its obligation to refrain from misappropriating Cigna’s confidential information”.It also accused Anthem of abandoning what it described as their an agreed-upon strategy to focus on the benefits that a combined company would bring to the health insurance marketplace – a strategy it hoped would win regulators’ blessing and assuage antitrust concerns. Instead, Cigna blamed Anthem for pursuing a “unilateral strategy” to bolster its Blue Cross Blue Shield network, which it said ultimately persuaded the judge that the deal would limit competition.“As a result, the path for regulatory approval of the transaction was fatally compromised and Cigna and its shareholders were harmed,” Cigna said in a regulatory filing.Anthem maintains that Cigna has no right to unilaterally pull the plug:“Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cigna does not have a right to terminate the agreement. Therefore, Cigna’s purported termination of the merger agreement is invalid. Anthem will continue to enforce its rights under the merger agreement and remains committed to closing the transaction.”Cigna said in a regulatory filing that it had reached out to Anthem in an attempt to resolve their differences over the merger agreement, but that they were unsuccessful in their efforts to reach a solution without litigation.Last week, a federal judge ruled in favour of the US Justice Department’s lawsuit to block Cigna’s $48bn acquisition of its rival insurer, which followed close on the heels of another judge’s determination that another proposed health insurer mega-merger between Aetna and Humana was also anti-competitive.Aetna said earlier on Tuesday that it would pay Humana a $1bn breakup fee after their proposed merger foundered in the wake of the court’s ruling.
6;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2017-02-09T04:28:12Z;US federal court blocks $48bn Anthem-Cigna merger;Judge says deal might substantially reduce competition in concentrated market ;Cigna’s $48bn acquisition of rival US health insurer Anthem has been blocked by a federal judge, marking the second time in as many weeks that US courts have knocked down a takeover in the industry on competition grounds.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington ruled late on Wednesday that the effect of the tie-up between Anthem and Cigna “may be substantially to lessen competition” in “what is already a highly concentrated market”, particularly in the sale of commercial health insurance to “national accounts” — customers with more than 5,000 employees, typically spread over two or more states.The decision, which will result in Anthem paying a $1.85bn break fee to Cigna, is set to further unravel the wave of consolidation that swept the health insurance sector in 2015 in the aftermath of then-President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare policy.Several large insurers believed there was a tacit agreement with the Obama administration that if they agreed to participate in the former government’s plan, which included providing health insurance to 20m people who had no coverage, they would have been allowed to merge with rivals to face higher costs.However, the Department of Justice filed two lawsuits last summer to block the Cigna-Anthem deal as well as Aetna’s $37bn takeover of Humana as it warned that both transactions would harm consumers’ interests by reducing competition.Aetna’s tie-up with Humana was also blocked last month by US District Judge John Bates, who ruled that the deal was anti-competitive.On Wednesday, Judge Jackson noted that the claimed medical cost savings, championed in particular by Anthem, were not “merger-specific, they are not verifiable, and it is questionable whether they are ‘efficiencies’ at all”.The merger first announced in 2015 between Anthem and Cigna — the second and third-largest medical insurers in the US — has been on shaky ground for months. A filing from the DoJ in September revealed the two companies had been trading accusations of breaching deal terms.All large insurers involved in the wave of dealmaking have since complained that due to so-called Obamacare they were incurring losses. They said this was because a large number of people who signed up to the new public marketplaces providing insurance were either much sicker or older than expected.Many insurers threatened to pull out completely from the Obamacare exchanges unless their deals were approved by the court.However, since Donald Trump was elected US president in November, the future of America’s healthcare has been in a state of uncertainty. The former New York property tycoon and reality TV showman signed an executive order within hours of becoming president that significantly reduced the enforcement of the Obama administration’s health act. It called on government agencies to waive or delay parts of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a “cost, penalty or burden” on individuals or insurers, as well as other businesses and states.Mr Trump said he plans to withdraw completely Obamacare but has not clarified what would replace it, leaving about 20m Americans in a state of limbo. The controversial decision, however, has raised the hopes of the health insurers who have seen their deals challenged, as some analysts expect that the new administration will be more open to consolidation.
7;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2017-02-09T01:46:15Z;US federal court blocks Anthem-Cigna merger on competition grounds;;The planned $48.4bn acquisition of Cigna by rival US health insurer Anthem has been blocked by a federal judge, marking the second time in as many weeks US courts have knocked back a takeover in the industry on competition grounds.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington ruled late on Wednesday that the effect of the tie-up between Anthem and Cigna “may be ‘substantially to lessen competition’” in “what is already a highly concentrated market”, particularly in the market for the sale of commercial health insurance to “national accounts” – customers with more than 5,000 employees, typically spread over two or more states.The ruling follows US District Judge John Bates’ decision in Washington DC late last month to block Aetna’s $37bn takeover of rival Humana, also on the grounds that deal would reduce competition.Judge Jackson noted that the claimed medical cost savings, championed in particular by Anthem, were not “merger-specific, they are not verifiable, and it is questionable whether they are ‘efficiencies’ at all.”The merger, first announced in 2015, between Anthem and Cigna – the second- and third-largest medical insurers in the US – has been on shaky ground for months. A filing from the Department of Justice in September revealing the two companies had been trading accusations of breaching deal terms.The knock-back now sets up Anthem to pay a $1.85bn break fee to Cigna.
8;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2017-02-05T13:37:24Z;US health insurers give notice on Obamacare marketplace;With lawmakers set to repeal healthcare reform, Aetna, Anthem and Cigna reassess role;Three of the biggest US health insurers have warned they could withdraw from the marketplace that enabled 20m Americans to purchase their own cover, as lawmakers in Washington scramble to repeal and replace Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform law.Such a move could leave many Americans without access to any health insurance options in 2018, if lawmakers are unable to implement a short term Obamacare improvement or a replacement law. Joseph Swedish, Anthem’s chief executive, told investors last week that the company “needs certainty about short-term fixes” in order to determine the extent of its participation in the market next year. “If we can’t see stability going into 2018 with respect to either pricing, product, or the overall rules of engagement, then we will begin making some very conscious decisions with respect to extracting ourselves.”Aetna chief Mark Bertolini took a stronger stance, saying the insurer had “no intention” of being in the market in 2018. He added that the company would participate “where we think it is appropriate” next year. David Cordani, chief executive of Cigna, said they would assess whether to participate and to what extent by the spring.“If the marketplace is really unstable and a lot of insurers drop out, it means that a lot of people who depend on getting coverage through the marketplace are going to be left out in the cold,” said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national healthcare consumer advocacy organisation.Insurers must submit their 2018 rates for the exchanges by the spring, but many fear lawmakers in Washington will not move in time to reform, even temporarily, key aspects of the law. “If nothing is in place, then all chaos will ensue,” said Sherry Glied, an economist and dean of New York University’s Robert F. Wagner graduate school of public service. “Some certainty, at least for one year, has to be injected into the system.”Health insurers have struggled to make a profit on the Obamacare exchanges since they opened in 2013. Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealth Group abandoned some exchanges altogether in 2016, claiming they contained too many sick members and not enough young and healthy ones to be profitable.The ability for insurers to manage risk in each of the exchanges could deteriorate further, if Congress removes the individual mandate that requires every American to buy insurance. Mr Bertolini told CNBC that the earliest he expected a new health insurance programme would be January 2019. House and Senate committees convened for hearings late last week to discuss steps to reform Obamacare.But the individual market is only one piece of the broader US health insurance business. Analysts point to healthy growth in the government services segment, especially Medicare and Medicare Advantage, as the elderly population increases.“Medicare is in a good place,” said Ana Gupte, a managed care analyst at Leerink Partners. “It’s clear Republicans are in favour of private coverage.”Aetna expanded its Medicare Advantage programme, the alternative to government-sponsored health insurance for senior citizens, by 111,000 members in 2016, and its Medicare supplement business by 119,000 members. Anthem expects to grow Medicare by 75,000 members in the coming year, primarily in the Medicare Advantage segment. Anthem and Cigna shares have largely outperformed the S&P 500 index since Donald Trump’s election. Aetna stock dipped below the broader market in January, when a US court ruled against the company’s proposed $37bn takeover of Humana, calling it anti-competitive. The company is considering an appeal. Anthem awaits a federal-court decision on its $48bn acquisition of Cigna.
9;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2016-11-30T20:33:02Z;Fitch predicts headwinds for major US health insurers in 2017;;"Prognosis: not so good.Concerns about a wave of mega-mergers and the profitability of plans sold on Obamacare exchanges could make the coming year a challenging one for major US health insurers, Fitch analysts said in a note on Wednesday.The ratings agency said that it had negative rating and sector outlooks for US health insurers, and that it expects “more health insurer rating downgrades than upgrades” over the next 12-24 months.“Leverage concerns tied to large mergers and concerns about the profitability of business sourced from health insurance exchanges are the key factors underlying Fitch’s negative outlooks,” said Fitch Ratings senior director Mark Rouck.It’s been a shaky year for many of the largest US health insurers, which have grappled with the implementation of President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform legislation, the Affordable Care Act – also known as Obamacare – and are now scrambling to figure out what will come next if Republicans follow through on their promises to repeal and replace portions of the law.While the law has expanded the number of Americans with health insurance, several of the largest insurers have already reported heavy losses as a result of plans sold on the exchanges set up under Obamacare, and had previously announced plans to pull back Obamacare offerings in all but a few markets.While a Republican repeal-and-replace could be a longer-term credit positive for the sector, Fitch said that “significant near-term uncertainty” exists about what shape those efforts could take.Another question mark that will linger over four of the five largest US health insurers until early next year are US antitrust officials’ lawsuits seeking to block to two mega-mergers. The first, Anthem’s $48bn bid for Cigna, is already on trial. The other, a proposed $37bn tie-up between Aetna and Humana, will go to trial later this month.But far from being a must-win for insurers, Fitch said that if the government wins and the deals are blocked, the resulting effect of acquirers “foregoing acquisition financing” would likely result in its removal of negatives watches on those companies’ ratings. “Given the size and significance of the companies involved this may be sufficient to contribute to a change in the sector’s rating outlook to stable,” Fitch said in the note.Compared to a year ago, Anthem’s shares are up 9 per cent; Aetna has risen 27 per cent, Humana has increased 25.1 per cent and UnitedHealth is up 40.5 per cent. Cigna is the only one of the big five insurers to be down, decreasing a modest 0.2 per cent from this time last year."
10;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2016-11-21T18:27:22Z;US health insurance mega-mergers on trial – key dates to watch;;"Four of the five largest US health insurers are headed to court to try to salvage two mega-mergers from being blocked by federal and state competition authorities, who claim that the deals will stifle innovation and consumer choice.Opening arguments kicked off in federal court on Monday in a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice and several states’ attorneys generals seeking to stop Anthem from completing its $48bn purchase of rival Cigna.In just a few weeks, before a different judge in the same Washington, DC court, attorneys for Aetna and Humana will head to trial to try to save their proposed $37bn tie-up. The insurers say that their deals will help them innovate and reduce costs, while federal and state authorities say that the wave of consolidation will stifle competition to patients’ detriment.Antitrust officials sued to block the planned deals earlier this year. The closely watched trials come as the US health insurance industry attempts to realign itself after sustaining heavy losses on plans offered through the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health-insurance reform legislation whose fate now hangs in the balance as Republicans prepare to retake the White House.Here are some key dates to watch:November 21 – Opening arguments begin in the Anthem/Cigna trial before US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C. federal court. She will first hear evidence and testimony on how the proposed deal would affect the overall national health insurance market.December 2 – Both sides in Anthem/Cigna will submit their proposed findings – intended to underscore trial evidence and testimony they hope will guide the judge in drawing her conclusions – for the first phase of the trial.December 5 – Trial begins for the Aetna/Humana merger before US District Judge John Bates in Washington, DC. The Anthem/Cigna trial will take the week off.December 12 – Testimony resumes in Anthem/Cigna, in a second phase that is expected to focus on the deal’s implications for local commercial markets and healthcare rates.December 29 – Parties in the the Aetna/Humana case are scheduled to submit their proposed findings to the judge.December 30 – Closing arguments scheduled for the Aetna/Humana trial before Judge Bates. The Anthem/Cigna trial is also scheduled to end by this date.December 31 – Original closing date for the Aetna/Humana merger; Aetna’s executives said on a recent conference call that they now expect the deal to close sometime in 2017. The company will owe Humana a $1bn termination fee if it does not clear the final hurdles.January 4 – Parties in the Anthem/Cigna trial will file their proposed findings from the second phase of the trial to Judge Jackson.January 31 – Original closing deadline for Anthem/Cigna merger. However, the parties have the option to extend that to April 30, 2017. Anthem is on the hook for a $1.85bn termination fee if the deal fails to close.End of January 2017 – Judge Jackson is expected to issue her ruling on Anthem/Cigna by the end of January, Anthem’s chief executive said on a recent conference call with investors. There is no indication about when Judge Bates will rule on Aetna/Humana, although all of the insurers have argued for a speedy resolution to help part the clouds of uncertainty that the litigation has created."
11;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;Health insurance stocks rally with Obamacare’s future in doubt;;Shares of a number of large US health insurers rose on Wednesday, in the wake of the election of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has pledged to repeal his predecessor Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act legislation.By mid afternoon, shares of four of the five largest US health insurers were in positive territory. Humana and Aetna’s stocks each rose more than 4.5 per cent, and Cigna gained 4.8 per cent. Anthem was up 2.1 per cent, while the largest of the five, UnitedHealth Group had pared some of its earlier losses to trade down 0.4 per cent.Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act has been dubbed, has been a mixed bag for these insurers. Since the law was enacted in 2010, 20m Americans have gained healthcare coverage, according to government estimates. But the influx of more people into the coverage pool has squeezed insurers, with several of them posting substantial losses as a result of plans offered on the Obamacare exchanges and eyeing an exit from some states’ markets. Recently, the US government said it expected insurance costs under Obamacare to jump by an average of 25 per cent next year.Republicans in Congress have attempted to repeal Obamacare numerous times, railing against its mandate that people buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty. But with Mr Trump in the White House, and Republicans winning majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives on Tuesday night, the odds of a rollback could be improving. This was underscored by comments from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who told Politico on Wednesday that repealing Obamacare is “pretty high on our agenda”.The “extent to which the president-elect’s policies will coincide with traditional Republican policies, given the limited number of his detailed and articulated positions at this time, remains to be seen,” wrote Fitch analyst Megan Neuburger in a note. “Successful efforts to repeal or materially replace the ACA would be a credit negative for healthcare providers as it is contributing to higher volumes of insurance patients.”But, she added:“Over the longer-term, healthcare companies will continue to invest in growth opportunities, as the fundamental outlook for the US corporate healthcare industry remains positive despite the election outcome…A repeal of the ACA may slow the nascent evolution toward value-based reimbursement schemes, but Fitch believes the shift toward linking pricing to patient outcomes will continue as patients and health insurers grapple with the growing burden of healthcare costs over the longer term.”

Such efficiencies don’t happen overnight; they require co-operation over months (if not years) to integrate the operations of these multibillion-dollar firms,” the DoJ said.“Because the breach letters reveal the current state of hostility between defendants, the letters evince barriers to integrating these firms and are relevant” to the defence’s case, said the DoJ.Anthem and Cigna declined to comment on the DoJ’s filing. Publicly the two companies have said they would fight the DoJ and continue to try to complete the deal.Anthem will be forced to pay $1.85bn if the deal falls apart. Anthem said in a separate filing earlier this year that Cigna would walk away if it cannot close the deal by April 30, when the transaction terms expire."
13;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2016-08-05T16:32:56Z;US health insurers: knock on wood;There is nothing to fear but mean reversion;A casual reader of headlines might conclude that the US health insurance industry was in a nasty fight with a government determined to foil it. The feds are suing to stop mergers that would join four of the five largest players (the Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana deals). And UnitedHealth, biggest of all, has all but walked out on the individual insurance exchange business, a cornerstone of Obamacare.Any such impression would be wrong. The industry is on a multiyear run of rising profits and share prices. Government-sponsored programmes have been the main source of growth.Since Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, shares of the five biggest insurers have all outperformed the S&P 500. The two largest by market cap, UnitedHealth and Cigna, increased revenues and free cash flow at double-digit compound rates over the period.The key in this bonanza has been sedate US medical cost inflation, which protects underwriting returns. This trend has traditionally corresponded with economic growth, but the link seems to have weakened in the latest recovery. The market apparently expects this forgiving trend to continue. Aetna’s price/earnings ratio, for example, has risen from nine to 15.Another helpful trend was the surge in managed plan enrolment by beneficiaries of Medicare (the programme for the old) and Medicaid (for the poor). At UnitedHealth and Aetna, member growth has compounded at double digits in both plans. Obamacare significantly expanded Medicaid membership. Compared with these programmes, the healthcare exchange business is a footnote.Can the prosperity continue? Put aside the merger issue. Medicaid won’t expand again, but the growth in managed care by government plans seems set to continue. The cost trend is trickier. It did tick up a bit in 2014, the most recent year for which data are available. And when a trend break is hard to understand, the conservative approach is to bet on mean reversion.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Ten state attorneys-general also joined the DoJ’s efforts to block the mergers.“Competitive insurance markets are essential to providing Americans the affordable and high-quality healthcare they deserve,” said Loretta Lynch, the US attorney-general.She added: “These mergers would restrict competition for health insurance products sold in markets across the country and would give tremendous power over the nation’s health insurance industry to just three large companies.”The planned tie-ups are the latest in a string of big-ticket takeovers that have been thwarted by antitrust officials in the Obama administration, which has taken a much more active role in blocking large mergers and acquisitions than previous governments.Anthem accused the DoJ of basing its decision on “flawed analysis” and said it was “fully committed to challenging the DoJ’s decision in court”. The health insurer is required to pay Cigna a break fee of $1.85bn if the deal falls apart, even at the behest of regulators.Aetna also said it would “vigorously defend” its planned deal and that it was looking forward to making its case in court, “where a judge will review the transaction based on its merits”. The company would owe Humana $1bn if the tie-up were thwarted by antitrust officials.The DoJ said it was particularly concerned that Cigna and Humana, the smallest of the big five insurers, would disappear from the market, describing them as “two innovative competitors” and warning that their takeover would hinder efforts to reform the bloated US healthcare system.When the deals were hatched a year ago, many in Washington predicted the DoJ would eventually wave them through despite competition concerns, in an effort to support the 2010 Affordable Care Act.Health insurers have argued the law, commonly known as Obamacare, has made it harder for them to make a profit and said they need to consolidate in order to drive down costs and secure better terms from hospitals, doctors and drugmakers.But the DoJ said the mergers would reduce competition on the new public health insurance exchanges, which have provided coverage to more than 16m Americans who were previously uninsured, while also limiting choice for large employers that offer employee healthcare plans.So far under the Obama administration, the total value of large US deals abandoned following government intervention to either protect competition or block a company from moving its tax base abroad has risen to about $500bn, according to a Financial Times analysis.This year alone, the DoJ has torpedoed a $38bn merger between oilfield services companies Halliburton and Baker Hughes, while new tax rules introduced in 2016 by the government forced Pfizer to jettison its planned $160bn acquisition of Allergan.Several bankers and lawyers have criticised the administration for being anti-business, after a big increase in enforcement of antitrust rules amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions over the past two years.But others argue that the recent spike in blocked deals has more to do with the M&A cycle hitting a peak, as companies attempt to pursue larger deals that are riskier from an antitrust perspective.“The Obama administration is no more confrontational than previous Democratic administrations,” one lawyer told the FT ahead of the DoJ’s ruling on Cigna-Anthem.In the first six years of the administration, the DoJ, which together with the Federal Trade Commission is one of the main competition watchdogs, publicly challenged on average 17 deals a year from 2009 to 2014, the last year for which data are available.
15;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2016-07-19T20:55:04Z;US justice department plans to block two health insurance deals;Anthem’s $48bn Cigna purchase and Aetna’s $37bn bid for Humana under a cloud;The US Department of Justice in planning to block two health insurance megamergers worth a combined $85bn amid fears that the deals would push up premiums for patients and reduce competition.Federal antitrust officials will file lawsuits as soon as this week to thwart Anthem’s proposed $48.4bn takeover of Cigna and Aetna’s planned $37bn purchase of Humana, according to a person familiar with the matter.The merger of four of the largest players in health insurance would have turned the market from a “big five” to a “big three”, in a move that many had argued would have a chilling effect on choice while pushing up costs for consumers.“That’s not a lot of competition,” said Diana Moss, president of the non-partisan American Antitrust Institute, who said that both patients with private health insurance as well as those on government-funded schemes would have suffered if the deals had gone through.A DoJ spokesman declined to comment.An Aetna spokesman said: “We don’t comment on rumours or speculation but we are steadfast in our belief that this deal is good for consumers and the healthcare system as a whole.” When the deals were conceived about a year ago, many analysts predicted the Obama administration would wave them through to support the president’s far-reaching Affordable Healthcare Act, which was passed in 2009.Under the healthcare law, known as Obamacare, many insurers were subject to limits on the amount of profit they could make from patients on government-funded schemes, prompting them to argue they needed to bulk up to survive.At the time, an adviser to Cigna said: “There is a tacit understanding in Washington that consolidation is not something they care about, as long as cost and quality can be preserved.”However, the Obama administration has warned in recent months that it would act to block deals that seemed likely to reduce competition. In May, Halliburton abandoned hopes of acquiring Baker Hughes amid DoJ opposition.There is a tacit understanding in Washington that [sector] consolidation is not something they care about, as long as cost and quality can be preservedWord of the pending government action sent shares in Anthem and Cigna down by 2.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively. Humana fell 3.9 per cent while Aetna retreated 2.7 per cent. Merger partners that anticipate regulatory hurdles often try to mollify regulators with plans to spin off parts of the combined entity. But such solutions aren’t easily found in the case of big national deals, Ms Moss said.The proposed Anthem-Cigna marriage would have created the nation’s largest health insurer, measured by number of members, leapfrogging the current leader, UnitedHealth.“Negotiating a divestiture package with a firm with a national footprint is very, very difficult,” she said. “You’re basically trying to craft a remedy that would create a new national competitor.”Similar difficulties ultimately scuttled last year’s proposed Sysco-US Foods deal as well as the recent Staples-Office Depot hookup.The affected health insurers would likely sue to block the DoJ action, Leerink Research told clients. Anthem and Cigna’s chances of prevailing in court were “slim”, the company said.“It’s a tough case to litigate,” said one antitrust attorney. “I don’t love the odds.”On Wednesday, the market falls extended beyond the four health insurers in the DoJ’s crosshairs. Small health insurer shares also fell. WellCare Health dropped 0.4 per cent while Centene and Molina Healthcare were off by 0.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively.In Mr Obama’s first two years in office, proposed mergers already were eight times more likely to face a DoJ challenge than in 2005, according to a Financial Times analysis of government statistics.In 2015, the DoJ acted to block 20 deals — four times the figure from a decade ago. US companies have scrapped $370bn worth of large deals since 2009, including those abandoned in the face of a White House campaign to stem tax inversions. Justice department officials, such as Bill Baer who headed the antitrust division until April, have said publicly that Obamacare depends upon adequate competition among providers and insurers. The department’s antitrust experts also reject insurers’ arguments that they need to become larger to negotiate better with large hospital chains.Last month, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and six Democratic colleagues wrote to the DoJ opposing the two deals as bad for consumers. Dave Jones, California’s insurance commissioner, likewise urged the department to block the deal as anti-competitive.
16;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2015-12-21T19:00:48Z;Cyber security: Attack of the health hackers;Breach of Anthem database, probably from China, is part of a 2015 wave of 100m hacked medical records;Last January an administrator at health insurer Anthem noticed an unusually complex query running on the computer network. It looked like a colleague was responsible, but a quick check revealed that it was coming from somewhere else.Minutes later, Anthem was in crisis mode. Investigators believe the hackers were from China and had been operating undetected inside the company’s network for months. They gained access by tricking the employee to click on a phishing email that was disguised to look like an internal message.Using the administrator’s credentials, hackers combed through Anthem’s database containing names, social security numbers and birth dates of over 78m people who have been enrolled in its insurance plans since 2004.Anthem’s breach sent a wave of panic through the healthcare industry. It exposed clients’ most sensitive and valuable personal information, and revealed just how unprepared the health industry was to threats from increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals — and from nation states.Hackers accessed over 100m health records — 100 times more than ever before — last year. Eight of the 10 largest hacks into any type of healthcare provider happened this year, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.Insurers scrambled to hire cyber security companies to scrub their systems. Premera Blue Cross, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, and Excellus Health Plan announced breaches affecting at least 22m individuals in total since March, including hacks that stretched back more than a year. Investigators told the FT that they believe some of the hacks are related and trace back to China.The insurers face multiple investigations from state insurance regulators and attorneys-general and some could face fines for failing to comply with state data privacy laws, while federal law enforcement agencies are investigating who is behind the hacks.“For a lot of them it is often less of a priority than it should be. Because their focus is often on many other things it creates a vulnerability that I think a lot of hackers have figured out,” said Deven McGraw, deputy director for health information privacy at the HHS’s Office of Civil Rights. “We’re seeing some pretty consistent areas of non-compliance across the board.”The HHS is investigating the breaches and declined to comment on them specifically. Healthcare companies are required by privacy laws in numerous countries, including the US and UK, to protect personal data. Yet they have been inconsistent in maintaining basic security, say regulators.In the UK, there have been no reported hacks at the National Health Service, but it has been fined £1.3m by the Information Commissioner’s Office, which conducts audits on behalf of the government over data privacy. The fines are mostly for sloppiness: lost laptops, files left at a grocery shop and records abandoned at a bus stop.“The Health Service holds some of the most sensitive personal information available, but instead of leading the way in how it looks after that information, the NHS is one of the worst performers. This is a major cause for concern,” Christopher Graham, the Information Commissioner, said this year. ICO was granted new authority this year to conduct compulsory audits of NHS systems. “Protecting the security of data across government and especially within the health system is a top priority,” an NHS spokesman said.As in the UK, US healthcare providers see a majority of its data breaches falling into the categories of lost laptops or improper access to systems by insiders. Yet as more information is maintained in electronic form — an idea pushed heavily by the US government to make health records more portable — cyber intrusions have grown.At some hospitals, the doctors who are often part of management have long resisted electronic measures that they thought could slow down or interfere with patient care. HHS’s Ms McGrath said this is a common excuse, but she said it is far more troubling that many companies don’t encrypt their data.The problem has been exacerbated by the hundreds of hospital mergers that have occurred over the past few years, often resulting in multiple IT systems in one hospital group. Cyber security is often overlooked as a priority.“It’s a very fragmented industry so there aren’t as many major players who drive the entire sector the way you’ve seen when it comes to financial services and cyber security,” said Bryan Palma, senior vice-president of Cisco’s Advanced Services in cyber security. “That is not happening in healthcare.”With healthcare profit margins under pressure, only about 3 per cent of the IT budget is earmarked for cyber security, according to experts. Too many aspects of patient care are shared on a single hospital network. That means hackers in search of patient data could also disrupt life-saving equipment such as respirators running on the same network.A new threat emergesThe threat changed this year with the emergence of hacks that investigators say are connected to China.“We know of multiple threat groups operating out of China that have engaged in attacks in the healthcare industry,” said Charles Carmakal, an investigator with Mandiant, a cyber security company. Mandiant was hired by Anthem, Premera and others.“While we believe we know from an organisational perspective who they are, we can’t tell who tasked them to do it. The big question is: are they hackers for hire and were they asked by the Chinese government to do this?” said Mr Carmakal.The Chinese government has denied it was involved in the hacks. American investigators believe hackers in China targeted insurers in the US, including Anthem, to learn how medical coverage and insurer databases are set up, people familiar with the cases said. The records are also valuable for intelligence purposes. Addressing healthcare challenges has been a top priority of the Chinese government, which is facing an ageing and affluent population that is demanding better care.22mIndividuals hit in cyberbreaches at four US healthcare insurers“China is very interested in anything that will help them with the illnesses they are dealing with and changes in their population,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of CrowdStrike, who declined to talk specifically about the Anthem breach. “For example, diabetes is a big problem in China so they have targeted companies in that space.”78mNumber of people whose records are in the hacked Anthem databaseChina has promised to provide universal access to healthcare to all its citizens by 2020. Currently, China’s spending on healthcare per capita still lags far behind that of developed countries, and the healthcare system is riddled with corruption and kickbacks.The industry is also an attractive target for criminals who sell personal health data on the black market. Medical records are much more valuable than credit card numbers because it often takes longer to detect so the data have a longer shelf life. Data such as social security numbers can be used in a range of schemes from tax refund fraud, insurance fraud or Medicare fraud.A credit card record can be bought for about $1 on the black market, but “one person’s complete [medical] record I’ve seen anywhere between $200 and $2,000,” said Carl Leonard, an analyst for Raytheon Websense, a security company.The market is flooded with stolen credit card details, he said, so “healthcare records attract the premium now”.Technological advances, rising global tensions and human failings are making it ever more vital to improve cyber security.Continue readingInvestigators do not believe information from the Anthem breach has been sold on black markets. However, other hackers have targeted victims of the Anthem attack with fake emails that appear to be from Anthem or offer credit protection. Those emails aim to steal data that could be sold to criminals, people familiar with the case say.Anthem plans to spend $130m over two years to better protect its networks from breaches. The company has assured regulators that it has strengthened its system, taking steps such as changing administrator passwords every 10 hours and hiring 55 cyber security experts.Bad ‘cyber hygiene’The hackers’ tactics vary but in many of the health breaches they set up domain names that look similar to the websites operated by the insurance companies, which were set up before the hacks were detected.The fake sites often had one letter off from the authentic site or used the number “1” in place of where the letter “l” should be in site names, according to research done by cyber security companies ThreatConnect and Symantec.For Anthem, which was formerly known as WellPoint, the domain www.we11point.com was set up. There was also prennera.com for Premera, EmpireB1ue.com for Empire Blue and caref1rst.com for CareFirst. All of these domain names were traced to China.$1Cost of a person’s credit-card record on the blackmarketWhen the Anthem administrator discovered the hack on January 27 it was just as the hackers were extracting a large file of patient data. The hackers are believed to have been in the system for months, staying under the radar by running multiple queries against the database to understand it before they began removing files, a person familiar with the attack said.$2,000Potential value of a complete medical record on the blackmarketThe hackers used a repeating pattern of extracting data and slightly altering the query to avoid detection. They then removed the data and transferred it to an encrypted share site, similar to a drop box. The hackers chose a share site similar to one that Anthem already used, making detection tougher.Anthem has been faulted for not having the right “cyber hygiene” or protections in place to minimise the risk of a hack or limit what information was vulnerable if the network was infiltrated.Citing a report produced by Mandiant, a class-action lawsuit filed by dozens of Americans enrolled in its health insurance plans alleges Anthem did not implement a two-factor authentication, failed to require users to change their password and allowed employees to access personal information that went beyond the scope of their job.Anthem also allegedly ignored alerts — including one that lasted a month, according to the lawsuit — and failed to implement systems that would monitor data usage or extractions. The company now has two-factor authentication for its high-level system administrators.In a September 2013 audit of Anthem, the US Office of Personnel Management’s inspector general said the insurer had vulnerabilities that could provide a “gateway for malicious virus and hacking activity.”Anthem could face fines and be required to take corrective measures.Already, the hack has cost Anthem about $230m in legal and consultant fees. Most of the costs were covered by its cyber insurance policy. However, Thomas Zielinski, Anthem’s general counsel, told insurance regulators in August that its cyber insurance has become more expensive since the breach. Now Anthem is on the hook for the initial $25m cost of any breach, and has purchased a policy offering $100m in additional coverage.“The [Anthem] breach has raised awareness,” Mr Palma said. “The healthcare industry is saying, ‘This is real now. There is precedent in our industry.’ They are late to the party but at least they are there now.”The Anthem breach that affected almost 80m customers was a wake-up call to US regulators.Health insurers already had to meet cyber standards and are subject to federal health reporting rules when there is a breach. But the vulnerabilities exposed in the Anthem hack prompted regulators to question whether current cyber security standards are up to the job of protecting against today’s hackers.The National Association of Insurance Commissioners is updating the cyber standards insurers have to meet and also set up a consumer bill of rights for breach situations in October.“Do we need to increase what they [insurers] do no matter who is behind it?” said Connecticut state insurance commissioner Katharine Wade. “It’s constantly evolving and you could have the best systems in the world but still have a breach. So we have to take a balanced approach.”Just a few months before the Anthem breach was reported, the NAIC created a cyber security task force in November 2014. The NAIC has also been meeting with representatives from Anthem, Premera and CareFirst to get updates on their hacks and remediation efforts.Other states are also looking to step up their standards. In Indiana, where Anthem is based, attorney-general Greg Zoeller said he has advocated legislation that would require companies that collect data to meet safer storage standards, including deleting files that are no longer needed for business purposes.In New York, state attorney-general Eric Schneiderman plans to push a bill next year that would broaden the definition of “private information” that companies will be required to report in case of a breach. This would include medical and biometric information and health insurance details. Gina Chon

Smaller insurer Premera said in March it had also been hacked, exposing the information of about 11m people.The Chinese hackers had trained their sights on the US health sector to help the country understand how other nations deal with medical care, people familiar with the Anthem investigation said.As China’s huge population becomes more affluent and more demanding, medical care is emerging as one of the most politically sensitive topics facing the Chinese government.China has promised to provide universal access to quality healthcare to all citizens by 2020. But there is intense public dissatisfaction at the cost and quality of care, leading to widespread attacks on medical staff and a rapidly growing — and politically dangerous — gap between rich and poor in healthcare provision.“Knowledge is power,” said one US government official with an insight into the case. “How is it set up? What are they insuring? Why is this procedure covered but not that one? All of that is useful information.”Anthem, Premera and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China declined to comment.Cyber attacks believed to be emanating from China have been a thorny issue for US-China relations. During a September visit to Washington, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged China would not engage in state-sponsored economic cyber espionage.Devastating cyber attacks are on the rise, putting vast amounts of personal and business data at risk. FT examines how banks, companies and governments are trying to mount a concerted fightback against the hackersFederal law enforcement agencies, insurance regulators and state attorneys-general offices have been investigating the Anthem breach. Insurance regulators brought in cyber security firm CrowdStrike and consultant Alvarez & Marsal to examine Anthem, people familiar with the case said.The National Association of Insurance Commissioners and state insurance regulators are finalising a report detailing their investigation of the Anthem breach, they said. Anthem could face fines and be required to take corrective measures.But insurance regulators are also wrestling with what standards to apply to companies when the hackers are state sponsored like in the case of Anthem, people familiar with the case said.Healthcare data has become one of the most valuable pieces of information that can be sold in the online black market, making the sector a popular target for hackers. Eighty-one per cent of healthcare executives say their business experienced an attempted cyber attack in the last two years, according to an August report by KPMG.Fifteen-year-old boy had been arrested in Northern Ireland on MondayRead morePeople familiar with the Anthem investigation believe that gaining intellectual property and trade secrets were the rationale for the hack. The individual data held by Anthem, which insures many US government employees, could also be helpful to Chinese intelligence agencies.Expanding the coverage of public health insurance has been one of Beijing’s most striking healthcare achievements in the past decade or so, during which 95 per cent of the population has been given at least some basic level of public health insurance.But China’s spending on healthcare per capita still lags far behind that of developed countries, and the healthcare system is riddled with corruption and kickbacks.The rapid ageing of the population is also threatening the government’s goal of easing the burden on families by expanding public insurance coverage to the entire population, health industry experts said. Medical insurance coverage remains woefully inadequate for most Chinese citizens, who often have to pay large sums out of pocket.

If both deals are approved, the number of major US healthcare insurers would shrink from five to three.Steven Haas, partner at Hunton & Williams, the law firm, said Anthem and Cigna were under pressure to strike a deal. “In a rapidly consolidating industry, there is great risk that you end up being the last person standing and unable to compete. There was a chance of being left out in the cold.”Consolidation among health insurers has coincided with a deals boom among drugmakers and medical technology companies, with all the big groups in US healthcare facing pressure to become more efficient as Obamacare widens access to medical insurance.The Cigna-Anthem tie-up follows months of speculation and talks in which executives of the two groups had reportedly tussled over the management structure of the combined entity.The two companies said in a statement on Friday that Joseph Swedish, Anthem chief executive, would run the merged group, while David Cordani, Cigna chief, would be president and chief operating officer.Anthem said it was confident the deal would receive regulatory approval despite its size.But a person advising one of the groups had told the Financial Times that antitrust watchdogs could raise red flags given the two giant simultaneous deals. “The parties can expect a lengthy review process,” said Mr Haas.Under the terms of the agreement unveiled on Friday, Cigna shareholders will receive $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 of an Anthem share for each share they hold, which the companies say values Cigna’s stock at $188 per share.Cigna shares closed at $154.26 on Thursday.Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink, said the deal was “strategically and financially attractive”.Anthem was advised by UBS and Credit Suisse and those banks also provided financing for the deal, along with Bank of America. Cigna was advised by Morgan Stanley.News of the two companies nearing a deal was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Overall deal activity is up 43 per cent with $841bn worth of transactions announced in 2015, the highest activity since 2007, the data show.Senior bankers said that the stigma of carrying out an unsolicited takeover bid had diminished as some shareholders push cash-rich companies to create value via deals rather than doing more share buybacks.“Back in the day [pre-financial crisis] if a company went hostile it had to win or its stock would suffer. Now the stigma has gone,” said Gregg Lemkau, global co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs.“Now buyers are being pushed by their shareholders to make bold approaches that will help their company grow and if they fail because the seller requested an unreasonable premium it’s not a tragedy,” he said.Mr Lemkau added that shareholders of the acquiring companies are more tolerant of failed bids because they want boards to walk away from deals that become too expensive to be justified.At the same time as buyers are becoming more aggressive, boards of target companies are more willing to take the chance of holding out for better offers given the current strength of equity markets.Targets are holding out because they want to get a better deal and the strong equity market gives them the power to ask for more“Targets are holding out because they want to get a better deal and the strong equity market gives them the power to ask for more,” said Jim Head, co-head of M&A in the Americas at Morgan Stanley.Last weekend’s events follow a string of other large contentious takeover battles, including Monsanto’s $45bn bid to win control of Syngenta, the Swiss agricultural chemicals group, and Teva’s $40bn offer to secure rival generic drugmaker Mylan.“Battles are becoming more hostile because nobody wants to be left alone with nobody else to consolidate,” said Mr Head. “That’s why we are seeing a lot of unsolicited bids.”Cheap financing has been an enormous incentive to strike deals now, said Chris Ventresca, global co-head of M&A at JPMorgan.“A company won’t buy just because the rates are low, but if there is a target they are interested in, they would rather do a deal now than later,” he said. “The economics are currently very compelling.”

If Cigna had agreed to a deal it would be the biggest ever transaction in the managed healthcare industry, and beat CVS’s $26bn takeover of Caremark in 2006.A deal would also have seen a combined Anthem and Cigna become the top player in the sector, depending on whether UnitedHealth bought a rival.Investors and analysts say the industry is reacting to changes introduced by the Affordable Healthcare Act, which has provided health insurance plans to 16m previously uninsured Americans, prompting predictions that the current crop of five large groups will shrink to three.The decision by Anthem to make its offer public came amid wrangling over whether David Cordani, president and chief executive of Cigna, would become chief executive of a merged company.The Cigna board has unanimously determined the proposal is inadequate and not in the best interests of Cigna’s shareholdersBefore Cigna’s rejection of the offer, Joseph Swedish, president and chief executive of Anthem, said in a public letter to Cigna’s board: “We were stunned that the Cigna board continues to insist on a guaranteed CEO position for Mr Cordani over choosing to allow its stockholders to realise the significant premium being offered.”In a statement he added: “With the co-operation of Cigna management and board of directors, we expect that we could reach a mutually agreeable and negotiated transaction by the end of June 2015.”Cigna hit back at Anthem on Sunday, criticising Mr Swedish, who would have become chief executive, president and chairman of the board under Anthem’s most recent proposal, as well as leading the integration team.“Your insistence that one person (Joseph Swedish) assume four roles …is disconcerting and risky,” said Mr Cordani in a letter to Anthem’s board co-signed by Isaiah Harris Jr, Cigna chairman.However, Cigna remains open to the two companies joining.“A combination involving Anthem and Cigna under the right circumstances has the potential to bring together our complementary strengths in a manner that would provide substantial benefits to both consumers of healthcare services and healthcare professionals, while delivering immediate and sustainable economic returns to shareholders,” the letter said.UBS and White & Case are advising Anthem. Morgan Stanley and Cravath, Swaine & Moore are advising Cigna.Additional reporting by James Fontanella-Khan
21;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Anthem makes $45bn offer for rival Cigna;Health insurance industry consolidation spurred by Obama reforms;Anthem has started a complex takeover war in the US health insurance industry by making a $45bn approach for Cigna as the sector prepares for a wave of consolidation spurred by the introduction of “ Obamacare”.Anthem has tentatively offered $175 a share for Cigna, a premium of 27 per cent over the company’s closing price on Friday, valuing the fourth largest health insurer at almost $45bn excluding debt, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Cigna rebuffed the offer, one person said.A deal would torpedo a possible tie-up between Cigna and Humana, the smallest of the main insurers, which has put itself up for sale in an auction that could fetch roughly $30bn. Aetna, the industry’s number three player, is also said to be interested in Humana, while UnitedHealth, the market leader, is exploring its options.The flurry of takeover talks comes as analysts predict the US health insurance industry will shrink from five large groups to three, as companies try to position themselves for changes being ushered in by the Affordable Healthcare Act, the signature reforms of President Barack Obama.If consummated, a takeover of Cigna by Anthem would be the biggest ever transaction in the managed healthcare industry, trumping the $26bn that CVS paid for Caremark in 2006. Anthem’s offer was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Insurers have shied away from big-ticket mergers and acquisitions since Mr Obama outlined his healthcare reforms in 2009, preferring to wait and see how the new legislation would affect their prospects.Since then, investors and analysts have said the enrolment of more than 16m uninsured Americans into health insurance plans has created opportunities and challenges. Shares in Anthem have increased 55 per cent in the past twelve months, while Cigna’s stock was up about 51 per cent before news of the offer emerged.Investors have largely shrugged off the spectre of a Supreme Court decision that could invalidate government subsidies for Americans who signed up through a federal insurance exchange, prompting millions to lose their health cover.However, the second aim of Obamacare — to reduce inexorably rising healthcare costs — could prove trickier for insurers to navigate. Faced with the prospect of lower reimbursements, hospitals and other healthcare providers have been consolidating, prompting health insurers to explore bulking up too.Health insurers are also contending with a new class of customer: the 16m individuals who are insured through the exchanges are more price conscious than those who get cover via their employers, prompting them to look for better deals.The health insurance industry has not traditionally had to deal with a large number of individual shoppers looking for the best value, and some executives fear they will not be able to protect profits unless the industry shrinks from a “big five” to a “big three”.Rampant inflation in the cost of medicines is also spurring consolidation among pharmacists and the pharmacy benefit managers who negotiate prices with drug companies on behalf of health insurers and other “payers” such as employers and trade unions.On Monday, CVS Caremark said it would buy Target’s pharmacy business for $1.9bn, helping it extract a better deal from pharmaceuticals groups. In March, UnitedHealth said it would pay $13bn for Catamaran, a pharmacy benefits manager.
22;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2015-05-20T05:19:03Z;Fear of reputational damage after security leaks may be overhyped;It seems that customers have short memories when it comes to recalling online data breaches;"For the second time in just over a year, beauty products retailer Sally Beauty Holdings is investigating reports of fraud involving payment cards used by customers in its US stores.In a statement issued on May 4, the company said it was working with police and others to “gather facts, while working to ensure our customers are protected . . . Customer confidence and security remain our priority”.The company may find those customers are more forgiving than it expects. While reputational damage is often presented by technology suppliers as the consequence of security breaches, evidence suggests the public has a short memory, though senior executives will continue to pay the price for a bad leak.Last year’s hacking of Apple’s iCloud service, for example, in which intimate photos of celebrities were stolen and published online, has done little to dent its financial performance. However, while the Sony Pictures breach did not lead to a boycott by movie-goers, the company’s co-chair, Amy Pascal, stepped down after the scandal. Despite this, in its Q3 2014 financial statements, the company said it “doesn’t expect to suffer any long-term consequences” as a result of the attack.A survey of 4,235 US adults conducted by Software Advice, part of research company Gartner, found almost 80 per cent were not aware of the eBay breach, revealed in May 2014, which forced the online auction site to advise its 145m users to update their passwords.“Negative reputational impacts are totally exaggerated, in my opinion,” says Gartner analyst Avivah Litan. “I think customers forget about a breach very quickly and it doesn’t impact their interest in buying goods or services from the breached company.”She puts this down in part to “breach fatigue” caused by panicky headlines.Marc van Zadelhoff, vice-president of strategy in IBM’s security division, agrees: “The more frequently data breaches occur, the more desensitised people become, resulting in less of an impact to the brand’s reputation.”Etienne Greeff, chief executive of SecureData, a specialist security consultancy, says: “Reputational damage ranks low on the scale. It’s just not a big deal . . . It’s the regulatory fines and cost of remediation that influence corporate strategy.”Technological advances, rising global tensions and human failings are making it ever more vital to improve cyber security.Continue readingEven these costs may not amount to much, according to Benjamin Dean, a fellow at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. He analysed financial results from Sony, Home Depot and Target following well-publicised security breaches and concluded that the associated expenses reported by the companies amounted to less than 1 per cent of annual revenues.“After reimbursement from insurance and minus tax deductions, the losses are even less,” he wrote.Here, we take a look at the five of the largest-known data breaches to date and how they have affected companies.Heartland Payment Systems
Payment processing company Heartland announced it had fallen victim in 2008 to a security breach involving credit and debit card data. At the time, security experts said up to 100m cards, issued by more than 650 financial services companies, may have been compromised in what was described as the biggest criminal breach of card data. A US computer hacker, Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the crime. The breach cost the company $147.6m, but it claimed back $31.2m in insurance payouts.Four months after it disclosed the hack, Heartland was returned to Visa’s list of validated providers.Sony PlayStation Network
In April 2011, names, addresses, passwords and credit card data relating to 77m user accounts on Sony’s video game online network were compromised. The network shut down for several weeks and the company was later fined £250,000 by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office for what it called “a serious breach of the Data Protection Act”. In the US, the company spent $15m on settling lawsuits arising from the incident.Target
The hacking of IT systems at the US retailer resulted in the theft of the details of 40m payment cards and 70m other records, including customer email addresses and telephone numbers.Gregg Steinhafel, the chief executive, resigned in the aftermath. In its most recent financial statement, the company said costs relating to the breach totalled $252m, but added these were offset by an insurance payout that took the total down to $162m. And, according to Columbia University’s Mr Dean, once tax deductions are taken into account, the net losses tally $105m.Home Depot
The hacking of US retailer Home Depot resulted in the theft of more than 50m customer credit card numbers and emails. In the third quarter of 2014, the company said the breach had cost it $43m in pre-tax expenses, “partially offset by a $15m receivable for costs the company believes are reimbursable and probable of recovery under its insurance coverage, for pre-tax net expenses of $28m”. Mr Dean said that this “represents less than 0.01 per cent of Home Depot’s sales for 2014”.Anthem
The breach at this US health insurance company may have netted crooks medical data relating to 78.8m people.The incident continues to be analysed by the company and the government, but lawyers are already preparing class-action lawsuits.“I think Anthem did a relatively good job of disclosing its breach in terms of timeliness and owning up to it,” says Gartner’s Ms Litan. “They still got canned by the media, but if would have been much worse had they waited longer to disclose, as other breached companies do.”"
23;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2015-04-22T22:50:48Z;Cyber bill’s progress shows shifting mood on threats;Proposal would push companies to share hacking details with US government;A bill that would push companies into sharing information about hacking threats with the US government passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday, in a victory for the Obama administration’s main proposal for dealing with growing cybersecurity threats.The strong bipartisan support for the bill in the House contrasts with the fate of a similar proposal two years ago which was dropped in Congress amid privacy concerns surrounding Edward Snowden’s revelations about National Security Agency surveillance.The politics around the information-sharing idea have shifted in recent months in part because of a series of major security breaches suffered by companies such as Sony and Anthem, as well as the federal government.The House passed the bill in a 307-116 vote, and a similar bill has already passed the committee stage in the Senate. If final legislation is approved by both houses of Congress, it would represent Washington’s most decisive response to rising cyber-threats.The idea behind the bill is to encourage companies to share information about attacks by hackers with other companies and with federal authorities, who can then compile a more complete picture of the emerging threats and potentially warn other vulnerable parties.As companies feared potential lawsuits from customers for sharing information with the government, the bill provides them with legal liability protections.“Businesses across the country are being cyber-attacked billions of times a day,” said Adam Schiff, the leading Democrat on the House intelligence committee. “Our bill will ensure that we have the tools to address these attacks by enabling voluntary information sharing of cyberthreats.”The Obama administration has strongly encouraged Congress to pass legislation on information-sharing but has also at times complained that certain bills do not do enough to protect the privacy of customers whose information might end up being handed over to the government. Amid a fierce backlash two years ago over the privacy implications of a previous information-sharing bill, the White House threatened to use its veto.In a statement on Tuesday, the White House said that the House bill had “improved significantly” but that it still had concerns about the “sweeping liability protections”.Defenders of the bill say that it would effectively allow companies to hand over to authorities the code for suspicious malware, rather than incriminating information about individuals.However, earlier this week a group of 55 civil rights groups and academics wrote to Congress calling for House members to vote against the bill, which they said would “require federal entities to automatically disseminate to the NSA all cyber threat indicators they receive, including personal information about individuals”. They added that the bill would allow law enforcement to use the information to investigate crimes that had nothing to do with cybersecurity.Another information-sharing bill has already been approved by the House Homeland Security committee. The full House is expected to vote on it later this week, when it will be merged with the text that passed on Tuesday and taken to a conference with the Senate to force a final piece of legislation.
24;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2015-03-02T17:45:12Z;Anthem was warned about hacking weakness;US agency audited health insurer two years before data for 80m stolen;"Anthem was warned by the US government about weaknesses in its computer security defences almost two years before hackers broke into the second-largest US health insurer’s database and stole personal information belonging to nearly 80m people.The US Office of Personnel Management’s inspector general found vulnerabilities that could provide a “gateway for malicious virus and hacking activity that could lead to data breaches”, according to a September 2013 audit report.The insurer, which serves one in nine Americans, disclosed in February that it had suffered one of the largest corporate cyber attacks to date when hackers obtained data of current and former customers and employees, including social security numbers. These are a particularly lucrative cache for potential fraudsters: they are key identifiers that Americans use to file tax returns and apply for credit cards.Anthem’s apparent failure to fully build up its cyber defences after the 2013 audit reflects how companies often underestimate their vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. It could also provide ammunition for lawyers seeking to sue Anthem over the breach.The health insurer then and now has denied OPM auditors full access to its network to review its cyber security, a spokeswoman for the inspector general’s office said last week. The inspector general, which acts as a watchdog for OPM, cautioned that it still could not confirm that Anthem’s servers were secure.The 2013 audit report came two months after Anthem, a health provider for federal employees that was then known as WellPoint, had to pay a $1.7m fine after it “impermissibly disclosed” electronic records — including social security numbers — of more than 610,000 patients. The settlement with the US Department of Health and Human Services stemmed from a data breach in October 2009 to March 2010. WellPoint did not admit wrongdoing.The latest revelations about Anthem raise questions about whether the health insurer did enough to address multiple warnings and whether OPM pressed hard enough for action.The 2013 audit found that Anthem had not implemented controls preventing rogue devices from connecting to its network. Also, several servers containing federal government employees’ information were not routinely scanned for vulnerabilities. Auditors could not find evidence that they had ever been reviewed.“Failure to implement a thorough configuration compliance auditing program increases the risk that insecurely configured servers remain undetected, creating a potential gateway for malicious virus and hacking activity that could lead to data breaches,” the 2013 audit said.As online threats race up national security agendas and governments look at ways of protecting their national infrastructures a cyber arms race is causing concern to the developed world

Further readingAnthem told the Financial Times it believed it had addressed “the vast majority” of the recommendations in the 2013 report to OPM’s satisfaction and would work to resolve any outstanding recommendations or concerns.An OPM spokesperson said Anthem had addressed the 10 recommendations in the audit report. The inspector general’s office said they still lacked access to do a thorough review of Anthem’s security.The inspector general, known as OIG, brought up its concerns with the OPM, which has amended its contract with Anthem to allow auditors some access, the OIG spokeswoman said. Still, she said, “This provision has proven to be insufficient.”“We are currently working with OPM to further amend the contract,” she said, adding that another audit had been scheduled for this summer.OIG said Anthem had told them that it was denying access because of a policy that prohibited external entities from connecting to its network. Anthem recently reiterated that auditors would not be permitted to conduct vulnerability scans.We have conducted vulnerability scans and configuration compliance tests at numerous health insurance carriers without incident . . . We do not know why Anthem refuses to co-operateAnthem said giving the auditors full access would have required turning off its antivirus software and could have caused outages in its system. Anthem provided an alternate vulnerability management programme as a substitute.OIG said other health carriers had opened up their systems to inspectors. “We have conducted vulnerability scans and configuration compliance tests at numerous health insurance carriers without incident,” the OIG spokeswoman said. “We do not know why Anthem refuses to co-operate with the OIG.”The 2013 audit said, given the access that auditors had, Anthem had implemented “a thorough incident response and network security program” but inspectors could not “attest that [the insurer’s] computer servers maintain a secure configuration.” The audit found that technical controls were lacking to prevent access “by rogue devices”, including laptops not issued or approved by the company.In written replies to the audit then, Anthem said it believed the risks were mitigated by on-site control and training. Anthem said it required authentication for all applications in its network and no direct wireless connectivity was allowed.The insurer added that its focus was “on protecting data”.“We continually monitor security exposures and have built layers of defence to protect data, and will continue to implement programs that have been proven effective,” it said in response to the 2013 audit.Additional reporting by Hannah Kuchler"
25;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2015-02-05T04:12:29Z;US health group Anthem hit by hackers;Targeted database held details of about 80m people;Anthem, the second-biggest US health insurance company, late on Wednesday revealed that it was the victim of what is thought to be the biggest cyberattack to hit the sector, with as many as 80m of its customers potentially exposed.The company said that the records of an unknown number of its present and former customers had been taken, including their social security numbers and salary details.The company database that was the target of what Anthem called a “very sophisticated external cyberattack” held details of about 80m people in all, around half of them current customers.In a message to the insurer’s members, Joseph Swedish, chief executive, said that the company had “no evidence” at this stage that credit card or medical information was stolen along with other records, although the breach is still under investigation.The large size of the database that was targeted in the attack stands to make the Anthem breach one of the largest to hit a US financial institution, potentially ranking alongside the 76m customer records that were taken when JPMorgan was hacked last year.However, the extent of the personal information in the Anthem case is much greater, encompassing not only extensive employment and social security records but a range of personal information including medical IDs and email and street addresses.The breach was discovered by the company itself, making it one of the relatively rare cases where a large-scale hack was identified by internal means rather than being reported by third parties, according to an official at Mandiant, a cyber security company called in after the problem was discovered.The first signs of extensive data breaches usually come when information from the stolen records starts to appear on other sites, as happened with credit card details taken from retailers like Target and Home Depot.Anthem said it had contacted the FBI about the attack and “immediately made every effort to close the security vulnerability”. However, in a sign that it had yet to get to the bottom of the full extent of the problems, Mr Swedish said the company was “working around the clock to do everything we can to further secure your data”.
26;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2014-07-17T16:57:40Z;UnitedHealth climbs on surging sales;;US health insurance providers continued a year’s long ascent on Thursday as the country’s largest health insurer reported better than expected results, buoyed by healthcare reform.UnitedHealth, the Minnesota-based insurer, said sales jumped 7 per cent from a year earlier to $32.6bn, lifted by a surge in Medicaid enrolment linked to the Affordable Care Act.Profits at the company fell 2 per cent from the same period a year earlier to $1.4bn, or $1.42 per share. Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of $1.26 a share on sales of $32bn.The results are the latest to show the impact President Barack Obama’s signature law has had on the healthcare sector, lifting sales at hospitals and insurers as more consumers enrol in Medicaid or private health insurance purchased through an online exchange.Over the past year, 730,000 people have enrolled in Medicaid services offered by UnitedHealth, including 380,000 people in the second quarter.“We plan to grow next year as we expand our offerings to as many as two dozen state exchanges,” chief executive Stephen Hemsley said on a call with analysts. “This approach is consistent with our long stated plan to take a prudent first year position, and then build and expand in 2015 and 2016.”Analysts with Deutsche Bank called the results “solid”, particularly the “earnings beat from UnitedHealth’s Health Benefits business”.The industry broadly advanced following the company’s results. UnitedHealth shares climbed to all-time high by midday trading before paring back to $85.11 by close, a 2 per cent jump. Shares in WellPoint rose 1 per cent to $113.44, Humana jumped 3 per cent to $131.17 and Aetna increased 2 per cent to $83.68.SanDisk shares led the benchmark S&P 500 lower after the flash-memory producer forecast third quarter sales shy of Wall Street expectations.The company said it expected net revenues in the third quarter to range between $1.68bn and $1.73bn due to supply constraints in the second half of the year.Shares in the company sunk 14 per cent to $93.21, wiping nearly $3bn off the company’s market capitalisation.Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, who succeeded Steve Ballmer in early February, said the company would cut up to 18,000 jobs over the next year.In a memo to employees, Mr Nadella insisted the reductions, which will primarily impact the Nokia handset business, were “the first step to building the right organisation”.The shrinkage of Microsoft’s workforce is the single largest cull in the company’s history.“The headcount reduction related to the Nokia business indicates that Microsoft is not going to let Nokia become a potential ‘black hole’ of spend,” Kirk Materne, an analyst with Evercore, said.Shares of Microsoft rose 1 per cent to $44.53, its highest level since 2000.Yum shares tumbled 7 per cent to $77.01 after the company said its US business remained weak despite recent investments.The company behind the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, has ceded ground to rivals including Chipotle and Domino’s.Global sales rose 10 per cent from a year earlier to $3.2bn while profits increased 19 per cent to $334m, or 73 cents a share. Both figures matched analysts’ forecasts.“We are obviously disappointed with second-quarter results, particularly with the very poor performance in our US division,” chief executive David Novak said of Pizza Hut.Mr Novak said he now expected the unit’s full-year operating profits to fall “well short of our expectations”.Analysts with brokerage Jefferies said the domestic KFC business would also “continue to struggle” and commodity cost inflation would weigh on Yum’s margins.Mattel, which is best-known for its Fisher-Price and Barbie brands, reported a sharp drop in second-quarter profits on Thursday, with net income down 61 per cent from a year earlier to to $28.3m.With the exception of American Girl, Mattel’s key brands all sank in the quarter. Barbie sales were down 15 per cent, Fisher-Price fell 17 per cent and Hot Wheels slipped 2 per cent.The toy maker’s shares declined 7 per cent to $36.46.Overall, US equity markets declined after a Malaysian Airlines passenger flight crashed in Ukraine.The S&P 500 fell 1.2 per cent to 1,958.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9 per cent to 16,976.81.

27;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2014-02-24T22:12:30Z;Humana surges as health insurers avoid worst of government cuts;;Humana shares surged to a record high on Monday after the health insurance provider said US government funding cuts to the Medicare programme through the private market would be less than had been expected.US government payments into the Medicare Advantage plan would fall 3.5 to 4 per cent in 2015, the company said in a filing with US securities regulators. Executives had previously warned analysts and investors the drop could be as high as 7 per cent.The change in tone follows new payment guidelines from the US Department of Health and Human Services issued last Friday, stating that proposed changes would be “ smaller than those implemented in 2014”.The advance notice from the government estimates a 1.9 per cent drop in healthcare spending for Medicare Advantage policy holders.The Medicare Advantage programme generated nearly two-thirds of Humana’s $41.3bn of sales in 2013. The company expects to add between 370,000 and 410,000 subscribers to the programme over the current year.“The company is continuing to evaluate the changes detailed in the Advance Notice and the related impact company-wide and by geography,” Humana said.Shares in Humana rose 10.6 per cent to $113.69, while rivals UnitedHealth Group advanced 2.9 per cent to $76.01, Aetna added 1.9 per cent to $71.80, WellPoint climbed 2.7 per cent to $90.93, and Tenet Healthcare rose 3.1 per cent to $48.33.Verizon was having trouble finding its feet on its first trading day since it completed the purchase of Vodafone’s minority stake in its US wireless venture.Shares in the largest US wireless operator fell 2.2 per cent on Monday, following a trading update in which management said it expected consolidated revenues to grow 4 per cent in 2014 to about $125bn.This was a little slower than the 4.1 per cent advance a year earlier but in line with Wall Street forecasts.Verizon management also said it was targeting an increase in margins for both its wireless and wireline businesses as they continued to add subscribers.Lowell McAdam, chief executive, said the completed merger marked a “major milestone” for Verizon.Barclays analyst Amir Rozwadowski noted that volatility in Verizon shares would probably continue over the next three months as index buyers absorb shares.BlackBerry shares rose 7.5 per cent to $9.83 after the mobile device maker said it would make its messaging service, BBM, available to Microsoft’s Windows Phone and the upcoming Nokia X platforms.Deal activity saw shares in RF Micro Devices, a manufacturer of radio frequency equipment, surge 21 per cent to $7.03. It agreed to merge with TriQuint Semiconductor in an all-stock deal that will create a new company with $2bn in annual revenues. TriQuint shares jumped 26.1 per cent to $11.64.Shareholders in RF Micro and TriQuint, a parts supplier in the radio frequency sector, will receive an equal stake in the combined venture. Under the terms of the deal, TriQuint shareholders will receive 1.675 shares of the new company and RF Micro shareholders will receive one share, for each TriQuint or RF Micro share held.“The world’s demand for mobile data is growing exponentially,” RF chief executive Bob Bruggeworth said. “The combination of TriQuint and RFMD creates a new leader in RF solutions with expertise in mobile devices and complex infrastructure and global defence applications.Mr Bruggeworth will lead the combined company as chief executive, while TriQuint’s current chief executive Ralph Quinsey will serve as non-executive chairman.The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index broke into record territory, up 21.4 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 1,857.66, earlier in the day.

28;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T07:24:12+0000;Data prescription for better healthcare;;Machines beep and drone throughout the neonatal intensive care unit at Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children. Intimidated parents stand by as nurses scurry between the glass cases.Among their various checks, nurses chart a baby’s heart rate once an hour. This is standard practice at most hospitals, but Carolyn McGregor, a professor of health informatics at the University of Ontario, Institute of Technology, says it leaves a lot of critical data to waste.While a baby’s heart beats around 120 times a minute, it is the pattern of those beats over time that that can give early warning if something is wrong.With the help of Watson, IBM’s supercomputer that trounced the top Jeopardy! champions last year, Ms McGregor analysed live streams of every heartbeat in a project nicknamed “data baby”. She found patterns that revealed signs of infection 24 hours before the baby showed any visible symptoms. In premature babies, advancing treatment by even an hour can be life-saving.“At the moment, all nurses have are some very poor alarms that go off all the time, so everyone ignores them,” Ms McGregor says. “We’re trying to watch more streams of data that will give more intelligent alarms.”The healthcare industry is under extreme pressure from regulators and market forces to reduce costs and produce better outcomes. The US, in particular, spends 30 per cent more on healthcare per capita than other developed countries – about $750bn in total. But despite this higher level of spending, its life expectancy or infant mortality rates are not significantly better, according to a McKinsey report.The US healthcare industry has therefore become the target of sweeping reforms aimed at reducing tests and procedures that bulk up the bottom line but show minimal to no impact on making patients better. Hospitals and insurance companies must demonstrate efficiency and the improved health of its customers to remain compliant with government policy changes and stay competitive in the free market.Harnessing vast troves of data is increasingly seen as the solution. From medical devices and insurance claims, to scribbled doctors’ prescriptions and social media sites, the data in healthcare is massive and messy.One of the promises of organising and analysing all those data is the ability to predict the future, with the goal of early intervention preventing heart attacks or hip fractures from happening in the first place.“Historically, quality in medicine has been a retrospective affair,” says Stephan Fihn, a doctor and director of analytics and business intelligence at the US Veterans’ Health Administration. “The Holy Grail right now is what would be termed ‘predictive analytics’.”One of the earliest health systems to begin keeping health records electronically, the VA now has data on 20m patients, including 2bn text notes, 16.2m X-rays, and 1.5bn drug prescriptions. From analysing that data, it can, for example, identify characteristics of patients who suffered renal failure after getting a certain drug, then use that to predict who else is likely to have the same reaction.Such measures are now of supreme interest to private hospitals in the US. Under new health reform laws, hospitals now face financial penalties if certain patients are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of being discharged. To maintain profit margins over the long term, they must invest now to develop new protocols that conserve resources and improve performance.Several hospitals are running data analyses to determine which patients are at the highest risk of being readmitted, for example after a heart attack or pneumonia, then prescribing in-home monitoring devices and outreach programmes to keep them on track.“We’re moving away from pay-per-pill and pay-per-procedure, and going into a business model that is pay-per-person,” says David Dimond, healthcare strategist at EMC.Health insurance companies are just as invested in correcting the inefficiencies of the system. Premiums have risen in step with the overspending, and customers, whether employers that sponsor health plans for their employees, or individual consumers, are at a breaking point of what they are willing to pay. Under US reforms, insurers cannot deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions, so they must manage the risk instead of avoiding it.WellPoint, a health insurer that covers more than 33m patients, has contracts with dozens of technology suppliers, including several to manage and analyse its data.One of the main goals is to use computers to make the human decision-making process more efficient, says Elizabeth Bigham, vice-president of health IT strategy for WellPoint. For example, the current process for pre-authorising claims can take up to two weeks and involve input from several nurses and physicians. Once a computer is trained on how the company decides to pay or reject claims, most of these humans could be replaced and the patient could have an answer almost instantaneously.It is even exploring what it can do with all the data generated by medical tracking devices, such as glucometers and heart rate monitors, and even health tracking devices such as the FitBit, a pedometer that tracks the wearer’s activity, calorie intake and sleep patterns. It uses those data to inform diet and lifestyle coaching programmes for patients with diabetes, obesity and hypertension with an eye on preventing a catastrophic – and expensive – heart attack or amputation.John Edwards, director of the health advisory at PwC, expects health insurers to offer lower premiums in the next one to two years to customers willing to wear a mobile health tracking device, similar to car insurance companies that give discounts to drivers willing to install a GPS device on their cars that tracks speed.“It’s not far-fetched at all that tracking exercise could become part of an insurance design that says ‘you’re doing the right thing’ in order to control healthcare costs,” he says.Wireless sensors are also seen as a way to control costs associated with the ageing population. Motion sensors in beds, walls and floors of elderly people’s homes can track patterns in activity and movement to predict devastating falls. Researchers at the Sinclair School of Nursing at the University of Missouri are identifying patterns of restlessness during sleep and changes in physical activity that precede a devastating fall or visit to the emergency room.Bonnie Wakefield, a research professor at the University of Missouri School of Nursing, says such data patterns and predictive algorithms could soon aid nurses making critical decisions at all levels of healthcare.“It’s quantifying intuition,” she says.
29;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Lowe’s slips as earnings miss forecasts;;Shares in Lowe’s retreated on Monday after the US home improvement retailer reported quarterly earnings that were worse than expected due to weak same-store sales.The stock fell 5.8 per cent to $26.26 as the company recorded earnings per share of 65 cents, which missed the average analyst estimate of 70 cents a share. The retailer also lowered its full-year outlook.Alan Rifkin, analyst at Barclays, said: “Lowe’s performance confirms our view that the company should be focusing all of its efforts on stabilising its current business …The company lowered guidance for the second time this year, suggesting that it continues to lose [market] share to its key rival Home Depot.”Mr Rifkin lowered the stock’s 12-month target price to $25 from $30, adding that the company was unlikely to benefit from any significant improvement in the housing market during the second half.Laura Champine, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, maintained a “hold” rating on the stock and said the company faces “execution issues amid slow recovery”.The consumer discretionary sector, which includes Lowe’s, was the second-worst performer behind telecommunications. Lowes rival Home Depot was down 0.3 per cent to $56.57.Best Buy fell 10.4 per cent to $18.16 after the electronic retailer said it had appointed Hubert Joly as its new chief executive officer, while the company’s takeover talk with its founder, Richard Schulze, broke down over the weekend.Daniel Binder, analyst at Jefferies, gave the stock a “hold” rating and said: “What will matter more is the restructuring plan we expect management to detail. Further, the exchange between Mr Schulze and the board continues to play out, each trying to gain more ground with shareholders.”Mr Binder also said investors were waiting for the turnround plan of the company.“While we have not yet heard management’s plan, we suspect the cornerstone of the strategy will probably be building the services business, while at the same time focusing on additional cost cutting so that it can reinvest in price and protect market share, a process that is already under way. [But] a large-scale turnround could take two to three years and may be better executed as a private company.”By contrast, Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, continued to rally and closed at a record level of $665.15, up 2.6 per cent.Aaron Rakers, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, who gave the stock a “buy” rating and set the 12-month target price at $825, said: “A major near-term catalyst is Apple’s widely-anticipated iPhone 5 launch in September or October.”Investment banking group Jefferies also raised Apple’s target price to $900 last Friday. The biggest US company has gained 7 per cent over the past week.Facebook bounced back to $20.05 and gained 5.3 per cent as Rory Maher, analyst at Capstone Investments, upgraded the social networking site to “buy” from “hold”. Microsoft dropped 0.5 per cent to $30.74.Six of 10 S&P sectors traded in negative territory with the information technology and financials indices recording gains. Both subgroups added 0.3 per cent, respectively.Shares in Aetna rose 5.6 per cent to $40.18 after the healthcare company said it would acquire Coventry Health Care for $5.7bn. The deal comes on the heels of WellPoint’s acquisition of Amerigroup Corp for $4.9bn last month.Coventry Health Care jumped 20.3 per cent to $42.04. The stock has gained 30 per cent last week.The merger, which is expected to close in mid-2013, would increase Aetna’s medical membership in Medicare and Medicaid.Chris Rigg, analyst at Susquehanna, cheered the transaction from a strategic perspective as the deal would substantially improve Aetna’s positioning in health insurance exchange in 2014 and beyond.However, credit rating agencies Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's cautioned possible financial risks would be imposed on Aetna by the large acquisition.Overall, the broader market lost momentum on Monday after gaining for six consecutive weeks as investors remained cautious over the eurozone debt crisis.The S&P 500 closed flat at 1,418.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped fractionally to 13,271.64 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index also declined fractionally to 3,076.21.William Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, said: “Developments out of Europe could be a driver of markets this week. One potential catalyst for markets will be the European Central Bank’s impending announcement of the details of its newest market intervention scheme, which was promised on August 2.”
30;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2012-08-20T16:38:42Z;Aetna buys Coventry Health for $5.7bn;;Aetna said on Monday it will acquire Coventry Health Care for $5.7bn in the latest sign of consolidation in the health insurance market, as it adapts to the Obama administration’s healthcare reforms.The deal will increase Aetna’s presence in the Medicaid and Medicare markets, which sell government-backed insurance to the poor and elderly and will expand in 2014 as a result of the healthcare law. The US Supreme Court upheld the law in June.“We think diversification is incredibly important as we head into healthcare reform,” Mark Bertolini, Aetna’s chief executive, told analysts on Monday. “Time was running out for us to consider something like this, because we wanted to have it ready for integration and closed prior to healthcare reform kicking off.”Aetna will pay $42.08 a share, including $27.30 in cash and 0.3885 Aetna common shares for each Coventry share. The price represents a 20 per cent premium to Coventry’s closing stock price on Friday and with debt the deal is valued at $7.3bn.“I view the deal positively,” said Ana Gupte, healthcare analyst at Bernstein Research. “It boosts Aetna’s commercial local and national scale in a meaningful manner.”Shares in Aetna rose 4.07 per cent to $39.59 in midday trading. Coventry was up 18.75 per cent to $41.49.The Supreme Court decision came while the companies were in early discussions, people close to the companies said, after which the pace of negotiations accelerated.The healthcare law provides funding to expand Medicare and Medicaid insurance, but some analysts suggested the deal was a risky bet so soon before elections.Several state governors have said they will not implement parts of the act until after the November polls. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, has vowed to repeal the act and proposed sweeping changes to Medicare.Mr Bertolini, criticised in June when Aetna failed to disclose $7m in political donations to groups backing Republican causes, told CNBC on Monday that “this combination goes far beyond what happens in the election”.The deal follows a similar move last month by WellPoint, which paid $4.9bn in cash to buy Amerigroup Corp, which specialises in Medicaid plans. Last year Cigna spent $3.8bn to acquire HealthSpring, a provider of health insurance to senior citizens.Analysts said Coventry came cheaper than expected, even though its stock price has risen by more than a third since July, when WellPoint bought Amerigroup.The companies said they expect $400m in annual cost synergies by 2015 .The acquisition of Coventry expands the share of revenues Aetna generates from its government business from 23 per cent to 30 per cent.Aetna issued $2.5bn in new debt and commercial paper to finance the cash part of the transaction.Goldman Sachs and UBS advised Aetna. Coventry was advised by Greenhill & Co.
31;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;WellPoint to buy Amerigroup for $4.9bn;;WellPoint, the US health insurer, has agreed to buy rival Amerigroup Corp in a $4.9bn cash acquisition that analysts say could be the start of a wave of consolidation in the sector following the US Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the Obama administration’s healthcare law.The deal comes after the court lifted a cloud of uncertainty from the US healthcare system less than two weeks ago.Under the law, most Americans will be required to purchase health insurance. Federal funding for Medicaid, which insures the poor, will increase.WellPoint will pay $92 a share for Amerigroup, a 43 per cent premium above the company’s closing share price last Friday. The move will help WellPoint serve the growing population of poor and elderly people. Some 16m additional people are projected to be covered through Medicaid in the next few years.The acquisition is the largest by a US managed-care company and the biggest premium ever paid by one.“I think the other major carriers that don’t have a sizeable Medicaid presence may stop and think about it,” said Edward Kaplan, leader of the health practice at Segal, a benefits consultancy. “It’s probably the biggest area of growth for the insurers in the next few years.”However, some analysts have expressed concern that uncertainty over the law has not fully subsided, as several governors have vowed not to implement provisions until after the presidential election in November. Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate, has vowed to repeal the law if he wins. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court’s ruling allows states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion and forgo funding.“We do believe the Medicaid expansion will go forward,” said James Carlson, chief executive of Amerigroup, suggesting that states will realise the benefits for poor residents once the political heat surrounding the law cools.Healthcare analysts have suggested that insurers will look for greater scale to cope with growing government scrutiny over the industry and restrictions on pricing.Share prices of Medicaid insurers got a lift earlier this month when the Supreme Court upheld the law. On Monday, shares of smaller Medicaid insurers such as Molina Healthcare, Centene and WellCare rose more than 10 per cent in midday trading, signalling growing interest in the sector from investors.WellPoint shares closed up 3.4 per cent to $61.95, while shares of Amerigroup jumped 38 per cent to $88.79.The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013. Credit Suisse advised WellPoint and Goldman Sachs and Barclays advised Amerigroup.
32;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
33;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;US healthcare: mixed diagnosis;Behind the Supreme Court hullabaloo are stark realities;"Only one industry can look forward to the US Supreme Court’s decision on the Affordable Care Act, expected on Thursday, with unambiguous delight. Whatever the ruling, commentators such as analysts, manufacturers of outrage and partisan triumphalists will be in great demand. Healthcare companies have more at risk.Take hospitals. The seven biggest publicly traded hospital companies by market capitalisation generated $77bn in revenues in the past fiscal year. About $7.4bn of that was written off as bad debt. To put that into context, the companies reported about $5.5bn in pre-tax income. They would benefit significantly from a law that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would more than halve the numbers of the uninsured to about 26m by 2016. Credit Suisse estimates that complete implementation of the law could raise earnings per share at these companies by a quarter, compared with its full repeal.The other industry with most at stake – managed care – is in an even trickier spot. The individual mandate clause, which penalises those who do not buy insurance, would increase the customer base for companies such as UnitedHealth and WellPoint, but the law also includes profit ceilings, constrains pricing and underwriting, and creates competition-increasing insurance exchanges. Bernstein Research estimates that total repeal could have a net 15 per cent positive impact on earnings; but a repeal of just the individual mandate while retaining the rest would push earnings in the other direction.The hard question for investors is what, after months of chatter, has already been priced into the shares. Both hospitals and insurers trade at or near single-digit price-to-earnings multiples, despite generating lots of cash.

By contrast, 83 per cent of voting shareholders opposed a shareholder proposal to prohibit political spending from corporate treasury funds, while 75 per cent opposed a proposal to have an independent board chairman.At the meeting, George Buckley, outgoing chief executive, said 3M should continue to participate in the political process and take positions on issues such as tax and regulation.Mr Buckley is well known to have strong political views. He caused a furore last year when he called President Barack Obama “Robin Hood-esque” and “anti-business” in an interview with the FT.
35;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2012-03-08T18:37:48Z;Inequality may lead to rage against the machines;We are in technological upheaval with rewards flowing to the elite;"Citigroup just hired a brilliant consultant called Watson to build out its digital banking. This very same Watson also advises healthcare companies such as WellPoint and, in his time off, took the top prize last year on Jeopardy!, the television quiz show. According to his friends, Watson has other corporate gigs that he is coy about, and will soon earn more than $1bn annually. His astronomical income puts him in the top 1 per cent of the top 1 per cent of all American workers. Or rather, it would if he were human. He is a machine.It is worth contemplating the rise of this IBM supercomputer amid a fraught election season. Out on the campaign trail, Republicans promise to bring jobs back by reining in the government and bashing China. Barack Obama counters with a mirror-image populism, blaming the super-rich for the troubles of ordinary workers. Watson stands as a reminder that something more profound is happening. We are in the midst of a technological upheaval; and financial rewards are flowing to the elites who create and control the new machines. Almost everybody else is threatened – including sophisticated bank executives at Citi and WellPoint’s healthcare analysts.Watson is the standard bearer of a formidable army. Thanks to the relentless arithmetic of Moore’s law, the latest Intel chip contains 2.6bn transistors, a million times more than the path-breaking Intel 4004 of four decades ago. The cost of computer storage has fallen about 90 per cent in just six years, according to Martin Barnes of BCA Research; today’s transistors are so tiny that you can fit 3,000 of them into the width of a human hair. As a result, companies can store and analyse information on every aspect of the world around them. The era of Big Data is at hand.The machines that mine these data are upending businesses of every stripe. Renaissance Technologies, the Long Island firm that runs what is probably the best-performing hedge fund of the past two decades, is led by two scientists from IBM’s artificial-intelligence lab. Human judgment is making way for machine-driven analysis in the executive offices of sports teams. Tomorrow’s medicine is, at least in part, a large programming challenge.Small wonder, then, that inequality is rising. Innovators and programmers are earning more than ever, as are the entertainers and intellectual superstars who leverage the new technologies to create global brands. High-touch, high-skill professions that cannot be automated (think fancy divorce lawyers) are doing nicely, thank you. But for large swaths of the workforce, the outlook feels bleak.It is a quirk of US politics that neither Democrats nor Republicans indulge in rage against the machine. Foreign competitors, Wall Street fat cats and big government are the preferred scapegoats, never mind that technology plays a larger role in stoking worker insecurities. But even though Campaign 2012 is ignoring the most crucial change in the economy, it is still important to be clear on what it means.Do Watson and his ilk portend higher unemployment? In the long run, clearly not. There is no finite set of tasks in an economy, so the fact that intelligent machines perform vastly more functions will not prevent able-bodied workers from landing jobs. But in the short- and even medium-run, displaced workers may have trouble finding new employment, with consequences for social policy that are seldom recognised. To rescue overstretched pension systems, for example, western societies are raising the retirement age. But, as Harvard’s Lawrence Summers argues, the timing is unfortunate. Postponing retirement may compound the frictional unemployment that technology threatens.Even if displaced workers do find jobs, will these jobs be dignified? A society divided between master-programmers and servants may not appeal to the servants, who will be the majority. But neo-Marxist visions of burger flippers on the barricades seem a touch too paranoid. In the 19th century, the shift from farm to factory was decried as dehumanising. But the supposedly alienated proletariat soon morphed into proud welders and machinists and today it is the decline of factories that is perceived as a problem. The lesson is that attitudes adjust and job status is elastic. There may be real unhappiness during the adjustment phase, but eventually the nannies of yesterday will be the respected childcare professionals of tomorrow. Cooks will turn into executive chefs.And so, in the last analysis, Watson’s most enduring impact will be to accentuate the trade-off between equity and growth. Technology and globalisation magnify differences in productivity among workers; if pay tracks performance so as to optimise incentives, rising inequality is the certain result. How far we want to tame that trend should be a central question in the politics of the coming decade. But politicians of both parties are weirdly silent.The writer, an FT contributing editor, is the Paul A. Volcker Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations"
36;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T07:23:53+0000;Results mixed for US healthcare companies;Companies beginning to see uptick in services;Shares of WellPoint fell by nearly 5 per cent after the US health insurer reported disappointing fourth-quarter results and a 2012 outlook that was weaker than analysts expected.The California-based insurer, which is the second-largest in the US by market capitalisation, said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter net income fell by 39 per cent from a year ago to $335.3m, or 96 cents a share, while operating revenue rose 5.5 per cent to $15.1bn.The company, which has been looking to gain more Medicare Advantage customers to capitalise on the ageing US population, was hit by surprisingly high medical costs of customers in its home state. Wellpoint’s consumer business lost $4.6m during the final three months of last year.“Clearly, our consumer segment underperformed, and it was almost entirely due to the senior business,” Angela Braly, Wellpoint’s chief executive, told analysts.Health insurers, which faced harsh criticism during the debate over US healthcare reform legislation, have performed well in the last year as patients tried to avoid medical procedures amid a weak economy.However, as the US economy has shown signs of life recently, healthcare companies are starting to see an increase in the use of medical services.On Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson said that its medical device business was approaching a “trough”, as patients were choosing to move forward with knee and hip replacements that they had delayed.Last week, United Health, the largest US insurer, offered a cautious outlook for 2012, noting that it expected medical claims costs to rise as usage rates increase.WellPoint said it expects to earn net income of $7.60 a share this year.“The company’s track record of execution over the last several years has been spotty, so delivering strong 2012 performance is important to see performance upside,” said Ana Gupte, healthcare analyst at Bernstein Research.Separately on Wednesday, Abbott, the US drug maker, reported a strong fourth quarter, with net earnings rising by 12.3 per cent to $1.6bn, or $1.02 a share. But the company’s share price slipped 1.34 per cent as its revenues and 2012 outlook were softer than Wall Street analysts projected.Scott Stoffel, an Abbott spokesman, said that the company cut 700 jobs and would eliminate several hundred more this year. Most of the jobs are in manufacturing, he said, and some are related to the expiration of Abbott’s contract to supply stents to Boston Scientific.The stronger US dollar meant that foreign exchange provided less of a benefit to Abbott than it previously thought. The US pharmaceutical sector is bracing for the currency shift to become a headwind this year.Abbott said that its plan to split the company into separate research-based pharmaceuticals and diversified medical products businesses is on track to be completed by the end of 2012.

38;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;Cigna to acquire HealthSpring for $3.8bn;;Cigna, the US health insurer, said on Monday that it acquired HealthSpring, which sells health insurance to senior citizens, for $3.8bn as it looks to capitalise on an ageing US population.Cigna will pay $55 a share for HealthSpring in a cash deal that represents a 37 per cent premium above HealthSpring’s closing share price from last Friday. To finance the acquisition, Cigna said it would issue new stock and additional debt.“The seniors market in the US is a very large market and because of demographics it will be growing in the next decade,” David Cordani, Cigna’s chief executive, told the Financial Times.HealthSpring sells Medicare Advantage plans, which are private versions of the government health insurance plans that senior citizens receive that are subsidised and come with additional benefits. The company currently has 340,000 members in 11 US states.The deal surprised some analysts, as Cigna has recently been looking to international markets for growth.“Cigna’s acquisition of HealthSpring is a surprise, not because of the seller, as Medicare has been a rapidly consolidating industry this year, but because of the buyer, as Cigna hasn’t expressed a lot of interest recently in becoming bigger in government business, with their near universal focus on growing internationally,” noted said Carl McDonald, a Citigroup analyst.Mr Cordani said that the seniors market has been the company’s second priority after international acquisitions and that it will also be looking for opportunities in the US retail insurance market.Health insurers have been consolidating after last year’s sweeping healthcare reform legislation. Ongoing legal battles have left the future of the law uncertain, but insurers have been making bets on senior care as a growth area.“Changes in healthcare reform are stimulating more change in the marketplace and more opportunities for those ready to embrace that change,” Mr Cordani said.In June, WellPoint, another health insurer, acquired CareMore, a Medicare specialist insurer, for $800m. Last month, Humana sought to boost its Medicare offerings through the acquisition of MD Care.Shares of Cigna slipped 0.56 per cent to $44.45 in midday trading, while HealthSpring’s stock price jumped 33.1 per cent to $53.47. The deal boosted the sector, with shares of Humana, Universal American and WellCare all rising.The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year and Cigna said it would add to its earnings per share within a year. Herbert Fritch, HealthSpring’s chief executive, will stay on and lead the division after the transaction is finalised.Morgan Stanley advised Cigna, while Goldman Sachs advised HealthSpring.

It’s that there won’t be an agreement until the stock market tanks.”The S&P 500 dropped 2 per cent to 1,304.89.Of the 10 main S&P industry groups, technology was the biggest loser with a drop of 2.95 per cent, followed by industrials, down 2.7 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.7 per cent to 2,764.79 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.6 per cent at 12,302.55.In a sign that nervousness and uncertainty was growing, the Vix, an indicator of future volatility, rose 13 per cent and touched its highest level since March.However, Dunkin’ Brands, which listed on Nasdaq, jumped 47 per cent to $28.85 in its first of trading day. The company has raised $422.75m after pricing its initial public offering at $19 a share, higher than the range of $16 to $18 set by underwriters.Corning said its second-quarter profits dropped 17 per cent, as the speciality glass maker was hit by a higher tax rate, while its supply of liquid crystal display glass was disrupted by Japan’s earthquake and tsunami in March. Its shares fell 7.2 per cent to $16.04.Shares in Juniper Networks, a network equipment maker, plunged 21 per cent to $24.66 after the company reported disappointing results for the second quarter. Juniper also warned that the “outlook for the September quarter reflects some near-term market weakness”.But shares in Amazon were up 3.9 per cent at $222.52, after the online retailer reported higher revenues but lower profits late on Tuesday. The company still beat estimates.Boeing reported a 20 per cent rise in second-quarter profits and upgraded its outlook for 2011, lifting its earnings per share guidance to between $3.90 and $4.10.Shares in the aircraft maker rose 0.7 per cent to $70.63, after its net income rose to $941m, compared with $787m in the second quarter of 2010.Dow Chemical reported a 74 per cent rise in profits to 84 cents a share on sales of $16bn, which beat analysts’ estimates, and the company also announced the sale of its polypropylene unit. Its shares lost 2.4 per cent to $34.99.Ford, a day after reporting a 7.7 per cent drop in earnings from a year ago, was planning to sell a benchmark 10-year debt issue. The stock was down 4.4 per cent at $12.37.Shares in WellPoint dropped 6.6 per cent to $68.70, after the company reported better-than-expected results and warned of rising costs for its Medicare plans for seniors.The US debt debate “is weighing on markets but so is the weaker-than-expected durable goods report”, said Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital. “We may be faced with a US downgrade but what we will definitely be faced with is weak economic growth.”Data on US second-quarter gross domestic product growth will be released on Friday.Durable goods orders for June fell 2.1 per cent, weaker than the expected rise of 0.3 per cent. Orders excluding transportation rose 0.1 per cent, and were also below estimates.“Manufacturing has lost momentum in recent months and it is hard to place all the blame on knock-on effects from Japanese supply chain disruptions,” said analysts at RDQ Economics.They added: “Motor vehicles have played a very significant part in the drop in durable goods orders over the past three months, as total durable goods orders have fallen at an annualised rate of 10.4 per cent since March, while orders of motor vehicles and parts have fallen at a more rapid pace of 23 per cent.”
40;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T07:23:53+0000;US health insurers boosted by weak economy;;Weakness in the US economy is helping to pad the profits of health insurers, allaying investor concerns that last year’s sweeping healthcare legislation would stifle their businesses.Aetna and WellPoint, two of the biggest insurers, raised their earnings outlooks on Tuesday as they reported better than expected second-quarter profits. Both pointed to fewer patients utilising healthcare services, which insurers end up making payments for, because they are putting off expensive procedures.Those results confirmed the strong performance in the sector that was foreshadowed last week when UnitedHealth, the largest insurer by market value, lifted its outlook, thanks to a pick-up in enrolment in its plans and customers avoiding visits to the doctor’s office.“Utilisation has remained lower than we anticipated,” said Angela Braly, WellPoint’s chief executive.Net income at WellPoint increased 2.9 per cent to $701.6m, or $1.89 a share, from the same period a year ago, and total revenues rose 4.6 per cent to $15.1bn.However, WellPoint’s shares fell nearly 4 per cent in midday trading as the company had unexpectedly high payouts to senior citizens through its Medicare plans. The company, which said it is “refining” its strategy, has been looking to grow its presence among ageing “baby boomers,” but took on too many sick customers during the quarter.Such issues were avoided by Aetna, which lifted second quarter profits 9.3 per cent to $536.7m, or $1.39 a share. Mark Bertolini, the company’s chief executive, also pointed to lower than expected medical utilisation rates as a key driver of its profits, but warned that these may start to pick up again later in the year or next year as the economy improves.“Patients are putting off elective procedures like hips and knees,” said Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager and healthcare analyst at Miller Tabak. “Healthcare has become more economically sensitive as co-pays and deductibles and the availability of insurance have changed. Should the economy improve, you will see a bump up.”The diverging fortunes of insurers and other healthcare providers was highlighted earlier this week by the poor performance of HCA, one of the biggest US hospital chains.“While the company had favourable admissions growth during the quarter, we experienced a shift in service mix from more complex surgical cases to less acute medical cases,” said Richard Bracken, HCA’s chief executive. “This resulted in lower than anticipated revenue growth and earnings.”
41;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2011-03-23T17:31:45Z;US insurers start to feel better about healthcare;;Investors fled the US health insurance sector last year as the Obama administration sparred with insurers over soaring premiums, and debate about a government-run system raised fears the companies could be put out of business.But a year since the passage of healthcare reform, the outlook for the big US insurers has brightened, with rising stock prices, profits and dividends suggesting that those that resisted the law the most had little to worry about.“Investors are cheered that healthcare reform has turned out to be better than expected,” said Ana Gupte, a healthcare analyst at Sanford Bernstein.Share prices have risen this year. The iShares Dow Jones US Health Care exchange-traded fund is up almost 10 per cent since the beginning of January, easily outpacing the S&P 500, which has advanced by almost 3 per cent.“They [insurers] were the target of a lot of rhetoric,” said Les Funtleyder, fund manager and healthcare strategist at Miller Tabak. “What you had is depressed valuations on reform fears, combined with improving business conditions, which is a recipe for share price appreciation.”Earnings have also been robust. According to an analysis by Health Care for America Now, which backed reform, profits at five of the biggest US health insurers – United Health, WellPoint, Aetna, Cigna and Humana – rose by 17 per cent from the end of 2009 to the end of 2010, reaching a total of almost $12bn.Insurers say they have been helped by a weak economy that deterred people from seeking non-essential medical care and an unusually impotent flu season. New consumer protections that have been rolled out have so far not been as costly as some predicted.Aetna signalled its brighter outlook last month when it raised its quarterly dividend from a penny to 15 cents a share. And Joseph Zubretsky, Aetna’s chief financial officer, confirmed that sentiment in early March when he said “As reform became clear, as the economy at least settled, we became increasingly confident in our financial profile and our strategy”.Wayne DeVeydt, chief financial officer at WellPoint, said at a health care conference last week that a recovering economy and normal flu patterns could raise costs, but he acknowledged that “health care reform really plays into our sweet spot”. He said that the company would look to capitalise on ageing baby boomers and new customers entering the insurance system.According to analysts at Goldman Sachs, insurers’ longer-term view is also bright. In a note to clients, they projected earnings per share growth of 10-12 per cent until 2020, as more people become insured and fears about reform subside. Cooling political rhetoric towards the sector should also provide support.“We think the political currency for criticism of the industry is waning along with a broader recognition that the cost of health coverage is about a lot more than industry profit margins, which are quite low relative to other healthcare and non-health care sectors,” said Matthew Borsch, analyst at Goldman Sachs.But despite signs of optimism, clouds continue to hang over the health insurance sector because large portions of the reform have yet to be enacted.Ms Gupte notes that rules looming in 2014 to create state health insurance exchanges and prevent insurers from denying coverage to people who are already sick will create significant shifts in the market, with unexpected consequences. “There are some long-term headwinds that they still have to contend with,” she said.
42;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2011-02-01T03:04:22Z;Judge declares US healthcare law ‘void’;;A federal judge in Florida has ruled that the primary mechanism used by President Barack Obama’s health reform legislation to achieve universal insurance coverage is unconstitutional.Roger Vinson, a US district judge in Pensacola, ruled on Monday that the “individual mandate” requirement that nearly all US citizens buy health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty exceeded Congress’ authority.“Because the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable, the entire act must be declared void,” wrote Judge Vinson, who was appointed by Ronald Reagan. “This has been a difficult decision to reach, and I am aware that it will have indeterminable implications.”Judge Vinson sided with governors and attorneys-general from 26 US states, almost all of whom are Republicans. Since the plaintiffs represent more than half of US states, the Florida case has more prominence than some two dozen similar lawsuits filed in federal courts.The Obama administration defended the constitutionality of the health law and plans to appeal the ruling. Two other judges have rejected challenges to the individual mandate but a judge in Virginia struck down a central provision of the law in December.“We strongly disagree with the court’s ruling today and continue to believe – as other federal courts have found – that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional,” said Tracy Schmaler, justice department spokeswoman.A White House official said the administration planned to continue with implementation of the law.“We’ll continue to operate as we have previously and suspect that the states will do the same,” said the senior administration official, who asked not to be named.“Obviously this case will be appealed …and so implementation would proceed apace …This is not the last word by any means,” the official said.But the fact that the judge did not issue a stay of his ruling pending appeal by the government could threaten the application of many of the provisions of the healthcare law.Many observers expect that the US Supreme Court will make the final decision on whether the healthcare reform bill stands.The healthcare overhaul enacted last year, a contentious cornerstone of Mr Obama’s presidency, aims to expand health insurance to cover millions of uninsured Americans while also curbing costs. Administration officials insist it is needed to stem huge projected increases in healthcare costs.Judge Vinson’s ruling drew immediate strong reaction.“Healthcare reform is the law of the land and, now that Americans see its benefits, a majority of them oppose Republicans’ dangerous plans to repeal a law that put patients in control of their own healthcare,” said Harry Reid, Senate Democratic leader.Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, an influential national advocacy group that pushed for the healthcare overhaul, called Judge Vinson’s decision an example of “radical judicial activism run amok”.John Boehner, Republican House speaker, was among those who applauded Judge Vinson’s ruling. “Today’s decision affirms the view, held by most of the states and a majority of the American people, that the federal government should not be in the business of forcing you to buy health insurance and punishing you if you don’t,” he said.The National Federation of Independent Business, which claims to represent small businesses across the US and was a plaintiff in the lawsuit, also welcomed the ruling.The individual mandate is key to the law’s mission of covering more than 30m uninsured. Officials argue it is only by requiring healthy people to purchase policies that they can help pay for reforms, including a provision that individuals with pre-existing medical conditions cannot be refused coverage.Judge Vinson’s ruling comes after the US House of Representatives, with a new Republican majority, voted earlier this month to repeal the healthcare reform law. The repeal measure is unlikely to go any further since the Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to drop it.Shares of US health insurers were little changed immediately after the ruling, with UnitedHealth Group and Aetna roughly flat and WellPoint down 0.8 per cent.“This just adds to the conflicting nature of the rulings that we’ve seen so far,” said Matthew Coffina, an analyst at Morningstar. “I think everyone watching the industry at this point has been expecting the Supreme Court to ultimately decide this situation.”States involved in the lawsuit were Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Iowa, Ohio, Kansas, Maine, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

Braly, 49Nationality: AmericanCompany: WellPointSector: Healthcare equipment and servicesLocation: USThree-year TSR: -38.7%As chief executive of the largest US health insurance company by membership, Angela Braly has been in the line of fire of the Obama administration’s stuttering health reforms. One in nine Americans is covered by a WellPoint plan, and it contracts with 82 per cent of primary-care doctors and 94 per cent of hospitals. In 2009, it generated operating revenues of more than $60bn.Braly, who trained as a lawyer, joined WellPoint in 2005, and has served as its president and chief executive since 2007. She was appointed as chairwoman of the board earlier this year.Brought before a US congressional committee this year over attempts to raise insurance premiums by up to 39 per cent at a subsidiary, Braly is a battle-toughened leader. The company relented, but still increased premiums by 25 per cent. It then had to play down fourth-quarter profits of $2.7bn and the fact that Braly’s compensation was increased by 51 per cent, mainly due to larger grants of stock options totalling $10.1m.

45;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2010-11-03T20:59:10Z;US stocks rise in choppy trading;;"The financial sector helped US stocks edge higher in choppy trading after the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it would embark on a second round of quantitative easing.Stocks see-sawed after the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee said it planned to buy $600bn of bonds, more than the $500bn forecast, by the middle of next year. The purchases will be spread out and the pace will be adjusted if needed.“I think the market is struggling with what to make of it,” said Dan Cook, chief executive of IG Markets. “It had it priced in pretty well at $500bn- $1,000bn and between the FOMC and the Federal Reserve of New York, the total is $850bn-$900bn.“I think we could see a good week or two of softness. A healthy retracement would not be a bad thing.”However, Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management, said in the longer term financials, housing and the automotive sectors stood to do well out of the increased liquidity from quantitative easing, and the consumer discretionary sector could rise on hopes for economic growth.The S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,197.96, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to close at 11,1215.13 and the Nasdaq Composite ended 0.3 per cent higher at 2,540.27.The S&P 500 financials index gained 1 per cent, with Bank of America adding 1.1 per cent to $11.52, AIG gaining 3.4 per cent to $43.57 and Morgan Stanley surging 3.2 per cent to $25.40.Before the Federal Reserve’s announcement, investors shrugged off a Republican victory in the midterm elections, widely predicted to buoy markets in the longer term.Analysts at JPMorgan said healthcare, financials and technology stood to benefit most from the Republican victory in the House because reforms of healthcare and finance could be implemented in a more lenient way, and technology could benefit from the extension of the tax cuts of former president George W. Bush. They said alternative energy stocks could suffer.Elsewhere, the earnings season pressed on in a bumper week of results for the healthcare sector.WellPoint, the US health insurer with the most customers, raised its earnings forecast as it became the latest insurer to report reduced costs as people shy away from non-essential procedures.Sales fell but Angela Braly, chief executive, said that enrolment would increase “slightly” next year. The shares edged 0.5 per cent higher to $56.05.Profit at Aetna, another health insurer, jumped 52 per cent and the company also raised its full-year guidance. Its shares rose
2.9 per cent to $30.84.CVS Caremark rose 1.1 per cent to $30.87 after reporting its quarterly results. The largest provider of prescription drugs in the US said profit fell 20 per cent, missing analyst estimates, after lower sales in its pharmacy benefits management division.Time Warner beat analyst expectations and raised its forecast for the full year. An advertising recovery helped buoy profits at the owner of cable networks, including CNN and TNT, and magazines such as Time and People.Revenue from Warner Brothers was flat as strong sales for the film Inception were outweighed by a more tepid reception for last year’s The Hangover and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. In spite of this, shares in Time Warner slid 1.1 per cent to $32.07.Molson Coors reported a stronger quarterly profit, helped by higher beer prices and cost savings. The brewer, which makes Coors Light and Blue Moon beers, rose 3.9 per cent to $49.08. MillerCoors, the company’s joint venture with SABMiller, said net income rose 37 per cent in the third quarter, also helped by prices offsetting soft volumes in the US market.In financials, insurer Hartford Financial Services Group raised its profit
estimate for this year after it focused on its core markets. The insurer also benefited from impairments and losses in its investment portfolio returning to pre-crisis levels. Its shares soared 9.2 per cent to $25.57.Homebuilder Pulte Group sunk 7.7 per cent to $7.45 after it reported a wider-than-expected loss."
46;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2010-11-02T16:56:04Z;Investors gauge election bounce;;Even though Republicans, touting business-friendly policies, appear set to take control of the US House of Representatives from Democrats, analysts are far from certain about the potential for a positive bounce for the US stock market.Historically, US markets have performed extremely well in the fourth quarter of a midterm year, following the typical loss of seats for the president’s party in the midterm election.The S&P 500 index has not made a total return of less than 10 per cent in such a quarter since 1950, according to figures from LPL Financial. UBS research shows that the year after a midterm, the S&P 500 sees a median price increase of nearly 20 per cent.Stock markets tend to prize political gridlock, believing fewer new regulations will emerge and less government deficit spending will keep borrowing rates low. A study by Fidelity Investments found that large-cap stocks saw average price gains of 23 per cent during the four periods of gridlock – a split in party control of the White House and both houses of Congress – since 1970.Some of those gains will already be priced in, however, in part because gridlock to some degree has been the rule in Washington since Democrats lost their 60th vote in the Senate. Only a surprise Republican seizure of the Senate could be a near-term catalyst for further gridlock-led gains.Other factors will also limit the effect. The largest looming change resulting from increased clout for the Republicans – an agreement to extend the Bush tax cuts, which would lower government revenues by $500bn, according to the Congressional Budget Office – will probably not be resolved to the market’s satisfaction by the election.“The changes may not be permanent,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. “A one-year extension of current tax rates may not be as welcome as a [permanent] resolution of the tax rate uncertainty.”A report on deficits by a bipartisan committee set for December could be a much more important event for clarity on tax cuts, analysts said, as a recommendation to extend would provide cover for Democrats who may face frustration from their own base if they agree to cuts.If such changes do come to pass, higher-yielding stocks could rally as investors look to take advantage of the extended tax break to pocket dividends.“High dividend-paying sectors such as telecoms and utilities may benefit. Cash-rich companies in other sectors may also benefit as they introduce or substantially increase their dividend payout as they look to attract a new class of investors seeking yield,” said Mr Kleintop.Many strategists have argued that the S&P 500 index has been discounted in 2010 due to uncertainty created by the tax expiration, heavier regulation and deficit spending. The S&P has risen just 6 per cent so far this year, even as earnings-per-share are projected to increase 35 per cent this year.Thomas Doerflinger, strategist at UBS, termed recent policies such as healthcare reform, financial regulation, a Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium and the tax rises likely to follow from deficit spending, “the Great Suppression”.“It should be positive for equities if the 2010 elections begin a policy shift toward lower taxes, less spending, and lighter regulation,” he said.He warned, however, that the Republican victory would not represent an immediate reversal of the “Great Suppression”. He said he was watching for a “tax holiday” on a repatriation of foreign earnings, which could signal a significant shift in the balance of power.Economists at RBS warned that a sizable victory may also raise expectations of Republican victory in the 2012 presidential election, and could hinder the economy over the next two years.“Hopes of a more business-friendly fiscal agenda, if the Republicans sweep both the presidency and Congress in 2012, could keep companies from aggressively hiring and capital spending near-term,” said Michelle Girard and Omair Sharif of RBS.The circumstances of this election are also historically unique, coming on the eve of what is expected to be a massive intervention by the US Federal Reserve in the form of “quantitative easing”.Bruce Bittles, equity strategist at Robert W. Baird, said the expected election result would not be a strong catalyst itself, instead only raising the relative importance of the Fed as an economic actor.“If we get political gridlock in Washington, as expected, the Federal Reserve will be the one left with any ability to provide stimulus to the economy,” he said.Economists at Société Générale suggested that changing course could unravel the gains seen as “QE2” has been priced in, and from a cheap dollar powering global revenues at multinational groups.“New fiscal stimulus, more likely [if the Democrats retain significant power], could prove potent, particularly when combined with further monetary easing,” they said. “The increased presence of conservatives could lead to premature fiscal tightening, which would be a negative for the economy, and risky assets.”The economy is also not in a typical position. In the 1980s and 1990s, gridlock was prized because it was not to going to upset already strong growth. The 1994 Republican sweep into power in Congress saw the S&P 500 index return 30 per cent in the fourth quarter of that year.The poorest showing for the market after a midterm election was in 1978, when inflation was rampant and investors were frustrated that the government was not cutting spending faster. The S&P rose 12 per cent.In an environment with high unemployment and deflation, gridlock may similarly not be as valuable to the market.Richard Soultanian of Nus Consulting, who advises companies on financial decisions, said: “Gridlock can be a positive when the country’s underlying economy and fiscal situation are in good order. Today this is not the case …The act of doing nothing will hamper the global economic recovery rather than accelerating it.”

Unconventional oil and gas drilling in key North American basins boosted quarterly profits.Larger rivals Halliburton and Schlumberger have also reported better than expected earnings on the back of strength in onshore drilling.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, upgraded the energy sector to “market weight”.“Based on our models, earnings growth, margins, return on equity and cash flow for energy have improved markedly in the past several quarters, while valuations remain quite reasonable,” he said.“Our work indicates that the sector typically begins to perform well once earnings growth becomes positive. September 2010 was the first positive reading since 2008.”Cabot Oil & Gas soared 4.1 per cent to $30.16 and Anadarko Petroleum gained 2.6 per cent to $63.16.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,184.38, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,124.62 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent lower at 2,504.84.Investors eagerly anticipated Tuesday and Wednesday’s meeting of the Federal Reserve’s open market committee, when many expect the central bank to resolve to deploy a second round of quantitative easing. They also expected a swing to the Republicans in the midterm elections on Tuesday.But analysts at JPMorgan said that although the outcomes of the FOMC meeting and the US midterms should help support stocks in the near term, the longer-term sustainability of the equity rally will rely on growth.“It is encouraging that the third-quarter reporting season has delivered another positive surprise in earnings growth, for the seventh quarter in a row,” they said.“[But in 2011] companies will have to rely more on revenues to generate earnings surprises.

48;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T07:29:19+0000;Half a million denied health coverage;;The four largest health insurance companies in the US denied coverage to more than half a million individuals because of their pre-existing conditions from 2007 to 2009, according to a congressional investigation.On average, the four companies – Aetna, Humana, UnitedHealth Group and WellPoint – denied one out of seven applicants’ coverage based on conditions such as pregnancy, angina, diabetes and heart disease.The investigation found that the number of people who were denied coverage increased about 49 per cent from 2007 to 2009. In that period, the groups refused to pay 212,800 claims for individuals who were already insured based on their previous medical conditions.New revelations about the extent of denials based on pre-existing conditions comes at a crucial time for Democratic lawmakers. Many of them have come under pressure in the lead up to the November mid-term elections because of their support for President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law, which was passed by Democrats in Congress in March.Polls show that roughly 50 per cent of voters disapprove of the wide-ranging new law. But one of the most universally popular provisions – which will not take effect until 2014 – makes it illegal for insurance groups to deny an individual coverage based on a person’s health status or pre-existing condition. Democrats have argued that the provision is economically feasible because the new law also includes a mandate forcing every individual to be covered, one of the least popular aspects of the bill.Republican candidates for Congress have vowed to “repeal and replace” the healthcare law, but keep the new provision on pre-existing conditions. They have not, however, explained how they would extend coverage to those individuals without a broader mandate.The congressional investigation by Democrats on the House energy and commerce committee was initiated shortly before the landmark vote on healthcare reform, when Congressman Henry Waxman, chairman of the committee, asked each of the companies for extensive information about their denial policies. Each of the companies complied with the request.The congressional probe found that each company saw its policy on pre-existing conditions as a key area of growth. For example, internal documents by a company that was not identified by the committee showed that executives were considering practices such as denying payments for drugs related to pre-existing conditions and linking additional claims to pre-existing condition exclusions as ways to limit the amount of money the company had to pay for claims.Although the committee found that a total of 651,000 individuals were denied insurance coverage in the individual market between 2007 and 2009, investigators said the number was likely “significantly higher” because the figure did not include individuals who were discouraged from applying for coverage by insurance agents. The four companies covered about 2.8m people in the individual market in 2009.In some cases, the denials were issued without review. A memo circulated by one unidentified company in 2006 listed 14 medical categories that did not require review, including: any woman who was pregnant or had been treated for infertility within five years.
49;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2010-06-03T03:19:16Z;Top US groups warned over pension assets;;Some of the top companies in the US, including General Electric and Citigroup, have more than 20 per cent of their pension portfolios invested in hard-to-value “level 3” assets, according to a new report.Of the 279 S&P 500 companies analysed by Credit Suisse, 12 per cent of their portfolios, or $127bn, were tied up in “level 3” assets. About 24 companies have more than 20 per cent of their funds committed to the assets.The term “level 3” is used to flag up assets – often hedge fund, private equity and real estate investments – that are not regularly traded and whose prices are determined using models. As a result, valuations are hard to confirm and assets can be illiquid, said David Zion, the report’s author.Shareholders bear the responsibility of plugging any shortfalls in pension funds that may arise from incorrect valuations or sudden demands for cash, Mr Zion noted.Companies with the largest exposures to “level 3” assets as a percentage of pension assets include industrials, materials and telecoms companies, with Weyerhaeuser, Questar Corp, WellPoint, Northeast Utilities and ITT Corp topping the list.Those five companies had between 43 per cent and 88 per cent of their pension funds invested in “level 3” assets at the end of 2009.Other companies with more than 20 per cent of their pension portfolios invested in “level 3” assets include GE, Citi, Verizon and Eli Lilly, according to Credit Suisse.The detailed information on pension assets is available because of new disclosure requirements that came into effect at the end of 2009. Credit Suisse analysed 279 S&P 500 companies that have reported under the new rules.To explain the risks, Mr Zion points to Weyerhaeuser, a wood products company. In 2008 and 2009 it downsized, creating a spike in lump sum retirement payments as some funds were increasing their lock-up periods.Eventually Weyerhaeuser was forced to lend $285m to its pension plans in order “to avoid liquidating assets at depressed prices”, it said in a regulatory filing. By the end of 2009 the pension fund had repaid $139m.Weyerhauser declined to comment on its pension strategy but it has since changed its benefit rules. Retirees can no longer take lump sum pay-outs. Instead they can ask for seven equal annual installments.In its filings Eli Lilly noted that “given the long-term nature of our US liabilities, the US plans have the flexibility to manage an above average degree of risk in the asset portfolios.”ITT said it has a sophisticated pension management team, has had no liquidity issues and carefully monitors valuations – comments echoed by Verizon.Questar said its assets were mainly in equities but were classified as “level 3” because of the type of investment vehicle it uses.GE said its pension plan has a “broadly diversified portfolio of investments,” and that “prudent, long-term management” helps it weather cycles. Citi said its plan is appropriately liquid and well-funded.Experts say “level 3” assets can work when managed well, providing better returns and diversification while reducing volatility.Over the last two decades, ITT’s pension assets have returned over 11.5 per cent every year, while Weyerhaeuser has produced a 15.3 per cent net compounded annual return.Mr Zion says investors should be alert to pension risk. “Investors need to ask, are they willing to pay to take on that kind of risk? In a lot of cases investors would say no.”

However, much of this impact has already been priced into the sector.”More broadly, he said, the healthcare bill may turn out to be a catalyst for a potential 5-10 per cent stock market decline due to the impact of higher taxation. “The potential negative outcome for the broader market stems from the tax and deficit impacts of the legislation.”The S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,165.81, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.4 per cent at 10,785.89 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.9 per cent at 2,395.40.Standard & Poor’s healthcare sector index outperformed the broader market, climbing 9.2 per cent.

55;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Insurers face ‘pre-existing conditions’ probe;;Democratic lawmakers have launched a probe into one of the most controversial practices of US health insurance companies – the denial of coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions – as part of an endgame push to bolster their case for insurance reform.Henry Waxman, chairman of the House energy committee, also asked chief executives from United Health, Humana, Aetna and WellPoint, to testify before his committee on March 23 about their policies for individuals with preexisting conditions.If Democrats ultimately move to vote on healthcare reform, it is expected to occur before the Easter break. Lobbyists on Tuesday said the timing of Mr Waxman’s hearing showed that he was seeking to focus attention on an extremely popular provision of proposed healthcare reform, which would guarantee coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions, just days before a potentially contentious vote.Americans overwhelmingly support the idea of forcing insurance companies to cover people who have previously been ill, according to analysts at Pew Research. According to a survey conducted in October, 82 per cent of respondents supported measures guaranteeing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, even though the majority of voters disapproved of healthcare legislation in its entirety.Mr Waxman has also asked the companies to provide his committee with documents dating back to 2005 that detail their policies on insurance claims or coverage denials based on pre-existing conditions.The requests includes all internal communications and e-mails between senior corporate management, presentations to management and government agencies, training materials for insurance brokers and agents, and documents showing the total number of denials related to pre-existing conditions during the past five years.The insurance industry’s chief lobby group on Tuesday said the House probe was part of a consistent effort by Democrats to shift the focus to the insurance industry in the lead-up to a potential vote by the House on a reform bill that it staunchly opposes.A spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans said the industry would support legislation that forced the insurance industry to cover individuals with preexisting conditions if it also contained a mandate to force individuals to buy insurance, which current proposals do not.WellPoint, one of the companies Mr Waxman is targeting, has already come under fire over its attempt to increase premiums by as much as 39 per cent, even as it has made billions of dollars in profits and taken executives out on lavish retreats.The rate increases, which were publicised last month, could not have come at a better time for the Obama administration and Democrats on Capitol Hill, who seized on the issue as a prime example of why the insurance industry requires reform.WellPoint and Humana said they were reviewing Mr Waxman’s request. United Health and Aetna did not return calls.

Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
57;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T07:29:19+0000;WellPoint under fire for insurance price hikes;;Angela Braly, WellPoint chief executive, came under fire from a US congressional committee on Wednesday over the health insurer’s attempt to hike premiums by as much as 39 per cent while reaping billions in profit and enjoying lavish executive retreats.Ms Braly, who runs the biggest US health insurance company by membership, is under pressure because of soaring rate increases at Anthem Blue Cross, a California subsidiary, that were set to take effect next month. The increases have drawn public ire amid the healthcare reform debate and have come to symbolise why the system is broken.“Raising our premiums is not something we wanted to do,” Ms Braly said in prepared remarks.Calling the increases “unfortunate”, Ms Braly blamed the rising cost of medical care, an ageing population and that young people are reducing insurance coverage because of the weak economy, raising prices for othersWellPoint was placed in the position of playing down its $2.7bn fourth-quarter profits and explaining why the costs of its services far exceed inflation. Ms Braly argued the 39 per cent increase was being mischaracterised because it only reflects rate hikes for individuals purchasing their most expensive package and accounts for the impact of ageing. Meanwhile, she said the company’s profits were in line with, or weaker than, most of its competitors.Henry Waxman, the California Democrat who heads the committee, scolded WellPoint executives for spending $27m on retreats in 2007 and 2008. Mr Waxman also revealed internal documents that the company was asked to hand over which showed WellPoint pushing customers into “less generous” plans and inflating premiums to give them a bigger cushion for negotiating and making concessions.Attention fell on Anthem earlier this month after a consumer backlash against the increases. According to the Center for American Progress Action Fund, WellPoint is trying to impose double-digit rate increases in 11 US states this year.
58;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2010-02-24T19:07:03Z;Anthem business model under fire;;Until a few weeks ago Mark Weiss was treating the well-heeled feet of a loyal group of patients from a practice he has owned for more than 40 years. But a recent jump in premiums by Anthem Blue Cross, the largest health insurance group in California, turned the mild-mannered Los Angeles podiatrist into a crusading advocate for healthcare reform.With Anthem increasing rates by as much as 39 per cent for some customers, he has launched a “Throw the bums out” campaign on the Huffington Post website. “At my practice we’re seeing decreasing reimbursements and increasing premiums [for our patients],” he told the FT. “It’s outrageous . . . Patients are paying more and getting less.”About 800,000 people will be affected by the increase – one in 10 of the group’s customers in California. Anthem told state officials this week the increase was “appropriate” and “consistent” with the law. It has blamed the rise on the recession, saying its costs have risen as younger, healthier people opt out of health insurance coverage to save money. This, it says, has left ageing customers who need more expensive treatment.Washington has jumped on the rate increase to shift the debate on healthcare reform away from arguments about universal coverage towards a discussion about curbing insurance costs.For Dr Weiss, the increase has been felt in his practice, where a third of his patients are Anthem customers, and in his private life as an Anthem policyholder. He was recently treated for kidney cancer and is unable to get insurance elsewhere because his illness now counts as a pre-existing condition. The annual premium for the doctor and his wife recently jumped 35 per cent, from $20,184 to $27,336.“It’s just not right,” he said, pointing to the $2.7bn (£1.8bn, €2bn) in profit earned by WellPoint, Anthem’s owner, in the most recent quarter. “They are reducing the things we can do for our patients. Their business model is ‘deny, deny, deny’.”The doctor may have found a supporter in Barack Obama. In his weekly online and radio address, the US president said the “bottom line is that the status quo is good for the insurance industry and bad for America. Over the past year, as families and small business owners have struggled to pay soaring healthcare costs, and as millions of Americans lost their coverage, the five largest insurers made record profits of over $12bn.”The Anthem rate increase has also sparked a political storm in California, where 6.6m people do not have health insurance – more than any other US state.Politicians from both sides of the political divide have lined up to attack the company: Steve Poizner, California’s insurance commissioner – and one of the Republicans hoping to replace Arnold Schwarz-enegger as governor – said this week that consumer complaints filed against Anthem Blue Cross’s claims-handling practices had uncovered more than 700 violations of state law. The maximum penalty for each violation is $10,000, if the action was found to be wilful.“From a failure to respond when the department of insurance requested information, to investigate complaints to misrepresenting the facts to consumers, these are serious violations,” Mr Poizner said.WellPoint said the alleged violations represented a “small fraction” of the millions of claims the company processed each year.Although California can investigate the handling of claims by insurers, it lacks the power to stop those companies from charging more for its premiums.Dianne Feinstein, one of the state’s Democratic senators, said this week she planned to introduce nationwide legislation that would curb “egregious premium rate increases, like the one recently announced by Anthem Blue Cross”.The rate change would place “a huge burden on people who are already struggling in these tough economic times”, she added.
59;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2010-02-22T20:20:16Z;Obamacare battle looms;US president places bets on healthcare;Until the Democrats’ stunning electoral setback in Massachusetts, Barack Obama held what seemed an unbeatable hand in his healthcare poker game. Having put too many political chips on the table to be ready to fold, he is instead going all-in ahead of Thursday’s televised healthcare summit.Taking the reins, Mr Obama on Monday laid out what a spokesman called an “opening bid” to craft a deal. A take-it-or-leave-it approach sank Hillarycare 15 years ago, but this administration has actual legislation to work with. Republicans know Mr Obama could make the existing Senate bill law by promising House Democrats to amend it later in “reconciliation” only requiring a simple Senate majority. Mr Obama’s proposal represents this compromise, giving every state the subsidy on Medicaid costs used to win one Nebraska senator’s vote, and temporarily softening the blow from the excise tax on pricey healthcare schemes, extending a deal previously offered only to union members.The only new element to the plan, and a controversial one, is creating a body to control insurance premiums. The president seized on a proposed 39 per cent increase for some of insurer Wellpoint’s California customers last week to introduce this angle. It will be dangerous for Republicans to oppose the populist proposal, but Mr Obama’s outrage is disingenuous. As the insurer has explained in a letter to the Obama administration, it has to cover an ever less attractive risk pool in California. Existing law does too little to eliminate this actuarial anomaly, and ignores most factors that make healthcare costs so high.But the looming battle concerns politics, not economics. Mr Obama’s position is strong, though no longer strong enough to outsource Obamacare to congressional allies. He is placing the bets now and Republicans must be very careful about calling his bluff.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially

Shares in the software company – considered the sector’s bellwether – rose 1.8 per cent to $134.14. Last week, Intel reported revenues and profits sharply above analysts’ expectations and gave an optimistic forecast for the first quarter, citing improving demand for electronic goods in the recovery. The shares were up 1.2 per cent at $21.05.However, shares in Google initially fell after the group announced it had postponed the launch of two mobile phones in China. Last week, the company threatened to quit China following suspected cyberattacks, raising fears of a deterioration in the country’s trade relations with the US. However, the shares ended 1.3 per cent up at $587.62 in anticipation of good results from the search engine this week.Elsewhere, Alcatel-Lucent, the world’s largest supplier of fixed-line phone networks, fell 3 per cent to $3.61 after Unicredit cut the stock to “sell” from “hold”. Analysts said the group could suffer from increased competition from China’s Huawei, the country’s largest telecoms provider.After climbing steadily higher, the S&P 500 closed at the highest level since October last year, having risen 1.25 per cent to 1,150.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1 per cent to 10,725.43 and the Nasdaq was 1.4 per cent higher at 2,320.40.Wall Street had initially opened lower after results from Citigroup unsettled the market.Citigroup reported a fourth-quarter loss of $7.6bn after its decision to repay government bail-out funds put an end to its run of three consecutive profitable quarters. The results were broadly in line with expectations but the shares, which lost more than 50 per cent last year, dipped in and out of the red as investors picked through the details. The stock was later up 3.5 per cent at $3.54.Last Friday, JPMorgan reported higher profits than Wall Street had been expecting but the shares fell sharply because of to concerns over rising loan losses. JPMorgan was down again on Tuesday, falling 0.9 per cent to $43.28.Shares in Kraft Foods fell 0.6 per cent to $29.41 after the consumer group finally agreed to a revised deal to buy Cadbury for about $19.6bn.The agreement follows months of hostile relations after Kraft made an unsolicited bid for the British confectioner last August.Fast-food chains were also in focus after Credit Suisse adjusted its ratings on the sector. McDonald’s rose 1.9 per cent to $63.48 after analysts raised the stock to “outperform” from “neutral”.However, Burger King was cut to “neutral” from “outperform”, sending its shares down 2.7 per cent
to $18.00."
61;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2009-10-30T19:00:28Z;US health insurers;;When the US congressional debate on healthcare heated up in June, Barack Obama’s chief of staff said the only non-negotiable point was success. “Everything else is negotiable.” One could have interpreted this statement as bravado or an acknowledgement that the administration’s blueprint might look quite different once 535 members of Congress and countless lobbyists finished with it. The latter is evident in the still-evolving versions of legislation.For the managed-care companies at the centre of the US’s health system, political horse-trading has sent their shares gyrating. Pressure for legislative “success” this year may produce a bill that leaves them paying punishing fees and insuring riskier patients, but probably not out of business. Even in their worst case, a full public option, the axe might not fall until 2013. But insurers’ shares are pricing in a high probability of disaster. Analysts at Barclays Capital found that the sector’s downside is limited to perhaps 10 to 15 per cent, because the tangible book value and cumulative cash flow from operations until 2013 leave many insurers trading near, or in some cases below, their liquidation value.Since the beginning of 2008, a group of managed-care stocks in the S&P 500 have lost 52 per cent of their value, or twice as much as the underlying index. The six largest insurers remain the priciest of the bunch, but even they trade at a mere 40 per cent premium to 2013 breakup value. Employer-centric Wellpoint is the priciest and Medicare-dependent Humana the cheapest, reflecting relative risks.A more realistic scenario is that most insurers survive in some form under Obamacare but see their profitability curtailed. Even if cash flows are cut in half ad infinitum after 2013 and never grow with inflation, the six large insurers still might be one-third undervalued today.

The discovery potentially opens up a new, 1,100 km-wide, multi-billion-barrel oil frontier in west Africa.Shares in the Texas-based company rose 9.6 per cent to $64.85. ConocoPhillips also gained 1 per cent to $46.79 and Chevron rose 1.1 per cent to $72.45 after optimism seeped across the rest of the sector.Higher petrol costs pushed up the consumer price index and US industrial production in August for the second consecutive month, adding to investor hopes that a recovery was under way.While the consumer price index was higher than expected, the core CPI was in line with forecasts and helped to calm investor concerns over inflation. Following an afternoon rally, all of the leading indices closed up more than 1 per cent, notching up three straight days of gains. The S&P 500 climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,068.76, closing at its highest level since October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.1 per cent at 9,791.71, while the Nasdaq rose 1.5 per cent to 2,133.15.Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams, said the market had also broken through significant levels. “Now there’s really no resistance,” he said. “Overseas markets were all up across the board and it just continued over here. Economic news this morning was also better, from the CPI to the industrial production numbers.”Financial stocks added to the gains from the energy sector. Citigroup rebounded after falling nearly 9 per cent on Tuesday. After reports that the government might offload its 34 per cent stake in the bank, it emerged late on Tuesday that Citi had also raised $5bn in government-guaranteed bonds. The move to tap the emergency facility just before it expires could complicate attempts to persuade the government to reduce its stake. The shares rose 1.9 per cent to $4.20. Genworth Financial also pushed the sector higher, gaining 9.1 per cent to $13.14 a day after it priced a common share offering.Other stocks in the sector also climbed on optimism about economic recovery. Wednesday’s positive data added to comments by Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, on Tuesday that the US recession was “very likely over”. Bank of America was up 2.7 per cent at $17.25 and JPMorgan rose 3.4 per cent to $44.65.The materials sector also contributed to the market advance as commodity prices gained momentum and gold approached an 18-month high. Alcoa rose 3.4 per cent to $14.47, after closing 8.1 per cent higher at $13.99 on Tuesday.Deal news lifted sentiment. Adobe Systems said on Tuesday it was buying Omniture, the ad-measurement company, for $1.8bn in an effort to diversify as its core software business declines. The all-cash deal will allow Adobe to embed Omniture’s measurement services into the web content that designers create with its software. Adobe fell 6.4 per cent to $33.35 while Omniture soared 26.3 per cent to $21.88.Bank of America analysts upgraded Amazon.com to “buy” from “neutral”, who said the world’s biggest online retailer would be able to maintain its position ahead of rivals. The shares rose 8.6 per cent to $90.70.Verizon Communications dragged the telecoms services index into negative territory after UBS downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy”. Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $30.41.Healthcare stocks also came under scrutiny after Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the Senate finance committee, unveiled the long-awaited bill on healthcare reform. Wellpoint rose 3.2 per cent to $54.86 and UnitedHealth gained 5.7 per cent to $29.29.In other news, Pilgrim’s Pride, the biggest maker of chicken products in the US, agreed to sell a 64 per cent stake to Brazilian meat producer JBS for $800m. Shares in the company, which is expected to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, rose 10.2 per cent to $5.53.

General Electric climbed 4.2 per cent to $16, while Alcoa rose 8.1 per cent to $13.99. Rising commodity prices have helped power Wall Street’s rally over the past two weeks.The S&P closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,052.63. The Nasdaq rose 0.5 per cent to 2,102.64, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent at 9,683.41.Retail sales had initially given investors confidence. In August, sales rose by the most in more than three years, boosted by the cash-for-clunkers car buying programme and signs of extra spending by consumers.In other data, the New York Federal Reserve Bank said that its “Empire State” manufacturing activity index rose in September to 18.88 from 12.08 in August.Technology stocks also pushed the market higher from the opening bell. Ebay was up 1.3 per cent at $24.14 after Piper Jaffray upgraded the shares of the online auctioneer. Also on the upgrade list was Yahoo, which was raised to “outperform” from “market perform” by Sanford C. Bernstein. The stock was up 5.4 per cent at $16.41.But consumer stocks dragged the indices into the red for brief periods during the day and continued to limit gains.Kroger, the supermarket chain, was one of the worst casualties in the consumer sector. The shares fell 7.5 per cent to $20.46 after the group posted second-quarter profit below estimates and reduced its full-year outlook. The company, which also operates Ralphs and Food 4 Less stores, has come under pressure to slash its prices in the recession to compete with low-price competitors such as Wal-Mart.Shares of rival Safeway also fell 3.6 per cent to $19.48 after the results
from Kroger, while Supervalu slipped 3.6 per cent to $15.73.Best Buy, the consumer electronics chain, also hit confidence in the sector after the retailer said second-quarter profit fell 22 per cent to $158m. The shares fell 5.2 per cent to $38.32.Johnson & Johnson said it would reduce by $115m to $885m the amount it would pay for an 18.4 per cent stake in Elan. The revised terms of the deal are designed to appease a dispute between Elan and Biogen, its US partner. Shares in Johnson & Johnson were down 0.3 per cent at $60.15.Financial stocks also led the market lower initially. It emerged that Citigroup was exploring options to facilitate a sale of the government’s 34 per cent stake in the troubled financial giant. Citi fell 8.9 per cent to $4.12. Shares in Citi closed at $4.52 on Monday, up from a low of $2.31 in March.The US authorities received more than 7bn shares in the troubled financial group at $3.25 each, after converting $25bn of preferred stock into common equity at the end of July. The share exchange boosted Citi’s ratio of tangible common equity to assets, providing it with a greater buffer of loss-absorbing capital.Bank of America lost 1.2 per cent to $16.79 and JPMorgan slipped 1.3 per cent to $43.19. After reporting increases in credit-card write-offs, Discover Financial Services fell in early trading but closed up 0.8 per cent to $15.14.Healthcare stocks took another battering as President Barack Obama reiterated his plans to curb medical expenses through sector reform. UnitedHealth fell 3.7 per cent to $27.70 and WellPoint dropped 1.8 per cent to $53.16.Kraft also came back into focus after its recent take-over bid for Cadbury.

But light trading volume suggested investors were reluctant to commit themselves after analysts had predicted equities would fall after the summer’s rally.“After a huge run over the last couple of days, the market is a bit overbought so everybody is waiting for a pull-back,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.After the oil price sunk back below the psychologically significant $70 level, stocks erased their early gains. The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,042.73 points after gaining 2.6 per cent this week.The Nasdaq fell 0.2 per cent to 2,080.90 points but it has still outperformed the other indices in recent sessions and was up 3.1 per cent for the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to end the session at 9,605.41 and was up this week by 1.7 per cent.After leading the market higher this week, technology stocks deteriorated throughout the day. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, lost 1.3 per cent to $19.51 even after an upgrade from Roth Capital.In spite of posting better first-quarter results than had been expected, National Semiconductor fell 5.9 per cent to $15.03. The chipmaker’s shares have risen 30 per cent since the beginning of July after investors bet on a sector recovery.Garmin, the maker of GPS products, rose 0.3 per cent to $36.18 after a recommendation from Bank of America.But Cree, a maker of light-emitting diodes, weighed on the sector after it announced on Thursday that it would place 11m shares in a common stock offering. Its shares fell 5.2 per cent to $34.83.After strong performances in the week, the energy and materials sector also dragged the market down but industrial stocks stayed strong.

The figure was down from 570,000 in the previous week and better than economists’ forecasts of 560,000.A strong Treasury auction also relieved concerns about the US deficit.Uncertainty lingered over President Obama’s address to Congress on Wednesday evening, during which he appealed for a bipartisan reform of the healthcare system, but health insurance stocks reacted well.After recent losses, WellPoint rose 2.5 per cent to $54.18, while Unitedhealth Group also gained 2.5 per cent to $29.11.The US president said that under his plan, it would be illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition or cancel coverage due to sickness, and that they would also be required to cover routine check-ups and preventive care.The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent up at its high for the day of 1,044.14, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,627.48.After five straight days of gains, the market hit fresh highs since last October.

Its shares fell back 0.6 per cent to $60.90 after early gains.But the materials sector continued to weigh on market sentiment, after pushing the indices into negative territory in early trading. Shares in Monsanto, the world’s biggest seed company, slid 5 per cent to $79.30 after the company forecast earnings below estimates. It said trading in its herbicide business had suffered due to oversupply in the market.The utilities index also pushed the market lower, after spending most of the past three weeks in negative territory.Ameren fell 2.8 per cent to $25.35 after the power company said it planned to offer 19m common shares to raise cash for investment in its subsidiaries.

68;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2009-07-27T21:11:48Z;Aetna second-quarter profits plunge;;"Rising commercial medical costs hit second-quarter profits at Aetna, the US health insurer, which on Monday reported a 28 per cent drop in net income and cut its outlook for the year.The company’s results, which fell far below analysts’ estimates, were because of slimmer-than- expected Medicare revenues and higher costs resulting from more insurance claims and medical visits.Shares of Aetna declined by 2.72 per cent to $25.72 in New York.“We continue to see upward pressure on medical costs beyond what we projected in early June, which we believe is driven in part by changing provider be­hav­iour in the face of a deep recession,” said Ronald Williams, Aetna’s chief executive.A person close to the matter said the company was considering a sale of its in-house pharmacy benefits management unit in the wake of rival WellPoint’s $4.7bn sale of its own PBM operation to ExpressScripts.The business, which manages prescriptions and performs other pharmacy-
related services for insured patients, has been on the table for months. Medco, which narrowly lost out on buying WellPoint’s PBM, is seen as the most likely buyer.Much of the asset’s value, however, will hinge on whether important customers agree to long-term service contracts that remain effective after the business changes hands.Net income at Aetna was $346.6m, or 77 cents a share, compared with $480.5, or
97 cents, in the same period a year ago. Revenues climbed 10 per cent to $8.7bn in the second quarter on higher premiums and membership rates.The company’s results come as the US government is wrestling with a contentious overhaul to its healthcare system, which includes the possibility of a public health insurer operating in the private sphere. Many insurers see this as a threat but Aetna’s president said this month that a public entity could help keep the private sector competitive.The Connecticut-based company said it would take “appropriate actions” to deal with rising commercial medical costs, including adjusting its prices and ensuring better medical management and provider contracting.Aetna cut its 2009 earnings outlook to a range of $2.75-$2.90 from an earlier projection of $3.55-$3.70."
69;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2009-04-13T19:23:18Z;Express Scripts buys WellPoint unit for $4.7bn;;Express Scripts said on Monday that it would buy the pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business of WellPoint for $4.68bn, in a deal that will boost Express Scripts’ purchasing power by making it the second-largest US drug benefits manager in terms of prescriptions processed.Express Scripts will pay $3.28bn in cash, with the rest of the price paid in stock, to WellPoint, a top US health insurer that provides benefits under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand.As a key component of the deal, Express Scripts has secured a contract to manage the drug benefits of WellPoint’s insurance customers for 10 years. WellPoint processes prescriptions for a range of insurers, but its own customers account for most of its volume.The Financial Times reported in early March that WellPoint had set up an auction to sell the business, which is largely comprised of a unit called NextRx that processes drug claims and helps establish drug prices and availability.Express Scripts’ main competitors are a diverse group. Most other PBMs are either owned by retail pharmacies, such as CVS Caremark, Walgreen and Rite Aid, or contained within insurers including Aetna, Cigna and UnitedHealth. However, Medco, its larger rival, ­operates as an independent company.Some PBMs, including Medco, were owned by large drug companies in the 1990s until questions over the propriety of such arrangements helped spur the drug giants to sell the operations.Express Scripts faced competition for the asset, said one person close to the matter, who said Medco, CVS Caremark and Walgreen were likely to have been interested. But WellPoint felt Express Scripts provided the best cultural fit for a long-term alliance and was the ideal buyer.“We think M&A opportunities often come about when you go through experiences like we are now, where there’s uncertainty,” Angela Braly, WellPoint’s chief executive, told investors and analysts on Monday, in reference to changes that may lie ahead for the US healthcare system under the new Obama administration.“We considered several PBM strategies and determined that we could provide the best long-term value to our members and our shareholders by selling our pharmacy entities [and entering an alliance with Express Scripts],” Ms Braly said.Industry dealmakers expect other insurers that own PBMs to also consider carving them out or outsourcing more of the work.WellPoint said it will use $2bn of the sale proceeds for additional share repurchases, $1.8bn to account for taxes and transaction costs, and $500m to pay down debt. It expected to book a $2.5bn gain on the sale of the asset.
70;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2009-03-05T01:20:02Z;WellPoint’s benefits business up for auction;;WellPoint, the second-largest US health insurer by revenue, has put its pharmacy benefits management business up for auction, say ­people familiar with the ­matter.A sale of WellPoint’s PBM business could be worth anywhere from less than $1bn to five times that amount, depending on the extent to which WellPoint and other insurers are willing to sign long-term customer contracts with any potential buyer, said one person close to the process.WellPoint, which has 35m medical members and provides insurance under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand, says its PBM business, which includes ­NextRx, is the fourth-largest in the US.NextRx is a third-party administrator that processes prescription drug claims and helps establish drug prices and availability for more than 32m people who are insured through Blue Cross Blue Shield or other corporate and government employee health plans.The three dominant companies in prescription healthcare services – ExpressScripts, Medco and CVS Caremark – are independent, free-standing companies.Several others are embedded within managed care providers such as WellPoint, Aetna, Cigna and UnitedHealth, the largest US health insurer.WellPoint paid 67.5m ­prescriptions in the fourth quarter of last year, an increase of 5.6 per cent from the same period a year earlier.Its PBM business is likely to attract interest from CVS Caremark, Medco and ExpressScripts, and the sale process has been under way for months, according to people close to the matter.WellPoint did not have any immediate comment.Expectations have risen that insurers with in-house PBMs might consider selling them or spinning them off as the political and economic environment surrounding the healthcare industry grows more challenging.Shares of companies ranging from ceuticals groups to insurers were hit hard last week after the US government issued proposals to update Medicare payment rates and expand health coverage.The US administration’s plan to insure more Americans could reduce private insurers’ profits and spark new competition.The argument over whether insurers or big ceuticals companies should own PBM businesses, which administer their own products alongside their competitors’, raises questions about potential conflicts of interest.In the 1990s, drug companies such as Eli Lilly, which owned PCS Health, and Merck, which owned Medco, were scrutinised over whether their captive PBM businesses would be pressured to use their parent companies’ drugs.Eli Lilly sold PCS to Rite Aid in 1999 for $1.5bn, and Merck spun off Medco in 2003.WellPoint’s medical insurance enrolment dropped by 288,000 members, or 0.8 per cent, in the fourth quarter because of nationwide job losses.Even with a further increase in unemployment, WellPoint projected last week that adjusted earnings per share should increase 1-3 per cent in 2009 compared with 2008.A Wellpoint spokeswoman said the company does not comment on merger speculation, but noted the company expects further consolidation in the industry.
71;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2009-01-13T22:44:01Z;Gains in US financials offset Alcoa losses;;US stocks struggled for momentum on Tuesday as gains in the energy and financial sectors helped offset fears that bleak results from aluminium group Alcoa were merely the precursor to a glut of heavy losses during the nascent earnings season.General Electric was among the hardest-hit blue chips amid the choppy trading, off 5.6 per cent at $14.94 after Barclays forecast that tax benefits could account for as much as $0.20 of an estimated $0.36 earnings per share in the fourth quarter, more than Wall Street expectations.Industrials and utilities were the worst performing sectors, off 2.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.The major indices finished mixed. The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent at 871.79 points, having drifted between positive and negative territory throughout the day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 8,448.56 points while the Nasdaq Composite Index was up 0.5 per cent at 1,546.46.The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, eased 5.6 per cent to fall back beneath the 45 level.Trading in the financial sector was particularly volatile. The sector finished 1.4 per cent higher overall, ­helping nudge the S&P into positive territory, having earlier fallen as much as 2.2 per cent.Several other banks rallied following reports that Citigroup, up 5.4 per cent to $5.90, may ditch the “financial supermarket” model and break itself up.Shares in Citigroup sank 17 per cent in the previous session amid concerns that the bank could still need more capital even if it spins off its brokerage unit into a joint venture controlled by Morgan Stanley, which was up 0.4 per cent at $18.86.JPMorgan jumped 5.8 per cent to $26.35 ahead of results due later in the week.However, Bank of America, which sustained heavy losses in the previous session, dropped a further 6.8 per cent to $10.65.Shares in Alcoa shed a further 5.1 per cent to $9.55 as investors had the first chance to respond to a ­wider-than-expected fourth- quarter loss – the first in six years. They had already dropped 10.7 per cent last week and lost a further 6.9 per cent in the previous session in anticipation of the results, which unofficially kicked off earnings season.The wider materials sector struggled for momentum as commodity markets were mixed, hurt by news that China’s exports and imports fell in December for a second straight month.Wellpoint, already down this week on a warning of investment losses, extended its bad run. The shares fell 5.2 per cent to $38.81 after the authorities ordered the health insurer to stop enrolling people on its Medicare plans due to breaches of ­regulations.
72;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2008-10-30T20:55:02Z;Unhealthy insurers;;US health insurers, already feeling unwell at the prospect of a Barack Obama presidency, had their condition further downgraded this past week as the financial crisis hit earnings. While the patient has suffered a bit of a shock, the prognosis is better than the average 61 per cent drop over the past year in the shares of six leading managed-care companies would suggest.The average prospective earnings multiple of Aetna, Humana, Cigna, UnitedHealth, WellPoint and Coventry Health Care of 5.4 times is pricing in an iron-fisted approach to healthcare reform under a Democratic White House and possibly a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. But the reality may be closer to a velvet glove – or perhaps a latex one.Take both Mr Obama and John McCain’s proposals to push for more widespread generic drug usage, or Mr Obama’s more substantial plan that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceuticals companies. These are bad for drug manufacturers, but on balance good for insurers, who are sensitive to such costs. Or how about Mr Obama’s plan to fine employers not offering health insurance and another that would force people to insure their children? These could add more than 30m new customers.Of course, some of Mr Obama’s proposals are clearly negative for insurers’ earnings, while some of Mr McCain’s would be a boon. Mr Obama might force insurers to cover those with pre-existing ailments, while Mr McCain would let people shop for coverage in any state, undercutting expensive local mandates. In the event of a McCain victory, the sector would rally, and it has amply priced in a likely Democratic administration.As in past campaigns, lobbying will likely water down sweeping proposals. Some is already happening, as Democrats reportedly received twice the donations from the industry as Republicans, reversing the trend in recent presidential contests.

73;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2008-04-23T20:42:20Z;Wall St edges up amid positive results;;Wall Street stocks wobbled back into the black on Wednesday as positive earnings news from technology companies and Boeing helped offset weak results and forecasts from Ambac and UPS.A round of decent quarterly earnings helped make the technology sector one of the leading gainers in the S&P 500.Any momentum for the broader indices, however, was undercut by a pull-back in commodities prices, which encouraged investors to sell related stocks.Dismal results from Ambac, the punch-drunk bond insurer, dragged down financials although acquisitions news helped limit the declines.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,379.98 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.2 per cent at 2,405.21. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 per cent to 12,763.22.Wednesday’s hesitant advance broke a two-day losing streak triggered by a batch of below-par reports but analysts are beginning to suggest that the worst fears for first-quarter earnings season were unfounded.Doug Peta, market strategist at J&W Seligman, said: “Earnings have been a pleasant surprise since we got past GE’s results …Markets always overshoot at the top and bottom and perhaps pessimism got overdone.”In technology, Molex, the electrical parts maker, surged 15.2 per cent to $28.56, VMware, the software company, gained 4.9 per cent to $60.84 and Broadcom, which makes chips for Nintendo’s Wii video-game console, jumped 16.3 per cent to $27.39.Meanwhile, Apple shares hit $162.70, adding 1.6 per cent to to its recent run after the company confirmed it had bought PA Semi, a microprocessor designer, for $278m in cash.After the close, the positive trend moderated somewhat as Amazon beat first-quarter earnings forecasts but said full-year operating income may be less than earlier predicted. Its shares fell 6.9 per cent to $75.40 in after- hours trading.In materials, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the second-largest copper producer, said first-quarter profit more than doubled but still dropped 2.2 per cent to $116.08 as gold prices fell back. Peers Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold, also lost 1.8 per cent to $43.85 and 4.5 per cent to $40.78, respectively.Aircraft maker Boeing advanced after it said profit rose 38 per cent to $1.2bn in the first quarter as its backlog of orders grew to a record $346bn. Revenue rose 4 per cent to $16bn and the shares added 4.6 per cent to $82.19.Leading the negative surprises on Wednesday was Ambac Financial.The company undershot Wall Street’s worst expectations, posting a net loss of $1.7bn after a $3.1bn charge for subprime mortgage securities.Ambac shares, which have lost 93 per cent of their value in the past year, plunged 41.8 per cent to $3.51. Peer MBIA dived 33.6 per cent to $8.82.However, news that Liberty Mutual Group, the property and casualty insurer, had agreed to buy Safeco, a home and automobile insurer on the West Coast, for about $6.2bn in cash, helped limit the downside in the financial sector. Safeco shares jumped 45.8 per cent to $65.94.Better-than-expected results from Moody’s, the credit rating company, also helped steady the sector. Moody’s shares gained 2.6 per cent to $37.46 while McGraw-Hill, owner of rival Standard & Poor’s, added 3.3 per cent to $39.41.Downbeat results and comments on the US economy from UPS, the industrial bellwether, left investors largely unmoved. Its shares fell just 0.3 per cent to $71.67.The healthcare sector was in focus after results from WellPoint, the health insurer, and drugmaker Schering-Plough.WellPoint climbed 7.3 per cent to $49.94 after it said it would take aggressive remedial action to address a decline in first-quarter profit due to higher claims.Schering-Plough said profit declined 48 per cent to $291m because of costs associated with buying Organon Biosciences for $16bn in November – but the figure was ahead of most analysts’ estimates. Schering gained 6.6 per cent to $18.27.The day’s biggest gainer was the telecommunications sector, which added 2.2 per cent led by Sprint Nextel. Sprint climbed 8.8 per cent to $7.67 in what some analysts called a relief rally after AT&T’s solid results on Tuesday.
74;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2008-03-14T20:45:48Z;Wall Street hit by mixed messages;;"US stocks ended the week at levels virtually unchanged from the previous Friday, a fact which belies the incredible volatility experienced by investors over the last five days.It has been an extraordinary week on Wall Street, and one characterised by mixed signals about the health of the economy and global financial markets.The week began on a sour note, with stocks falling to 19-month lows after oil prices soared to a record and the dollar plumbed new lows.On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve sparked a significant rally when it announced a new, expanded effort to improve financial market liquidity. Investors’ initial euphoria waned just a day later, after Carlyle Capital, a highly-leveraged mortgage bond fund, said it had defaulted on $16.6bn in debt and was facing collapse.Standard & Poor’s provided a sentiment boost on Thursday, when it said the end was near for subprime writedowns at major financial institutions. Prior to the S&P comment, shares had fallen on data showing consumers had cut their spending sharply in February.And early on Friday, unexpectedly benign inflation data supported a strong opening on Wall Street.But by the end of the trading day in New York, as investors digested the implications of JP Morgan and the Federal Reserve stepping in to support Bear Stearns, stocks had turned sharply negative.The S&P 500, which had been poised for its best week since the end of January before Friday, fell 0.4 per cent on the week to 1,288.14.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5 per cent over the period to 11,951.09, while the Nasdaq composite was unchanged at 2,212.49. TBear Stearns which this week repeatedly denied it faced any funding problems, plummeted after the brokerage said its liquidity position had significantly deteriorated. In response, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch slashed Bear’s credit ratings to triple-A. Shares fell 57.2 per cent this week to $30, a near 10-year low.JPMorgan Chase, which is acting in tandem with the New York Fed to provide Bear with secured funding, fell 2.7 per cent on the week to $36.54. The bank said shareholders would not be exposed to “any material risk”.Financial stocks bore the brunt of the fallout from the Bear rescue. Citigroupfell 5.4 per cent on the week to $19.78. Merrill Lynch fell 3.7 per cent to $43.51.Lehman Brothers fell 15.3 per cent to $41.48. “The most acute contagion from the liquidity disease afflicting Bear Stearns today appears to be festering at Lehman Brothers,” analysts at Interactive Brokers said. “The mad rush for protection against further downside drama in its share price appears more or less unmitigated.”Bank of America fell 2.9 per cent to $35.69, while Countrywide, which it has agreed to buy, fell 11.2 per cent to $4.50. Bank of America’s proposed acquisition of the top US mortgage lender has come under increasing scrutiny from investors and lawmakers. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic senator from New York, said Countrywide had been a “main contributor” to the mortgage crisis, and the lender is one of
several facing an early-stage inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Ambac, the bond insurer, lost 34.5 per cent of its value this week, falling to $6.22 despite having its top-notch credit rating reaffirmed by both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. Rival MBIA fell 8.8 per cent to $10.94.AIG the world’s largest insurer, fell 4 per cent to $41.18 after Morgan Stanley said it could be hit by as much as $3bn in losses related to credit default swaps. Insurance companies are facing subprime-related losses that could dwarf the record set by Hurricane Katrina, the worst natural disaster in US history, according to Bloomberg data.The amount of asset writedowns and credit losses reported by the insurance industry has reached at least $38bn, just shy of the $41.1bn in claims from Katrina, Bloomberg data show.WellPoint fell 29.8 per cent this week to $47.09 after the health insurer said it expected a smaller profit because of higher medical costs and economic weakness.Rival Humana fell 30.8 per cent to $43.98 after it revised its own forecasts downward, citing higher-than-expected claims in its standalone Medicare prescription plans. Moody’s cut its ratings outlook on Humana to “negative” from “stable”.Elsewhere in the insurance sector, Progressive fell 11.3 per cent to $15.47 after the car insurer reported weak February results.The insurance sector fell 2.7 per cent this week."

The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,243.87.“The overall sentiment picture suggests that although there is scope for a short-lived rally, equities are by no means out of the bear trend,” said analyst Sreekala Kochugovindan of Barclays Capital. “Sentiment is only marginally below crisis levels and there is a risk that once the euphoria of [the Federal Reserve’s liquidity action] subsides, investor focus could return to the continued problems of financial sector woes and the effect of a mild bout of stagflation.”Credit Suisse characterised said the Fed’s action – which sparked a massive rally in stocks on Monday – “does not address the fundamental problem of solvency, in our view. The two critical issues are that US housing still looks overvalued and that we think banks need to deleverage.”Until the Fed-induced rally, the market had retreated for three successive sessions as investors were unnerved by reports of margin calls at hedge funds and soaring home foreclosures.Financial stocks ended lower after a volatile day’s trade. The S&P financial index fell 2.1 per cent, while an index of investment banks fell 1.8 per cent.Among big bank stocks, Citigroup fell 1.3 per cent to $21.21, JPMorgan, fell 0.6 per cent at $38.61, while Bear Stearns fell 2.2 per cent at $61.58.Shares in the government sponsored mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae closed lower in active trade.Both Fannie and Freddie fell sharply this morning after media reports said they might have to issue more than $10bn in new stock this year as the lenders continue to serve as a backstop for the deteriorating housing market.Freddie Mac fell 0.6 per cent to $20.04 despite comments from the company’s chief executive that it had sufficient capital and had no plans to raise more capital through a share sale. Fannie Mae, Freddie’s larger rival, fell 4.4 per cent to $21.04.Countrywide, the mortgage lender which Bank of America has agreed to buy, fell 7.1 per cent to $4.75. Fitch, the ratings agency, cut the lender’s rating to BBB- from BBB+ after the market closed.American Eagle, the clothing retailer, said its fourth-quarter profit fell 6.4 per cent as it increased discounts to clear out unsold merchandise. The earnings were in line with expectations and the shares gained 4 per cent to $17.94. Healthcare company WellPoint fell 1.7 per cent to $46.45 after Fitch changed its outlook on the company from “stable” to “negative”. WellPoint warned early this week that 2008 earnings would not meet forecasts because of higher medical costs and fewer subscribers than expected.JPMorgan downgraded a number of airlines, including American, Northwest and Delta. Shares in American fell 12.8 per cent to $9.31. Northwest fell 16.2 per cent to $10.25 while Delta was down 16.4 per cent at $10.13.Shares in Take-Two Interactive gained in afternoon trade, rising 1.1 per cent to $24.91, after the video game publisher raised its outlook for 2008. Take-Two reiterated that it had rejected a $2bn buy-out offer from rival Electronic Arts.Dow component Caterpillar said after the close of the previous session that 2008 sales and earnings would top earlier forecasts. The heavy equipment maker also raised its long-term sales goal. Shares rose 3.6 per cent to $75.25.The pharmaceuticals sector came under pressure after Wyeth and Progenics
Pharmaceuticals said that preliminary results on a treatment for gastro-intestinal problems failed. Progenics fell 63.6 per cent to $4.93."
76;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2008-03-12T20:43:22Z;US health insurers;;Medical costs for health insurers WellPoint and Humana have risen more than expected this year. The news sent up a warning flare concerning the industry’s worst fear – unanticipated cost acceleration – and burned share prices to a crisp. Rival Aetna reaffirmed its profit forecast, but WellPoint’s warning has nonetheless triggered a sell-off in the sector that wiped out gains posted last year, when investors had viewed it as a haven. That defensive lustre has justifiably worn off. The recent market share wars that prompted insurers to cut their premiums are starting to look ill-timed.WellPoint, an industry bellwether with 35m medical members, priced its premiums on the assumption that medical costs would rise by less than 8 per cent this year. But the volume of high-expense claims steepened across many of its markets, as did doctor and hospital costs. WellPoint overshot cost estimates in its Medicare business, and the subsequent profit warning from Medicare-heavy Humana suggests WellPoint’s Medicare troubles may not be isolated.Humana, however, largely shot itself in the foot. It overestimated demand for expensive brand-name drugs and lowered co-payments, which left it responsible for an inflated portion of members’ drug costs. The co-payment cuts prompted waves of high-cost members to shift into more expensive plans, twisting the knife by raising Humana’s costs further. Conditions should be better for insurers with more underwriting prowess or, in Aetna’s case, minimal Medicare exposure and a growing share of profitable individual and small group customers.Even if WellPoint’s higher costs do not materialise industry-wide, the sector’s outlook is cloudy. Uncertainty over whether the next political administration will favour increased regulation and less private-sector Medicare involvement could worsen as the elections draw nearer. With a lack of clarity over the scope of cost increases now making visibility even worse, most insurers’ risks appear to outweigh their investment prospects.Post and read comments on this Lex

The central bank plan helped allay fears that liquidity pressures were spiralling out of control.Energy companies and other commodity producers were among the best performers as crude oil surged to another record.The S&P 500 closed up 3.7 per cent at 1,320.63 points, its best performance since October 2002. The Nasdaq Composite soared 4 per cent to 2,255.76 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.6 per cent to 12,156.81 points.The co-ordinated central bank announcement was a welcome salve for equity investors alarmed at the pattern of recent selling.Until Tuesday the market had retreated for three successive sessions as investors were unnerved by reports of margin calls at hedge funds and soaring home foreclosures.Tobias Levkovitch, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, had warned that “hopelessness” was setting in.The Fed plan to lend up to $200bn of Treasury securities to primary dealers on a 28-day term soothed some of these worries. The plan allows dealers to park a variety of collateral, including mortgage-backed securities, which have declined rapidly in price and have become difficult to trade.The latest announcement brought to $400bn the total amount of new short-term funds made available by the Fed over the past week.Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, said: “The Fed taking mortgages as collateral should help ease liquidity concerns. This is a way to really attack the problems at their route rather than just cutting interest rates.”After the announcement the futures market trimmed odds of a 75bp rate cut when the federal open market committee meets next week.Although the market reaction was very supportive some analysts were more sceptical.David Rosenberg, North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said: “We still believe today’s action is not nearly a large enough step to make a big difference.”Stocks moved sharply higher on the Fed news with gains concentrated in the financial sector. An analysis by Bespoke Investment Group suggested some of Tuesday’s rally was driven by traders closing out short positions.Among the big movers were Citigroup, up 9.1 per cent at $21.49, Lehman Brothers, 7.8 per cent higher at $46.31, and Countrywide Financial, up 17.2 per cent at $5.11.Washington Mutual rose as much as 25.5 per cent on speculation it could receive a cash infusion from an outside investor. It closed up 18.3 per cent at $11.88.Bear Stearns was particularly volatile, falling as much as 19 per cent from its intraday peak, amid persistent talk – which it denied – that it faced liquidity problems. Bear closed up 1.1 per cent at $62.97 on reports Joseph Lewis, the British billionaire investor, was looking to increase his stake.Investors were also cheered by a smaller US trade deficit increase than expected. The gap between imports and exports widened 0.6 per cent in January, excluding costly oil imports but the deficit narrowed to a five-year low, as the weaker dollar boosted exports.Energy companies moved higher as crude oil futures rose above $109. ExxonMobil put on 5.1 per cent to $86.68 and Noble, the rig operator, rose 7.6 per cent to $50.48.Citing “out of control” oil prices and rising costs, Credit Suisse downgraded the airline sector from “overweight” to “market weight”. NorthWest Airlines shed 0.8 per cent to $12.23.Also trading to the downside was chipmaker Texas Instruments, which cut its first quarter earnings and revenue outlook.The shares dropped 3 per cent to $28.76. In telecoms, Sprint Nextel, the troubled mobile phone operator briefly hit a 20-year low. The shares closed 8.2 per cent lower at $6.17.Health insurer WellPoint cut its 2008 earnings outlook because of high costs and the deteriorating economy. Its shares plunged 28.3 per cent to $47.26.
78;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2007-07-25T20:39:15Z;Wall St higher in volatile session;;"Wall Street stocks closed higher on Wednesday as investors responded to generally upbeat company earnings from companies including Amazon and Boeing and got to grips with fresh housing market data.The market had opened higher after the sell-off of the previous session, turning sharply negative for a short period early in the day before closing off its best levels for the day after news that Chrysler had postponed a $12bn loan deal.Early gains were driven by Amazon, which more than tripled its second quarter profit and raised its 2007 sales and operating earnings outlook. Its shares were up 24 per cent or $15.34 at $84.59 at midday in New York.Amazon’s share price gains were fuelled as JP Morgan lifted its rating from ”underweight” to ”neutral”, saying it sees strong revenue growth in 2007 and 2008. It added that Amazon’s valuation ”provides limited upside.”At the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent at 1,518.09, the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.3 per cent higher at 2,648.17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent at 13,785.07.The materials sector, fell about 1.1 per cent. All other sectors, bar semiconductors, were positive for the day.Volatility remained very high. Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “It used to be the case that as stocks went up, volatility went down. “That relationship is coming apart at the seams these days with investors keen to buy the CBOE Vix index futures and options with the specific aim of protecting portfolios from a downturn in the broad market.”He added that the Vix index rose on Wednesday even as the Dow and S&P 500 roseEarnings remained a sharp focus for investors.Before the opening bell, Boeing raised its full-year earnings forecast and reported net income of $1.35 a share in the second quarter compared with a loss
of $160m, or 21 cents, a year earlier, when the company paid a $615m government fine.Its shares rose 3.3 per cent to $107.23. Boeing also said it was on track to deliver the first 787 Dreamliner in May, although research and development costs for the fuel-saving jet – which has generated more orders than any new aircraft in history – have risen.ConocoPhillips and Colgate Palmolive also reported better than expected second quarter results, buoying sentiment.ConocoPhillips shares were up 2.4 per cent at $84.21. Colgate Palmolive shares rose 2.1 per cent to $69.66 after the company reported second-quarter profit was $415.8m, or 76 cents per share, compared with $283.6m, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.Apple was set to report after the market close. Its shares lost 6 per cent on Tuesday on concerns about weaker than expected sales of the iPhone from AT&T, but regained 1.8 per cent to close at $137.26.In economic news, the pace of existing home sales fell to its lowest for more than four years in June, according to the latest reading on the state of the battered property market.Home resales fell to a 5.75m annual rate, a 3.8 per cent decrease from May’s revised 5.98m annual pace, the National Association of Realtors said.May’s rate had been estimated at 5.99m.Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress last week that he expected housing demand to stabilise and housing to be a less severe drag on growth in the coming months.US economic activity expanded further in June and early July, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, as slower housing markets were offset by gains in manufacturing and commercial real estate.In deal news, medical diagnostics provider Dade Behring Holdings rose 32.8 per cent to $74.26 after Siemens agreed to buy it for $77 a share.A 70 per cent profit rise for NutriSystem was not enough, with shares down 10.8 per cent at $56.90 as the company’s third-quarter outlook fell below analyst expectations.Corning said second-quarter net income fell 5.7 per cent on charges related to an asbestos settlement. Corning’s LCD business remained strong, while its telecommunications segment was weaker than expected. Corning shares were down 6.5 per cent at $24.48.Wellpoint posted an 11 per cent rise in second-quarter profit on Wednesday as the largest US health insurer by enrolment increased its membership from a year earlier and better controlled administrative costs. Shares in Wellpoint fell 2.7 per cent to $79.99.Alexion Pharmaceuticals shares rose 17.5 per cent to $58.38 after the biotechnology company’s quarterly loss narrowed, beating analysts’ expectations."
79;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2007-05-24T14:08:22Z;Cheap drugs price war stirs US retailers;;"Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has over the past two decades reshaped both the US retail industry and the economy. Can it also reduce the more than $200bn (£100bn; €150bn) that Americans spend on prescription drugs every year?Since September, the company has been pursuing a high-profile attempt to cut costs, announcing that its in-store pharmacies would sell a month’s supply of 300 commonly prescribed generic drugs for $4, a 60 per cent cut in the cost of the most expensive drugs on the list.Wal-Mart says that low-cost generics – copies of brand name drugs whose patents have expired – now account for 35 per cent of the prescriptions issued in its instore pharmacies. Lee Scott, chief executive, de­clared in April that the cuts had so far saved his customers $290m, and that 30 per cent of the drugs were being issued without health insurance. Target, Wal-Mart’s main discount rival, has followed up with its own $4 programme, while Kmart has extended an offer of three months’ supply of generics for $15.But as the programme continues, questions remain over whether the initiative can eventually achieve the more substantive, structural changes to the US drug pricing model, and by extension the US healthcare market, that Bill Simon, head of Wal-Mart’s pharmacy operations, says he wants to achieve.“Before we took what was given us. What we’re doing now is trying to lead,” he says. Mr Simon argues that the $4 generic programme could eventually bring down the price for the selected generics across the market – just as Wal-Mart contributed to last year’s fall in the price of flatscreen TVs. That, he claims, would lead to a $10bn reduction in overall US healthcare costs.But in an indication of the opaque world of US drug pricing, several of Wal-Mart’s rivals haven’t yet followed suit.the US’s three largest drug store chains, CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid, have refused to follow suit, arguing that customers covered by insurance only pay around $5 out of their own pocket for generics because of co-payment arrangements.The arguments over the issue are an indication of the opaque world of US drug pricing. Wal-Mart and its allies say that, although the customer may pay only $5 up front in the drug store chains, the remaining costs, including the transaction processing costs, are borne by the healthcare system as a whole. “Standard industry practices had led to a place where price was relatively irrelevant,” Mr Simon says.In any case, Brian Sweet, chief clinical pharmacy officer at Wellpoint, one of the largest health insurers, says Wal-Mart’s current programme is not extensive enough to impact overall pricing. “If it was broader, then you may have a big enough initiative …that covers enough of the utilisation patterns, that it would change pricing.”But Wal-Mart wants to expand its project. It says it is considering introducing a second price tier for generics, of around $9, and that it believes that eventually 40 to 50 per cent of all drugs prescribed in the US could be covered. Wal-Mart is now talking to the insurers about designing healthcare plans that take account of the availabilty of both tiers of low-cost generic drugs.“They understand there’s a role these products could play in a new look at the fu­ture,” says Mr Simon. “They could redesign a programme that would offer to their clients extra value on the expensive drugs because they don’t need to provide support on the inexpensive ones.”Wellpoint’s Mr Sweet says the insurer is watching the unfolding dynamics of the programme. “It certainly is a bellwether to watch …if these programmes are utilised heavily or expanded then we may have some change in the way we do business here.”Wal-Mart’s interest in healthcare stems in part from its own healthcare issues; Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the US, with around 1.3m workers. It has faced rising healthcare costs and a storm of political criticism over the level of healthcare support offered to its largely low-wage workforce.Wal-Mart’s strategies should also win the company new customers. Pharmacies and clinics encourage customers to stay in stores longer, meaning they are also good for sales."

The legendary investor also disclosed a smaller investment in Wellpoint, a US health insurer, and revealed further details of its exposure to the railway industry, identifying Virginia-based Norfolk Southern Corp as his mystery target in the sector.Berkshire Hathaway, Mr Buffett’s investment vehicle, had previously disclosed stakes in two railway operators, Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union Pacific but declined to name the identity of the third company in its portfolio.Mr Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway were unavailable for comment.In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway said its holdings in Johnson & Johnson had risen to 48.7m shares in the three months to March, more than double the 24m shares it had at year-end. The value of Mr Buffett’s stake in J&J is around $2.9bn, according to the document.Mr Buffett’s widely followed investment strategy is predicated on buying companies that are undervalued, easy to understand and have strong management teams.Shares in J&J have fallen more than 9 per cent in the three months to March amid regulatory problems for some of the company’s new drugs.Sanofi Aventis shares lost more than 6 per cent over the same period – a fall that may have prompted Mr Buffett to buy more of the company’s US-traded American Depositary Receipts. His stake in the French company is now worth over $36m.As expected, Mr Buffett rebuffed demands from human rights groups and kept his stake in the Chinese oil group Petrochina.
81;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
82;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2007-05-16T20:36:48Z;Wall St rallies on billionaires’ bets;;Wall Street rallied strongly on Wednesday with trading influenced by a number of well-known investors revealing their latest purchases in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Early on Wednesday, stocks traded in a choppy fashion as a better-than-expected rise for industrial production in April was offset by news that building permits last month fell at their fastest pace since 1990.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was boosted by the disclosure that its constituents, Citigroup, and Johnson & Johnson were in favour among leading investors.The Dow closed up 0.8 p+er cent at 13,487.53, and set its 23rd record close for the year. The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to close at 1,514.14 and edged closer to its record level of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Georges Yared, chief investment officer at Yared Investment Research said good earnings and guidance for the coming quarter should support stocks and that the S&P was building up to moving higher towards its 2000 record peak.Within the S&P, telecom, and financial stocks led the major sectors higher, while materials lagged.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that while all 10 major S&P sectors were still trading near their recent highs, “many seem to be rolling over a bit.”They said: “Financials, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and health care have all had slight declines after hitting overbought levels, and it will be key to see how they react to resistance levels.”The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 2,547.42, and shrugged off weakness among semiconductors stocks. Earnings and lower guidance from Applied Materials did weigh upon technology for much of on Wednesday and the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 0.2 per cent, following a slide of 1.1 per cent on Tuesday.Applied Materials, a chipmaker, reported better-than-expected earnings, but its guidance for sales disappointed investors. Its shares were down 3.1 per cent at $19.17.Meanwhile the Russell 2000 index of small companies rose 0.7 per cent at 820.29 and rebounded from its lowest closing level in more than a month on Tuesday.A number of stocks were in the spotlight on Wednesday when Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment company, said it had invested in Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific, two railroads, and also bought stock in Wellpoint and raised its holding in Johnson & Johnson, two healthcare companies.Norfolk Southern rose 1.65 per cent to $56.79, Union Pacific gained 0.9 per cent to $119.39 and the S&P railroad index rallied 1.3 per cent, taking its gain for the year to 25.1 per cent.Wellpoint gained 1.6 per cent at $84.86, while Johnson & Johnson rallied 2 per cent to $63.05.Edward Lampert, the hedge fund manager, said late on Tuesday that he had purchased 15m shares of Citigroup. This prompted the shares to jump 4 per cent to $54.91. Analysts believe that the banking conglomerate could now become the next high-profile target for activist investors, given its underperforming share price in recent years. Such a move would show that even the biggest companies were not immune to activist pressure.Meanwhile, George Soros, another of the most famous hedge fund managers, said his stake in Microsoft had doubled, and the stock rose 0.55 per cent to $31.07. Mr Soros had lowered his holdings in Oracle, and shares were up 0.8 per cent at $18.99, while he had sold shares in Ebay, down 0.75 per cent at $33.25, and Take-Two Interactive, and shares in the video game maker slid 0.2 per cent at $19.08.Another big investor, Carl Icahn, a well-known activist, said he had purchased a large slice of Anadarko Petroleum, boosting its shares by 1.6 per cent to $47.20, and also bought shares in CSX, the railroad finished up 1.4 per cent at $46.40. Mr Icahn also disclosed that his stake in Time Warner, had been cut by nearly half. Its shares in the media group rallied 1.55 per cent to $21.60.In takeover news, Bausch & Lomb agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus for about $3.7bn in cash. Shares in the the maker of eye-care products jumped 9.8 per cent to $67.50.“We believe pressure on operating cash flow, as the company struggles to recapture lost market share, creates significant risks in terms of return on capital for an acquiring firm and we do not expect any higher offers,” said Robert Gold, medical devices analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.After the closing bell, Hewlett-Packard said second-quarter profit fell 6.5 per cent after a tax gain in the year- earlier period. In after-hours trade, shares in the computer maker were 0.7 per cent lower at $44.86, after a rise of 1 per cent in regular trade.Shares in Amazon closed 4.4 per cent higher at $63.22, after the online retailer said it plans to launch a digital music store later this year and sell songs without copy protection restrictions.In earnings news, Compuware reported a 20 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings and its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $10.67.Shares in Federated Department stores rose 1.2 per cent to $62.69 after its first-quarter profit rose more than 5 per cent, but missed analysts’ estimates.
83;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;WellPoint links healthcare to bonuses;;WellPoint, the second-biggest US health insurer, on Tuesday took the novel step of directly linking a portion of its employees’ annual bonuses to the quality of healthcare its 34m customers people receive.The move comes at a challenging time for the industry, which faces the prospect of a profit-threatening push by Democratic presidential hopefuls for national healthcare and criticism over instances of executive greed.Five per cent of bonuses for each of WellPoint’s 42,000 employees will be linked to improvement in an index measuring customers’ progress in 20 clinical areas, measuring for example, whether children receive immunisations, or diabetics control their blood sugar.“We’re making a bold statement that we’re going to improve the health of our members, and we’re putting compensation of every…WellPoint associate on the line to improve health,” chief medical officer Sam Nussbaum said.WellPoint has set an index performance target for 2010, using 2005 as the baseline. If it hits its goal, all employees will earn that portion of the bonus. If not, none of its employees will gain that part of the bonus.Aligning its employees’ incentives with better US health could answer criticism that insurers are nothing more than profit-seeking middlemen.Only last month, WellPoint’s rival, UnitedHealth Group, took a step to pull out from under a stock options backdating scandal restating earnings by more than $1.5bn over 12 years.The scandal led to the ousting of longtime chief executive, William McGuire, who had amassed almost $2bn in compensation while building UnitedHealth into a dominant health insurer.But WellPoint’s plan is also part of an effort by big US companies to push for greater health prevention initiatives to improve health and lower costs.
84;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2006-11-10T21:30:54Z;Wall St edges higher helped by deals, earnings;;US stocks were caught in several cross-currents during the week as earnings, deals and likely repercussions from the mid-term Congressional elections were digested by investors.The main indices rose modestly, led by the Nasdaq Composite, which was helped by a surge in earnings from technology giant Cisco, up 12.5 per cent over the week at $26.74.With the Democrats claiming control of the House of Representatives for the first time since 1994 and narrowly gaining a majority in the Senate, equity investors focused on the likely winners and losers under a new Congress.“It’s uncertain just how much specific regulation or actions will be imposed by the Democrats,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “While investor concern is well founded, congressional gridlock will likely hold sweeping changes at bay.”Early indications were that losers could include companies in the pharmaceutical and defence sectors, while labour conditions at Wal-Mart, down 2.2 per cent at $46.47, and a rise in the minimum wage are also likely to attract the attention of lawmakers.The winners are expected to include alternative energy and stem cell research companies along with the Government housing agencies that made gains over the week. Fannie Mae, up 3.6 per cent at $60.38, and Freddie Mac, up 2.2 per cent at $69.48, capitalised on expectations of less onerous regulation.In contrast, investors sold down the healthcare sector and big defence companies this week. The New York Stock Exchange Healthcare index rose 1.7 per cent early in the week ahead of the elections but tumbled after the election results. The index was down 2.1 per cent for the week at 6,742.80.“There is some concern for healthcare, with the Democrats talking about Medicare and [with] an eye toward lowering prescription drug prices,” said Mr Ablin.Big pharmaceutical groups Merck and Pfizer fell 4.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent to $43.12 and $25.71 respectively during the week. Johnson & Johnson was off 2.2 per cent at $66.29.Among managed health care providers, Humana fell 8.4 per cent to $52, in spite of reiterating its 2006 and 2007 earnings targets earlier in the week. UnitedHealth was down 3.6 per cent at $46.11, and WellCare fell 5.2 per cent to $56.WellPoint and Aetna were lower by 1.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent at $72.89 and $40.24 respectively. Watson-Pharma slid 5.2 per cent to $24.84 after disappointing earnings and legal woes. Bausch & Lomb fell 6.6 per cent for the week to $49.50 after it lowered 2006 and 2007 forecasts following the recall of its ReNu contact lens solution.Defence shares pared some of their post-election losses but on Friday were still down on the week. Lockheed Martin was 1.4 per cent lower at $85.75, Northrop Grumman was down 1.9 per cent at $64.70 and Raytheon had eased 0.2 per cent to $48.90.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 index had gained 1.2 per cent to 1,364.30 for the week and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.5 per cent higher at 2,389.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1 per cent firmer at 12,108.43 after making a record close of 12,176.54 on Wednesday.The small-cap Russell 2000 index was up 2 per cent for the week at 768.07.Dominating earnings releases this week was Cisco, which has risen by about 60 per cent this year. Juniper, rose 15.8 per cent to $19.48. Among S&P 500 companies, 438 have reported third-quarter earnings with growth averaging 19 per cent, according to Thomson Financial – 73 per cent beat consensus forecastsA $3.7bn private bid for Four Seasons, the luxury hotel chain up 28.4 per cent to $82, was chief among a number of deals announced during the week.Swift Transportation, the US long-haul truck company that received a $2.2bn buyout offer, rose 15.2 per cent at $27.70 over the week.OSI Restaurant Partners, which runs the Outback Steakhouse chain, agreed to a $3bn private acquisition and rose 21.4 per cent to $39.37.The faltering housing market bruised homebuilders this week, with Toll Brothers down 2.9 per cent to $27.41. Merrill Lynch downgraded builder DR Horton, and it fell 1.1 per cent to $22.47. Pulte Homes was down 3.2 per cent at $29.15.
85;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2006-10-25T20:45:24Z;Wall Street higher following Fed results;;Wall Street stocks closed higher yesterday, in spite of a surge in oil prices and a mixed batch of company earnings early in the session, as the market responded positively to the US Federal Reserve’s decision to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5.25 per cent.Before the Fed’s announcement, which said the economy seemed likely to expand and inflation pressures moderate over time, Wall Street had struggled to build momentum amid mixed earnings reports and uncertainty ahead of the announcement.Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at JPMorgan private bank, said: “The market needed a constructive statement from the Fed and it got one. The Fed confirmed that the economy is neither too hot not too cold.”General Motors, the world’s largest carmaker, was firmly in the spotlight after it reported a narrower third quarter loss and a $529m, or 93 cents a share, profit. Analysts had expected a rebound in profit to 49 cents a share.GM shares were down 4.1 per cent, or $1.48, at $34.71 at the close, as analysts said the market continued to be concerned about its market share. GM shares had rallied sharply this week and the stock was up 86 per cent for the year to date before issuing its earnings report.The S&P 500 closed up 4.84 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 1,382.23. The Nasdaq was up 11.75 points, or 0.5 per cent, at 2,356.59.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 6.8 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 12,134.68, its 12th closing high in the past 16 trading sessions.Amazon.com surged after reporting better-than-expected third quarter results on Tuesday after the market close. Its shares rose $4.05, or 12 per cent, to $37.68.Aircraft maker Boeing fell $2.73, or 3.3 per cent, at $80.86 after it reported a fall in third quarter profits.Lockheed Martin shares were dragged lower, down $2.44, or 2.7 per cent, at $86.67.Shares in Corning, the glass, fibre-optics and speciality materials company, fell 8.8 per cent to $21.10 after it revised down its revenue forecast for the coming quarter in spite of better-than- expected results for the third quarter.Shares in tobacco group Altriawere up 2.9 per cent at $82.10 after its third quarter results came in lower than expected. The rise came as Altria lifted its guidance for its full-year earnings.Drugmaker ImClone rose 5.3 per cent, or $1.56, to $31.00 after it announced investor Carl Icahn as its new chairman and also reported an 85 per cent rise in its third quarter earnings.Shares in WellPoint were $2.09, or 2.66 per cent, lower at $76.53 after the health insurer said third quarter net income grew to $810.8m, up from $640.7m for the same quarter last year. The performance fell short of analyst estimates.
86;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2005-09-27T20:29:43Z;Wall St steady despite slide in confidence;;Taser International, the stun gun maker, saw its shares lose 13.1 per cent to $6.35 after it said the Securities and Exchange Commission was stepping up an investigation of the company to the point where it could subpoena documents.The decline came as Wall Street stocks proved that hope springs eternal by closing virtually unchanged in the wake of a report showing consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low.The report was the first evaluation of the impact of recent hurricanes on American consumers. It raised the prospect of slowing consumer expenditure in an economy that owed much of its recent expansion to the resilience of consumers and their willingness to borrow.David Rosenberg, economist at Merrill Lynch, noted this week that consumer discretionaries have been the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year and warned investors that there was a risk of disappointment next year, given that consensus forecasts see the sector as having the best earnings prospects in 2006. On the Dow Jones Industrial Average, initial declines in those stocks with more direct exposure to consumer spending patterns mostly faded away by the close. Thus, Wal-Mart, the retailer, was less than 0.1 per cent off at $43.10, while Home Depot lost 0.1 per cent to $38.39. McDonald’s lost 0.8 per cent to $33.01.By the close, this background saw a 0.1 per cent advance in the Dow to 10,456.21, while the S&P 500 index was flat at 1,215.66. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.2 per cent to 2,116.42.The day’s other data report appeared to do nothing to help sentiment, showing that new homes sales fell in August. However, homebuilders recouped some of their earlier losses.The news sent the Dow Jones US home construction index 0.6 per cent lower, with Toll Brothers down 1.6 per cent to $43.28. KB Home gave up 1.9 per cent to $72, Centex lost 0.8 per cent to $63.40 and DR Horton gave up 0.2 per cent to $35.50.Lennar, which reported above-expectation quarterly results after the Monday close, was 0.1 per cent off at $57.Other stocks in the news included ExxonMobil, which closed unchanged at $64.62 and Chevron, off 0.1 per cent at $64.18. The two oil groups received a downgrade and an upgrade respectively from analysts at JPMorgan.Meanwhile, in deal news, the shares of WellChoice rose 7 per cent to $75.51 after reports that WellPoint, the largest US health insurer, was set to acquire the company. WellPoint was 0.1 per cent lower at $75.01.News that profits grew by 7.3 per cent at Pepsi Bottling Group pushed the company’s shares up 3.1 per cent to $28.46.Movie Gallery, a DVD-rental chain, was 13.9 per cent lower at $11.04, not far from a fresh low point after the company announced that it would suspend its quarterly dividend in order to pay down debt. The stock is down almost 42 per cent for the year.Blockbuster, a rival, was down 1.3 per cent at $4.51.Netflix, which rents DVDs via the internet, improved by 1.4 per cent to $24.30.
87;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Wellpoint agrees to buy rival for $6.3bn;;WellPoint, the largest US health insurer, on Tuesday agreed to pay $6.5bn in stock and cash to acquire WellChoice, a rival boasting a customer base of about 5m members in the New York City area.The deal furthers a nearly two-year wave of consolidation in the US health insurance industry. WellPoint, itself the product of a $16bn merger that closed last November, and UnitedHealth, its main competitor nationally, have aggressively sought to expand through acquisitions.By acquiring WellChoice, the parent of the powerful Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield brand, WellPoint will be placing itself in direct competition with UnitedHealth in the New York market, which can be exceptionally lucrative because of the presence of many corporate employers.UnitedHealth bolstered its presence in New York last year when it agreed to buy Oxford Health Plans in a $5bn deal. In July this year, UnitedHealth set its sights on the western US when it announced plans to pay $8.1bn for PacifiCare, whose customers are located in states such as California, Colorado and Texas.In a statement on Tuesday, Larry Glasscock, chief executive of WellPoint, suggested the acquisition of WellChoice would help curb - rather than exacerbate - the rising cost of health insurance, one of the most significant issues confronting US corporations and policymakers.“We can assure our members in all of our states that this merger will not add in any way to premium increases,” Mr Glasscock said. “Both WellPoint and WellChoice have strong track records of reducing administrative costs while improving customer satisfaction.”WellPoint - which was formed last year after Anthem agreed to buy WellPoint for $16bn and took its name - is paying $77.23 per share to WellChoice shareholders - or the equivalent of an 9 per cent premium to WellChoice’s value on Monday. The cash portion of the payment will be worth $38.25 per share, while the stock portion is worth $38.98 per share.The New York Public Asset Fund, WellChoice’s majority shareholder, is supporting the merger and will receive a cash pay-out of nearly $2bn and an additional 27m WellPoint shares after the deal closes. The deal offered a way to get around legal restrictions that would have required the fund to cut its stake in WellPoint to under 50 per cent by November.After the close of the transaction, Michael Stocker, chief executive officer of WellChoice, which went public in 2002 after abandoning its not-for-profit status, will run WellPoint’s NorthEastern operations. In midday trading, WellPoint shares were 0.15 per cent lower at $74.98. WellChoice shares were up 6.7 per cent at $75.33.
88;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2005-07-07T15:35:21Z;Omnicare buys healthcare rival for $1.6bn;;Omnicare, the US provider of drugs and pharmacy services to nursing homes, on Thursday agreed to buy NeighborCare, a rival, for about $1.6bn, marking the end of a takeover battle that has lasted more than a year.Omnicare had been pursuing NeighborCare since June 2004, when it launched a unsolicited bid worth $30 per share that was rejected by the target.Last month, Omnicare raised its bid to $32 per share in the hope of luring NeighborCare into takeover talks - which it eventually did, leading to Thursday’s deal struck at $34.75 per share.Omnicare will also take on more than $200m of NeigborCare debt.“More than a year in the making, the combination of our companies, we believe, will create a premier institutional pharmacy company“, said Joel Gemunder, Omnicare’s chief executive.The enlarged Omnicare will serve 1.6m beds in nearly all US states and have about $6bn in revenues. John Arlotta, NeighborCare’s chief executive who had been on the frontlines in resisting Omnicare’s approaches, said: “Our organisation has made significant progress in achieving our business goals and we are pleased that Omnicare has recognised the values inherent in our enterprise.“The deal came in a busy week for mergers and acquisitions activity in the US healthcare services industry. On Wednesday, UnitedHealth, the country’s second largest health insurer, agreed to buy PacifiCare for $8.1bn in stock and cash, cementing its standing as the top rival to WellPoint, the largest US health insurer.Omnicare shares rose 2 per cent in morning trading to $46.95, giving it a market capitalisation of $4.9bn. NeighborCare shares were up 0.7 per cent to $34.60.Lehman Brothers and Lazard advised Omnicare, which is based in Kentucky. Goldman Sachs advised NeighborCare, whose headquarters are in Maryland.
89;ANTM;Anthem Inc;2005-07-06T22:42:26Z;UnitedHealth to buy Pacificare for $8.1bn;;UnitedHealth, the second-largest US health insurer, on Wednesday agreed to buy PacifiCare Health Systems for $8.1bn in cash and stock, extending a deal-making spree that has lasted almost two years.The acquisition will allow UnitedHealth to establish a strong presence in the western US, where PacifiCare has about 10m clients and derives some $12bn in annual revenues.Industry observers suggested that UnitedHealth’s expansion would intensify competition with WellPoint, the largest US health insurer created out of last year’s $16bn merger of Anthem and WellPoint.The US health insurance industry has been consolidating because many of the players are feeling pressure to gain clout with hospital and pharmaceuticals companies. William McGuire, UnitedHealth’s chief executive, on Wednesday described the deal as “advancing a national presence that can help address a highly fragmented health care system”.Over the past decade, Mr McGuire has presided over the growth of the company, which is based in Minnesota, through a series of acquisitions. The latest were the $2.7bn takeover of Mid Atlantic Medical Services in 2003 - a deal followed last year with the $5bn purchase of Oxford Health.These deals allowed UnitedHealth to become a dominant force in many mid-Atlantic and north-eastern US states.Besides the appeal of moving into states such as California, Colorado and Texas, the purchase of PacifiCare is also appealing to UnitedHealth because the target is one of the top providers of Medicare programs, which offer low-priced medical care to the elderly.In the late 1990s, United withdrew from the Medicare market in several states. Under the terms of Wednesday’s deal, PacifiCare shareholders will be receiving $80.05 per share - of which $21.50 will come in cash and the rest in $2.2bn in UnitedHealth shares at an exchange ratio of 1.10. This price represents a 10 per cent premium to PacifiCare’s value on Tuesday.Investors will in the next few weeks be closely monitoring the regulatory response to UnitedHealth’s latest deal. John Garamendi, the California insurance commissioner who last year held up Anthem’s merger with WellPoint, on Wednesday said he would give “close scrutiny” to the acquisition of PacifiCare.UnitedHealth’s latest purchase comes on the heels of a strong first quarter for the company, whose net income rose 41 per cent to $779m and revenues jumped 34 per cent to $10.9bn.PacifiCare shares on Wednesday closed up 6 per cent at $77.09. UnitedHealth shares closed up 0.5 per cent at $53.50. MorganStanley and MTS Health Partners, a private merchant bank, advised PacifiCare. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citigroup advised UnitedHealth.

The Nasdaq 100 index contracts were 4.50 points lower at 1,424.50, or 1.35 points below fair value.On the economic news front, durable goods orders fell 2.8 per cent in March for their largest drop since September 2002. Orders of non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, a key gauge of capital expenditure, fell 4.7 per cent.The data were likely to dent the bulls’ hopes for a respite following a broad sell-off in the previous session amid disappointing earnings reports from some prominent US companies.In corporate news, Boeing, a Dow component, saw share give up 1.9 per cent to $57.90 as the aerospace company reported declining profits and missed revenue forecasts the day its chief rival Airbus tested the world’s largest commercial jet and a potential threat to the US group.Shares in Amazon.com fell 6.5 per cent to $30.60 after the largest retailer on the internet reported lower profits due to increased costs.Best Buy, a traditional retailer of electronics and technology, was up 1.6 per cent to $50 after the company reported earnings and announced a stock buyback.Also reporting results was Verizon Communications, whose wireless unit helped it achieve $1.8bn profits in the latest quarter.Infospace shares tumbled 18.7 per cent to $36.58 after the technology company issued a guidance that disappointed analyst estimates.Among pharmaceutical stocks, Gilead Sciences saw shares give up 4.4 per cent to $37.56 after its experimental treatment for AIDS would need to be reformulated.

Falling oil prices, and the expectation of further declines, buoyed spirits, but this was countered by some disappointing earnings in the healthcare sector.By the close, the S&P 500 index was off 0.1 per cent at 1,201.72, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 10,715.76. The Nasdaq Composite shed 0.2 per cent to 2,082.03.Last week, the S&P 500 tacked on 2.7 per cent on benign remarks from the Federal Reserve and declining oil prices.Oil remained a positive factor in the markets on Monday, as crude futures eased 1.8 per cent to $45.70 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.As is usually the case, the market's activity elicited differing interpretations from bullish and bearish participants. Bulls took heart that last week's rally after a difficult January did not crumble, and they suggested the market has more upside. Bearish investors said the rudderless activity signals that the market had few upside catalysts left as the earnings season winds down.""Regardless of the short-term movements, there are some significant fundamental issues that need to be addressed,"" said Eric Kallen of Hayek Kallen Investment Management, citing the mounting US deficits and the dollar.While no overarching theme was driving Wall Street activity, a handful of stocks posted sharp moves. RealNetworks surged 20.7 per cent to $6.83 after a Barron's story over the weekend extolled the company's prospects in the online music-subscription arena.A handful of healthcare providers were ailing after a round of disappointing earnings.
