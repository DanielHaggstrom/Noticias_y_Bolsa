0;HUM;Humana Inc;2019-04-09T17:34:02Z;Pharmacy benefit managers face bipartisan criticism;Republican and Democratic senators accuse industry intermediaries of harming consumers;Republican and Democratic senators joined together at a hearing on Tuesday to accuse pharmacy benefit managers of harming consumers as both parties prepare to make soaring drug prices a key issue for the 2020 US elections.Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the Senate Finance committee, said healthcare industry mergers are “increasingly prompting concerns” and questioned whether they help patients or could open the door to “anti-competitive activity”.Pharmacy benefit managers, known as PBMs, bridge the gap between drugmakers and insurers, deciding which drugs will be covered by insurance plans and negotiating rebates and discounts.But the three biggest players are now part of broader healthcare conglomerates. Last year, health insurer Cigna bought PBM ExpressScripts for $54bn, pharmacy chain and benefits manager CVS Health bought insurer Aetna for $69bn, and United Healthcare, which already owned PBM OptumRX, added smaller pharmacy chains.PBM profits are based on making a slice of the prescription drug pie more expensiveThe Federal Trade Commission is already looking into competition in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The three leading companies count 71 per cent of Medicare patients enrolled in prescription drug plans as their customers, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research institution.Rising drug prices have become a key issue in the run-up to the 2020 polls, with both President Donald Trump and leading Democratic candidates trying to appeal to voters who feel they face higher out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions.Many senators spoke of meeting constituents who were skipping doses to try to control their drug bills. The price of insulin has come under particular scrutiny after some diabetics died from not receiving the vital hormone.Senator Ron Wyden, the committee’s top-ranking Democrat, accused PBMs of being more secretive about pricing than HBO is at guarding the end of Game of Thrones — calling them as “clear a middleman rip-off as you are going to find”.“PBMs actually make more money when they pick a higher priced drug over a lower priced drug,” he said. “PBM profits are based on making a slice of the prescription drug pie more expensive.”Five executives from the PBMs testified on Tuesday, insisting they operate in a very competitive market with over 60 players. Steve Miller, chief clinical officer of Cigna, said it was “wildly competitive” with many regional or local rivals, and that the consolidation of the industry helps them take better care of patients.The PBMs insisted that they passed all rebates on to consumers. But they pushed back on full public transparency, saying it would hamper their ability to negotiate effectively with drugmakers.When drugmakers including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Merck appeared in front of the Senate in February, many blamed a complex system where pharmacy benefit managers do not pass rebates on to the patients.Alex Azar, health and human services secretary, has put forward a proposal to ban the complex system of rebates in the two major government-backed health plans — Medicare, for seniors, and Medicaid, for the poor — because of fears they are not passed on to the patients.But on Tuesday, pharmacy benefit managers pointed the finger at drugmakers, criticising them for deliberately delaying when lower-priced generics can come on to the market. John Prince, chief executive at Optum RX, said manufacturers continue to raise list prices because of a “lack of meaningful competition”.The executives also cited the rising cost of speciality drugs, only used by 2 per cent of patients, but which they said were set to account for about half of all drug costs by 2022. They pushed for drugmakers to consider more “value-based pricing”, where a drugs costs are dependent on successful treatment.Shares in Cigna rose 1.4 per cent to $169.83 in midday trading in New York, while United Healthcare ticked up 0.3 per cent to $249.56. CVS was flat at $54.10, while Humana was flat at $273.42.
1;HUM;Humana Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Humana jumps on media reports of Walmart takeover;;Humana jumped as much as 8.1 per cent in early trading on Monday following media reports that the health insurer was in early-stage talks to be acquired by Walmart, a deal that would catapult the big US retailer deep into the healthcare services industry.The talks between Walmart and Humana are very preliminary and have focused on a variety of options ranging from a partnership that would keep the two companies independent to a full-blown combination, people familiar with the matter told the FT.Walmart’s approach of Humana follows a recent wave of deals in the healthcare services sector, including CVS’s $69bn takeover of health insurer Aetna and the $67bn acquisition of Express Scripts, a large pharmacy benefits manager, by Cigna, another health insurer.The deal frenzy is in large part a direct response to Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods, the high-end grocer, and follows speculation that the US e-commerce juggernaut could soon make a foray into the health services sector.Large US retailers, including Target, Kroger, Albertson and Walgreens Boots Alliance in addition to Walmart, have been frantically scouting for deals in an effort to prepare for the potentially disruptive entry of Amazon into their sector, according to advisers working with retailers.“For Walmart, this move is a strategic response to any potential Amazon play in the drug supply chain or more broadly in healthcare,” said an analyst note by Leerink, an investment bank specialising in the healthcare sector.Several dealmakers said that “everyone is talking to everyone” as all brick-and-mortar companies are trying to figure out how to bolster their sales and grow market share at a time when Amazon is threatening their business model.For example, Walgreens held talks earlier this year with AmerisourceBergen, the pharmaceuticals distributor, but the two failed to reach an agreement.At the moment it is unclear whether Walmart will go ahead with doing a deal with Humana, said one person close to the situation.Humana currently has a market value of $39bn but analysts said it could be sold at a much higher valuation. Leerink estimated that Walmart would have to pay close to $50bn to acquire Humana.Walmart shares were down more than 3 per cent on Monday following the news of the talks, which were first reported last week by the Wall Street Journal. Humana shares were up 5.2 per cent at pixel time.
2;HUM;Humana Inc;2017-10-26T23:35:56Z;CVS Health holds deal talks with Aetna;Shares in health insurance group rise on takeover reports sending valuation to $60bn;CVS Health, one of the largest US pharmacy retailers, has held high-level talks about a combination with health insurer Aetna which would create one of the most powerful forces in the prescription drugs industry.The talks come at a time of potentially tectonic shifts in the pharmacy industry, which is abuzz with rumours that Amazon plans to enter the sector. Earlier on Thursday, it emerged the retail giant had received wholesale licenses from at least 12 US state pharmacy boards.However, CVS and Aetna have been exploring a number of deals throughout the industry in recent months and there is no certainty anything will come of the discussions, after premature revelations. CVS is working with bankers at Evercore Partners and Barclays, while Aetna is working with Lazard.A CVS-Aetna deal would combine the third largest health insurer in the US with the two planks of CVS’s business: a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) that negotiates the prices of medicines with pharma groups, and the country’s biggest drugstore chain with almost 10,000 stores.Investors sold off shares in PBMs, drugstore chains and pharmaceuticals wholesalers on the speculation of a possible deal and the Amazon move, with Express Scripts, Walgreens, RiteAid and McKesson shedding between 3 and 6 per cent. Shares in Aetna jumped by 12 per cent, giving the company a market capitalisation of almost $60bn, while CVS lost around 3 per cent, putting its stock market value at $74.5bn.Some other insurers also have an integrated model that combines an insurer with a PBM, such as UnitedHealth, which cuts deals with drugmakers through its OptumRx division, and a consortium of Blue Cross Blue Shield state health plans, which negotiate via Prime Therapeutics. Anthem, the second largest health insurer, also entered the PBM sector recently by launching a new operator called IngenioRx. But a CVS-Aetna deal would stand out if consummated because it combines a large drugstore chain with an insurer for the first time, and also because it would put the pharmacy group rather than the insurer in pole position. One analyst, who asked not to be named, said they viewed the talks as a direct response to fears that Amazon plans to enter the pharmaceuticals industry by selling drugs online, setting up a PBM, or doing both. Although the licenses Amazon has applied for do not necessarily mean the company plans to sell prescription drugs, the company has hired several executives and managers from the healthcare industry in recent months. CVS and Aetna declined to comment on what they described as rumours and speculation. The talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.It is far from clear that the CVS-Aetna combination would be approved by regulators: the Department of Justice recently torpedoed a tie-up between Cigna and Anthem as well as Aetna’s takeover of Humana, warning that both transactions would harm consumers by reducing competition.However, CVS and Aetna could present a deal as consumer-friendly because the combined company would potentially be able to extract better deals from drugmakers and help to contain the soaring price of medicines, according to one person briefed on the companies’ plans.President Donald Trump has described the prices charged for drugs by pharmaceutical groups as tantamount to “getting away with murder”.Drugmakers already say that PBMs, insurers and wholesalers are collaborating in ways that is hurting their margins, and generic drugmakers such as Teva and Mylan have blamed more powerful customers for price deflation that is roiling the industry.
3;HUM;Humana Inc;2017-07-23T11:37:31Z;US health insurers shrug off chaos over Obamacare;Share prices outpace the market as groups focus on other areas of their businesses;"Shares in US health insurers have outpaced the broader stock market rally, shrugging off the chaotic debate over the future of Obama’s signature healthcare law.The sector’s big five companies, including Aetna and Humana, have enjoyed share price rises of more than 30 per cent since the election, having stepped away from participation in unprofitable parts of the Obamacare system and thanks to improvements in other areas of their business.While the long-term fate of Obamacare’s individual insurance markets and expanded government-backed Medicaid programme hang in the balance on Capitol Hill, the insurers are being rewarded by investors for having stabilised their profit margins.“The hit from regulatory changes is behind them,” said Ana Gupte, a healthcare analyst at Leerink Partners. The decline in margins, which resulted from the Obamacare rules and regulations on coverage has “levelled off”, she said.Investors have focused, in part, on growth from a different government-backed programme, Medicare, which is largely unaffected by Republican lawmakers’ back-and-forth over whether and how to “repeal and replace” Obamacare. Insurers have been adding customers to their Medicare Advantage plans for senior citizens.Medicaid programmes that provide health insurance to low-income Americans have also proved lucrative, as insurers add members to the managed care programmes they operate under state contracts — although the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare would be thrown into reverse under the Republican reform plans floated so far.But the companies still face profound uncertainty over the way US healthcare will change under Donald Trump. The administration could take steps to further affect regulations on health coverage in the near term.Yet even as the latest Republican reform bill collapsed in the Senate last week, UnitedHealth Group, considered an industry bellwether, exceeded Wall Street’s expectations in its second-quarter earnings report. The company, which also operates a medical services arm known as Optum, recorded net income of $2.28bn, or $2.32 per share, up 30 per cent from the same three months in 2016. UnitedHealth Group revenues were up nearly 8 per cent at $50.1bn, even after it forewent business by withdrawing from several Obamacare insurance marketplaces.Since inception, the Obamacare insurance exchanges, which enabled some 20m Americans to purchase cover, often with government subsidies, have proved to be more of a headache than a boon for business. More sick people than expected and too few young, healthy individuals signed up for plans, skewing the balance of risk in insurance pools.However, an analysis of insurers’ first-quarter earnings by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests these marketplaces are becoming more profitable, as higher premiums and slower growth in the rate of patients’ medical claims lift pressure on the margins.As signs of near-term reform grew less likely this year, Aetna and Humana, whose proposed tie-up was blocked by a federal judge in January, opted out of the exchanges for 2018. Mark Bertolini, Aetna’s chief executive, told Yahoo Finance last week that there would need to be a “stable and predictable market” for the insurer to return in future years.The essential briefing for decision makers on global healthUnitedHealth filed 2018 plan rates in just two states after abandoning most of the exchanges in 2017. Connecticut-based Cigna filed to participate in six.Of the big five, Anthem is most exposed to the Obamacare exchanges; the insurer holds licences for the popular Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in several states. However, Joseph Swedish, Anthem chief executive, told analysts in April that the company might be forced to reduce its service area or exit some markets if subsidies are cut by the Trump administration. Insurers have until the end of September to commit to state exchanges for 2018.Those who filed to remain were projected to ask state regulators to approve premium increases of between 28 and 40 per cent, in part to account for uncertainty in Washington as well as rising healthcare costs, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman.Stephen Hemsley, UnitedHealth chief executive, told analysts last week that policy changes in Washington, including healthcare and tax reform, could have an effect on 2018 earnings. “Certainly at this stage in the national conversation, speculation about any outcome here would just be that,” he said."
4;HUM;Humana Inc;2017-03-08T18:15:36Z;Obamacare reform: lucrative paralysis;Tax policy continues to subsidise healthcare spending;President Trump says the Obamacare repeal and replace plan that has just been put forward by his allies in the US House of Representatives is both “new” and “great”. Whatever one’s views of President Obama’s 2010 Affordable Care Act or Mr Trump’s response, the defining structure of American healthcare has not really changed. The vast majority of Americans who have health insurance take it from their employers. The primary beneficiary has been, unsurprisingly, corporate America.This feature is in the spotlight again with the Republican reform plan. US employers have enjoyed a significant tax benefit when providing the cover. The subsidy is worth a whopping $260bn annually. The Republican reform plan aims to cancel various tax hikes associated with Obamacare. To pay for those, one idea was to cap the tax deductibility of generous employer healthcare. However, a revolt from companies and unions seems to have killed that idea. The reform appears underfunded by hundreds of billions.Obamacare has targeted those on the fringes without access to employer-based healthcare. As a result, the uninsured rate of 9 per cent has been cut in half since 2010. Big insurers such as Aetna, UnitedHealth, and Humana have complained about the economics of newly created exchanges where the uninsured can buy policies. However, the American healthcare system that has largely maintained the status quo has worked out just fine for insurers and hospital chains. The shares of the big five US health insurers are up 300 per cent on average since 2011. The largest hospital chain, HCA, is up 180 per cent, double the S&P 500.With healthcare spending still growing faster than the economy, the pressure to rein in costs remains. But the solution is as much a corporate tax policy question as one of healthcare politics. Washington looks paralysed as ever. This existing condition should continue to suit the broader medical industry just fine.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
5;HUM;Humana Inc;2017-02-14T23:31:49Z;Insurer Humana to drop out of Obamacare exchanges in 2018;;In the aftermath of its failed bid to merge with rival Aetna, US health insurer Humana says it will drop out of the healthcare exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act – a move that sent President Donald Trump to Twitter pointing to it as the latest sign of the shortcomings of his predecessor Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform.Humana’s chief executive Bruce Broussard said during a call on Tuesday that thanks to the “unbalanced risk pool” in the exchanges, “we’ve decided that we cannot continue to offer this coverage in 2018.”The move prompted a tweet from Mr Trump, which read: “Obamacare continues to fail. Humana to pull out in 2018. Will repeal, replace & save healthcare for ALL Americans.”Mr Trump and Republican lawmakers have made repealing and replacing the so-called Obamacare law a key legislative priority, while some insurers have suffered losses as more sick people buy insurance through the exchanges.
6;HUM;Humana Inc;2017-02-14T12:11:40Z;Aetna to pay Humana $1bn break fee after failed merger;;Aetna confirmed on Tuesday that it will pay Humana a $1bn break fee after the merger between the two US health insurers was knocked down earlier this year by a federal judge.The news puts a formal end to what was planned as a $37bn tie-up that would have re-painted the landscape of the American health insurance industry.“While we continue to believe that a combined company would create greater value for health care consumers through improved affordability and quality, the current environment makes it too challenging to continue pursuing the transaction,” said Aetna chief executive Mark Bertolini.US District Judge John Bates ruled last month that the deal would have reduced competition, saying that: “The court is unpersuaded that the efficiencies generated by the merger will be sufficient to mitigate the anti-competitive effects for consumers in the challenged markets.”
7;HUM;Humana Inc;2017-02-09T04:28:12Z;US federal court blocks $48bn Anthem-Cigna merger;Judge says deal might substantially reduce competition in concentrated market ;Cigna’s $48bn acquisition of rival US health insurer Anthem has been blocked by a federal judge, marking the second time in as many weeks that US courts have knocked down a takeover in the industry on competition grounds.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington ruled late on Wednesday that the effect of the tie-up between Anthem and Cigna “may be substantially to lessen competition” in “what is already a highly concentrated market”, particularly in the sale of commercial health insurance to “national accounts” — customers with more than 5,000 employees, typically spread over two or more states.The decision, which will result in Anthem paying a $1.85bn break fee to Cigna, is set to further unravel the wave of consolidation that swept the health insurance sector in 2015 in the aftermath of then-President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare policy.Several large insurers believed there was a tacit agreement with the Obama administration that if they agreed to participate in the former government’s plan, which included providing health insurance to 20m people who had no coverage, they would have been allowed to merge with rivals to face higher costs.However, the Department of Justice filed two lawsuits last summer to block the Cigna-Anthem deal as well as Aetna’s $37bn takeover of Humana as it warned that both transactions would harm consumers’ interests by reducing competition.Aetna’s tie-up with Humana was also blocked last month by US District Judge John Bates, who ruled that the deal was anti-competitive.On Wednesday, Judge Jackson noted that the claimed medical cost savings, championed in particular by Anthem, were not “merger-specific, they are not verifiable, and it is questionable whether they are ‘efficiencies’ at all”.The merger first announced in 2015 between Anthem and Cigna — the second and third-largest medical insurers in the US — has been on shaky ground for months. A filing from the DoJ in September revealed the two companies had been trading accusations of breaching deal terms.All large insurers involved in the wave of dealmaking have since complained that due to so-called Obamacare they were incurring losses. They said this was because a large number of people who signed up to the new public marketplaces providing insurance were either much sicker or older than expected.Many insurers threatened to pull out completely from the Obamacare exchanges unless their deals were approved by the court.However, since Donald Trump was elected US president in November, the future of America’s healthcare has been in a state of uncertainty. The former New York property tycoon and reality TV showman signed an executive order within hours of becoming president that significantly reduced the enforcement of the Obama administration’s health act. It called on government agencies to waive or delay parts of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a “cost, penalty or burden” on individuals or insurers, as well as other businesses and states.Mr Trump said he plans to withdraw completely Obamacare but has not clarified what would replace it, leaving about 20m Americans in a state of limbo. The controversial decision, however, has raised the hopes of the health insurers who have seen their deals challenged, as some analysts expect that the new administration will be more open to consolidation.
8;HUM;Humana Inc;2017-01-24T18:23:30Z;Aetna/Humana: Obamacare’s irrelevance;Overlap in seniors’ insurance scuppered a tie-up but there is still room for growth;The US District Court in Washington on Monday blocked the $37bn merger of health insurers Aetna and Humana.There was too much opportunity for mischief in the Medicare Advantage service both groups offer to seniors. No matter. Health insurers have already outperformed the market for other reasons. A tie-up would have simply been another notch in their belts.Medicare Advantage is an alternative to government-sponsored health insurance for the elderly. Seniors in Medicare Advantage can choose between programmes and providers based on pricing and coverage.This market is a growth area for insurers. The elderly population is ballooning and appears more savvy about coverage choices than previous generations who would simply default to government Medicare if they needed to. Only a third of those eligible have joined the Medicare Advantage programme. Humana has half of that total.The court’s decision states that the market where antitrust issues loomed was Medicare Advantage insurance alone. The combined market share for the pair was simply too concentrated.Pricing power and negotiation clout with physicians and drug companies is what the companies were aiming for. Indeed, an impending Obamacare repeal under the Trump administration would be largely irrelevant for the insurers. They have already pulled out of many local insurance exchanges and retain only minimal financial exposure to its fate.Share prices of the S&P Health Care Providers and services index have outperformed the S&P 500 by 25 per cent since the 2010 passage of Obamacare. A $1bn break-up fee is now owed to Humana by Aetna.Should either set of investors be upset? Given $1.25bn in estimated annual synergies and a dip in the shares one might assume so. Another health insurance megamerger between Anthem and Cigna is also in the hands of the antitrust courts.But there is enough room for growth in the health insurance market for investors to take another adverse decision on the chin.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
9;HUM;Humana Inc;2017-01-24T00:32:07Z;Court blocks ‘anti-competitive’ $37bn Aetna-Humana bid;Judge says health insurers failed to make case that the deal would not hurt consumers;Aetna’s takeover of Humana has been blocked after a US court ruled the $37bn deal that aimed to reshape the health insurance industry would reduce competition.After a 13-day trial in Washington DC, US District Judge John Bates said the two companies had failed to make a strong case in defence of a deal that the Department of Justice warned would hurt consumers. “The court is unpersuaded that the efficiencies generated by the merger will be sufficient to mitigate the anti-competitive effects for consumers in the challenged markets,” he said. “The companies’ rebuttal arguments are unpersuasive: federal regulation would likely be insufficient to prevent the merged firm from raising prices or reducing benefits.”The decision, which will result in Aetna paying Humana a $1bn break fee, is set to unravel the consolidation seen in the health insurance sector in 2015 in the aftermath of then-President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare policy.Anthem’s $48bn acquisition of Cigna is also being scrutinised by a federal court after the DoJ said last year that it was anti-competitive. “We’re reviewing our options and giving our serious consideration to an appeal after putting forward a compelling case,” a spokesperson for Aetna said.Humana did not immediately return a request for comment. The court also ruled that Aetna’s decision to withdraw ahead of the trial from several healthcare exchanges offering affordable coverage in Florida was not driven by business rationale but was an attempt to put pressure on the court to let the deal go through.Aetna argued at the time that it was incurring large losses, because the people who had signed up to the new public marketplaces were much sicker and older than expected. It also threatened to pull out completely from the Obamacare exchanges unless its deal got the green light from the court.However, the court ruling debunked Aetna’s claim.“Aetna chose to remain on-exchange in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia — all projected to be unprofitable for 2016 — yet withdrew from Florida, which is projected to be profitable,” the judge said in the court ruling.“In fact, Florida was Aetna’s third most profitable state for its on-exchange business in 2015 and the first half of 2016.”The court’s ruling is the latest case of a large deal being blocked in the past year.Under the Obama administration, antitrust enforcers had blocked a series of large deals, including Halliburton’s $28bn takeover of Baker Hughes and Comcast’s $45bn acquisition of Time Warner Cable. This may change under the Republican-led administration of Donald Trump. Republicans have historically been more pro-business and open to allowing big mergers to go through. However, Mr Trump has openly criticised large deals that concentrate power and reduce competition.
10;HUM;Humana Inc;2017-01-23T17:38:07Z;Federal judge blocks Aetna, Humana deal on antitrust grounds;;Shares in US insurers Aetna and Humana declined on Monday after a federal judge blocked the $37bn transaction on antitrust grounds. Aetna however said that it was considering appealing the decision.Humana shares fell as much as 7.1 per cent before trimming their losses to trade about 1.2 per cent lower. Meanwhile, Aetna shares, which had declined as much as 3.7 per cent, pared back their losses to trade 2 per cent lower.US district judge John D. Bates in Washington sided with the Justice Department and said the merger would substantially lessen competition in the market for individual Medicare Advantage plans and that it could harm competition in certain counties in Florida.In his ruling, Judge Bates added: “the Court is unpersuaded that the efficiencies generated by the merger will be sufficient to mitigate the anticompetitive effects for consumers in the challenged markets”.“We’re reviewing our options and giving our serious consideration to an appeal after putting forward a compelling case,” a spokesperson for Aetna said.Regulators sued to block Aetna’s takeover of Humana last year. Anthem’s $48bn takeover of Cigna also remains in doubt.
11;HUM;Humana Inc;2016-11-30T20:33:02Z;Fitch predicts headwinds for major US health insurers in 2017;;"Prognosis: not so good.Concerns about a wave of mega-mergers and the profitability of plans sold on Obamacare exchanges could make the coming year a challenging one for major US health insurers, Fitch analysts said in a note on Wednesday.The ratings agency said that it had negative rating and sector outlooks for US health insurers, and that it expects “more health insurer rating downgrades than upgrades” over the next 12-24 months.“Leverage concerns tied to large mergers and concerns about the profitability of business sourced from health insurance exchanges are the key factors underlying Fitch’s negative outlooks,” said Fitch Ratings senior director Mark Rouck.It’s been a shaky year for many of the largest US health insurers, which have grappled with the implementation of President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform legislation, the Affordable Care Act – also known as Obamacare – and are now scrambling to figure out what will come next if Republicans follow through on their promises to repeal and replace portions of the law.While the law has expanded the number of Americans with health insurance, several of the largest insurers have already reported heavy losses as a result of plans sold on the exchanges set up under Obamacare, and had previously announced plans to pull back Obamacare offerings in all but a few markets.While a Republican repeal-and-replace could be a longer-term credit positive for the sector, Fitch said that “significant near-term uncertainty” exists about what shape those efforts could take.Another question mark that will linger over four of the five largest US health insurers until early next year are US antitrust officials’ lawsuits seeking to block to two mega-mergers. The first, Anthem’s $48bn bid for Cigna, is already on trial. The other, a proposed $37bn tie-up between Aetna and Humana, will go to trial later this month.But far from being a must-win for insurers, Fitch said that if the government wins and the deals are blocked, the resulting effect of acquirers “foregoing acquisition financing” would likely result in its removal of negatives watches on those companies’ ratings. “Given the size and significance of the companies involved this may be sufficient to contribute to a change in the sector’s rating outlook to stable,” Fitch said in the note.Compared to a year ago, Anthem’s shares are up 9 per cent; Aetna has risen 27 per cent, Humana has increased 25.1 per cent and UnitedHealth is up 40.5 per cent. Cigna is the only one of the big five insurers to be down, decreasing a modest 0.2 per cent from this time last year."
12;HUM;Humana Inc;2016-11-21T18:27:22Z;US health insurance mega-mergers on trial – key dates to watch;;"Four of the five largest US health insurers are headed to court to try to salvage two mega-mergers from being blocked by federal and state competition authorities, who claim that the deals will stifle innovation and consumer choice.Opening arguments kicked off in federal court on Monday in a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice and several states’ attorneys generals seeking to stop Anthem from completing its $48bn purchase of rival Cigna.In just a few weeks, before a different judge in the same Washington, DC court, attorneys for Aetna and Humana will head to trial to try to save their proposed $37bn tie-up. The insurers say that their deals will help them innovate and reduce costs, while federal and state authorities say that the wave of consolidation will stifle competition to patients’ detriment.Antitrust officials sued to block the planned deals earlier this year. The closely watched trials come as the US health insurance industry attempts to realign itself after sustaining heavy losses on plans offered through the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health-insurance reform legislation whose fate now hangs in the balance as Republicans prepare to retake the White House.Here are some key dates to watch:November 21 – Opening arguments begin in the Anthem/Cigna trial before US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C. federal court. She will first hear evidence and testimony on how the proposed deal would affect the overall national health insurance market.December 2 – Both sides in Anthem/Cigna will submit their proposed findings – intended to underscore trial evidence and testimony they hope will guide the judge in drawing her conclusions – for the first phase of the trial.December 5 – Trial begins for the Aetna/Humana merger before US District Judge John Bates in Washington, DC. The Anthem/Cigna trial will take the week off.December 12 – Testimony resumes in Anthem/Cigna, in a second phase that is expected to focus on the deal’s implications for local commercial markets and healthcare rates.December 29 – Parties in the the Aetna/Humana case are scheduled to submit their proposed findings to the judge.December 30 – Closing arguments scheduled for the Aetna/Humana trial before Judge Bates. The Anthem/Cigna trial is also scheduled to end by this date.December 31 – Original closing date for the Aetna/Humana merger; Aetna’s executives said on a recent conference call that they now expect the deal to close sometime in 2017. The company will owe Humana a $1bn termination fee if it does not clear the final hurdles.January 4 – Parties in the Anthem/Cigna trial will file their proposed findings from the second phase of the trial to Judge Jackson.January 31 – Original closing deadline for Anthem/Cigna merger. However, the parties have the option to extend that to April 30, 2017. Anthem is on the hook for a $1.85bn termination fee if the deal fails to close.End of January 2017 – Judge Jackson is expected to issue her ruling on Anthem/Cigna by the end of January, Anthem’s chief executive said on a recent conference call with investors. There is no indication about when Judge Bates will rule on Aetna/Humana, although all of the insurers have argued for a speedy resolution to help part the clouds of uncertainty that the litigation has created."
13;HUM;Humana Inc;2016-11-09T19:47:02Z;Health insurance stocks rally with Obamacare’s future in doubt;;Shares of a number of large US health insurers rose on Wednesday, in the wake of the election of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has pledged to repeal his predecessor Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act legislation.By mid afternoon, shares of four of the five largest US health insurers were in positive territory. Humana and Aetna’s stocks each rose more than 4.5 per cent, and Cigna gained 4.8 per cent. Anthem was up 2.1 per cent, while the largest of the five, UnitedHealth Group had pared some of its earlier losses to trade down 0.4 per cent.Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act has been dubbed, has been a mixed bag for these insurers. Since the law was enacted in 2010, 20m Americans have gained healthcare coverage, according to government estimates. But the influx of more people into the coverage pool has squeezed insurers, with several of them posting substantial losses as a result of plans offered on the Obamacare exchanges and eyeing an exit from some states’ markets. Recently, the US government said it expected insurance costs under Obamacare to jump by an average of 25 per cent next year.Republicans in Congress have attempted to repeal Obamacare numerous times, railing against its mandate that people buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty. But with Mr Trump in the White House, and Republicans winning majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives on Tuesday night, the odds of a rollback could be improving. This was underscored by comments from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who told Politico on Wednesday that repealing Obamacare is “pretty high on our agenda”.The “extent to which the president-elect’s policies will coincide with traditional Republican policies, given the limited number of his detailed and articulated positions at this time, remains to be seen,” wrote Fitch analyst Megan Neuburger in a note. “Successful efforts to repeal or materially replace the ACA would be a credit negative for healthcare providers as it is contributing to higher volumes of insurance patients.”But, she added:“Over the longer-term, healthcare companies will continue to invest in growth opportunities, as the fundamental outlook for the US corporate healthcare industry remains positive despite the election outcome…A repeal of the ACA may slow the nascent evolution toward value-based reimbursement schemes, but Fitch believes the shift toward linking pricing to patient outcomes will continue as patients and health insurers grapple with the growing burden of healthcare costs over the longer term.”

Plans with the most stars are entitled to certain perks, such as bonus payments, from the government.According to the report, Humana said the percentage of its July 31 membership in plans rated four stars or higher (out of five) had declined to just 37 per cent, or 1.17m, compared with 78 per cent, or 2.15m, the year before.It added that star ratings did “not accurately reflect the company’s actual performance” and it would seek reconsideration for some of them.The decline did “not take into account certain operational actions the company intends to take over the coming quarters to mitigate any potential negative impact of these published ratings on star bonus revenues for 2018”, Humana said.Humana had tried to soften the ratings blow by raising its profit guidance for the year.Elsewhere, investors cheered a move by Stanley Black & Decker to take over Newell Brands’ tools business for $1.95bn cash.Shares in the industrial and consumer hardware maker rose 2.9 per cent to $121.05, taking gains over the past 12 months to 19 per cent.Newell shares rose 2.2 per cent to $51.42.Investors in cyber companies were in need of security on Wednesday after Fortinet sliced its third-quarter outlook, blaming delayed purchases.The shares fell 10.1 per cent to $30.66 after the California-based company lowered its sales forecast from $316m to $311m, below earlier estimates of $319m to $324m and shy of analysts’ forecasts of $322.3m.Fortinet’s earnings outlook in the range of 15 to 16 cents a share was also below previous estimates and analysts’ expectations for 18 cents.Best Buy received a shot in the arm after an analyst gave a more upbeat second-half outlook.The electronic goods retailer jumped as much as 3.8 per cent to $39.77, its highest level in nearly two months.Cleveland Research said the “outlook for share gains and current trends in mobile both appear better” than 60 days ago.In the wider market, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 2,139.18, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.1 per cent to 18,144.20 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 5,239.02.

The star metric assesses the quality and performance of insurance plans based on certain factors, from a low of one star to the highest five stars, in an effort to help comparison shoppers. Plans with the most stars are entitled to certain perks, such as bonus payments from the government.According to the report, Humana said the percentage of its July 31, 2016 membership in plans rated four stars or higher has declined to just 37 per cent, or 1.17m, compared to 78 per cent, or 2.15m from the year before. It maintained that its Star ratings “do not accurately reflect the company’s actual performance” under applicable measures, and said it intends to seek reconsideration of some of those ratings.The decline “does not take into account certain operational actions the company intends to take over the coming quarters to mitigate any potential negative impact of these published ratings on Star bonus revenues for 2018,” the company said.Humana sought to soften the ratings blow by raising its profit guidance for the second time since announcing a planned $37bn merger with rival Aetna earlier this year.It now expects diluted earnings per common share for full-year 2016 to $8.80 on a GAAP basis, and about $9.50 on an adjusted basis – 25 cents higher than the last time it boosted its earnings guidance in July. Its third-quarter projections were also revised 30 cents higher, to $3.07 on a GAAP basis and $3.15 adjusted.

Such efficiencies don’t happen overnight; they require co-operation over months (if not years) to integrate the operations of these multibillion-dollar firms,” the DoJ said.“Because the breach letters reveal the current state of hostility between defendants, the letters evince barriers to integrating these firms and are relevant” to the defence’s case, said the DoJ.Anthem and Cigna declined to comment on the DoJ’s filing. Publicly the two companies have said they would fight the DoJ and continue to try to complete the deal.Anthem will be forced to pay $1.85bn if the deal falls apart. Anthem said in a separate filing earlier this year that Cigna would walk away if it cannot close the deal by April 30, when the transaction terms expire."

The company said it would stop selling plans in 11 of the 15 states where it operates and cancel its expansion plans.The public healthcare exchanges were launched in 2013 and were quickly billed as one of the biggest achievements of the Affordable Healthcare Act. Almost 13m Americans are covered by the plans, many of whom were previously unable to afford a commercial policy, or turned away by insurers for being too sick.However, the private insurers who sell plans through the marketplace have complained they are incurring significant losses, because the people who have signed up are much sicker and older than expected. Two of the largest insurers, UnitedHealthcare and Humana, recently announced plans to scale back their commitment to the exchanges.Aetna’s decision to pull back from the marketplace comes just weeks after the Department of Justice tried to block its $37bn takeover of Humana, and quickly sparked accusations that it was punishing the Obama administration for torpedoing its deal.Those accusations grew louder on Wednesday after a letter from Aetna to the DoJ was leaked, in which the insurer warned it would have to reduce its commitment to the exchanges if the deal was held up, and pull out altogether if it was ultimately blocked.“Instead of expanding to 20 states next year, we would reduce our presence to no more than 10,” said the letter dated July 5, which was signed by Mark Bertolini, Aetna chief executive. “It is very likely that we would need to leave the public exchange business entirely . . . should our deal ultimately be blocked.”Aetna did not respond to a request for comment.It is very likely that we would need to leave the public exchange business entirely . . . should our deal ultimately be blockedLast month, the DoJ filed a lawsuit to block the deal, and a second transaction: Anthem’s $48.6bn takeover of Cigna. Aetna and Anthem have vowed to appeal.Officials argued the consolidation would turn the health insurance market from one with five big players to three, with dire consequences for consumers and employers who foot the bill for the private system.In a Facebook post, Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator for Massachusetts, accused Aetna of using “the health of the American people . . . as a bargaining chip to force the government to bend to one giant company’s will”.However, critics of the Affordable Care Act, often dubbed ‘Obamacare’, seized on Aetna’s decision to pull back from the exchanges as further proof that the president’s landmark healthcare law is fundamentally flawed and needs to be repealed and replaced with something else.“Another health insurer is pulling back due to persistent financial losses on Obamacare plans,” tweeted Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.John McCain, the Republican senator for Arizona, said Obamacare was “unravelling at a rapid rate,” and warned “we’re going to have to go back and not only repeal, but replace and make healthcare available to every American.”In an interview with the Financial Times in March, Mr Bertolini said the Affordable Care Act “wasn’t going to be a disaster” and that the exchanges were “a very small portion of our business”, while calling on Republican and Democratic politicians to work together to improve the legislation.“If you look at every other social programme we’ve implemented through the New Deal, through the Great Society programmes, we always touch those programmes every year and make them better,” he said. “We have not touched this programme.”
18;HUM;Humana Inc;2016-08-05T16:32:56Z;US health insurers: knock on wood;There is nothing to fear but mean reversion;A casual reader of headlines might conclude that the US health insurance industry was in a nasty fight with a government determined to foil it. The feds are suing to stop mergers that would join four of the five largest players (the Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana deals). And UnitedHealth, biggest of all, has all but walked out on the individual insurance exchange business, a cornerstone of Obamacare.Any such impression would be wrong. The industry is on a multiyear run of rising profits and share prices. Government-sponsored programmes have been the main source of growth.Since Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, shares of the five biggest insurers have all outperformed the S&P 500. The two largest by market cap, UnitedHealth and Cigna, increased revenues and free cash flow at double-digit compound rates over the period.The key in this bonanza has been sedate US medical cost inflation, which protects underwriting returns. This trend has traditionally corresponded with economic growth, but the link seems to have weakened in the latest recovery. The market apparently expects this forgiving trend to continue. Aetna’s price/earnings ratio, for example, has risen from nine to 15.Another helpful trend was the surge in managed plan enrolment by beneficiaries of Medicare (the programme for the old) and Medicaid (for the poor). At UnitedHealth and Aetna, member growth has compounded at double digits in both plans. Obamacare significantly expanded Medicaid membership. Compared with these programmes, the healthcare exchange business is a footnote.Can the prosperity continue? Put aside the merger issue. Medicaid won’t expand again, but the growth in managed care by government plans seems set to continue. The cost trend is trickier. It did tick up a bit in 2014, the most recent year for which data are available. And when a trend break is hard to understand, the conservative approach is to bet on mean reversion.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
19;HUM;Humana Inc;2016-07-21T17:20:14Z;US justice department moves to block health insurance megamergers;DoJ files lawsuits to prevent Anthem’s $48.4bn takeover of Cigna and Aetna’s $37bn purchase of Humana;The US Department of Justice on Thursday moved to block two health insurance megamergers worth a combined $85bn, warning the deals would hurt competition and reduce the quality of care received by millions of patients.The DoJ said it had filed lawsuits to prevent Anthem’s $48.4bn takeover of Cigna and Aetna’s $37bn purchase of Humana, two deals that would have reshaped the private US healthcare system and shrunk the market from five big insurers to just three. Ten state attorneys-general also joined the DoJ’s efforts to block the mergers.“Competitive insurance markets are essential to providing Americans the affordable and high-quality healthcare they deserve,” said Loretta Lynch, the US attorney-general.She added: “These mergers would restrict competition for health insurance products sold in markets across the country and would give tremendous power over the nation’s health insurance industry to just three large companies.”The planned tie-ups are the latest in a string of big-ticket takeovers that have been thwarted by antitrust officials in the Obama administration, which has taken a much more active role in blocking large mergers and acquisitions than previous governments.Anthem accused the DoJ of basing its decision on “flawed analysis” and said it was “fully committed to challenging the DoJ’s decision in court”. The health insurer is required to pay Cigna a break fee of $1.85bn if the deal falls apart, even at the behest of regulators.Aetna also said it would “vigorously defend” its planned deal and that it was looking forward to making its case in court, “where a judge will review the transaction based on its merits”. The company would owe Humana $1bn if the tie-up were thwarted by antitrust officials.The DoJ said it was particularly concerned that Cigna and Humana, the smallest of the big five insurers, would disappear from the market, describing them as “two innovative competitors” and warning that their takeover would hinder efforts to reform the bloated US healthcare system.When the deals were hatched a year ago, many in Washington predicted the DoJ would eventually wave them through despite competition concerns, in an effort to support the 2010 Affordable Care Act.Health insurers have argued the law, commonly known as Obamacare, has made it harder for them to make a profit and said they need to consolidate in order to drive down costs and secure better terms from hospitals, doctors and drugmakers.But the DoJ said the mergers would reduce competition on the new public health insurance exchanges, which have provided coverage to more than 16m Americans who were previously uninsured, while also limiting choice for large employers that offer employee healthcare plans.So far under the Obama administration, the total value of large US deals abandoned following government intervention to either protect competition or block a company from moving its tax base abroad has risen to about $500bn, according to a Financial Times analysis.This year alone, the DoJ has torpedoed a $38bn merger between oilfield services companies Halliburton and Baker Hughes, while new tax rules introduced in 2016 by the government forced Pfizer to jettison its planned $160bn acquisition of Allergan.Several bankers and lawyers have criticised the administration for being anti-business, after a big increase in enforcement of antitrust rules amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions over the past two years.But others argue that the recent spike in blocked deals has more to do with the M&A cycle hitting a peak, as companies attempt to pursue larger deals that are riskier from an antitrust perspective.“The Obama administration is no more confrontational than previous Democratic administrations,” one lawyer told the FT ahead of the DoJ’s ruling on Cigna-Anthem.In the first six years of the administration, the DoJ, which together with the Federal Trade Commission is one of the main competition watchdogs, publicly challenged on average 17 deals a year from 2009 to 2014, the last year for which data are available.

21;HUM;Humana Inc;2016-07-19T20:55:04Z;US justice department plans to block two health insurance deals;Anthem’s $48bn Cigna purchase and Aetna’s $37bn bid for Humana under a cloud;The US Department of Justice in planning to block two health insurance megamergers worth a combined $85bn amid fears that the deals would push up premiums for patients and reduce competition.Federal antitrust officials will file lawsuits as soon as this week to thwart Anthem’s proposed $48.4bn takeover of Cigna and Aetna’s planned $37bn purchase of Humana, according to a person familiar with the matter.The merger of four of the largest players in health insurance would have turned the market from a “big five” to a “big three”, in a move that many had argued would have a chilling effect on choice while pushing up costs for consumers.“That’s not a lot of competition,” said Diana Moss, president of the non-partisan American Antitrust Institute, who said that both patients with private health insurance as well as those on government-funded schemes would have suffered if the deals had gone through.A DoJ spokesman declined to comment.An Aetna spokesman said: “We don’t comment on rumours or speculation but we are steadfast in our belief that this deal is good for consumers and the healthcare system as a whole.” When the deals were conceived about a year ago, many analysts predicted the Obama administration would wave them through to support the president’s far-reaching Affordable Healthcare Act, which was passed in 2009.Under the healthcare law, known as Obamacare, many insurers were subject to limits on the amount of profit they could make from patients on government-funded schemes, prompting them to argue they needed to bulk up to survive.At the time, an adviser to Cigna said: “There is a tacit understanding in Washington that consolidation is not something they care about, as long as cost and quality can be preserved.”However, the Obama administration has warned in recent months that it would act to block deals that seemed likely to reduce competition. In May, Halliburton abandoned hopes of acquiring Baker Hughes amid DoJ opposition.There is a tacit understanding in Washington that [sector] consolidation is not something they care about, as long as cost and quality can be preservedWord of the pending government action sent shares in Anthem and Cigna down by 2.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively. Humana fell 3.9 per cent while Aetna retreated 2.7 per cent. Merger partners that anticipate regulatory hurdles often try to mollify regulators with plans to spin off parts of the combined entity. But such solutions aren’t easily found in the case of big national deals, Ms Moss said.The proposed Anthem-Cigna marriage would have created the nation’s largest health insurer, measured by number of members, leapfrogging the current leader, UnitedHealth.“Negotiating a divestiture package with a firm with a national footprint is very, very difficult,” she said. “You’re basically trying to craft a remedy that would create a new national competitor.”Similar difficulties ultimately scuttled last year’s proposed Sysco-US Foods deal as well as the recent Staples-Office Depot hookup.The affected health insurers would likely sue to block the DoJ action, Leerink Research told clients. Anthem and Cigna’s chances of prevailing in court were “slim”, the company said.“It’s a tough case to litigate,” said one antitrust attorney. “I don’t love the odds.”On Wednesday, the market falls extended beyond the four health insurers in the DoJ’s crosshairs. Small health insurer shares also fell. WellCare Health dropped 0.4 per cent while Centene and Molina Healthcare were off by 0.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively.In Mr Obama’s first two years in office, proposed mergers already were eight times more likely to face a DoJ challenge than in 2005, according to a Financial Times analysis of government statistics.In 2015, the DoJ acted to block 20 deals — four times the figure from a decade ago. US companies have scrapped $370bn worth of large deals since 2009, including those abandoned in the face of a White House campaign to stem tax inversions. Justice department officials, such as Bill Baer who headed the antitrust division until April, have said publicly that Obamacare depends upon adequate competition among providers and insurers. The department’s antitrust experts also reject insurers’ arguments that they need to become larger to negotiate better with large hospital chains.Last month, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and six Democratic colleagues wrote to the DoJ opposing the two deals as bad for consumers. Dave Jones, California’s insurance commissioner, likewise urged the department to block the deal as anti-competitive.
22;HUM;Humana Inc;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Aetna set to raise $13bn in bond sale;;The record wave of bond sales in May has not fully quenched investor appetite.US insurer Aetna was poised to sell $13bn of bonds on Thursday across eight tenors, the third largest US corporate debt offering of the year, according to two people familiar with the transaction, reports US capital markets correspondent Eric Platt.The sale, which will fund the company’s acquisition of rival Humana, was set to include an 18 month floating rate note and fixed rate bonds maturing between two and 30 years,Orders for the sale were said to top $40bn, according to one source.Corporate bond sales have accelerated since a lull at the year’s start — a time when swooning commodity prices and rising volatility closed the door on new bond offerings. A rebound in markets opened the door for companies seeking to tap investors for fresh capital.Investment grade groups raised $176bn of debt in May, a record monthly haul that eclipsed the previous peak set in 2015 by $19bn, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data shows.The figures were buoyed by sales earmarked for takeovers and mergers, which eclipsed $5tn for the first time in 2015. Many bond offerings used to finance deals announced last year were held until the start of 2016, giving companies like Dell, Anheuser-Busch InBev and the utility Southern Co time to work through regulatory or other merger requirements.The more than $637bn raised by investment grade groups in the US this year has included $158bn to finance acquisitions, a record level, according to Dealogic. Those figures are expected to rise after the Aetna sale is completed later on Thursday.Guidance circulated to portfolio managers indicated that Aetna’s new 10-year note would trade with a yield 150 basis points above the benchmark US Treasury, or roughly 3.3 per cent. Bonds that hold a similar credit rating and maturity yield roughly 3.6 per cent, according to BofA figures.UBS and Citi led the sale, which will rank ahead of Apple’s $12bn take earlier this year but behind the $46bn haul by brewer AB InBev and $20bn sale from US computer maker Dell.
23;HUM;Humana Inc;2016-03-13T12:46:43Z;Mark Bertolini, Aetna CEO: mindful of mortality;The unconventional boss of the US health insurer distrusts hospitals and business school dogma;"When Mark Bertolini’s son, Eric, was struck by a rare type of cancer at the age of 16, his doctors said to prepare for the worst. “Forty-seven people had been diagnosed with the disease before, all of them men between the ages of 16 and 34, and they were all dead,” he recalls.Mr Bertolini, now chief executive of Aetna, the third-largest US health insurer, refused to accept Eric’s prognosis. He found an oncologist in Boston who was willing to try an experiment — a “bad” bone marrow transplant that would kill the cancerous cells.The transplant wiped out the cancer but Eric’s body rejected the bone marrow and he became extremely sick. “He went from 140lb to 80lb in a matter of months,” says Mr Bertolini. “He was starving.”It was then that Mr Bertolini quit his job as an insurance executive at Cigna and moved into his son’s hospital room to manage his care personally.He downloaded a copy of Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, a bible for junior doctors, and started having fierce arguments with the medics, who thought he was in denial about his son’s chances of survival.By 2003, Eric had made a full recovery, in part because his father had convinced regulators to let him take an unapproved medicine. Today, Eric works at State Street, the asset manager.Mr Bertolini returned to work with radically different views about the US healthcare system. “Lesson one was that they always viewed him as the lymphoma in room four, whereas I knew him from the delivery room when he was born,” he says. “Their view of him was as a disease, not a person.”Eric’s personal story is remarkable — not least because his father ended up giving him a kidney in 2007, following complications resulting from his cancer treatment.The reality of dealing with health insurers in the US tends to be less uplifting, however. Aetna achieved only a middling ranking in JD Power’s annual consumer satisfaction table in 2015. Customers tend to prefer not-for-profit health plans offered by rivals such as the Kaiser Foundation.Mr Bertolini, however, believes his personal experience can be applied to his vast employer, which has a market capitalisation of $38bn and 23m health insurance customers.He points to three changes he has made since taking the top job in 2010. Aetna now encourages people to travel to secure the best treatment, as Eric did. “People tend to want to be near home but when they travel for more than two hours to get specialised care, they have much higher survival rates,” says Mr Bertolini; the insurer has dropped a requirement that patients cease curative treatment before being admitted to a hospice, and it is collecting anonymised genetic profiles of members to glean “big data” insights into which drugs work best for which patients.His son’s illness has informed Mr Bertolini’s unconventional approach to running one of the larger US companies — which is poised to get even bigger with its pending $37bn acquisition of rival group, Humana — as has a horrific accident of his own.In February 2004, a year to the day after his son was discharged, Mr Bertolini smashed into a tree while skiing in Vermont, breaking his neck and back, injuring his head and damaging nerves. When he regained consciousness a week later, he found that he was alive only because he had fallen headfirst into a freezing river, which acted like an ice-pack on his spinal cord.His distrust of hospitals, which he says are “full of diseases”, kicked in. He discharged himself as soon as he could, clutching “all sorts of narcotics”, including the opioid painkillers that are handed out so liberally in the US.Despite being sceptical about alternative treatments, he found relief in craniosacral therapy, which some doctors have dismissed as quackery. “I was a total doubter,” he recalls.“Somebody’s going to hold on to my rear end and my head, and I’m going to feel better? Well, what the hell — I was all hopped up on drugs.”Three sessions in, he says he started to feel better; three months later he stopped taking painkillers.Unable to go on his daily run, Mr Bertolini turned to yoga, where he met his partner Mari, a yogi who trained in Chennai, India, in the 1980s. He quickly developed a passion for “the whole Hindu view of the world,” and he has tried to put this into practice at Aetna, which offers yoga and mindfulness sessions to staff.“Our chief medical officer said, ‘this is voodoo, don’t you know’,” says Mr Bertolini. “And I said, ‘well let’s do a study’.” More than 13,000 Aetna employees have since had a 12-week stint of mindfulness or yoga, and Mr Bertolini says it has resulted in “a dramatic increase in productivity”.He eschews the management texts beloved by other chief executives and accuses American business schools of “poisoning the economic thinking of every businessman in the world”, even though he has an MBA in finance from Cornell University. He also decries “these things called spreadsheets”.Instead, he turns to Hindu texts such as the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita for insights, as well as writings by Abraham Maslow, the late humanist psychologist, and Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the seminal book on income inequality by French economist Thomas Piketty, published in 2013.It was Mr Piketty’s book that encouraged Mr Bertolini to implement a company-wide pay increase last year, which set a $16 an hour minimum for all Aetna employees, equivalent to a one-third pay rise for some of its lowest-paid workers.Mr Bertolini took home $15m in pay, bonus and long-term incentive award in 2014, the last year for which figures have been disclosed, on top of $31m in 2013.Aetna has also improved its staff medical plan, which dramatically reduced the amount that low-paid employees had to contribute to their healthcare. “When I went out into the field to shake everybody’s hands, I kept hearing the same thing: ‘I can’t afford the healthcare, I’m working two jobs, my family’s on food stamps,’” he says.Mr Bertolini says the stories reminded him of his childhood in Detroit, where his father worked in the auto industry and his mother was a part-time nurse.“I too grew up in a family that didn’t have health insurance at times, that was on government programmes for cheese and bread and milk,” he recalls. “It wasn’t a bad life, but today it’s harder.”The Humana deal is expected to face tough scrutiny from antitrust authorities amid claims that it will reduce competition and drive up costs.Mr Bertolini thinks the opposite is the case, that Aetna’s size and its assured profitability will give him the freedom to experiment.“While I may be a little different as a CEO, in how I think about how to invest and play the game, I am very, very focused on making sure we deliver on our results,” he says. “Because that’s what gives us the ability to do the rest.”On his wrist, Mr Bertolini sports an expensive Swiss watch, a staple for many chief executives, and a nod to the conventional ways of big business, but he also wears two unusual black rings, one in the shape of a skull.He tells colleagues it reminds him that “time is short”."
24;HUM;Humana Inc;2015-07-27T14:40:45Z;Anthem/Cigna/Aetna/Humana: Health risk;Antitrust worries and management incentives;"Anthem has an agreed deal to buy Cigna for $188 a share; Aetna and Humana have shaken hands on $230 for each of the latter’s shares. All four health insurers have expressed confidence that the deals will be good for their customers. The market is worried that US antitrust regulators might not see it that way. Cigna’s shares are at $146 and Humana’s at $182. The targets, in other words, are trading at discounts of over 20 per cent to the deal prices.Surely the companies have hired the best antitrust lawyers money can buy — who in turn believe the deals stand a good chance of going through? Why else would the companies bother?This logic, which has been offered up by at least one cheery sellside analyst, is reassuring and wrong. Anthem thinks it can wring $2bn of annual cost savings from the Cigna deal. Taxed and capitalised those are worth about $13bn. If regulators block the deal, Anthem will owe Cigna a $2bn break-up fee. Even throwing a few hundred millions in fees for bankers and the lawyers, and assigning a cost to lost management time, it would be rational for the two companies to give the deal a whirl even if they thought it had a 50/50 chance of getting through. The same logic applies to the Aetna/Humana deal, where the targeted synergies are worth perhaps $8bn and the break-up fee is $1bn.The question of how the value of the cost savings is divided between buyer and target is important, given that the break-up fee falls only on the buyer. If deal premium gives most of the value to the target, then the buyer will require a higher probability of success. But the buyer’s leadership team will also have in mind the much higher pay that comes with running a much larger company.There may be good reason to believe that both deals will sail through. But investors should not assume that the leaders of the companies involved have made an unbiased, optimistic assessment of the odds.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
25;HUM;Humana Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Anthem agrees to buy Cigna for $48bn;If merger secures approval, the combined group will be the biggest health insurer in the US;US health insurer Anthem has agreed to buy rival Cigna for more than $48bn in the largest deal yet in the consolidating US healthcare sector.The tie-up, which values Cigna at $54.2bn including debt, would create the biggest health insurer in the US and comes as the industry is experiencing rapid change because of the Obama administration’s Affordable Care Act.The combined group would have revenue of about $115bn and serve more than 53m customers.The announcement comes just three weeks after Aetna agreed to acquire Humana for $37bn. If both deals are approved, the number of major US healthcare insurers would shrink from five to three.Steven Haas, partner at Hunton & Williams, the law firm, said Anthem and Cigna were under pressure to strike a deal. “In a rapidly consolidating industry, there is great risk that you end up being the last person standing and unable to compete. There was a chance of being left out in the cold.”Consolidation among health insurers has coincided with a deals boom among drugmakers and medical technology companies, with all the big groups in US healthcare facing pressure to become more efficient as Obamacare widens access to medical insurance.The Cigna-Anthem tie-up follows months of speculation and talks in which executives of the two groups had reportedly tussled over the management structure of the combined entity.The two companies said in a statement on Friday that Joseph Swedish, Anthem chief executive, would run the merged group, while David Cordani, Cigna chief, would be president and chief operating officer.Anthem said it was confident the deal would receive regulatory approval despite its size.But a person advising one of the groups had told the Financial Times that antitrust watchdogs could raise red flags given the two giant simultaneous deals. “The parties can expect a lengthy review process,” said Mr Haas.Under the terms of the agreement unveiled on Friday, Cigna shareholders will receive $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 of an Anthem share for each share they hold, which the companies say values Cigna’s stock at $188 per share.Cigna shares closed at $154.26 on Thursday.Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink, said the deal was “strategically and financially attractive”.Anthem was advised by UBS and Credit Suisse and those banks also provided financing for the deal, along with Bank of America. Cigna was advised by Morgan Stanley.News of the two companies nearing a deal was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
26;HUM;Humana Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Anthem closes in on $48bn Cigna takeover;Acquisition could face difficulty securing approval from regulators;Anthem is close to acquiring Cigna for more than $48bn, in what would be the second health-insurance deal to be spurred as a direct reaction to Obamacare.Anthem would value Cigna at $187 per share, said people involved in the negotiations.However, what could be the largest health-insurance deal in US history risks never being approved by antitrust regulators, admitted some people involved in the negotiations.A person advising one of the companies said that a deal could be announced in the next few days but added it would be hard for it to get approval from antitrust watchdogs, which are currently considering another health-insurance agreement. Aetna agreed to acquire Humana for $37bn earlier this month.“Getting two health-insurance deals approved one after the other is going to be very challenging,” another person said.If both deals were approved the number of US healthcare insurers would shrink from five to three.Advocates for consolidation argue that insurers will have greater leverage to curb costs when negotiating with healthcare providers.However, critics argue that by reducing the number of insurers will lead to higher premium as customers will have fewer options to chose from.News of the two companies nearing a deal was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
27;HUM;Humana Inc;2015-07-06T15:07:54Z;Low rates weigh on insurers even as it feeds their merger mania;Cheap borrowing and efficiency seeking fuel a boom in M&A with 2015 on track to be a record year;The announcement of three vast insurance deals within a week is a sign of the times.Last Tuesday, broker Willis said it would merge with consultancy Towers Watson in an $18bn deal. Within 24 hours, Ace struck the largest pure insurance takeover in the sector’s history with the $28bn acquisition of local US rival Chubb. By the end of the week, Aetna had topped the ranking with the $37bn takeover of Humana in the US health insurance market.The string of deals puts 2015 on track to be the biggest year on record for insurance mergers and acquisitions, according to data compiled by Dealogic. So far, so similar to countless other sectors, where a brightening economic outlook and ultra-low financing costs are combining to persuade company boards to spend record amounts on deals.In some ways, the latest takeovers are idiosyncratic. The brokerage deal is an attempt by Willis to narrow the gap with the big two in the sector, Marsh & McLennan and Aon. The Ace-Chubb combination is part efficiency-seeking, part empire-building. And Aetna’s acquisition is likely to be one of a number in US health insurance, where underwriters are seeking ways to boost negotiating power with ever heftier drugs groups at the same time as new healthcare legislation is incentivising cost savings.But there is one common theme, too. Across the landscape of insurance dealmaking, the biggest impetus for M&A is a turbocharged version of the driver behind much of the market-wide M&A boom: low interest rates.For insurers, zero rates doesn’t just mean free financing for buyers, as in any sector. There is an indirect, defensive spur, too. As investors, hungry for yield, have flocked into the underwriting market with alternative sources of capital, the added competition has driven down prices, in some areas to uneconomic levels. A merger is a natural response — done right, it should both strip out capacity and generate cost savings. Even in the broking segment of the market, low interest rates are playing their part. In their search for decent returns to match their commitments, pension fund clients are increasingly turning to the likes of consultancy Towers Watson for advice.The last time there was this intensity of deals, it did not end well. Fifteen years or so ago, Hank Greenberg, the legendary boss of AIG, was buying up the likes of American General for $23bn and SunAmerica for $18bn. It was not long before this large, sprawling group had become the biggest blow-up of the financial crisis. Last week’s Chubb takeover, driven by Ace boss Evan Greenberg, smacked uncomfortably of family rivalry and a desire to build an even larger business than his father did at AIG.All the same, the dealmaking seems pretty likely to continue. Even if interest rates start to rise, upward moves are likely to be slow. For many, cost savings through M&A look like the only way to boost returns on equity that often barely exceed 10 per cent.Opportunities abound. Insurance remains a fragmented sector, particularly in the US. Mutually owned companies are numerous, keeping pressure on commercially owned underwriters to cut costs to remain competitive.US deals, despite the complexities of state-by-state insurance regulation, are more likely than takeovers in Europe, where the incoming Solvency II regulations leave little opportunity for merger talks.The appetite for insurance M&A contrasts starkly with the dearth of deals in banking, where regulators are hostile to any combination that would exacerbate the risks of institutions already deemed “too big to fail”. Of course, big, complex insurance companies have themselves been made subject to regulatory penalties — nine insurers ranging from Allianz and Axa to Ping An and MetLife are deemed “systemically important financial institutions”, though the ramifications have yet to be detailed.For now, though, neither the risk of Sifi designation, nor the fear of bubble valuations is deterring fans of M&A.But a third danger may be looming from outside the insurance world. As those deals were being struck last week, the Financial Times held its Future of Insurance conference in London. Relatively few delegates seemed to take seriously the advent of new tech-savvy competitors disrupting the old world of insurance. Bulking up through M&A might be a decent way to thwart upstart competition. But the flipside risk — of being so internally focused that you ignore the fast-evolving market environment — is just as big.patrick.jenkins@ft.com
28;HUM;Humana Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Aetna to buy Humana for $37bn in cash and shares;Buyer’s shareholders will own 74% of combined group in tie-up that will add to M&A pressure on rivals;"US insurer Aetna has agreed a $37bn cash and shares deal to buy rival Humana in the latest sign of consolidation in the healthcare sector.The deal, approved by the boards of both companies, values Humana at $230 a share, representing a premium of 29 per cent on its undisturbed price on May 28.It follows weeks of speculation over possible deal permutations among America’s biggest health insurers as they seek greater scale and efficiency.This has been prompted in part by the introduction of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, which has spurred an influx of new customers into the market and created new incentives to control costs.The agreement between Aetna and Humana will increase pressure on rivals to strike similar deals; Anthem last month had a $45bn offer rebuffed by Cigna, while UnitedHealth, the market leader by revenue, is considering its options.Advocates for consolidation say it will help wring greater efficiency from the 18 per cent of gross domestic product the US spends on healthcare by giving insurers greater leverage to curb costs.Critics fear it will lead to higher premiums and reduced choice for customers, however. The US Justice Department is certain to expose the Aetna-Humana deal and any others that follow to tough scrutiny.Under the agreement announced on Friday, Humana stockholders will receive $125 in cash and 0.8375 Aetna common shares for each Humana share. Aetna’s shareholders will own 74 per cent of the combined company.Aetna said it would fund the cash portion of the deal with cash on hand, plus $16bn of new-term loans, debt and commercial paper.Investors have been speculating on a deal for Humana for five weeks since the Wall Street Journal first reported that the company was exploring a sale.Cigna and Aetna were considered the most likely potential suitors.The combination “brings together Humana’s growing Medicare Advantage business with Aetna’s diversified portfolio and commercial capabilities to create a company serving the most seniors in the Medicare Advantage programme,” the companies said in a joint statement.Consolidation appears to be coming, needed or notRead moreAetna said the merger would create the second-largest managed care company by revenue in the US.“We expect synergies from the transaction to be $1.25bn annually in 2018,” said Shawn M. Guertin, Aetna’s chief financial officer.The enlarged company’s debt-to-capital ratio is projected at 46 per cent; management wants it to be below 40 per cent within 24 months of closing the deal.A merger further consolidates an industry where five companies — UnitedHealth, Anthem, Aetna, Cigna and Humana — already dominate, providing coverage to 130m people.This year is set to be the strongest for global mergers and acquisitions since 2007 in terms of dollar value. By number of deals, this year is flat compared with 2014.Healthcare has been one of the busiest sectors for dealmaking with hundreds of billions of dollars in M&A among drugmakers, medical technology companies, pharmacy benefit managers and healthcare providers in the past year.These deals have increased pressure on health insurers to join the M&A rush as the various groups doing business in US healthcare seek to strengthen their negotiating power with each other.Analysts say last week’s US Supreme Court backing for the Affordable Care Act will accelerate the dealmaking by ensuring that tax subsidies will continue to help attract millions of new customers. At the same time as widening coverage, Obamacare also includes measures to encourage insurers to cut waste from the health system."

On 23 March 2010 the US Affordable Care Act — Obamacare — was passed. It was designed to ensure that more Americans had health insurance. It depended on health insurers to make that happen. Action: buy health insurers. Outcome: an index of the five largest (UnitedHealth, Anthem, Aetna, Cigna and Humana) has returned 270 per cent since. The S&P has only doubled.It did not look at all simple at the time. The impact of the law’s limits on profit margins was uncertain, as was the impact of the transparent insurance exchanges it mandated. Those worries have abated and, after the last big legal challenge to the law was swept aside last week, a frenzy of deals has ensued. Anthem (second in the market, by revenue) has bid for Cigna (fourth). Centene (sixth) bought Health Net (seventh). And on Friday Aetna (third) announced it would buy Humana (fifth).Time to close the trade? Merger arbitrageurs can still wager on which deals will get closed, of course. And UnitedHealth (the number one) could present a counterbid for one of the targets, or for Aetna.But there is the risk that one or more of the deals will fail, perhaps at the hands of the antitrust authorities. And the stocks are no longer cheap.Once they traded at a big discount to the wider market; now most are at small premiums. This for organic growth in the mid-single digits. Yes, the efficiencies the deals are designed to create are still to come — but they have already been paid for in premium cash and stock bids.

30;HUM;Humana Inc;2015-03-13T03:41:27Z;Michael Graves, architect and designer, 1934-2015;Creator of the Alessi kettle seen as a leading figure of postmodernism;A kettle with a whistling bird on its spout and a building in which the columns are replaced by the seven dwarves are among the stranger legacies of an architect who started out as a committed and strict modernist. Michael Graves, who has died aged 80, paved the way for a wholesale questioning of the banality into which modernism had descended by the late 1970s and his works were never less than striking.His huge Portland Building in Oregon, recently under threat of demolition, was a landmark in postmodernism, marking the moment when glass skyscrapers gave way to classical monuments. The boxy 1982 tower preceded by two years his friend and mentor Philip Johnson’s AT&T Tower in New York.Graves’ work might have been populist but it was by no means always popular. The Portland Building was largely disliked by those who worked inside it and those who walked past it. His later structures, including the Walt Disney headquarters replete with dwarves and swans in Burbank, California (1990), were critically reviled but they introduced humour and wit, bringing the showmanship of Disneyland to the city.He was also able to employ that flair in more popular markets, most notably with his whistling bird kettle (1985) for Alessi, which according to owner Alberto Alessi remains the Italian company’s biggest moneymaker and cult object.Michael Graves was born in Indianapolis on July 9 1934 to a livestock trader and a nurse, a Midwestern working class background that was unusual for an architect in those days. His mother used apparently to present the young Michael to guests as a drawing prodigy, “a performing Picasso” as his friend Charles Jencks described it. Graves went to study architecture at the University of Cincinnati and then at Harvard, going on to work briefly for the brilliant architect/designer George Nelson until he was awarded the Prix de Rome fellowship of the American Academy and spent two profoundly influential years in the Italian capital.He accepted a teaching post at Princeton (where he would continue to teach and live for the rest of his career) and founded his own practice in 1964. Graves was initially associated with the “New York Five”, a coterie of architects (the others were Peter Eisenman, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk and Richard Meier) who were all severe modernists infamous for using only white in their minimalist buildings and heavily influenced by Le Corbusier.But he was also the first apostate, flipping over to postmodernism in the mid-1970s. The classical details, the arches and the rustication allowed him much freer expression and his drawings, which were always exquisite, were arguably some of the most influential in postwar architecture. His 1978 graphite and crayon drawing for the Fargo-Moorhead Bridge, employing the whole depth of his art-historical references, is now in the permanent collection at New York’s Museum of Modern Art.The Humana Building in Louisville (1985) set the style for the overblown, operatic form of corporate postmodernism as branding.Graves was dismissive of the modernists’ claims to economy of style and efficiency, responding that their pseudo-functionalist buildings cost many times more than his and pleased only their architects. Graves had, however, become one of the first “starchitects” and his subsequent gradual fall from fashion shows that this star status remains precarious.Yet, more than perhaps any other architect, Graves succeeded in translating architectural sensibilities into the mass market, first with his products for Alessi and then for Target and JCPenney. His designs embraced everything from avocado scoops to ice scrapers and he succeeded where his modernist predecessors had failed — in bringing high design to the people at affordable prices.In 2003 Graves contracted a sinus infection and was prescribed antibiotics but, on a trip to Europe, he confused two sets of drugs and inadvertently failed to take them. The infection spread to his spinal cord and within days of returning to the US he was paralysed from the mid-chest down.His confinement to a wheelchair led to another spurt of creativity. Declaring of the hospital in which he spent 14 hours writhing in agony, “It’s far to ugly for me to die here,” he became a powerful advocate for improvements in healthcare design, everything from beds and bedside tables to whole hospitals.Graves’ own home, a converted storage facility in Princeton that he called The Warehouse, was stuffed with the objects that inspired him — classical fireplaces, busts and Biedermeyer furniture — all set against an industrial chic background. At its heart was a huge library, the shelves supported on an array of classical columns.He was apparently once asked to take over as head of UCLA’s architecture department and, when he looked around the institution’s library, he inquired how he would be able to teach in a school when his own library was three times the size of theirs. He stayed at Princeton. He was married twice, to his high school girlfriend in 1955 (with whom he had two children) and then to Lucy James in 1972. Both marriages ended in divorce.After his paralysis, Graves reserved his greatest affection for his caregivers, whom he credited with saving his life. He leaves a contested legacy — the future of his first great landmark is still uncertain but, with his products still selling and his drawings safely housed in galleries and archives, he still leaves more to high and popular culture than most great architects ever manage.
31;HUM;Humana Inc;2014-07-17T16:57:40Z;UnitedHealth climbs on surging sales;;US health insurance providers continued a year’s long ascent on Thursday as the country’s largest health insurer reported better than expected results, buoyed by healthcare reform.UnitedHealth, the Minnesota-based insurer, said sales jumped 7 per cent from a year earlier to $32.6bn, lifted by a surge in Medicaid enrolment linked to the Affordable Care Act.Profits at the company fell 2 per cent from the same period a year earlier to $1.4bn, or $1.42 per share. Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of $1.26 a share on sales of $32bn.The results are the latest to show the impact President Barack Obama’s signature law has had on the healthcare sector, lifting sales at hospitals and insurers as more consumers enrol in Medicaid or private health insurance purchased through an online exchange.Over the past year, 730,000 people have enrolled in Medicaid services offered by UnitedHealth, including 380,000 people in the second quarter.“We plan to grow next year as we expand our offerings to as many as two dozen state exchanges,” chief executive Stephen Hemsley said on a call with analysts. “This approach is consistent with our long stated plan to take a prudent first year position, and then build and expand in 2015 and 2016.”Analysts with Deutsche Bank called the results “solid”, particularly the “earnings beat from UnitedHealth’s Health Benefits business”.The industry broadly advanced following the company’s results. UnitedHealth shares climbed to all-time high by midday trading before paring back to $85.11 by close, a 2 per cent jump. Shares in WellPoint rose 1 per cent to $113.44, Humana jumped 3 per cent to $131.17 and Aetna increased 2 per cent to $83.68.SanDisk shares led the benchmark S&P 500 lower after the flash-memory producer forecast third quarter sales shy of Wall Street expectations.The company said it expected net revenues in the third quarter to range between $1.68bn and $1.73bn due to supply constraints in the second half of the year.Shares in the company sunk 14 per cent to $93.21, wiping nearly $3bn off the company’s market capitalisation.Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, who succeeded Steve Ballmer in early February, said the company would cut up to 18,000 jobs over the next year.In a memo to employees, Mr Nadella insisted the reductions, which will primarily impact the Nokia handset business, were “the first step to building the right organisation”.The shrinkage of Microsoft’s workforce is the single largest cull in the company’s history.“The headcount reduction related to the Nokia business indicates that Microsoft is not going to let Nokia become a potential ‘black hole’ of spend,” Kirk Materne, an analyst with Evercore, said.Shares of Microsoft rose 1 per cent to $44.53, its highest level since 2000.Yum shares tumbled 7 per cent to $77.01 after the company said its US business remained weak despite recent investments.The company behind the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, has ceded ground to rivals including Chipotle and Domino’s.Global sales rose 10 per cent from a year earlier to $3.2bn while profits increased 19 per cent to $334m, or 73 cents a share. Both figures matched analysts’ forecasts.“We are obviously disappointed with second-quarter results, particularly with the very poor performance in our US division,” chief executive David Novak said of Pizza Hut.Mr Novak said he now expected the unit’s full-year operating profits to fall “well short of our expectations”.Analysts with brokerage Jefferies said the domestic KFC business would also “continue to struggle” and commodity cost inflation would weigh on Yum’s margins.Mattel, which is best-known for its Fisher-Price and Barbie brands, reported a sharp drop in second-quarter profits on Thursday, with net income down 61 per cent from a year earlier to to $28.3m.With the exception of American Girl, Mattel’s key brands all sank in the quarter. Barbie sales were down 15 per cent, Fisher-Price fell 17 per cent and Hot Wheels slipped 2 per cent.The toy maker’s shares declined 7 per cent to $36.46.Overall, US equity markets declined after a Malaysian Airlines passenger flight crashed in Ukraine.The S&P 500 fell 1.2 per cent to 1,958.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9 per cent to 16,976.81.

32;HUM;Humana Inc;2014-02-24T22:12:30Z;Humana surges as health insurers avoid worst of government cuts;;Humana shares surged to a record high on Monday after the health insurance provider said US government funding cuts to the Medicare programme through the private market would be less than had been expected.US government payments into the Medicare Advantage plan would fall 3.5 to 4 per cent in 2015, the company said in a filing with US securities regulators. Executives had previously warned analysts and investors the drop could be as high as 7 per cent.The change in tone follows new payment guidelines from the US Department of Health and Human Services issued last Friday, stating that proposed changes would be “ smaller than those implemented in 2014”.The advance notice from the government estimates a 1.9 per cent drop in healthcare spending for Medicare Advantage policy holders.The Medicare Advantage programme generated nearly two-thirds of Humana’s $41.3bn of sales in 2013. The company expects to add between 370,000 and 410,000 subscribers to the programme over the current year.“The company is continuing to evaluate the changes detailed in the Advance Notice and the related impact company-wide and by geography,” Humana said.Shares in Humana rose 10.6 per cent to $113.69, while rivals UnitedHealth Group advanced 2.9 per cent to $76.01, Aetna added 1.9 per cent to $71.80, WellPoint climbed 2.7 per cent to $90.93, and Tenet Healthcare rose 3.1 per cent to $48.33.Verizon was having trouble finding its feet on its first trading day since it completed the purchase of Vodafone’s minority stake in its US wireless venture.Shares in the largest US wireless operator fell 2.2 per cent on Monday, following a trading update in which management said it expected consolidated revenues to grow 4 per cent in 2014 to about $125bn.This was a little slower than the 4.1 per cent advance a year earlier but in line with Wall Street forecasts.Verizon management also said it was targeting an increase in margins for both its wireless and wireline businesses as they continued to add subscribers.Lowell McAdam, chief executive, said the completed merger marked a “major milestone” for Verizon.Barclays analyst Amir Rozwadowski noted that volatility in Verizon shares would probably continue over the next three months as index buyers absorb shares.BlackBerry shares rose 7.5 per cent to $9.83 after the mobile device maker said it would make its messaging service, BBM, available to Microsoft’s Windows Phone and the upcoming Nokia X platforms.Deal activity saw shares in RF Micro Devices, a manufacturer of radio frequency equipment, surge 21 per cent to $7.03. It agreed to merge with TriQuint Semiconductor in an all-stock deal that will create a new company with $2bn in annual revenues. TriQuint shares jumped 26.1 per cent to $11.64.Shareholders in RF Micro and TriQuint, a parts supplier in the radio frequency sector, will receive an equal stake in the combined venture. Under the terms of the deal, TriQuint shareholders will receive 1.675 shares of the new company and RF Micro shareholders will receive one share, for each TriQuint or RF Micro share held.“The world’s demand for mobile data is growing exponentially,” RF chief executive Bob Bruggeworth said. “The combination of TriQuint and RFMD creates a new leader in RF solutions with expertise in mobile devices and complex infrastructure and global defence applications.Mr Bruggeworth will lead the combined company as chief executive, while TriQuint’s current chief executive Ralph Quinsey will serve as non-executive chairman.The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index broke into record territory, up 21.4 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 1,857.66, earlier in the day. It closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,847.61.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 103.84 points, or 0.6 per cent, at 16,207.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 29.56 points, or 0.7 per cent, at 4,292.97.
33;HUM;Humana Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

It is also plausible that traders anticipated such an outcome and bet accordingly.Humana shares rose 5.4 per cent to $79.11 amid high volumes.Shares in UnitedHealth Group, which were upgraded by analysts at Raymond James to “strong buy”, also rallied, adding 4.7 per cent to $61.74. Aetna and Cigna Corporation rose 3.7 per cent to $54.30 and 2.9 per cent to $64.75 respectively.The wider US stock market moved higher and the S&P 500 surpassed its previous record closing high reached last week, with sentiment boosted by better than expected factory orders data.The benchmark index advanced 0.5 per cent to 1,570.25 on Tuesday, hitting a new record high and only 6 points shy of the all-time intraday high reached in October 2007. Seven of ten main sectors were in positive territory, with gains led by healthcare stocks.“The way the stock markets treated today’s poor eurozone economic data indicates that they were pricing in a much worse outcome,” said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial.“It is slightly worrying that markets are not more concerned, given the importance of the region to trade,” he added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip stocks and is a price-weighted index, added 0.6 per cent to 14,662.01.Among consumer discretionary stocks, Urban Outfitters jumped 3.8 per cent to $39.87 after the company revealed in a 10-K filing that first-quarter comparable net sales were up in the high single-digits.Shares in Garmin, manufacturer of GPS devices, rose 5.1 per cent to $34.25 after it announced it would provide in-dash navigation for future Mercedes-Benz models.Housebuilders initially attracted buyers, with the S&P 500 homebuilder index up as much as 1 per cent in early trading. As the housing market has been slowly returning to health, boosted by record-low borrowing rates, homebuilders benefited, with the subgroup more than tripling since October 2011.Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist at Citigroup, is optimistic about further growth in the housing market, saying the turn in housing is being misperceived as almost over. “Given protracted stagnation in housing starts at historically low levels of activity, it would seem as if the recovery could last several years and gain strength,” he wrote in a research note.PulteGroup erased gains and was 1.3 per cent lower at $19.86, while DR Horton fell 1.8 per cent to $23.41.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite paired some of the earlier gains and closed up 0.5 per cent at 3,254.86, as its largest member Apple retreated from earlier advances to finish 0.2 per cent higher at $429.90.Shares in the iPhone maker sold off during the previous session as it bowed to Chinese pressure and issued a formal apology to consumers in its second-largest market. The stock has been declining since peaking at $702 in September 2012 and has lost more than 17 per cent since the start of the year.Nasdaq OMX shares tumbled 12.8 per cent to $27.91 as Moody’s put the exchange operator on review for downgrade. Nasdaq’s current credit rating is one notch above junk. The decision by Moody’s followed the announcement that Nasdaq OMX agreed to buy a US Treasury trading platform from BGC Partners in a $1.2bn cash and deferred stock deal.BGC Partners shares soared 48.6 per cent to $5.72.Hewlett-Packard shares suffered after analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to “sell”, saying that “consensus is attributing unreasonably high probability to HP turnround success and incorrectly assuming fundamentals have already bottomed”. Shares dropped 5.2 per cent to $22.10.
35;HUM;Humana Inc;2012-12-05T23:07:20Z;Companies in last-minute bond flurry;;Global corporations are attempting to raise this year’s final batch of funds at rock-bottom borrowing rates this week, taking no chances with the possible impact on US markets from the looming fiscal cliff.Investment-grade global borrowers such as chipmaker Intel and ConocoPhillips, the oil and gas group, tapped the US debt markets on Monday and Tuesday to sell a combined $13bn in new bonds at yields near historical lows, according to RBS and Standard & Poor’s LCD data.More debt sales took place on Wednesday, with Humana, a provider of Medicare benefits and Wisconsin Electric Power among companies which sold combined $2.1bn in debt in trade in New York. RBS estimates this week’s issuance may reach $25bn.The rush of new sales is coming after a strong performance in November. The month became the largest of the year for total corporate issuance, with sales of $135bn.Companies are now trying to squeeze in as many debt sales as possible in coming days ahead of an expected slowdown in activity later this month during the holiday season.Analysts said large corporate borrowers were also trying to beat a potential sell-off in markets at the start of January if US policy makers fail to reach a compromise on budget talks and avert the looming fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts.“There are really only about two good weeks of new issuance left in December,” said Ed Marrinan, head of macro credit strategy at RBS Securities.“Comments on the fiscal cliff are still likely to cause hiccups in risk assets in general, though we do not expect a deal to be reached until later in the year as the deadline approaches.”The combination of record low borrowing costs and strong demand for higher yielding alternatives to top-tier government bonds has pushed corporate debt sales in the US to their highest level on record, according to data tracker Dealogic.Global corporations took advantage of the sweet spot and have sold $1.1tn bonds so far this year.“Why not sell more bonds if you can?” said Adrian Miller, a director of fixed-income strategy at GMP Securities.“With rates at these low levels, the holiday season coming, and lack of definition on the fiscal cliff front . . . many companies just simply don’t want to wait. They will try to lock in funds at the lowest possible cost,” he added.Mr Miller said demand for the bonds was likely to remain high in spite of the flood of new debt sales as returns on the securities far outpaced those of government bonds.Average total returns year-to-date on US investment grade corporate bonds stood at 10 per cent on Wednesday, while those on US Treasuries were at 2.4 per cent, according to Barclays indices.Returns on US high-yield debt were even higher, at 14.3 per cent.
36;HUM;Humana Inc;2012-06-11T22:05:08Z;Insurers to keep key ObamaCare provisions;;The US’s leading health insurers are likely to maintain key parts of President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law even if the Supreme Court strikes down the legislation later this month, analysts say, following decisions by UnitedHealthcare, Aetna and Humana to institutionalise some of the provisions already in place.The court is expected to rule this month on whether to uphold the controversial law, derided by Republicans as “ObamaCare” but officially known as the Affordable Care Act, or to overturn it in part or in full.But rather than waiting for the decision, UnitedHealthcare, the largest American healthcare insurer with 38m members, said on Monday that it would continue some key benefits regardless of how the court rules.These include covering preventive healthcare services, such as immunisations and screening for high-blood pressure and diabetes, with no out-of-pocket charges, and allow dependants to stay on their parents’ health insurance plan until the age of 26.Other provisions that will be maintained include a ban on lifetime dollar maximums on most benefits and a more streamlined process to appeal claims decisions.“The protections we are voluntarily extending are good for people’s health, promote broader access to quality care and contribute to helping control rising healthcare costs,” said Stephen Hemsley, president and chief executive.Aetna, another big US insurer, quickly followed suit, saying that a number of provisions in the health reform law “have been woven into the fabric of our healthcare system, bring value to customers and consumers and should be maintained”.“We intend to keep provisions such as coverage for dependants to age 26, 100 per cent coverage for certain preventive care and access to appeals through independent third parties in our benefit plans, regardless of how the Supreme Court rules,” said Matthew Wiggin, an Aetna spokesman.Humana also tried to get ahead of the decision with its own promise to keep popular parts of the law.“Regardless of how the US Supreme Court rules on the federal healthcare reform law, Humana is committed to keeping in place important patient protections contained in the law,” the company said.Analysts said the moves made sense.“This is a case where the Affordable Care Act has dragged the horse to water and the horse has decided to drink,” said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan health policy group.“I think some others are likely to follow suit because it probably adds to their competitive advantage in the market place, and these provisions are relatively inexpensive and very popular,” he said.Edward Miller, dean of the Johns Hopkins University school of medicine, agreed that “the train has already left the station”.“So many people have moved past this [question of whether the healthcare law should stand] already and we’ve started to see insurance companies bundling payments and employers looking at new innovations,” Dr Miller said.Other leading insurers including WellPoint and Blue Cross Blue Shield did not comment on Monday.Ana Gupte, a healthcare analyst at Bernstein Research, said that UnitedHealthcare was showing leadership and also currying favour with the US government and its customers by keeping the provisions. She suggested that the costs of rolling back features that have been put in place might be higher than retaining them.Mr Obama’s signature healthcare law, passed by Congress with the narrowest of margins two years ago, has been controversial, with Republicans criticising it as an over-reach of government power.The 2010 law introduced the “individual mandate,” a requirement for everyone but the very poor or those with religious objections to buy some kind of health insurance. It also banned insurers from declining coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions.The Supreme Court could repeal the whole law or just part of it – most likely the mandate – or let the entire act stand.The move by UnitedHealthcare presupposes the court overturning the entire law.However, insurers are bracing for the possibility that the mandate is struck down but the rest of the law is upheld, forcing them to offer coverage to sick people without the additional healthy customers to help defray the costs.“If that happens, the bill in the long term is not workable,” Mike McCallister, chief executive of Humana, told the FT last week. “Without the mandate, guaranteed issuance falls apart. You have to eliminate gaming of the system where people buy coverage after they get sick.”UnitedHealthcare, Aetna and Humana signalled they would stop offering coverage to children under the age of 20 with pre-existing medical conditions, with the former explaining that “one company acting alone” cannot shoulder this burden.Nor did they address another key component of the law that is already in effect: the requirement that health insurers spend at least 80 per cent of premium dollars on health-related costs, not on administration.Mr Altman of Kaiser said that the companies could hardly be blamed for this. “I don't expect them to voluntarily do things which are painful for them or would hurt their bottom line without regulatory relief,” he said.
37;HUM;Humana Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Obamacare: an unhealthy focus;Insurance investors must be careful not to focus too much on the individual mandate;If Congress required every American to own a garden gnome, you would not expect the kitsch industry to rally if the Supreme Court expressed hostility to that law. But on Thursday, following arguments in which judges hit defenders of the Affordable Care Act with pointed questions, the biggest US health insurers got a boost: UnitedHealth, Aetna, Cigna, and Humana were all up between 3 per cent and 6 per cent.That is because from the point of the insurers, the law is double-edged. The requirement that everyone buys insurance (the so-called individual mandate) is accompanied by consumer-protection rules, most notably that insurers neither reject customers, nor charge them differently, depending on their health – only according to age, family size, location and tobacco use. The market was celebrating the judges’ apparent disinclination to toss the individual mandate but not the rules. That would have killed the potential for new customers while retaining a threat to margins.But take a step back. According to the Census Bureau, 56 per cent of non-elderly Americans – those not covered by Medicare – have employer-provided insurance. They are already protected by rules like the ones the Act would apply to everyone. Another 19 per cent have Medicaid (government insurance for the poor) or other government insurance. It is only the remaining quarter of the population, individual buyers of insurance and the uninsured, who are the primary targets of the law. And many of those would be covered by the law’s expansion of Medicaid, not by private plans. The reality is that insurance profits come mostly from employer-provided insurance (and managing government plans), and this will continue regardless.Insurance investors must be careful not to focus too much on the individual mandate.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Stifel is up 19.3 per cent to $38.25, and Raymond James has gained 14.8 per cent to $35.54 so far this year, but only Greenhill, whose shares have surged 33 per cent to $48.40, is matching the 25 per cent plus returns of BofA, Citi, Morgan Stanley and Goldman.Although banks have been among the leaders in the US equity rally so far this year, other stocks linked directly to capital markets have underperformed. Exchanges are lagging the S&P 500 by 5.5 per cent while trust banks have underperformed by 4.2 per cent.On Monday, Craig Siegenthaler at Credit Suisse also warned clients not to be tempted by shares in asset managers, as the strong equity market rally has not been matched by significant mutual fund inflows.“We see valuations remaining at depressed levels due to continued weak long-term flows in 2012,” he told clients.Money managers Franklin Resources and Federated Investors were both off 0.2 per cent to $116.22 and $18.65, respectively.Elsewhere, US stocks opened sharply lower, following the lead of global indices, which had sold off as a breakdown in negotiations once again raised fears of a Greek default.But, not for the first time this year, US stocks rallied once European markets closed, and the S&P 500 closed off just 0.04 per cent at 1,344.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,845.2, and the blue-chip heavy index remains close to its three-year high hit Friday.While Greece dominated headlines, disappointing earnings continued to weigh on individual stocks.Food wholesaler Sysco fell 3.6 per cent to $29.79. Quarterly profits fell slightly as the company absorbed food cost inflation of 6.3 per cent, almost 2 percentage points higher than in the year-ago period.Humana fell 5.4 per cent to $85.25 after the company, which provides healthcare to seniors under the government’s Medicare scheme, disappointed analysts with its earnings guidance for 2012.With the majority of S&P 500 fourth-quarter results reported, negative guidance for the current quarter has outpaced positive guidance two to one.That has raised concern among analysts for the sustainability of the rally, which has seen the S&P 500 climb 6.9 per cent this year.“Some improvement from the macroeconomic or earnings outlook will be needed to support a continued rally in equities,” Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital, told clients.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch surged 8.1 per cent to $43.78. But despite the temporary lull in selling pressure, the clothing retailer, which saw a year on year fall in holiday same store sales, remains the weakest performer in the S&P 500’s current bull run. Shares are down 26 per cent since October 3.Pharmacy benefits manager Medco Health Solutions fell 6.3 per cent to $59.62 on reports the company’s acquisition by rival Express Scripts may be blocked. Express Scripts shares also fell 4 per cent to $50.00.Social media stocks, which enjoyed a two-day Facebook filing-fuelled surge on Thursday and Friday, gave back some of their gains.Offers website Groupon fell 3.8 per cent to $23.51 and professional networking website LinkedIn fell 0.2 per cent to $79.76.Zynga, whose online games accounted for 12 per cent of Facebook revenue in 2011, fell 4.6 per cent to $12.77. The stock remains 35 per cent up for the year after a 33 per cent surge last week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index remained at levels not seen since the dotcom bubble 11 years ago, despite slipping 0.1 per cent to 2,901.99.

Attempts to sell the company to Interactive Brokers failed over the weekend.MF Global’s market capitalisation had fallen by two-thirds last week, with the shares valued at $1.20 when trading was suspended.The S&P 500 index fell 2.5 per cent to 1,253.30, its second worst day of the month. European concerns returned to the fore as Italian bond yields approached euro-era highs. Monday’s losses left the benchmark US index up 10.7 per cent for October, still the best month since December 1991.Half of Monday’s losses came in the last hour as the Euro fell against the dollar.“It was a day of profit taking that accelerated at the end of the day,” said Ryan Detrick, chief investment strategist at Schaeffers. “That makes sense given the strength of last week’s rally. I’m not too worried as long as the market holds here.”Utilities and consumer staples held up best. Cyclical energy and material stocks suffered the worst, down 4.4 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively.Solar stocks were left particularly bruised after the UK government proposed a 55 per cent cut in its solar subsidy scheme.First Solar was off 7.8 per cent to $49.77 and MEMC Electronic Materials was off 9.8 per cent to $5.99.“The entire solar industry is subsidised and, when you look at any region, subsidies are under threat everywhere apart from China,” said Ben Pang, alternative energy analyst at Caris and Company.Oil driller Nabors Industries fell 3.8 per cent $18.33, although it had traded in positive territory most of the day, despite revealing it had paid $100m to chairman Eugene Isenberg after he relinquished his post as chief executive.The company, which is based in Bermuda, has faced shareholder rebellions in the past over compensation paid to the estates of deceased executives and executive pay.“It’s a huge payout and again Nabors shareholders are the losers,” said Peter Flaherty, president of the National Legal and Policy Center, a shareholder activist group, which holds Nabors stock. “It seems that Isenberg has absolutely no regard for appearances, even when corporate excess is under scrutiny.”Nabors did not comment on the payout.Financials, which had benefited most from improving sentiment towards Europe, were also sold off.Insurers were worst hit. Lincoln National was off 11 per cent to $19.05 and Genworth Financial fell 6.9 per cent to $6.38.Asset managers and investment banks also suffered. Money manager Janus Capital was off 9.1 per cent to $6.56, while Morgan Stanley dropped 8.6 per cent to $17.64 and Goldman Sachs was off 5.5 per cent to $109.55.Yahoo fell 5.6 per cent to $15.64 on reports the company may dispose of Asian assets, rather than be acquired as a single business.Humana was the stand-out performer in the S&P 500. The health insurer jumped 5.7 per cent to $84.89 after forecasting full-year earnings of between $8.35 and $8.40 a share, which would represent a 20 per cent jump on last year’s profit and is a big improvement on a previous estimate of $7.50 to $7.60 a share.Humana benefited from having a higher proportion of customers covered by Medicare – the government healthcare programme for senior citizens – and from low customer claims.The company predicted 2012 earnings per share will moderate to $7.40 to $7.60.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.3 per cent lower at 11,955.7 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.9 per cent to 2,684.41.But despite scepticism about the sustainability of last week’s rally, some strategists at big US banks advised clients to position for further gains.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, urged clients to hold more material stocks, arguing valuations remain “in the cheapest quintile versus history”, despite last week’s rally.Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou at JPMorgan Chase said the rally could gather further steam as hedge fund managers “increase their equity exposure given their poor performance this year, as they attempt to recover their losses”.Electronic broker Charles Schwab released a survey showing the majority of its clients still expect the S&P 500 to rise through to the end of the year.Diversified energy and commercial property holding company Loews was down 3.8 per cent to $39.70 despite reporting third-quarter profits of $162m, or 40 cents a share, compared with only $36m in the 2010 third quarter. Analysts had been expecting 54 cents a share.Healthcare real estate investment trust HCP Inc fell 0.9 per cent to $39.88 after funds from operations in the third quarter rose to 63 cents per share, up 16.7 per cent from the same quarter in 2010.

Taleo Corporation, which sells human resources software to businesses, was up 7.9 per cent to $31.61. SuccessFactors, which markets business education courses, rose 9.3 per cent to $26.24.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.4 per cent to 2,699.44 at the close.The S&P 500 advanced 1.3 per cent to 1,254.20, its highest close since the start of August, and decisively above the 1,220 to 1,230 range where two previous rallies stalled in recent months.The Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 closed below 30 for only the second time since early August. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” had been above 30 for most of August and September.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent to 11,900.03.“EU debt negotiations didn’t go off the rails over the weekend, and it appears that some progress may have even been made toward an agreement,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.The rally was broadly cyclical with material and industrial stocks in the S&P 500 up 2.3 and 1.7 per cent respectively. Both sectors were helped by a better than expected “flash” purchasing managers’ index survey in China.Alpha Natural Resources, which supplies China with metallurgical coal for use in the manufacture of steel, was up 9.5 per cent to $23.79. Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan was 8 per cent higher at $23.79.The defensive utility, telecom and consumer staples sectors were the only S&P 500 components to fall.Caterpillar surged 5 per cent to $91.77, after the company reported record revenues and delivered earnings per share of $1.71, a full 15 cents higher than the average analyst expectation in a Bloomberg poll.The company raised its 2012 earnings outlook by a fifth, and said global economic uncertainty had not fed through to demand for its earthmoving equipment.Shares in health insurer HealthSpring surged 33.7 per cent to $53.71, after rival insurer Cigna announced it would purchase the company for $3.8bn.The deal values HealthSpring at $55 a share, and would give Cigna access to HealthSpring’s customer base. HealthSpring sells premium insurance to customers eligible for Medicaid, the federal health insurance programme for retirees. Cigna shares were down 0.6 per cent to $45.34.The deal helped Humana, another health insurer focused on Medicare-eligible clients, gain 4.8 per cent to $79.93.In the property sector, Citigroup analyst Josh Levin released a note arguing that “the structural excess supply of homes is exhausting itself.“The inventory of existing homes for sale [3.48m in September] has been declining on a year on year basis for the past eight months and now stands at a multiyear low,” Mr Levin told clients.Although he warned the “shadow inventory” of homes in foreclosure could yet add to the housing stock, homebuilder shares continued their strong October rally.The SPDR Homebuilders exchange traded fund, which tracks the return on homebuilders listed in the S&P 500 was up 2.9 per cent to $16.49. The ETF has risen 30 per cent in three weeks, after hitting a low of $12.30 at the start of October.Lennar Corp, considered one of the healthiest of US homebuilders because of its low debt levels, was up 1.7 per cent to $17.02, a gain of 33.6 per cent since October 4. PulteGroup, a more volatile stock carrying high debt, was up 6.3 per cent to $5.21, a gain of 47.2 per cent since October 4.Commercial property service provider CB Richard Ellis Group surged 9.5 per cent to $16.74.Lorillard, the maker of Newport cigarettes, fell 0.6 per cent to $114.97 after earnings per share of $1.94 came in below average analyst expectations. Gross profit of $563m was $3m lower than the same quarter last year, as higher costs offset increased sales of cigarettes and higher pack pricing.Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of Kleenex and other household brands, fell 4.6 per cent to $69.65. Earnings per share of $1.26 were in line with expectations, but net income fell to $432 million compared with $469 million in the same quarter last year.Sprint Nextel was down 2.9 per cent to $2.69, as a judge weighed whether to dismiss the third-largest US mobile network’s opposition to the takeover of T Mobile by its AT&T.
41;HUM;Humana Inc;2011-10-24T17:05:54Z;Cigna to acquire HealthSpring for $3.8bn;;Cigna, the US health insurer, said on Monday that it acquired HealthSpring, which sells health insurance to senior citizens, for $3.8bn as it looks to capitalise on an ageing US population.Cigna will pay $55 a share for HealthSpring in a cash deal that represents a 37 per cent premium above HealthSpring’s closing share price from last Friday. To finance the acquisition, Cigna said it would issue new stock and additional debt.“The seniors market in the US is a very large market and because of demographics it will be growing in the next decade,” David Cordani, Cigna’s chief executive, told the Financial Times.HealthSpring sells Medicare Advantage plans, which are private versions of the government health insurance plans that senior citizens receive that are subsidised and come with additional benefits. The company currently has 340,000 members in 11 US states.The deal surprised some analysts, as Cigna has recently been looking to international markets for growth.“Cigna’s acquisition of HealthSpring is a surprise, not because of the seller, as Medicare has been a rapidly consolidating industry this year, but because of the buyer, as Cigna hasn’t expressed a lot of interest recently in becoming bigger in government business, with their near universal focus on growing internationally,” noted said Carl McDonald, a Citigroup analyst.Mr Cordani said that the seniors market has been the company’s second priority after international acquisitions and that it will also be looking for opportunities in the US retail insurance market.Health insurers have been consolidating after last year’s sweeping healthcare reform legislation. Ongoing legal battles have left the future of the law uncertain, but insurers have been making bets on senior care as a growth area.“Changes in healthcare reform are stimulating more change in the marketplace and more opportunities for those ready to embrace that change,” Mr Cordani said.In June, WellPoint, another health insurer, acquired CareMore, a Medicare specialist insurer, for $800m. Last month, Humana sought to boost its Medicare offerings through the acquisition of MD Care.Shares of Cigna slipped 0.56 per cent to $44.45 in midday trading, while HealthSpring’s stock price jumped 33.1 per cent to $53.47. The deal boosted the sector, with shares of Humana, Universal American and WellCare all rising.The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year and Cigna said it would add to its earnings per share within a year. Herbert Fritch, HealthSpring’s chief executive, will stay on and lead the division after the transaction is finalised.Morgan Stanley advised Cigna, while Goldman Sachs advised HealthSpring.
42;HUM;Humana Inc;2011-08-01T22:03:18Z;Humana: kneejerk reaction;;"Poor Humana. The health insurer had good earnings to report. But it does business primarily with the US government, and the results were published Monday, the day the debt ceiling agreement was announced. Two-thirds of Humana’s premium revenue comes from Medicare, the federal plan for the elderly; it dabbles in Medicaid (for the poor), and covers military families as well. The federal business is performing well. Medicare enrolment rose nearly 10 per cent year over year last quarter; medical costs were tame and profits easily beat expectations.The market had little time to notice. News that the debt deal included possible cuts to reimbursement for Medicare providers (hospitals, doctors, etc) sent Humana down as much as 5 per cent after its report. The fact that Humana was hit no worse than its peers such as WellPoint and Aetna, who have less government exposure, reflects the tentative nature of the deal, the fact that the cuts only come if Congress fails to agree on other deficit reduction and that provider cuts have only an indirect impact on payers like Humana.But there is also a bigger issue in play. The federal deficit problem is largely a healthcare problem. Health programmes, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, will account for four-fifths of the increase in federal non-interest spending as a per cent of output over the next 25 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. If the authorities decide that private companies have the best tools to change this, Humana is ideally positioned. Private insurers managed only about 20 per cent of the $1,200bn the government spent on healthcare in 2010, according to Credit Suisse.

Although Citi analysts said this was not as bad as the industry had expected, the cuts were not yet final and could increase.Citi said it expected “there to continue to be some overhang on defence names until a deal gets done”, but the key details of defence spending would probably be released in the strategic review due in September.After the bell, the S&P 500 index fell 0.4 per cent to 1,286.95, the Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.4 per cent to 2,744.61, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 12,132.49.Last week, the S&P 500 registered its worst weekly performance in a year and markets fluctuated on the news of the negotiations and the growing possibility of default.The indices were also hit by weaker-than-expected Institute of Supply Management figures indicating that the pace of US manufacturing growth was slowing.Some analysts saw some hope, at least over the short term, for bulls.“Over the near term, a solution to raising the debt limit will probably result in a strong rally, given stocks are deeply oversold and near support, which is at 1,250 to 1,270 using the S&P 500,” said Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Baird. “But the ramifications of GDP growth of less than 1 per cent for the first six months of the year will linger.“Looking further out, the question now becomes whether the weak economy can endure the austerity programmes planned for the second half of the year,” he said.Healthcare facilities were some of the biggest losers after Friday’s after-market news that nursing homes lost a lobbying fight with Medicare that will cost the industry more than $3.8bn next year. The federal government’s healthcare programme for the elderly is cutting its payment rate by 11.1 per cent to help compensate for overbilling.Sun Healthcare Group lost 52.14 per cent to $3.35, Skilled Healthcare Group fell to $5.06, a 42.5 per cent drop, and The Ensign Group slid 22.2 per cent to $22.09.US insurers slipped on news that the US department of health and human services had signed off on recommendations to include contraception in preventive care.While not slated to go into effect until next year, analysts said it would force insurance companies to increase premiums. The S&P healthcare sector was down 1.71 per cent.Concerns that some of the spending cuts from the debt deal will affect Medicare and other healthcare services also hit the sector.Among health insurers to fall were Cigna, down 4.3 per cent to $47.63, Aetna, off 2.9 per cent to $40.29, and United Healthcare, 3.2 per cent lower at $48.02.Humana, the US health insurer, also fell despite forecast-beating results. It reported a second-quarter profit and raised its earnings forecast by more than 10 per cent but shares fell to $72.36, a 2.9 per cent loss.The company would have raised its full-year guidance further, Citi analysts said, but plans to increase non-production spending in the second half could have an impact on results.Allstate, the home and car insurer, reported a second-quarter net loss of $620m after a spring of tornadoes, flooding and other natural disasters, but the loss was less than markets had anticipated. In the quarter, losses from catastrophes reached more than $2bn, the most disclosed by any publicly traded US insurer. Its shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.34.Shares in Ford Motor rose despite news that the US car company was recalling 1.1m pick-up trucks because of a risk of the gas tank falling off and causing fires. Shares were up 1.1 per cent to $12.35.Late on Sunday, HSBC agreed to sell 195 branches in upstate New York to First Niagara, the Buffalo-based bank, for $1bn in cash. Shares in the regional bank, which merged with NewAlliance Bancshares for $1.5bn last year, fell 2.7 per cent to $11.92.Loews, the US insurance and property group, was hit by higher catastrophe losses and lower income from its biggest holding, CNA Financial.Missing market expectations, it reported earnings per share of $0.62 versus an expected $0.74. Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $39.11.
44;HUM;Humana Inc;2011-05-24T21:32:45Z;US financials lose ground;;Shares in AutoZone jumped after the company reported better than expected quarterly earnings, but the wider markets were broadly flat as investors remained wary following the sharp sell-off in the previous session.Shares in the motor parts retailer were up 6 per cent to $293.30 after reporting a 12 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings as sales and margins improved.Analysts had worried that high petrol prices might hurt sales as consumers are driving less and therefore need to replace parts less frequently.Earlier in the month, Advance Auto Parts, a smaller rival to AutoZone, disappointed investors with its quarterly results. Auto Parts is down 5 per cent this month at $62.54.The S&P 500 index closed broadly flat, edging less than 0.1 per cent lower to 1,316.28.Most sectors were slightly lower – following the 1.2 per cent sell-off in the previous session – as sentiment continued to be downbeat over the eurozone debt crisis and global growth concerns.Financial stocks continued to lose ground. Shares in Capital Onewere down 2 per cent to $53.03 while the Bank of New York Mellonfell 1.2 per cent to $27.49. The S&P financial index lost 0.5 per cent.Healthcare stocks were also lower. United Health Group lost 2.4 per cent to $47.96 while Humana fell 1.6 per cent to $78.The S&P healthcare sector was down 0.3 per cent, although it is still up 7.3 per cent since the start of the second quarter as investors have recently been moving from cyclical stocks into more defensive areas.Sentiment across the markets was helped slightly by better than expected housing data. The number of new home sales rose 7.3 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 323,000, ahead of the 300,000 expected.But this was still weak and so did not cheer investors too much.“The outcome was better than generally expected, although still miserable in absolute terms,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The losses in the wider markets were limited primarily by the rebound in energy and material stocks.In the energy sector, a bounce in the oil price helped Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, climb 1.5 per cent to $83.28 while Halliburton rose 2.9 per cent to $47.50.The S&P energy index was up 1.3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 3 per cent to $48.82 while Consol Energy, the coal miner, added 1.3 per cent to $48.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,356.36 in cautious trading. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,746.16.These larger indices have lost ground for the past three weeks as weak economic data have sparked concerns that interest rate rises globally are beginning to slow economic growth.“This has aggravated suspicions that the US economy may have entered a soft patch, not unlike in the spring of last year,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.Last year the S&P fell 11.7 per cent from the start of April to the end of August on concerns over a double-dip recession.In corporate news, shares in Yandex, the Russian search engine, rocketed on its first day of trading.The Russian group was up as much at 144 per cent in early trading, although it settled at a more modest 55.4 per cent gain from its initial public offering price at $35.20. Yandex was priced on Monday night at $25 a share, valuing the company at $8bn.The jump in price was small compared with LinkedIn last Thursday, when shares in the business-focused social networking site jumped 109.4 per cent to $94.25 on their first day of trading.LinkedIn was up 8.1 per cent to $95.45 on Tuesday, in spite of restrictions having been lifted on short selling the stock, which pared all of the losses seen since the first day of trading on Thursday.Elsewhere, shares in El Paso Corp were up 6.5 per cent to $20.22, the best performing stock on the S&P 500, after the natural gas group announced it intended to separate its exploration and production unit from its pipeline and midstream businesses.Medtronicwas down 0.9 per cent to $40.88 after the medical devices company reported fourth-quarter earnings down 19 per cent on restructuring and other charges. Revenues were up slightly and better than expected, however.
45;HUM;Humana Inc;2011-03-23T17:31:45Z;US insurers start to feel better about healthcare;;Investors fled the US health insurance sector last year as the Obama administration sparred with insurers over soaring premiums, and debate about a government-run system raised fears the companies could be put out of business.But a year since the passage of healthcare reform, the outlook for the big US insurers has brightened, with rising stock prices, profits and dividends suggesting that those that resisted the law the most had little to worry about.“Investors are cheered that healthcare reform has turned out to be better than expected,” said Ana Gupte, a healthcare analyst at Sanford Bernstein.Share prices have risen this year. The iShares Dow Jones US Health Care exchange-traded fund is up almost 10 per cent since the beginning of January, easily outpacing the S&P 500, which has advanced by almost 3 per cent.“They [insurers] were the target of a lot of rhetoric,” said Les Funtleyder, fund manager and healthcare strategist at Miller Tabak. “What you had is depressed valuations on reform fears, combined with improving business conditions, which is a recipe for share price appreciation.”Earnings have also been robust. According to an analysis by Health Care for America Now, which backed reform, profits at five of the biggest US health insurers – United Health, WellPoint, Aetna, Cigna and Humana – rose by 17 per cent from the end of 2009 to the end of 2010, reaching a total of almost $12bn.Insurers say they have been helped by a weak economy that deterred people from seeking non-essential medical care and an unusually impotent flu season. New consumer protections that have been rolled out have so far not been as costly as some predicted.Aetna signalled its brighter outlook last month when it raised its quarterly dividend from a penny to 15 cents a share. And Joseph Zubretsky, Aetna’s chief financial officer, confirmed that sentiment in early March when he said “As reform became clear, as the economy at least settled, we became increasingly confident in our financial profile and our strategy”.Wayne DeVeydt, chief financial officer at WellPoint, said at a health care conference last week that a recovering economy and normal flu patterns could raise costs, but he acknowledged that “health care reform really plays into our sweet spot”. He said that the company would look to capitalise on ageing baby boomers and new customers entering the insurance system.According to analysts at Goldman Sachs, insurers’ longer-term view is also bright. In a note to clients, they projected earnings per share growth of 10-12 per cent until 2020, as more people become insured and fears about reform subside. Cooling political rhetoric towards the sector should also provide support.“We think the political currency for criticism of the industry is waning along with a broader recognition that the cost of health coverage is about a lot more than industry profit margins, which are quite low relative to other healthcare and non-health care sectors,” said Matthew Borsch, analyst at Goldman Sachs.But despite signs of optimism, clouds continue to hang over the health insurance sector because large portions of the reform have yet to be enacted.Ms Gupte notes that rules looming in 2014 to create state health insurance exchanges and prevent insurers from denying coverage to people who are already sick will create significant shifts in the market, with unexpected consequences. “There are some long-term headwinds that they still have to contend with,” she said.
46;HUM;Humana Inc;2011-02-28T21:54:38Z;Wall St rises on strong economic data;;"US stocks extended their recovery from last week’s losses, helped by strong
economic data, positive comments from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and deal activity in the healthcare real estate investment trust sector.The markets were given an early lift by comments from William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, that the outlook for the US economy was “considerably brighter”, but not bright enough for the central bank to withdraw stimulus help.Also helping sentiment was a strong number from the Chicago purchasing managers’ index, which measures the number of purchasing managers that are reporting better business conditions.Elsewhere, Ventas, the second-biggest US health-care real estate investment trust by market value, said it would acquire its rival Nationwide Health Properties in an all-stock deal valued at $5.79bn.This sent shares in Nationwide Health up 9.7 per cent to $42.74 while Ventas lost 3.1 per cent to $55.42.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher to 1,327.22, building on the 1.1 per cent rally on Friday.This followed a 2.8 per cent loss earlier last week as the unrest in north Africa and the Middle East led to concerns over the oil supply.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent to 12,226.34 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,782.27.Many traders used the recent sell-off as an opportunity to re-enter the markets. “The markets are supported by the decent economic data and so many bulls are using the recent correction as an opportunity to add to their positions,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.The rally was broad based, with all of the S&P sectors rising. The materials sector saw some of the strongest gains as global risk appetite edged higher.US Steeladded 1.3 per cent to $57.49 while Nucor rose 2.2 per cent to $47.96. The S&P materials index was up 1 per cent.Limiting the gains, however, were figures from the Commerce Department showing that consumer spending had risen by less than expected in January. Spending rose 0.2 per cent, less than the 0.5 per cent rise in December and short of the 0.4 per cent expected.However, the figures are likely to have been dented by bad weather. “Looking ahead, assuming that energy prices do not continue to spiral upward, the key determinant of consumer spending growth will be the pace of the recovery in the labour market and hence the path of wage and salary income,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Amazon fell 2.2 per cent to $173.29 after UBS downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, citing concerns that margins will be hit by the company’s new video streaming service.Amazon launched the service last week to compete with Netflix, the film subscription company.Shares in Netflix were down 2.7 per cent to $206.67 and have now fallen 6.7 per cent since last Wednesday.Humana, a health insurance company, was up 3.9 per cent to $65.01 after it was awarded a lucrative contract by the US defence department late on Friday night. The contract had been awarded to UnitedHealth Group in 2009 but Humana successfully challenged the decision.Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company controlled by Warren Buffett, added 2.8 per cent to $87.28 after Mr Buffett said he was prepared for “more major acquisitions” in his annual letter to shareholders.Looking at the month of February, the S&P 500 hasrisen 3.2 per cent, the Dow 2.8 per cent and the Nasdaq 3 per cent. The S&P has seen its third consecutive monthly gain and has risen 26.5 per cent since the start of September. On February 16 the index reached a point where it had doubled from its 2009 lows.The energy sector has been one of the strongest sectors of the month. The S&P oil and gas drilling index saw particular gains, rising 15.5 per cent in a month that has seen oil spike as high as $120 a barrel. The overall energy index was 6.8 per cent higher, up 14.6 per cent over the year. The index has now put on 52.6 per cent since the start of September.The biggest gainer on the S&P in February was JDS Uniphase, a maker of optical communications, which was up 45.4 per cent to $24.67 while Big Lots, a discount retailer, had risen 29.1 per cent to $41.03."
47;HUM;Humana Inc;2011-02-22T05:02:19Z;Humana in pact with S Africa group;;Humana, the US health insurance company, is to form a $65m partnership with a South African company which offers incentives to its clients to live healthier lives and reduce medical costs.Discovery, quoted on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, will initially gain access to 4m of Humana’s US customers, providing rewards including discounted hotel rooms and electronic goods for those who work out at gyms and attend health education courses.The action reflects the growing application of “nudges” to motivate people towards more healthy lifestyles, at a time of growing concern by employers of rising medical costs. Poor diet and lack of exercise has fuelled an epidemic of chronic diseases, triggering worker absenteeism and doctor consultations.It also marks an effort to respond to the fresh pressures on insurers to reduce claims and improve their competitive position, triggered by President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms.Humana will acquire a quarter of Discovery’s US subsidiary, Vitality Group, for about $15m and pledge up to $50m more through a joint venture in which it will hold three-quarters of the equity.Vitality will continue to separately provide services to existing corporate clients and develop new loyalty programmes.Discovery already has more than 1.7m clients worldwide, initially developing its incentives approach in South Africa in the late 1990s, and since expanding and modifying its model in the UK, China and the US.Its success in the US in recent years as a standalone insurer has been only modest, given both the complexities of the health insurance market and the absence until now of a partnership with a large provider to reach a significant number of clients.The link with Humana will initially give it access to the insurer’s 4m private clients, before expanding to more than 17m covered through its specialist optical and dental plans as well as its work through the government-backed Medicare programme for retired people.Shaun Matisonn, head of Discovery’s international operations, said the programmes in the US were devised to respect tough anti-discrimination regulations by rewarding healthy activities rather than behaviours which necessarily demonstrated improved medical outcomes.
48;HUM;Humana Inc;2011-01-18T19:04:16Z;US health insurer pulls out of UK;;Humana, the giant US health insurer, is pulling out of the UK, unconvinced that the coalition’s healthcare shake-up will open up a lucrative market in helping GPs buy NHS care.Its decision comes as other providers of commissioning support – for example Bupa, Tribal and the US-owned Aetna and United Health – also appear to be making cautious assessments of the opportunities it will yield.Andrew Lansley on Wednesday publishes the bill that will hand over the commissioning of £70bn or more of NHS care to family doctors by 2013, with the health service unions, including the British Medical Association, voicing fears over large scale private involvement, or even a takeover, of commissioning by big US health companies and others.Humana made a significant investment in the UK in 2006, offering innovative ways of improving care for patients with long-term conditions and support for primary care trusts in the commissioning of NHS care.However, few PCTs took advantage of a cumbersome framework contract drawn up by the Department of Health that was intended to ease the acquisition of private sector expertise.Lee Phillips, Humana Europe’s marketing director, said on Tuesday that the department had now made clear that the priority at the moment was using existing primary care staff to support the emerging GP consortia.“The market for private sector commissioning support is unlikely to develop dramatically in the next year or so,” he said. Humana is looking to sell off its limited UK business – it employs 70 staff – and is likely to close its operations within six months.While potential private sector suppliers are in extensive talks with GPs, the indications are that the suppliers themselves will form consortia, since few on their own have all the skills needed to support commissioning.KPMG has teamed up with the National Association of Primary Care (a grouping of family doctor enthusiasts for GP commissioning), United Health, Morgan Cole and others to form a “commissioning partnership”. It has won a contract across London to support the development of pathfinder consortia.Kingsley Manning, executive chairman for health at Tribal, said potentially £1.5bn a year could be spent on commissioning, “but we don’t expect a huge and growing market in the near future”, not least because the private sector itself has limited capacity.“We are chiefly working in partnership with PCTs and others. I suspect the market will evolve into a small number of larger scale players. But while we are cautiously optimistic, we do not expect this is going to be a gold rush”.
49;HUM;Humana Inc;2010-12-31T19:08:24Z;CVS to buy Universal’s Medicare unit;;CVS Caremark, the drugstore and pharmacy-benefits company, on Friday agreed to buy the Medicare ‘Part D’ prescription drug business of Universal American for about $1.25bn in a deal that will more than double its share of the programme.Universal American serves about 1.9m Medicare recipients, while CVS already provides prescription drug plans for 1.2m Medicare members.Medicare Part D, introduced in 2006, provides the elderly with subsidised access to prescription drugs. The various programmes are managed by private companies and have proved a lucrative segment of the market.Analysts predict that the ageing US population will become dependent on Medicare coverage while the recent healthcare reform legislation is expected to speed up a shift of retirees from employer to government-based health programmes.The social security and Medicare boards of trustees expect the cost of Medicare part D coverage to grow at an average rate of 9.4 per cent each year over the next decade.In early trading, CVS shares slipped 0.3 per cent to $34.89 while Universal American shares soared 40 per cent to $20.39. Under the terms of the deal, Universal shareholders will get about $12.80 to $13 a share in cash.Pitching the deal to shareholders, Per Lofberg, President of Caremark Pharmacy Services, said the transaction would boost CVS position in “one of the nation’s fastest growing segments of the Pharmacy Benefit Management industry”.The deal will position CVS to compete with health insurance companies such as Humana and UnitedHealth Group who already have a strong presence in the Medicare sector.CVS has had a tough year, coming under pressure from weak consumer spending and the loss of major contracts. At the same time, it faces ongoing scrutiny, including several state investigations, of its hybrid model of managing prescriptions and selling drugs through own pharmacies.“The Medicare Part D program is integral to CVS Caremark’s long-term growth strategy,” Mr Lofberg said, adding that the combination would allow the company to provide members with a wider range of products and services at lower costs.Under the complex terms of the deal, CVS Caremark will buy all of the outstanding stock of Universal and then give Universal shareholders all the shares in a new company, which will own all of Universal’s other operations including its Medicare Advantage business.The new company is expected to have about $640m of cash and statutory capital and no debt. Richard Barasch, chief executive of Universal, said the move would allow the company to “focus its energies” on and building its Medicare Advantage business.The deal is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2011 and is dependent on shareholder and regulatory approvals.
50;HUM;Humana Inc;2010-11-01T21:24:35Z;Baker Hughes results lift energy sector;;"Better than expected earnings from Baker Hughes helped buoy the energy sector while US stocks fluctuated ahead of a busy week set to include a Federal Reserve decision on quantitative easing and the midterm elections.Energy stocks gained 0.3 per cent after Baker Hughes jumped 4.2 per cent to $48.37 as the oilfield services company’s results beat analysts’ expectations. Unconventional oil and gas drilling in key North American basins boosted quarterly profits.Larger rivals Halliburton and Schlumberger have also reported better than expected earnings on the back of strength in onshore drilling.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, upgraded the energy sector to “market weight”.“Based on our models, earnings growth, margins, return on equity and cash flow for energy have improved markedly in the past several quarters, while valuations remain quite reasonable,” he said.“Our work indicates that the sector typically begins to perform well once earnings growth becomes positive. September 2010 was the first positive reading since 2008.”Cabot Oil & Gas soared 4.1 per cent to $30.16 and Anadarko Petroleum gained 2.6 per cent to $63.16.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,184.38, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,124.62 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent lower at 2,504.84.Investors eagerly anticipated Tuesday and Wednesday’s meeting of the Federal Reserve’s open market committee, when many expect the central bank to resolve to deploy a second round of quantitative easing. They also expected a swing to the Republicans in the midterm elections on Tuesday.But analysts at JPMorgan said that although the outcomes of the FOMC meeting and the US midterms should help support stocks in the near term, the longer-term sustainability of the equity rally will rely on growth.“It is encouraging that the third-quarter reporting season has delivered another positive surprise in earnings growth, for the seventh quarter in a row,” they said.“[But in 2011] companies will have to rely more on revenues to generate earnings surprises. And this is becoming already more difficult,” they added.The S&P 500 industrials index rose sharply after data showed US manufacturing rose to a five-month high and the Chinese purchasing managers’ index beat expectations. But it finished the session up just 0.1 per cent.Caterpillar gained 0.9 per cent to $79.27 and Illinois Tool Works climbed 1.2 per cent to $46.23.In healthcare, Humana raised its earnings forecast for the current financial year and beat expectations in its third quarter. The health insurer benefited from lower medical and administrative costs and strength in its plans serving Medicare recipients.But the company would not project a detailed outlook for 2011 before the US government finalises new requirements for spending on medical costs.Humana’s shares, which have risen 16.3 per cent in the past month, were up 0.7 per cent at $58.68. Rivals also gained with Cigna up 0.6 per cent to $35.38 and WellPoint gained 0.7 per cent to $54.72.McKesson, the pharmaceutical distributor, rose 2.9 per cent to $67.88 after it said it planned to buy privately held US Oncology. The deal, valued at about $2.16bn, will help McKesson expand services in the fast-growing area of cancer care.Elsewhere in earnings news, Corning rose 1.2 per cent to $18.50 even though both profit and revenue missed analysts’ estimates.Its display technology division suffered after demand for flat-screen
televisions weakened but the company was upbeat about demand in the fourth quarter.Intel rose 2.6 per cent to $20.48 after the chipmaker’s price target was raised at Macquarie, and the broker upgraded the broader US semiconductor sector.Apple rose 1.1 per cent to $304.18 after it said it had counter-sued Motorola, alleging the mobile phone maker violated patents. Shares in Motorola dropped 1.7 per cent to $8.02."
51;HUM;Humana Inc;2010-10-12T20:19:18Z;Half a million denied health coverage;;The four largest health insurance companies in the US denied coverage to more than half a million individuals because of their pre-existing conditions from 2007 to 2009, according to a congressional investigation.On average, the four companies – Aetna, Humana, UnitedHealth Group and WellPoint – denied one out of seven applicants’ coverage based on conditions such as pregnancy, angina, diabetes and heart disease.The investigation found that the number of people who were denied coverage increased about 49 per cent from 2007 to 2009. In that period, the groups refused to pay 212,800 claims for individuals who were already insured based on their previous medical conditions.New revelations about the extent of denials based on pre-existing conditions comes at a crucial time for Democratic lawmakers. Many of them have come under pressure in the lead up to the November mid-term elections because of their support for President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law, which was passed by Democrats in Congress in March.Polls show that roughly 50 per cent of voters disapprove of the wide-ranging new law. But one of the most universally popular provisions – which will not take effect until 2014 – makes it illegal for insurance groups to deny an individual coverage based on a person’s health status or pre-existing condition. Democrats have argued that the provision is economically feasible because the new law also includes a mandate forcing every individual to be covered, one of the least popular aspects of the bill.Republican candidates for Congress have vowed to “repeal and replace” the healthcare law, but keep the new provision on pre-existing conditions. They have not, however, explained how they would extend coverage to those individuals without a broader mandate.The congressional investigation by Democrats on the House energy and commerce committee was initiated shortly before the landmark vote on healthcare reform, when Congressman Henry Waxman, chairman of the committee, asked each of the companies for extensive information about their denial policies. Each of the companies complied with the request.The congressional probe found that each company saw its policy on pre-existing conditions as a key area of growth. For example, internal documents by a company that was not identified by the committee showed that executives were considering practices such as denying payments for drugs related to pre-existing conditions and linking additional claims to pre-existing condition exclusions as ways to limit the amount of money the company had to pay for claims.Although the committee found that a total of 651,000 individuals were denied insurance coverage in the individual market between 2007 and 2009, investigators said the number was likely “significantly higher” because the figure did not include individuals who were discouraged from applying for coverage by insurance agents. The four companies covered about 2.8m people in the individual market in 2009.In some cases, the denials were issued without review. A memo circulated by one unidentified company in 2006 listed 14 medical categories that did not require review, including: any woman who was pregnant or had been treated for infertility within five years.
52;HUM;Humana Inc;2010-08-02T22:28:54Z;S&P 500 at 10-week closing high;;US stocks jumped on Monday as a strong performance from European banks and a higher oil price helped boost investor confidence, with the S&P 500 pushing into positive territory for the year.The S&P 500 closed up 2.2 per cent at 1,125.86, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 2 per cent to close at 10,674.38, and the Nasdaq was 1.8 per cent higher closing at 2,295.36.Strong earnings from big European banks BNP Paribas and HSBC on top of positive economic data from both Europe and Asia cheered investors.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 were up, with six rising more than 2 per cent. It closed at its highest for 10 weeks, above its 200-day moving average.Investors welcomed the news that growth in the the US manufacturing sector slowed less than expected in July.The Institute of Supply Management’s index of factory activity fell for the third month running, from 56.2 in June to 55.5 last month, slightly better than analysts’ average forecast of 54.1.But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said that while the headline figures were fine, new orders – a leading indicator – dropped sharply from 58.5 to 53.5.Government spending on construction made up for a decline in private projects and led to an unexpected 0.1 per cent rise in total construction spending. The markets also shrugged off cautious comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, that high unemployment and a weak housing market were weighing on consumers.The S&P 500 Financials index rose 2.6 per cent after the positive results from European banks, with Citigroup up 2.2 per cent to $4.19, Bank of America advancing 2.9 per cent to $14.44 and AIG rising 4.1 per cent to $40.04.The S&P 500 energy index was up 3.6 per cent after oil hit its highest level in nearly three months, topping $81 a barrel. Optimism about the strength of the global recovery and the outlook for energy demand pushed up the oil price.ExxonMobil added 3.8 per cent to $61.94, National Oilwell Varco gained 5 per cent to $41.13, and Schlumberger rose 5.2 per cent to $62.74.Elsewhere in the energy sector, Anadarko Petroleum rose 8.4 per cent to $53.27 after it agreed to sell its Colorado pipeline assets to Western Gas Partners for $498m.

Alcoa gained 4.8 per cent to $11.71 and Cliff Natural Resources rose 7.1 per cent to $60.60.Ford rose 3.1 per cent to $13.16 after the carmaker’s debt was upgraded two levels by ratings agency S&P, which said its auto operations in North America are likely to remain profitable and it is stabilising its market share.Among the fallers, the maker of the BlackBerry, Research in Motion, dropped 1 per cent to $56.98 after the United Arab Emirates said on Sunday that it would suspend Blackberry’s e-mail services in October because, it said, they operated outside its laws and raised national security concerns.Visa was down 1.5 per cent to $72.22 and MasterCard, due to report earnings tomorrow, lost 3.6 per cent to $203.95 after speculation that US mobile carriers AT&T and Verizon Wireless could be planning to compete with the credit card companies by developing a payment system using smartphones. AT&T rose 2.5 per cent to $26.59 and Verizon advanced 1.7 per cent to $29.56.In earnings news, healthcare company Humana reported a 21 per cent rise in profit for the quarter and raised its forecast for the full year on the back of growth in its Medicare plans for seniors and commercial plans for employers. Shares were up 3.6 per cent to $48.73.Truckmaker Oshkosh fell 1.6 per cent to $33.83 in spite of reporting better-than-expected results after it warned its revenues from defence would fall next year because it had finished most of the all-terrain vehicles it supplied to the US government.Shares in Charles River Laboratories International fell 3.9 per cent to $29.87 in early trading after the company reported worse-than-expected second-quarter results and cut its revenue outlook for the full year.
53;HUM;Humana Inc;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Insurers face ‘pre-existing conditions’ probe;;Democratic lawmakers have launched a probe into one of the most controversial practices of US health insurance companies – the denial of coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions – as part of an endgame push to bolster their case for insurance reform.Henry Waxman, chairman of the House energy committee, also asked chief executives from United Health, Humana, Aetna and WellPoint, to testify before his committee on March 23 about their policies for individuals with preexisting conditions.If Democrats ultimately move to vote on healthcare reform, it is expected to occur before the Easter break. Lobbyists on Tuesday said the timing of Mr Waxman’s hearing showed that he was seeking to focus attention on an extremely popular provision of proposed healthcare reform, which would guarantee coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions, just days before a potentially contentious vote.Americans overwhelmingly support the idea of forcing insurance companies to cover people who have previously been ill, according to analysts at Pew Research. According to a survey conducted in October, 82 per cent of respondents supported measures guaranteeing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, even though the majority of voters disapproved of healthcare legislation in its entirety.Mr Waxman has also asked the companies to provide his committee with documents dating back to 2005 that detail their policies on insurance claims or coverage denials based on pre-existing conditions.The requests includes all internal communications and e-mails between senior corporate management, presentations to management and government agencies, training materials for insurance brokers and agents, and documents showing the total number of denials related to pre-existing conditions during the past five years.The insurance industry’s chief lobby group on Tuesday said the House probe was part of a consistent effort by Democrats to shift the focus to the insurance industry in the lead-up to a potential vote by the House on a reform bill that it staunchly opposes.A spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans said the industry would support legislation that forced the insurance industry to cover individuals with preexisting conditions if it also contained a mandate to force individuals to buy insurance, which current proposals do not.WellPoint, one of the companies Mr Waxman is targeting, has already come under fire over its attempt to increase premiums by as much as 39 per cent, even as it has made billions of dollars in profits and taken executives out on lavish retreats.The rate increases, which were publicised last month, could not have come at a better time for the Obama administration and Democrats on Capitol Hill, who seized on the issue as a prime example of why the insurance industry requires reform.WellPoint and Humana said they were reviewing Mr Waxman’s request. United Health and Aetna did not return calls.
54;HUM;Humana Inc;2010-01-27T00:37:46Z;Whole Foods eyes discounts for healthy staff;;Whole Foods Market, the largest US natural and organic supermarket, is to start offering its healthier workers higher discounts on their grocery shopping, in a move it says is aimed at cutting healthcare costs.John Mackey, chief executive officer, said in a recent letter to employees that indicators including blood pressure, cholesterol and body mass index would be used to determine the level of discount offered above the basic 20 per cent available to all employees.Mr Mackey said the company hoped the programme would be “empowering and fun for team members who enjoy a challenge”, and that the company was not taking anything away from workers who chose not to participate.“These new higher discounts are incentives to encourage our team members to be healthier and to lower our healthcare costs,” he said. “We believe this is a win-win programme that will help both our team members and our shareholders.”A workplace poster explaining what the company calls its “healthy discount incentive programme” sets out four possible employee discount levels – bronze, silver, gold and platinum.The maximum 30 per cent platinum discount requires employees not to smoke, to have a BMI of less than 24, cholesterol levels below 150 mg/dL and blood pressure of 110/70. Employees who would be considered obese – with a BMI of over 30 – would not qualify.Staff wishing to take part in the programme are being asked to undergo biometric screening sessions at Whole Foods’ 289 stores in the US, Canada and the UK.The approach reflects Mr Mackey’s own libertarian political thinking, which has made him an outspoken critic of the healthcare reforms now before Congress. He argues that health reform should move “toward less government control and more individual empowerment” while asserting that there is no “intrinsic right to healthcare, food or shelter” in the US.But Whole Foods’ effort is also part of a broader trend among businesses concerned by rising health costs. Companies including Kellogg, Humana, Johnson & Johnson and Dell have all linked discounts on insurance payments to a range of health indicators in an effort to create incentives for healthy behaviour.Safeway, the US supermarket chain that has taken a lead on the issue, offers members of its non-union healthcare plan discounts of $780 if they meet standards in the same four areas set out by Whole Foods. The retailer has also tested using its supermarket loyalty card sales data to offer health premium discounts to employees who purchase more healthy foods. Critics argue that the approach is potentially discriminatory.Whole Foods has more than 54,000 employees.
55;HUM;Humana Inc;2010-01-20T19:07:13Z;Insurers get Mass reprieve;;As speculation mounted on Tuesday morning that Martha Coakley would fail to secure the Democrats’ 60 seat lock on the US Senate, companies whose futures hinge on a pending healthcare overhaul saw their share prices gyrate. Recently bloodied health insurers Humana and Aetna rallied as much as 8 and 6 per cent, respectively while owners of hospital stocks like Tenet Healthcare underperformed the market by nearly 5 per cent. The former would see their business shrink and become less profitable under Obamacare, particularly the more radical version passed by the House of Representatives, while the latter would have received compensation for services they now provide gratis to the uninsured. Drugmakers like Pfizer bounced more mildly, given the damage-limiting deals they had already struck with legislators.The remarkable 31-point swing between Barack Obama’s margin of victory in deeply liberal Massachusetts 14 months ago and Ms Coakley’s showing was in large part a referendum on the Democrats’ performance and agenda, in spite of spin from the White House pinning blame on the candidate. Nationwide, generic polling suggests that Democratic candidates have lost 10 points of popularity since November 2008, making healthcare legislation a liability just 10 months before the entire House and a third of the Senate come up for re-election.The White House still has a few political gambits for saving Obamacare in its current form. One is to rush a vote before Mr Brown is seated in about two weeks. Another is for the House to simply pass the Senate’s version of the legislation. Key congressmen have already expressed displeasure at both ploys.It appears that Obamacare-lite is the most likely option. Even that may be a stretch given the shock of Coakley’s loss. Either way, health insurance executives surely rejoiced at this 11th-hour reprieve.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially

The S&P gained 0.5 per cent to 1,126.48, while the Dow added 0.5 per cent to 10,520.10 and the Nasdaq climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,285.69.Markets advanced on data showing a steeper than expected drop in jobless claims. The number of people applying for unemployment benefits last week fell by 28,000 to 452,000 in seasonally adjusted figures. Jobless claims are now at their lowest level since September 2008.Separately, the US Commerce Department reported new orders for durable goods increased by 0.2 per cent in November.Uri Landesman, head of global growth at ING Investment Management, said he was “positive on 2010”, assuming unemployment data started to catch up with the rest of the economy. “If banks start to lend and businesses start to expand and employ people, I think the consumer can join in this recovery,” he said.Mr Landesman predicted the S&P would trade between 950 and 1,300 next year, finishing 2010 in the range of 1,150 to 1,175.Shares in Apple jumped to a record high on reports the company was set to introduce a new product in January of next year. Apple advanced 3.4 per cent to $209.04.Gold producers were higher after the metal surged past $1,100 an ounce. Barrick Gold climbed 0.3 per cent to $40.35 and Goldcorp added 1.2 per cent to $40.50.Gold was up 1.6 per cent to $1,104.90, spurred by a lower dollar. The greenback lost 0.1 per cent to $1.4356 against the euro and declined 0.1 per cent on a trade-weighted basis.Oil added 0.9 per cent to $77.34, while the yield on10-year US treasuries jumped 5 basis points to 3.8 per cent.In the banking sector, Citigroup rose 1.8 per cent to $3.35 after announcing on Wednesday it had repaid $20bn in bailout money to the US government. Wells Fargo, which said it had repaid $25bn in government funds on Wednesday, was 0.9 per cent higher at $27.09.Industrial group, Crane, announced it would acquire Merrimac Industries, a satellite parts manufacturer for $16 a share in cash. Crane advanced 2.2 per cent to $32.21, while Merrimac surged 37.8 per cent to $15.90.Pharmacy services provider, Omnicare, was 0.5 per cent weaker at $24.42. The group announced David Froesel Jr had resigned from his posts as chief financial officer and senior vice president.

Teva-KOWA parent, Teva, was 0.7 per cent weaker at $55.94.
57;HUM;Humana Inc;2009-11-02T21:49:00Z;Ford drives Wall St higher;;US equities were volatile on Monday, turning sharply negative during the afternoon as financials slumped, before recovering some lost ground.Initially, stocks rallied, boosted by upbeat economic reports and a surprise swing to profitability for Ford.The US carmaker posted its first quarterly profit in more than a year as cost-cutting and the government’s “cash-for-clunkers” rebates helped produce earnings of nearly $1bn, or 29 cents a share, during the third quarter.That confounded expectations of a 12-cent-a-share loss and Ford closed up 8.3 per cent at $7.58.After the closing bell, Stanley Works announced it would acquire Black & Decker in an all-share deal valued at $4.5bn.After dipping as much as 0.7 per cent during the afternoon, the S&P 500 closed 0.7 per cent higher at 1,042.88, half its earlier rise of 1.5 per cent.It was a wild ride on Monday for Vix, the index of S&P options volatility. After dropping 8.5 per cent to 28, Vix powered back above 30, only to ease a tad as stocks recovered. Last week, Vix closed above 30, for the first time since July a sign of rising fear for stocksThe S&P financials also rebounded from an afternoon slide of 1.8 per cent, sparked by worries that the banking system remains vulnerable in the wake of CIT filing for bankruptcy on Sunday.“Weakness among financials was also likely reflecting investor concerns as how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp will build reserves against future loses in an environment that’s already seen 100 banks fold this year,” said John Stoltzfus, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities.Elsewhere, the Nasdaq Composite closed higher by 0.2 per cent at 2,049.20, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,789.44.The behaviour of equities on Monday came after last week’s decline of 4 per cent for the S&P, which helped drag the broad benchmark into negative territory for October, its first monthly decline since February.Investors enter November facing a busy week of data, the end of the earnings season and a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Any change in the central bank’s policy statement as to the timing of removing easing policy could weigh on sentiment, notably in the bond market.Later in the week, attention will focus on the release of the October employment report. Economists expect a decline of 175,000 jobs during October with the unemployment rate rising 0.1 percentage points to 9.9 per cent.“The bottom line in Friday’s jobs data is likely to be that the labour market remains a significant source of vulnerability for the economic recovery,” said Lou Crandall, economist at Wrightson Icap.On Monday the market was propelled to its intra-day highs after the Institute for Supply Management said its closely watched manufacturing index was 55.7 for October.That was higher than an expected rise of 53 and was the best reading since April 2006. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion.Meanwhile, construction spending for September rose 0.8 per cent, its biggest gain since September 2008, and pending home sales for September were up 6.1 per cent as the home buyer tax credit boosted activity.Sentiment for stocks was also boosted by other earnings, brokerage actions and a deal in the energy sector.Denbury, the oil company, announced a deal to buy Encore for $3.2bn with Encore shareholders receiving $50 a share, consisting of $15 in cash and $35 in Denbury common stock.Denbury fell 10.3 per cent to $13.09 while Encore rose 20.5 per cent to $44.67.In other earnings news, Humana, the health insurer, posted a 65 per cent rise in third-quarter profit.The company reported earnings of $301.6m, or $1.78 a share, up from $183m, or $1.09 a share, a year before. Revenue rose 8 per cent for the quarter to $7.72bn and the stock fell 1.5 per cent to $37.01.Shares in Loews Corp rose 2.4 per cent to $33.90 after the conglomerate reported a higher-than-expected third-quarter profit of $469m, or $1.08 a share, beating a forecast of 89 cents a share. That compared with a loss of $144m, or 33 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.Sysco Corp, the food distributer, recorded an 18 per cent rise in quarterly profit, just above estimates. The stock gained 0.2 per cent to $26.50 as sales fell for the fourth consecutive quarter.Shares in Clorox rose 0.3 per cent to $59.40 after the maker of bleach products posted a 23 per cent rise in fiscal first-quarter profit, beating estimates.Shares in Motorola rose 5.4 per cent to $9.03 after Citigroup upgraded it to a “buy” from a “hold” and raised the target price to $10.50 ahead of the new Droid cell phone.Nordstrom gained 1.6 per cent to $32.29 after Deutsche Bank upgraded the retailer to a “buy” from a “hold” with a target price of $45 from $36on expectations of better store sales in October.
58;HUM;Humana Inc;2009-10-30T19:00:28Z;US health insurers;;When the US congressional debate on healthcare heated up in June, Barack Obama’s chief of staff said the only non-negotiable point was success. “Everything else is negotiable.” One could have interpreted this statement as bravado or an acknowledgement that the administration’s blueprint might look quite different once 535 members of Congress and countless lobbyists finished with it. The latter is evident in the still-evolving versions of legislation.For the managed-care companies at the centre of the US’s health system, political horse-trading has sent their shares gyrating. Pressure for legislative “success” this year may produce a bill that leaves them paying punishing fees and insuring riskier patients, but probably not out of business. Even in their worst case, a full public option, the axe might not fall until 2013. But insurers’ shares are pricing in a high probability of disaster. Analysts at Barclays Capital found that the sector’s downside is limited to perhaps 10 to 15 per cent, because the tangible book value and cumulative cash flow from operations until 2013 leave many insurers trading near, or in some cases below, their liquidation value.Since the beginning of 2008, a group of managed-care stocks in the S&P 500 have lost 52 per cent of their value, or twice as much as the underlying index. The six largest insurers remain the priciest of the bunch, but even they trade at a mere 40 per cent premium to 2013 breakup value. Employer-centric Wellpoint is the priciest and Medicare-dependent Humana the cheapest, reflecting relative risks.A more realistic scenario is that most insurers survive in some form under Obamacare but see their profitability curtailed. Even if cash flows are cut in half ad infinitum after 2013 and never grow with inflation, the six large insurers still might be one-third undervalued today.

59;HUM;Humana Inc;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;US health insurance reform;;The more muddled Barack Obama’s crusade to remake US healthcare has become, the higher share prices of big insurers such as UnitedHealth, Aetna and Humana have risen. They faltered this week as plans emerged from the Senate to directly tax the industry to help pay for coverage to nearly 50m uninsured Americans.The main distinction between soaking insurers directly and eliminating the tax-free nature of employer health benefits is that the latter proved wildly unpopular, particularly among Democrats’ union allies, while the former is palatable to all but insurers’ shareholders. But the distinction would rob Peter to pay Paul as both would result in higher customer outlays or more limited coverage for those already insured.Healthcare companies, including drugmakers, would pay a direct levy and people with high-priced health insurance would also pay. Taxing what politicians dub “Cadillac” health plans has other flaws though. It would not distinguish between typical private sector employees who pay nearly a third of premiums out of pocket and those of civil servants who often pay next to nothing. It would also disproportionately hit policies in high-cost states that bar insurers from denying coverage to riskier customers, thus discouraging a key goal of healthcare reform.As passing Obamacare has grown from a policy initiative into a litmus test of the new administration’s power, political expediency has overshadowed many of its original goals. Chief among these is controlling costs without affecting quality of care. Incentivising a better match between medical cost and benefit is key to this. Without such changes in medical decision-making or a workable public plan, insurance reform simply becomes an exercise in redistributing unacceptably high costs. Creating the illusion that the healthcare industry itself will foot the bill is a convenient fiction.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
60;HUM;Humana Inc;2009-08-26T20:23:16Z;Wall Street shrugs off mixed data;;"US stocks closed a whisker higher after a choppy day of trade on Wednesday as investors digested a mixed set of economic data.A disappointing reading on durable goods orders for July weighed on industrial stocks, which were the day’s weakest sector.Although the headline figure was encouraging, analysts focused on the number that excluded transportation, discounting the temporary effect of the government’s cash-for-clunkers programme.That data was worse than expected, which triggered widespread selling in the industrial sector.Caterpillar, the machinery maker, dropped 1.2 per cent to $47.25, while
Honeywell, the manufacturing conglomerate, lost 1.1 per cent to $37.12.General Electric was also caught up in the selling, in spite a new $2.7bn contract to build a power plant in Kuwait and reports of a possible $2bn sale of its security unit. The shares fell 1.3 per cent to $14.11.The early falls were mitigated by a sharp rise in monthly sales of new homes , which boosted the homebuilding sector.Lennar gained 4.1 per cent to $15.58 and DR Horton climbed 5.7 per cent to $13.79.The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all closed a fraction higher at 1,028.12, 9,543.52 and 2,024.43, respectively.That constituted the seventh successive positive session for the Dow.“Until it becomes clear that there is a sustainable economic trend you are going to see this kind of mixed data,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential.“More worrying is the fact that the markets have sold off towards the close recently.”Metals producers came off their recent highs as commodity prices dipped. Freeport-McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, lost 1.5 per cent to $63.13, while Nucor, which makes steel, fell 2.4 per cent to $45.28.“Commodity shares could find a headwind with Chinese stocks soft and crude oil finding resistance at $75,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Financial stocks were also lower in spite of the housing data as well as figures showing that mortgage applications rose last week, defying a rise in mortgage rates.Signs of stabilisation in the housing market have lifted banks to the forefront of the recent rally, but they slipped on Wednesday as investors took an opportunity to take profits off the table.Citigroup declined 2.5 per cent to $4.63 and JPMorgan lost 0.6 per cent to $43.30.Morgan Stanley drifted 2.2 per cent to $29.53, even as rumours intensified
surrounding the sale of its Van Kampen investment unit, with Bloomberg reporting that the bank has approached at least three other asset managers with offers of a possible partnership or sale.Retailers were higher during the day, building on the gains made during Tuesday on the back of an unexpectedly sharp rise in consumer confidence.Budget retailers were especially strong, carried by the momentum from the previous session, when Big Lots reported better earnings than expected.The company was one of Tuesday’s strongest performers and rose again on Wednesday morning, picking up 3 per cent to $26.37.Rival Family Dollar climbed 3.5 per cent to $30.82.Williams-Sonoma, the kitchenware retailer, jumped after it reported a surprise profit and said that tight inventory control would see it earn more over the year than previously forecast.The sharp cost cuts mitigated slumping sales at the company, which also owns the Pottery Barn furnishings chain, and the shares rose 11.3 per cent to $17.21.Health insurers suffered however, as analysts predicted that the death of Senator Edward Kennedy could provide further impetus to government plans to reform healthcare.They said the Democrats may want to honour the memory of one of the strongest advocates for such reform.With the current plan proposing cuts in government subsidies to large health insurers, Humana lost 2.7 per cent to $36.15, while UnitedHealth fell 3.3 per cent to $28.93."
61;HUM;Humana Inc;2009-08-18T20:33:56Z;Wall Street stages modest rebound;;"US stocks rebounded on Tuesday after the steepest decline in more than a month during the previous session.Financial stocks, retailers and materials companies, which led the market lower on Monday, all did well as buyers were tempted back into the market.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 1 per cent at 989.67. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.9 per cent to 9,217.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.3 per cent to 1,955.92.“A lot of people missed the rally in March and again in July,” said Chris Verrone, investment strategist at Strategas Partners. “Therefore any pull-back will be viewed as a buying opportunity.”Investors continued to focus on retailers as earnings season for the sector kicked up a gear with results from Home Depot, Target and Saks. For all three the pattern during the quarter was similar, with strict cost controls mitigating ongoing sales weakness.Home Depot recovered all of Monday’s losses, which were triggered by disappointing results from rival Lowe’s, after lower costs than expected helped it raise its full-year outlook. Its shares picked up 3.1 per cent to $26.93.Budget retailer Target also beat analysts’ estimates with revenues in line with expectations but profit margins improving. The stock climbed 7.6 per cent to $44.32.Upmarket chain Saks reported a similar story as carefully managed expenses kept costs low and helped it beat earnings estimates. Its shares gained 6.9 per cent to $5.72.“Only 43 per cent of companies that have reported their earnings have beat expectations on both the top and the bottom line,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential. “We need to see revenue growth in the next quarter,”Financial stocks led the way, however, helped in part by improving credit card losses. Citigroup climbed 3.5 per cent to $4.14 and Bank of America gained 2.1 per cent to $16.90.Goldman Sachs was upgraded to “buy” at Pali Research, which predicted continued strength in its fixed-income business, and the stock rose 2.1 per cent to $160.48.American Express, meanwhile, was upgraded by KBW after credit losses improved last month. Its shares picked up 4.3 per cent to $31.69.CIT was one of the strongest financial companies, up 2.9 per cent to $1.40 after the commercial lender announced a narrower loss than in the same quarter last year.On Monday the group announced that it had bought more time to fight off bankruptcy by completing a $1bn debt tender.But the rally in financial stocks was not replicated everywhere and economic data limited the bullish mood. Figures showed that deflation continued to
hamper producer prices.There was weakness among health insurers, which bucked Monday’s
losing trend on signs that the Obama administration could abandon the public insurer element of its healthcare reforms.Such a plan has been
criticised as undermining the private sector and, after campaigners hit back at suggestions that it might
be dropped, insurers gave back much of the previous session’s gains.Humana lost 1.5 per cent to $35 and Coventry Health Care fell 2.6 per cent to $22.98.Homebuilders recovered from early losses, which were triggered by data showing that builders started work on fewer homes last month than expected. But economists said the rise in the number of new single-family homes was good for the sector. Lennar and DR Horton both finished the day 2.8 per cent higher, at $13.19 and $12.22, respectively.Technology stocks also showed strength after a bruising previous session. Smartphone makers were particularly strong after RBC described the market as “the next wave of
computing” and raised its price targets on the three leaders in the sector.Apple, which makes the iPhone, climbed 2.8 per cent to $164. Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, picked up 4.6 per cent to $73.99. Palm, which recently launched the Pre, gained 4.9 per cent to $13.88."

Investors were worried that travel would be the first industry to suffer if the flu continued to spread, and the Bloomberg US Airlines index suffered its heaviest intra-day fall since the session after the September 11 attacks.Tourism companies also suffered. Marriott, the hotel chain, dropped 5.1 per cent to $21.17 and Expedia, the online travel agency, fell 6.3 per cent to $10.53. Carnival, the cruise operator, lost 13.5 per cent to $24.59.Du Pont, which manufactures chemicals for the agricultural industry, led the materials sector lower amid worries about how the outbreak could affect farming. Its shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $27.50.Even credit card companies suffered because of the flu scare, as JPMorgan warned “cross-border fees may suffer from reduced cross-border travel related to the virus”. Visa lost 2.5 per cent to $58.87 and Mastercard retreated 4.4 per cent to $165.55.But Gilead Sciences, the drug company that developed the flu drug Tamiflu, and continues to receive royalties for its sales from Roche, the European company to whom it sold the licence, gained 3.8 per cent to $47.53.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent down at 857.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.6 per cent lower at 8,025 points and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 1,679.41 points.The market briefly rallied during the morning, but later fell back, despite some analysts saying the selling was overdone. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Investors overreacted during the outbreaks of Sars and bird flu, and we saw that again this morning, as traders shot first and asked questions later.”Lawrence Summers, the chief White House economics adviser, also dented confidence when he told Fox News on Sunday that the US economy would experience “sharp declines in employment for quite some time this year”.Fears that global demand could still be some way from returning hit metals prices, and industrial companies suffered as a result. Freeport McMoRan the copper miner, lost 3.1 per cent to $39.68, while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, gave up 3.8 per cent to $8.79.The macro-economic news overshadowed earnings announcements from several leading companies, including Verizon the second-largest US telecoms company by market value, which beat analysts’ expectations, as it attracted more new customers than expected. But with revenues from business customers continuing to fall, the company’s shares lost 1.5 per cent to $30.54.Elsewhere in the sector, Qualcomm, which makes microchips for mobile phones, disappointed with its first-quarter earnings, but the company gained ground after raising its full-year revenue targets on signs that the market could be improving. Its shares picked up 4.4 per cent to $43.17.Humana, the health insurer, jumped 6.9 per cent to $29.25 after reporting a surge in first-quarter profits, easily exceeding Wall Street’s expectations and allowing it to raise its outlook for full-year profits.Corning, which makes glass for televisions, also beat analysts’ predictions, as the company said demand for its products was improving. Its shares gained 3.3 per cent to $15.84.General Motors was the strongest performer of the morning after it said it would make deep cuts to its plants and workforce and eliminate the Pontiac brand. The company also asked its bondholders to swap $27bn of debt for equity. Its shares surged 20.7 per cent to $2.04.“We didn’t see the sell-off that the pre-market session indicated,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “We’ve lived through 18 months of intense pressure after the financial collapse and we realised this flue outbreak does feel like the next wave.”
63;HUM;Humana Inc;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Cash incentives helping nation’s health;;Financial incentives from the taxpayer for people to quit smoking, lose weight or eat better may be an important means of improving the population’s health, leading academics have claimed.Their verdict comes as advisers to the Department of Health are promoting such schemes and as private health insurers are offering discounts to subscribers who go to the gym, eat more fruit and take other steps towards a healthier lifestyle.In Dundee, smokers are being offered £12.50 a week by the NHS if carbon monoxide testing shows they have quit. In Essex, pregnant women can claim a £20 food voucher from the NHS after stopping smoking for one week, £40 after four weeks and another £40 at the end of a year if they have still quit.Brighton offers children £15 for quitting smoking for 28 days, while overweight patients in Kent are also being offered incentives for losing weight. In the US and other countries incentives have been offered for weight loss, complying with diabetes treatment, or regularly testing negative for sexually transmitted diseases.Such schemes are controversial with the public and professionals, say Theresa Marteau and Richard Ashcroft, professors of health psychology and bioethics at King’s College and Queen Mary universities in London.Writing in the British Medical Journal, they say the programmes are attacked as “a form of bribery” and “rewarding people for unhealthy behaviour”, while others believe they undermine the doctor patient relationship and remove patients’ autonomy.But they say evidence is emerging some programmes may work, although research is needed to establish “the conditions under which change is achieved and sustained, and for whom”, as well as to identify unintended consequences.“Using payments may be more powerful than providing information, and less restrictive than legislation [which attempts to ban or punish activities],” they say. “Ultimately, if incentives prove to be effective in only a few contexts, they may still offer an important means to improve health.”Julian Le Grand, chairman of Health England, said the difficulty with prevention programmes was that the costs of unhealthy lifestyles could be far off in the future when the pleasures from them were felt now. Policies were needed that provided some of the benefits of changing lifestyle in the present, he said.
64;HUM;Humana Inc;2009-04-07T20:55:53Z;Wall Street falls on earnings fears;;US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors waited cautiously for Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, to kick off the earnings season after the close of the market.Alcoa dropped 1.5 per cent to $7.79 as analysts predicted that the company would make a first-quarter loss of $0.56 per share, with falling global demand taking its toll on profits. Its shares slipped further after the market closed when it reported a net loss of $0.61 a share, or $497m, on revenue of $4.1bn.Worries over earnings also weighed on Caterpillar, the machinery maker, which dropped 5.9 per cent to $29.45 after Andrew Obin, a Bank of America analyst, said the company was likely to make a wider first quarter loss than expected.“Investors are taking a little bit of profit off the table ahead of earnings,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. “The financials have managed to rally over 60 per cent in the last few weeks. But I do not think anyone knows what their earnings are going to be like, so some of that money is coming back out.”This followed a subdued session on Monday, during which volumes were low and the market adjusted to the views of Mike Mayo, one of the first analysts to turn bearish on the banking sector, that banks might suffer the worst loan losses since the Great Depression.Those fears were exacerbated on Tuesday after it was reported that the International Monetary Fund is set to forecast global losses on toxic assets of up to $4,000bn.Citi added to the gloom when its analysts cut the US equities market as a whole to “underweight”, saying valuations did not look “particularly attractive”.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 2.4 per cent down at 815.55 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3 per cent to 7,789.56 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.8 per cent to 1,561.61.“The market overextended on the way up and we’re seeing it correct itself a bit now,” said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. “Equities have a tendency to overshoot in both directions.”But Lincoln National provided a bright spot amid a falling financial sector after the life insurer said it was considering selling assets to build capital as it pays down $700m in debt. Its shares gained 8.2 per cent to $6.89.Health insurers also performed well after Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a government agency, said that it would increase its basline payments to those companies by 0.8 per cent, higher than originally proposed.Humana gained 6.1 per cent to $27.92, while UniteHealth picked up 6.9 per cent to $23.45 and Coventry Health lifted 3.5 per cent to $14.26.General Motors fell, giving up all of the gains made during the previous session, after Bloomberg reported that the company was speeding up preparations for bankruptcy. Its shares lost 11.9 per cent to $2.Ford fell 7.4 per cent, meanwhile, to $3.49 as investors took profits after its shares jumped 16 per cent during the previous session on the news that it had swapped $9.9bn worth of debt for cash and shares.Sun Microsystems, the previous session’s heaviest faller, continued to lose ground as analysts predicted the technology company would find it difficult to find another suitor after IBM withdrew its offer for the company over the weekend. Sun’s shares fell 4.3 per cent to $6.28.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Applied Materials shed 8.7 per cent to $10.55 after the computer chipmaker said a $1.9bn solar power contract had been cut to $250m.In oil, Exxon Mobil retreated 1.9 per cent to $68.71 after Barclays cut its 2009 and 2010 earnings estimates for the energy company, having lowered its estimates for natural gas prices.Archer-Daniels-Midland, the agricultural conglomerate, lost 10.6 per cent to $25.66 after Citi recommended selling the shares, saying the decline in its agricultural services business had been extremely fast.Utilities was the only sector briefly to find gains during the day, pulled upwards in part by PG&E, the Californian energy provider, which was upgraded by Credit Suisse. Analysts at the Swiss bank said the Californian regulatory environment would help the company maximise its earnings. PG&E shares rose 2.8 per cent to $37.83.
65;HUM;Humana Inc;2009-04-06T20:41:54Z;Bank stocks drag Wall Street lower;;"Sun Microsystems tumbled on Monday, as its planned takeover bid by IBM ran into trouble.IBM withdrew its offer for Sun, leaving the talks suspended, but insiders say it remains to be determined whether the talks have fully collapsed or whether they’ll restart. This triggered a 22.7 per cent fall in Sun’s shares to $6.56.Banking stocks also suffered after Mike Mayo, an analyst at Calyon Securities, began coverage on 11 leading banks, giving them all an “underperform” or “sell” rating. Mr Mayo, one of the earliest analysts to turn bearish on banks, warned loan losses might exceed those seen during the great depression.Billionaire investor George Soros added his doubts about banks’ health later in the day, saying: “The banking system as a whole is basically insolvent.”Wells Fargo fell 6.7 per cent to $15.25, while Citigrouplost 4.6 per cent to $2.72 and JPMorgan dropped 3.7 per cent to $28.20.Investors are relying on banks to pull markets out of their slump more than any time in the past 60 years, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg, and worries over their profitability weighed heavily on the markets as a whole.After a very late rally, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.8 per cent down at 835.48 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 7,975.85 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.9 per cent to 1,606.71 points.“This was a dramatic run up and as we approach earnings season investors are being cautious and taking profits off the table at any opportunity,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford,But George Feiger, chief executive of Contango Capital Advisers warned the slide is a sign of more fundamental problems. “The big problems with the economy are still there,” he said. “We are still only at the beginning of this problem.”Commodities companies also declined on the back of falling materials prices. Steel makers suffered particularly badly after Deutsche Bank warned demand for steel in North America could fall 25 per cent this year. US Steel fell 2.7 per cent to $25.16 and AK Steel dropped 4.7 per cent to $8.82.The defence sector received a late shot in the arm as Robert Gates,
the defence secretary, announced an overhaul of government spending. Lockheed Martin gained 8.9 per cent to $73.28 after Mr Gates said the government would double the budget for Lockheed’s F-35 fighter plane.Northrop Grumman also stood to benefit from increased spending, and its shares lifted 9 per cent to $47.94.Lockheed was also involved in another of the day’s big stories, as speculation mounted that it might look at acquiring Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft. Textron’s share rose 11.3 to a two-month high of $8.26.Cisco added to the pressure already weighing on the technology sector because of the withdrawal of IBM’s offer for Sun. Cisco was downgraded by Goldman Sachs from “conviction buy” right back to “neutral”, with the bank saying recent gains in the company’s stock meant future growth was now priced in. The technology company fell 3.5 per cent to $17.53.Credit Suisse meanwhile said: “We believe Cisco has seen further incremental weakness in its enterprise business, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of total revenues.”General Motors was one of the session’s few risers, lifting 8.1 per cent to $2.27 after Fritz Henderson, its new chief executive, said bankruptcy was not inevitable for the company.Ford also gained ground after it was able to reduce its debt by $9.9bn after swapping much of it for cash and equity. Shares in the carmaker advanced 16 per cent to $3.77.Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceutical company, performed well after it renegotiated a licensing agreement with Japan’s Otsuka Pharmaceutical to sell the Abilify schizophrenia drug for an extra 29 months. It s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $20.51. The healthcare sector was also bolstered by insurers, which rebounded after falling on Wachovia’s prediction that government proposals to cut their subsidies could cost them as much as 20 per cent of their earnings.Humana gained 3.3 per cent to $26.31 and UnitedHealth picked up 6.8 per cent to $21.93."
66;HUM;Humana Inc;2009-04-03T22:38:53Z;Late rally bucks grim US jobs data;;US stocks rallied late in the day on Friday to take the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 8,000 points and complete a fourth successive week of gains for the first time since the market peaked in October 2007.The gains came in spite of downbeat economic data as US unemployment hit 8.5 per cent, its highest level since 1983. This was in line with analysts’ estimates, and after an initial fall, the equities market remained resilient.Figures showing that activity in the services sector fell for the sixth consecutive month extended the losses, but stocks recovered in the last hour to find positive territory.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent up at 842.5 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 8,017.59. The Nasdaq Composite index was helped by strength from technology stocks, rising 1.2 per cent to 1,621.87 points. The three gained 3-5 per cent this week.Financial stocks took comfort from the fact that the data were not worse, and the sector rose 4.2 per cent.Healthcare stocks were the biggest drag on the S&P as Wachovia said the government’s proposals to cut subsidies to health insurers as part of the healthcare reform package could cost those companies as much as 20 per cent of their earnings.Humana and United Health, two of the biggest beneficiaries of such subsidies, lost 5.7 per cent to $25.46 and 2.5 per cent to $20.54 respectively.But other areas of the market held up well, with signs that consumer spending was strengthening.Research in Motion, the Canadian maker of the BlackBerry mobile phone, stunned the market with its quarterly earnings, reporting a 26 per cent increase in net income as the company benefited from much better than expected consumer spending. The company’s shares jumped 20.8 per cent to $59.29 on the Nasdaq.The news fuelled hope that consumer spending might be rising in the technology sector overall and Apple gained 2.9 per cent to $115.99, while Dell rose 8.6 per cent to $10.32.The sector was boosted by reports that IBM’s proposed acquisition of Sun Microsystems might be nearing completion, although for a lower price than at first thought.IBM’s shares rose 1.4 per cent to $102.22 and Sun gained 3.4 per cent to $8.49, moving towards the reported new offer of $9.55 per share.Google’s gains were limited, as Techcrunch, the website, reported the company might be in talks to buy Twitter, the microblogging service that has become the latest online craze. Google’s shares rose 2 per cent to $369.78.Micron Technology, the biggest US producer of computer memory chips, damped enthusiasm as it reported a quarterly loss with a lack of demand driving down prices. Its shares fell 2.8 per cent to $4.50.Qwest helped take the telecoms sector higher, as investors continued to respond to reports that it was considering selling its long-haul network. Its shares picked up 8.6 per cent to $3.91.Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 5.4 per cent to $20.17 after Sanford Bernstein said the drugmaker was less likely than others to be taken over in the industry’s latest bout of consolidation.Fellow drugmaker Gilead Sciences rose 5.1 per cent to $46.98 after it said trials of an experimental drug had shown it helped lower blood pressure.During the week a relaxation of mark-to-market accounting and global unity at the G20 helped stocks recover after suffering losses when the White House rejected GM’s restructuring plans, sparking fears the company might soon go into bankruptcy.But some commentators warned that the short-term rally was masking a deeper malaise. Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com, said: “This is a bear market rally. Mark-to-market is simply covering economic problems. Just because you rig the scale, doesn’t mean you have lost weight.”

Schering-Plough also gained, rising 8.5 per cent to $24.21.Humana, the health insurer, also gained on speculation reported by Bloomberg that it was the subject of a takeover bid. Its shares rose 7.7 per cent to $24.83.But CV Therapeutics lost ground after Japan’s Astellas said it might not re-bid for the company after it accepted a rival bid from Gilead Sciences. CV lost 1.8 per cent to $20.67.The financial sector finished in positive territory as gains in the banking sector outweighed fears over bad debts in the credit card market. Banks received a boost after Richard Parsons, the chairman of Citigroup, said the bank would not need more capital injections from government, further allaying fears of nationalisation. Citi gained 6.6 per cent to $1.78, and JPMorgan picked up 2.4 per cent to $23.75.But credit card companies Discover Financial and Capital One both lost out, the latter after announcing a change to executives’ compensation schemes that will convert cash bonuses and equity incentives into salary and restricted stock. Discover fell 5.9 per cent to $6.23 and Capital One lost 5.6 per cent to $12.56.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both gained 0.8 per cent to 756.55 points and 7,223.98 points respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.4 per cent at 1,431.5 points. The gains followed a surge on Thursday after Ken Lewis, chief executive of Bank of America, became the third leading bank boss to say his company had been profitable for the first two months of 2009.The market was given a boost late on Thursday when President Barack Obama said he would be willing to consider lowering the corporate tax rate if people within business helped him to close tax loopholes.The energy sector put pressure on the S&P after OPEC cut its forecast for oil demand, with Chevron losing 0.8 per cent to $62.91.Palm was one of the biggest gainers after RBC Capital Markets upgraded the cellphone manufacturer to outperform from sector perform, based on its plans to dominate the smartphone market. Its shares lifted 6.7 per cent to $8.39.It was not all good news for technology stocks, as National Semiconductor, the chipmaker, was downgraded to junk status by Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency. The company lost 8.8 per cent to $10.05.Warren Buffett spent Monday talking up the stocks he holds, but his company remains too exposed to losses on its portfolio, says Fitch, which cut Berkshire Hathaway’s AAA rating.

The S&P briefly fell below 700 points and finished down 4.7 per cent at 700.82.Investors reacted to more bad news from some of the world’s biggest financial companies, with financial stocks and industrials leading the selling.AIG announced the biggest corporate loss in US history, while HSBC tapped the markets for the UK’s biggest corporate rights issue.AIG was one of the day’s best performing stocks, initially surging, but then falling back to finish unchanged at $0.42 after its results triggered a third government rescue plan in as many months. But the losses themselves stoked fears about the health of the financial system and the ongoing availability of liquidity.Joshua Raymond, market strategist at IG Index, said: “The stench of liquidity concerns remain entrenched in banking systems.”Fears about liquidity weighed heavily on Citigroup, which became one of the day’s biggest losers, down 20 per cent to $1.20.JPMorgan, which is underwriting HSBC’s cash call, fell 7.4 per cent to $21.16. Bank of America dropped 8.1 per cent to $3.63, while Wells Fargo lost 10.4 per cent to $10.84.Industrial stocks were significantly lower, hit by three rounds of bad news. New data showed construction had contracted by more than double analysts’ expectations for January. Consol Energy, one of the US’s biggest metallurgical coal producers, then announced it was to shut its Buchanan mine temporarily.Added to this, the oil price continued to slide, standing 10.6 per cent down at $40 a barrel by the close of the stock markets.Consol lost 4.7 per cent to $22.58, while Caterpillar fell 9.9 per cent to $22.17, and Deere & Co, the machinery maker, fell 9.7 per cent to $24.83.“The closure of the Buchanan mine is bad news for the entire industrials sector,” said Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets.GE, which last week cut its dividend for the first time since 1938, continued to drop. It finished 10.7 per cent down at $7.60, the first time the stock has been below $8 since 1994.Healthcare stocks fared little better as the market continued to react to President Obama’s healthcare policies, unveiled last week.The sector was down 4.2 per cent. Johnson & Johnson lost 4.2 per cent to $47.92. Humana and Unitedhealth, the two companies to benefit most from private involvement in Medicare, continued to lose ground, down 15.5 per cent to $20 and 11 per cent to $17.48 respectively. Humana has now lost nearly half its value since news of the budget began to leak last weekend.Nick Kalivas, analyst at MF Global, said: “The market continues to worry that there are going to be policies taken that will be even worse for healthcare stocks.”Further bad news came from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway group turned in the worst performance in its history, underlining the battered state of nearly all equities.In a letter to investors, Mr Buffett sounded a gloomy note for the economy in general, saying that it would be “in shambles throughout 2009 – and, for that matter, probably well beyond”.He added that “that does not tell us whether the stock market will rise or fall”.Dell initially rose after Thursday’s results were followed by an upgrade of the stock by Argus research. Shares in the company eventually closed down 1.2 per cent at $8.43, although that still made it a relatively good performer.The outperforming technology sector has helped the Nasdaq Composite index outperform the other two leading indices, and it closed 4 per cent lower at 1,371.91 points.
69;HUM;Humana Inc;2009-02-27T21:34:52Z;Citi deal hits US financials;;US stocks plummeted again on Friday to levels not seen since 1996.Details of a government plan to take a 36 per cent stake in Citigroup and more negative economic data caused the heavy falls, which took shares below Monday’s level, when they tested 1997 lows.Investors balked at the dilution of Citi’s shares by the government holding as well as the news that the company would suspend all dividend payments.But an annualised 6.2 per cent fall for the fourth quarter in US gross domestic product, the sharpest since 1982, meant that the whole market was hit.The benchmark S&P 500 index dropped 2.4 per cent for the day, finishing at 735.09.Citigroup saw 39 per cent of its share price wiped out, finishing at $1.50. It was joined by Bank of America, which shed 25.8 per cent to $3.95 and Wells Fargo, which lost 16 per cent to $12.10. Banks fell 8.7 per cent, and the financial sector overall lost 7.4 per cent.Insurers, meanwhile, fared even worse, hit not only by general fears over the financial sector but also by the fact that Standard & Poor’s cut its rating for 10 companies in the sector.Principal Financial lost 24.6 per cent to $7.99, Metlife dropped 23.1 per cent to $18.46 and Lincoln National fell 20.1 per cent to $8.59.“The insurers have been big backers of commercial securities and that area is getting weak as well,” said Pran Tiku, chief investment officer at Peak Financial. “The whole financial sector is going to continue to show weakness,” he added.General Electric slumped in afternoon trade after the group cut its quarterly dividend from 31 cents to 10 cents per share. Even though the news had been widely expected, its shares fell 6.5 per cent to $8.53.It was a mixed day for healthcare stocks, which fell in afternoon trading after early gains as the market continued to digest the government’s healthcare plan.Humana recovered to gain 0.1 per cent to $23.67, but other companies lost out, such as Johnson & Johnson, which fell 4.7 per cent to $50. Overall, the sector lost 4.2 per cent, contributing to a total fall of 11.4 per cent for the week.“When people started looking at the details of the Obama plan, it got even more frightening for healthcare companies,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Dell did well after its earnings beat analysts’ predictions and it announced it would seek to save an extra $1bn as part of ongoing cost-cutting efforts. Its shares were up 3.9 per cent to $8.53.Heavy selling was also seen on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index. The Dow fell 1.7 per cent at 7,062.93, while the Nasdaq fell 0.98 per cent to 1,377.84 The Dow has now seen six straight months of falls.The sell-off capped a turbulent week, which saw the equities market breaking through November’s lows after heavy selling on Monday which some analysts called “capitulation” and “a technical breakdown”.Despite a mid-week rally, all three indices finished around 4 per cent down for the week, with different sectors having pulled in opposite directions throughout on announcements from Washington.On Tuesday and Wednesday, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, helped trigger a surge in banking stocks when he reassured the market that the government had no plans to nationalise banks.His message was boosted when Mr Obama announced that, as part of his budget, he wanted to put aside $250bn into a reserve fund in case the financial sector needed further bail-outs.These announcements meant that financial stocks remained one of the week’s big winners, even after Friday’s selling, finishing the week 2 per cent up.“The government is starting to realise it needs to either nationalise the banks or be very clear that it will not,” said Mr Paulsen. “But it could still have been more explicit this week.”

GDP fell by 6.2 per cent on an annualised basis compared to estimates of 5.4 per cent.“Finally the GDP data have caught up to the severity of the recession and, unfortunately, we expect the first quarter report to show similar weakness to the fourth quarter. Alas, we are looking at what is almost certain to be the longest, and quite likely to be the deepest, recession of the post-war era,” wrote John Ryding of RDQ Economics.The S&P 500 index fell 2.2 per cent immediately after the opening bell to 735.69, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7 per cent to 7,058.55 and the Nasdaq was down 0.8 per cent at 1,380.23. This meanth the S&P was on course for its lowest close since 1996.Citigroup saw a third of its share price wiped out in the early morning, falling to $1.69. It was joined by Bank of America, which shed 15.4 percent to $4.53 and JPMorgan, which lost 5.3 per cent to $22.28. The financial sector overall lost 6 per cent.Healthcare stocks regained some of their losses from the previous session based on the news that President Barack Obama’s budget would look to cut subsidies to health insurers and drug makers. Humana recovered to gain 2.7 per cent at $24.19, while Unitedhealth picked up 1.4 per cent on $19.89.Dell was one of Friday’s winners after it announced earnings that beat analysts predictions once certain costs had been stripped out. The company also announced it would look to make an extra billion dollars of savings as part of an ongoing cost cutting program. Its shares were up 1 per cent to $8.32.This falls looked like capping a turbulent week on Wall Street, where different sectors were pulled in opposite directions by announcements coming from Washington.Early in the week, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, helped trigger a surge in banking stocks when he reassured the market that the government had no plans to nationalise the country’s failing banks. His message was given an extra boost when President Barack Obama announced that as part of his budget he wanted to put aside $250bn into a reserve fund in case the financial sector needed further bailouts.Their words had helped financial stocks pick up 10.1 per cent over the week, but those gains were likely to be pared on Friday following Citi’s announcement.But healthcare was the other major element of Mr Obama’s speech, and his plan to cut subsidies to the health insurance and drugmaking sectors triggered a sharp downturn in those stocks on Thursday.European stocks were down ahead of the open on Wall Street as the news from President Barack Obama’s budget that the government would cut subsidies to drugmakers filtered through to take its toll on pharmaceutical stocks. The FTSE Eurofirst 100 index was 3.2 per cent down at 1,526.66. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, led by a 1.5 per cent rise in the Nikkei 225 as the yen’s weakness benefited shares.Bond yields were down. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell by 6 basis points to 1.018 per cent, and on the 10-year Treasury note lost 5 basis points to 2.943 per cent.The dollar was off against major currencies early in New York, while gold was trading 56 cents lower at $951.90 per troy ounce.Oil prices were down early in New York. US crude prices had lost $1.11 at $44.88 a barrel.

Coventry Health also lost out, tumbling 14.4 per cent to $11.88.“Traders realise that the changes may begin to squeeze healthcare companies either through lowered premiums or decreased subsidies from the government,” wrote Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers.The Obama administration’s plans also spelt bad news for the defence sector, as it vowed to end overspending and schedule delays in the US weapons program.Shares in Boeing fell 3.5 per cent to $32.71 while Northrop lost 2.9 per cent to $39.42 and General Dynamics was off 1.9 per cent to $45.68.The major falls from these sectors cancelled out the gains made by banks, which rallied as the administration also announced plans to set aside an additional $250bn for future bail-out funds.Bank of America was a winner, up 3.1 per cent to $5.32 and was helped by news that it was looking to sell First Republic Bank, a private bank inherited from Merrill Lynch.The rally included JPMorgan, which climbed 6.1 per cent to $23.05 on the day of its investor conference. The bank expected to open 120 new retail branches and projected a total of 12,000 job cuts resulting from the merger with Washington Mutual.Wells Fargo was another strong performer, rising 7.1 per cent to $14.40. Among several regional banks to enjoy strong gains, Fifth Third also did well, up 18 per cent at $2.29.The S&P financial index reflected the advances made by banks and was the strongest performing sector, up 2 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down 1.6 per cent at 752.83 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.2 per cent at 7,182.08 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 2.4 per cent at 1,391.47 points.“There is a strong belief among the financial community that the centre of power has moved from New York to Washington,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equities strategist at Citigroup. “That is why the market moves on what the president says.”Stocks had rallied earlier in the day in spite of worse-than-expected economic data that showed continuing unemployment benefits passed the landmark 5m mark to a hit a fresh record..“The data is only going to get worse, and the figures on job losses are going to be very severe later this week,” said Mr Levkovich.Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Global Banking & Markets wrote that the data would “do nothing to support serious follow through in better risk appetite today, even though the focus for the moment is very much on banks”.Consumer staples also performed badly, dragged down by Safeway, the grocery chain. Safeway shed 13 per cent to $18.37 after sales came in $400m less than analyst estimates. The sector as a whole fell 2.3 per cent.Several department stores rallied initially after Sears reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations and said it would be closing an additional 24 stores to cut costs.But the stocks fell again towards the close. Sears eased 0.8 per cent to $35.54. Kohl’s lost 1.6 per cent to $34.70 and JC Penney dropped 1.7 per cent to $15.43.Energy stocks fared well early in the day as crude oil continued to rise, hitting $45 at one point during early trade. The sector climbed in early trade but succumbed late in the day to finish just below the previous session’s level.Elsewhere, IBM bucked the general downward trend in the technology sector when it reaffirmed its full-year proft outlook and forecast a profit in its business services division.This came just a week after peer Hewlett-Packard cut its full-year outlook. IBM’s shares were up 3.6 per cent at $88.97 in afternoon trade, while HP also saw some benefit, rising 0.4 per cent to $30.24.
72;HUM;Humana Inc;2009-02-24T22:05:39Z;MediScare;;"What one president giveth, the other taketh away, but health insurers didn’t expect the Obama administration to ruin their financial bonanza quite so soon. Private involvement in Medicare, the health insurance programme for the elderly and disabled, flourished under a Bush White House but was expected to be politically vulnerable under Mr Obama. Investors thought this was priced in, but a surprisingly paltry 0.5 per cent increase in proposed government payments next fiscal year hit the sector on Monday. Shares of Humana, the insurer most exposed to private Medicare coverage, lost a quarter of their value; UnitedHealth, the largest provider, fell 15 per cent.Politically unable to revoke private coverage, its opponents in Washington may seek to starve the business model and save money in the process. One potent criticism of private coverage is that, while patients can receive better value for money, the government’s overall cost per patient is higher. This comes at a time when the future solvency of Medicare is in doubt. Federal Medicare spending was 13 per cent of the overall $3,000bn budget last year and, as a wave of baby boomers enters the system, is expected to almost double by 2030.Still, the market seems to have overreacted as insurer valuations now assume flat or falling earnings. They can compensate partially for measly reimbursements by raising private premiums and trimming payments. Costs and a weak economy will force some elderly people back to traditional Medicare, but the services are popular. Enrolment in private plans grew to over 10m people last year, from about 5m in 2003, and demographic trends remain favourable as the baby boomers become eligible in 2011. There are also 35m Medicare recipients still not in private plans. While the Democrats have fired a frightening first shot against insurers, the industry has a foothold that will be difficult to dislodge.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

73;HUM;Humana Inc;2009-01-08T22:29:29Z;Becky Shaw, Second Stage, New York;;"It is called festivalitis – the unsettling thing that happens to critics when they gorge on movies or plays for a week at Cannes or Sundance or Edinburgh. Bleary-eyed after days of trite or earnest fare, they latch on to anything that shows a spark, overpraising it and setting up expectations that the work cannot sustain. Months later, when the hangover wears off and the piece is exposed to a sober view, reality sets in.Or doesn’t. In the latest example of the syndrome – the comedy/drama Becky Shaw by Gina Gionfriddo, which has arrived off-Broadway after a much-lauded run last spring at the Humana Festival in Louisville – I didn’t believe for more than a minute here and there that the five characters, or the actors playing them, were inhabiting anything approaching real life.If Gionfriddo’s story – a blind date between emotionally scarred temp worker Becky and an abrasive financial adviser named Max threatens to unravel a family – were set up in a cock-eyed universe, then Max’s quick, cutting dialogue would be credible. In a play that too often descends into soap-opera situations, Max’s occasionally amusing zingers are chiefly a distraction.The scabrous remarks of Max’s adoptive mother figure, Susan, who deals with the recent death of her husband by taking up with a shady, much younger man, would be more at home in a gin-powered drawing-room comedy. Tossed into the therapy-soaked world of her psychologist daughter, Suzanna (Emily Bergl), Susan’s words, no matter how expertly delivered by Kelly Bishop, reinforce the sense of unreality.Directed by Peter DuBois, the production is notable chiefly for Gionfriddo’s professional ear for dialogue and for the performance of David Wilson Barnes as Max. Barnes has an impressive suffer-no-fools abrasiveness. If there’s ever a movie version, the inevitable casting would be Kevin Spacey.In a recent interview, in which she discussed her dismay that female playwrights are not given a fair shake by many New York theatres, Gionfriddo observed that producers, directors and perhaps audiences are willing to accept unappealing male characters more than unappealing women.In the case of Becky Shaw, Gionfriddo proves the point. But the sometimes rebarbative Max is not more compelling than Becky because he is a man; he sustains our attention because he has vigour, a quality that we must rely upon to carry us through this uneven play.Tel +1 212 246 4422"
74;HUM;Humana Inc;2008-10-30T20:55:02Z;Unhealthy insurers;;US health insurers, already feeling unwell at the prospect of a Barack Obama presidency, had their condition further downgraded this past week as the financial crisis hit earnings. While the patient has suffered a bit of a shock, the prognosis is better than the average 61 per cent drop over the past year in the shares of six leading managed-care companies would suggest.The average prospective earnings multiple of Aetna, Humana, Cigna, UnitedHealth, WellPoint and Coventry Health Care of 5.4 times is pricing in an iron-fisted approach to healthcare reform under a Democratic White House and possibly a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. But the reality may be closer to a velvet glove – or perhaps a latex one.Take both Mr Obama and John McCain’s proposals to push for more widespread generic drug usage, or Mr Obama’s more substantial plan that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceuticals companies. These are bad for drug manufacturers, but on balance good for insurers, who are sensitive to such costs. Or how about Mr Obama’s plan to fine employers not offering health insurance and another that would force people to insure their children? These could add more than 30m new customers.Of course, some of Mr Obama’s proposals are clearly negative for insurers’ earnings, while some of Mr McCain’s would be a boon. Mr Obama might force insurers to cover those with pre-existing ailments, while Mr McCain would let people shop for coverage in any state, undercutting expensive local mandates. In the event of a McCain victory, the sector would rally, and it has amply priced in a likely Democratic administration.As in past campaigns, lobbying will likely water down sweeping proposals. Some is already happening, as Democrats reportedly received twice the donations from the industry as Republicans, reversing the trend in recent presidential contests. Consider it a dose of preventive medicine.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click hereLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

75;HUM;Humana Inc;2008-08-04T21:45:28Z;Drop in oil hurts energy sector on Wall St;;"Wall Street stocks fell for a third session on Monday as a sharp drop in oil prices helped consumer-facing stocks but hurt commodity-related sectors.Energy and material stocks were the worst performers, hit by the pull-back in oil and other commodity prices. ExxonMobil, the oil producer, dropped 3.9 per cent to $76.60 and Schlumberger, the oil services company, dipped 5.8 per cent to $94.41. The sector gave up 4.9 per cent and has now lost more than 20 per cent from its recent highs.In materials, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold fell 12 per cent to $80.35 and AK Steel lost 8.4 per cent to $55. As a whole, the sector shed 4.2 per cent.The ructions in commodity markets overshadowed some significant economic data. The core personal consumption expenditures index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs and is the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, rose more than expected.As a result, although headline spending increased at a faster rate than expected, after adjusting for inflation, real consumer spending fell 0.2 per cent following a 0.3 per cent gain in May.Analysts at Lehman Brothers said: “On balance, this was a negative report showing a slowdown in spending and acceleration in inflation. We expect consumption will continue to weaken, especially as the rebate effect fades.”The data on personal consumption expenditures are of particular significance as they measure spending for all goods and services, which make up about 70 per cent of gross domestic product.Consumer-facing stocks slipped in early trade but recovered after oil dipped briefly below $120 a barrel. Wal-Mart Stores rose 1.2 per cent to $58.43, Procter & Gamble added 1.3 per cent to $65.82. Sears Holdings climbed 5 per cent to $82.78.Consumer discretionary and staples stocks overturned early losses to gain 0.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively.Bill Knapp, chief investment strategist at MainStay Investments, said: “Many of the agricultural commodities came down 5 per cent or more, copper dropped 4 per cent, so that big downdraft in commodity prices helped buoy equities after a relatively large decline early in the day.”The benchmark S&P 500 pared early losses but still closed 0.9 per cent lower at 1,249.02 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 11,284.15. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,285.15.Last week, markets had little to show for a volatile period of trading in which losses at the start and end of the week cancelled out gains in the middle. Equity markets took their cue from mixed second-quarter earnings, a decline in the price of oil and some weak economic data on growth, home prices and employment.On Monday, healthcare was the best performer, boosted by better-than-expected
second-quarter results and an improved forecast from Humana, the health insurer. Its shares added 4.9 per cent to $46.81 while the sector advanced 1.3 per cent.Motorola helped to limit losses in the tech sector to 0.4 per cent. The company surged 11.5 per cent to $9.82 after it hired Sanjay Jha, a former Qualcomm executive, to head its mobile devices business.There was some good news from the “real economy” as well. The Commerce Department said that factory orders rose 1.7 per cent in June – the largest jump since December.But that did little for the industrials as deal news and analyst downgrades weighed on the sector. Manitowoc, the construction group, fell 10.3 per cent to $23.03 after it agreed to sell its marine unit to Lockheed Martin and an Italian shipbuilder for $120m.Meanwhile, Deere dropped 7.1 per cent to $65.24 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock from “buy” to “neutral”, pointing to weakness in the domestic construction market and higher raw material costs.The banking sector was another drag, falling 1.3 per cent after HSBC said losses in North America increased in the first half.Bank of America fell 2.1 per cent to $32.62, Wells Fargo slipped 1.1 per cent to $30.18 and JPMorgan lost 1.5 per cent to $40.14.Wachovia was among the biggest fallers, sliding 9.9 per cent to $17.11, after analysts at Morgan Keegan suggested investors “take profits” from a recent run-up in the share price “driven by covering”."
76;HUM;Humana Inc;2008-08-04T19:58:21Z;Hopeful Humana;;After months of wondering whether to pull the plug on health insurance companies, investors now see signs of life. Monday’s results from Humana were merely reasonable but prompted a 6 per cent rise in the share price. Coming on the heels of similarly solid numbers from Humana’s peers, the whole medical insurance sector has bounced by a fifth in the past month. Is it on the road to recovery?In the first quarter, a sudden acceleration in healthcare usage and cost inflation caught insurers off guard. Heavy competition for large company clients during the past three years squeezed pricing, leaving little cushion to protect margins. Starting with United Health in March, a string of profit warnings led sector share prices down. Valuations bottomed out at about half the long-term average of 14 times forward earnings.There is reason to think the bad news is now fully discounted in share prices. Insurance companies have been coping with rising medical expenses for years. In 1950 healthcare costs accounted for 4 per cent of personal consumption. That proportion has grown to about 17.5 per cent. Aided by computerised billing that allows them to react quickly, insurers appear to have adjusted to the most recent cost surge. Rising yields at their non-profit rivals suggest competition may be moderating. This downturn could spark further consolidation, providing additional support for margins.Yet the patient is not out of the woods. Under President George W. Bush, the regulatory regime has been very friendly to the industry. In extremis, a Democratic administration could introduce universal healthcare, cutting insurers out entirely. While the chances of such radical change remain tiny, more Democrats in Congress would almost certainly mean greater regulation and tighter pricing controls. The economic cycle may not be as bad as feared but share prices will not recover fully while the political outlook remains uncertain.
77;HUM;Humana Inc;2008-07-02T00:45:25Z;Bingo and patient back-up prove life enhancing;;A little before 8am, Monday to Friday, 78-year-old Robert Hsu, once a Taiwanese marine and latterly an ice cream salesman in the US, is picked up from his home and taken by bus to the North Miami Beach Wellness Center in Florida.There he has breakfast, takes part in carefully structured exercise classes, eats a healthy lunch, completes puzzles and plays bingo with other members of the Silver Sneakers health club. And he feels a whole lot better for it.When Mr Hsu stopped work three years ago he was close to being confined to a wheelchair.“I was a couch potato,” he says. “I could hardly go to the mall. I was sweating, short of breath. My whole body felt awful.“I was depressed and worried and my wife was driving me crazy. She told me I was ‘do nothing’ – too lazy – but I felt ill.”He is no longer on anti-depressants, his weight is down, his blood pressure is under control and he contracts far fewer fevers and colds.“I live a normal life now and I am less expensive for the doctors,” he says.Studies are starting to suggest that such programmes pay for themselves, improving health and reducing day to day medication and cutting costly hospital stays. Certainly commercial insurers such as Humana, which invests in the programme, rate them.Those who run publicly funded programmes are also starting to believe such investments are worthwhile. Some 4,000 miles from Florida, in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, nurses Bridget Howard and Susannah Reede spend their days on the phone talking to 400 patients whose weight puts them at high risk of heart disease and diabetes.The patients have been given pedometers to count the steps they take each day. Telephone support helps motivate them, a website gives advice on a healthy lifestyle and for the patients – aged from 18 to well into their 70s – weight is coming down, blood pressure falling and medication being reduced.“I was very sceptical that just giving people a pedometer and talking to them on the phone would make such a difference. I’m now a total convert,” says Ms Reede.Helping people live more healthily is one way to control costs but so is the drive to ensure medicine uses the cost-effective over the marginally effective.The search has led to a global growth in evidence-based medicine.The UK’s National Institute of Clinical Excellence (Nice), which assesses new drugs and technologies and recommends those the National Health Service should fund, is being copied, or about to be copied, by almost a dozen countries.The US is discussing a similar initiative, which may concentrate on clinical effectiveness. But Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, chairman of Nice, says: “Even if the US does not include cost-effectiveness now it will have to do so in future.”
78;HUM;Humana Inc;2008-06-27T20:35:26Z;Wall St shares slide almost to March lows;;Surging oil prices, poor earnings reports from the technology sector and a slump in financials pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Index briefly into bear market territory and the S&P 500 to within a hair’s breadth of its March lows on Friday.The Dow fell to its lowest level since September 2006 – down more than 20 per cent from its October highs – before recovering slightly.The index is on course for its worst June since the Great Depression, down 10.2 per cent.The S&P 500 fared little better. Technical analysts warned that if the index broke through its March lows it could retest its 2002 lows at 1,172 points. The S&P is set for its worst monthly performance since September 2002, down 8.7 per cent.Friday began positively after the US Department of Commerce released data showed that consumer spending doubled in May while personal income also jumped, in part thanks to government tax rebates.Observers warned that tax rebates would have only a short-term effect and one already largely priced into the market.Leo Kamp, chief economist of TIAA-CREF, the financial services company, said: “Markets are seeing through this transitory increase in demand and consumption and are expecting a very slow economy afterwards.”New data on sentiment suggested that consumers had largely discounted the rebates as well. The University of Michigan index showed consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in 28 years in June.Consumer facing stocks initially stabilised but fell back. Dillards fell 3.4 per cent to $11.58 while ConAgra fell 6 per cent to $19.67. The consumer discretionary sector fell 0.7 per cent while consumer staples fell 1.2 per cent.Poor earnings results in the technology sector added to the gloomy mood. Micron Technology and Palm came under pressure following disappointing earnings reports after the close on Thursday. Micron slipped 12.7 per cent to $6.10 on Friday while Palm fell 8.3 per cent to $6. The sector lost 0.4 per cent.Financials were the biggest laggards as they were all week. JPMorgan lost 3.5 per cent to $35.05. Morgan Stanley fell 0.1 per cent to $36.81 after Moody’s said it might cut the brokerage’s credit rating.The benchmark S&P 500 pared losses at the close but ended the day down 0.4 per cent at 1,278.49 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent lower at 11,348.96. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.3 per cent to 2,315.63. Equities had been volatile during the week, stoked and stymied in equal measure by the fluctuating price of oil and the fortunes of corporate America.Negative earnings reports from the likes of UPS and Oracle had weighed on sentiment. Over the week, UPS lost 10 per cent to $60.37 while Oracle gave up 3.7 per cent to $21.29.Markets had to contend with rising inflation expectations. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold, noting the risk of rising inflation due to surging oil prices.Stocks rallied on the news but fell back sharply a day later as the dollar weakened, oil prices rocketed and analysts warned of further writedowns at leading banks and brokerages such as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.Citigroup lost 10.6 per cent to $17.25 over the week and Merrill dropped 9 per cent to $32.70, dragging the sector down 6.6 per cent – its biggest drop since February.Over the week the S&P 500 lost 3 per cent for its fourth consecutive weekly drop while the Dow Jones dropped 4.1 per cent.On Friday as oil advanced, energy stocks made gains. Chevron rose 0.7 per cent to $98.08 while Schlumberger added 0.9 per cent to $105.90. The broader sector advanced 0.9 per cent.Healthcare stocks rose 0.6 per cent after Senate Republicans blocked a bill to cut billions of dollars off health plans tied to Medicare. Humana rose 3.1 per cent, Tenet Healthcare 1.1 per cent and Coventry Health Care 2.9 per cent.
79;HUM;Humana Inc;2008-06-20T20:45:47Z;US stocks slide as oil prices rebound;;Wall Street stock markets slumped to three-month lows on Friday as oil prices rebounded, knocking consumer-facing stocks, while analyst and ratings downgrades for financials stoked fears that the credit crisis has further to play out.Oil moved as much as $4 higher on Friday, cutting short a rally in consumer-facing stocks. Dillards and Starbucks gave up 4.7 per cent to $13.10 and 4.2 per cent to $17.23.But carmakers were the biggest fallers after S&P, the credit rating agency, said it may cut auto makers ratings. Ford lost 8.1 per cent to $5.81, GM slid 6.8 per cent to $13.79 and the discretionary sector plunged 4 per cent.Technology shares also came under heavy selling pressure, with large caps leading the sector to a 2.5 per cent loss. Microsoft dropped 2.4 per cent to $28.25.In the background, the financials cut away at investor confidence. Moody’s became the last of the three major rating agencies to downgrade Ambac and MBIA, the embattled bond insurers, citing their limited ability to raise new capital and write new business.Ambac swung to a gain of 1 per cent at $2.05 in late trading but MBIA lost 13.3 per cent to $5.59.Banks were also in focus after analysts downgraded or cut their price targets for Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Wachovia among others, arguing that writedowns, volatile capital markets and mediocre fixed-income performance would damage earnings. Citigroup shares fell 4.8 per cent to $19.21, while Goldman Sachs and Wachovia dropped 1.7 per cent to $183.77 and 1.9 per cent to $17.43. The S&P 500 financials index dropped 2.6 per cent to its lowest level in five years.The S&P 500 closed 1.9 per cent lower at 1,317.85 on Friday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.8 per cent at 11,841.95. The Nasdaq Composite lost 2.3 per cent to 2,406.09.On Thursday, equity markets ended higher after a jittery session of trading, as oil prices dropped sharply, helping exporters, such as technology stocks, and consumer-facing stocks to advance.That strong run was the exception in a week marked by bad news from the financials, another batch of data showing considerable weakness in the US economy and elevated fears of inflation.The S&P 500 fell for a third straight week, losing 3.1 per cent as all 10 leading industrial sectors retreated. The S&P 500 is now down 5.9 per cent so far in June after making gains in April and May.As if to underline the bearish sentiment on Wall Street, short interest on the New York Stock Exchange jumped to an all-time high during the week. Financial stocks came under pressure from short-sellers.William Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, said: “We got decent earnings out of Goldman Sachs this week and that seemed to raise people’s spirits a bit. But we can’t seem to get out of the way of bad news . . . every day another bank needs to raise more capital.”On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs undermined market sentiment, in spite of posting better-than-expected results, after its analysts warned that US banks might have to raise as much as $65bn in additional capital to shore up balance sheets weakened by the mortgage crisis.As if to confirm those predictions, Fifth Third Bancorp said on Wednesday it would raise $2bn by selling shares and assets. Fifth was among the week’s biggest losers, dropping 23.2 per cent to $10.11. It was followed down by other regional banks as analysts questioned whether smaller, less capitalised institutions could withstand the credit crisis.Healthcare stocks were another weak point after Coventry Health Care cut its second-quarter and full-year forecasts. Coventry was the biggest faller on the S&P 500 dropping 26.4 per cent to $31.05 over the week, while peers UnitedHealth Group and Humana slumped 11.8 per cent to $27.12 and 10.7 per cent to $41.97.
80;HUM;Humana Inc;2008-06-17T20:54:52Z;Goldman chills Wall Street with warnings;;New York stocks fell on Tuesday as Goldman Sachs both soothed and spooked markets, with second-quarter results that handily beat expectations while its analysts argued that continuing losses and writedowns may force US banks to raise $65bn of extra capital.Goldman said profits fell 11 per cent to $2.09bn, but that was well ahead of consensus estimates as gains in commodities and prime brokerage offset losses elsewhere.The results had little impact on the broader financial sector, however. It slipped 2.9 per cent after a number of analysts, including some at Goldman, wrote downbeat notes on investment banks and cut their targets for regional banks.Analysts at Strategas Research said: “We find it difficult to envision how the majors will be able to put the earnings machine back together in the near-term and therefore it is not time to wade back into the investment banks.”The latest batch of data on housing, industrial production and inflation also weighed on sentiment.Housing starts fell 3.3 per cent to a 975,000 annual rate in May, knocking the S&P 500 homebuilding index down 1.4 per cent.New figures on industrial production also made for sober reading. Large industrials such as Boeingfell back after the Federal Reserve said production slipped 0.2 per cent in May.Meanwhile, the Producer Price Index, a key inflation measure,jumped by a higher-than-expected 1.4 per cent in May due to surging energy prices, although core inflation moderated as forecast.Financial markets have suffered in recent weeks as rising inflation has stirred fears that the Fed will start raising interest rates.However, some remain optimistic on the outlook for monetary policy and equities. David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: “We continue to expect that in an environment of increased uncertainty, US equities will outperform. The hawkish noises from the Fed seem to us much more an exercise in expectations management than a warning of an imminent tightening.”The S&P 500 closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,350.93, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent lower at 12,160.30. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,457.73.Financials were in focus again on Tuesday after the Goldman results. Of the leading brokerages, Goldman has stood up best to the credit crunch. So far this year its share price has lost about 16 per cent of its value compared with a 29.3 per cent loss for the S&P 500 investment banking index.Goldman shares fell 1.5 per cent to $179.44 on Tuesday while its peers for the most part dropped back. Bank of America lost 3.6 per cent to $29.24 and Lehman dropped 7.6 per cent to $25.14.Zions Bancorp was the biggest sector faller, tumbling 8.6 per cent to $33.97,. The Salt Lake City-based lender was pummelled after it said further increases in bad loans were “likely”.In the consumer discretionary sector, data showing a small increase in weekly chain store sales initially boosted retailers. Analysts attributed the gains to demand for hot weather merchandise, Father’s Day shopping and federal tax rebates.Gap shares rose 0.3 per cent to $18, while Coach added 0.1 per cent to $33.37. But disappointing results from Best Buy and poor appliance sales data for May, which hit Whirlpool, helped drag the sector down 1.3 per cent. Best Buy fell 5.3 per cent to $43.46 and Whirlpool dropped 3.5 per cent to $66.03.Homebuilders and industrials also came under pressure. Lennar dropped 4 per cent to $15.28 and KB Home lost 3.5 per cent to $18.34, while United Technologies gave up 0.7 per cent to $68.41 and Boeing fell 0.9 per cent to $74.38.Commodity-related stocks were among the few gainers. Energy rose 1.7 per cent as refiners bounced back and bid speculation pushed shares in Marathon Oil3.1 per cent higher to $53.07. Materials added 0.2 per cent, led by Monsanto, which gained 5 per cent to $142.69.The healthcare sector initially made ground after Elan said its experimental Alzheimer’s drug helped some patients. Elan shares added 10.7 per cent to $30, while Wyeth, Elan’s US partner, rose 4.8 per cent to $45.16.But losses for healthcare providers swamped those gains. Humana dropped 3.3 per cent to $44.87.
81;HUM;Humana Inc;2008-03-14T20:45:48Z;Wall Street hit by mixed messages;;"US stocks ended the week at levels virtually unchanged from the previous Friday, a fact which belies the incredible volatility experienced by investors over the last five days.It has been an extraordinary week on Wall Street, and one characterised by mixed signals about the health of the economy and global financial markets.The week began on a sour note, with stocks falling to 19-month lows after oil prices soared to a record and the dollar plumbed new lows.On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve sparked a significant rally when it announced a new, expanded effort to improve financial market liquidity. Investors’ initial euphoria waned just a day later, after Carlyle Capital, a highly-leveraged mortgage bond fund, said it had defaulted on $16.6bn in debt and was facing collapse.Standard & Poor’s provided a sentiment boost on Thursday, when it said the end was near for subprime writedowns at major financial institutions. Prior to the S&P comment, shares had fallen on data showing consumers had cut their spending sharply in February.And early on Friday, unexpectedly benign inflation data supported a strong opening on Wall Street.But by the end of the trading day in New York, as investors digested the implications of JP Morgan and the Federal Reserve stepping in to support Bear Stearns, stocks had turned sharply negative.The S&P 500, which had been poised for its best week since the end of January before Friday, fell 0.4 per cent on the week to 1,288.14.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5 per cent over the period to 11,951.09, while the Nasdaq composite was unchanged at 2,212.49. TBear Stearns which this week repeatedly denied it faced any funding problems, plummeted after the brokerage said its liquidity position had significantly deteriorated. In response, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch slashed Bear’s credit ratings to triple-A. Shares fell 57.2 per cent this week to $30, a near 10-year low.JPMorgan Chase, which is acting in tandem with the New York Fed to provide Bear with secured funding, fell 2.7 per cent on the week to $36.54. The bank said shareholders would not be exposed to “any material risk”.Financial stocks bore the brunt of the fallout from the Bear rescue. Citigroupfell 5.4 per cent on the week to $19.78. Merrill Lynch fell 3.7 per cent to $43.51.Lehman Brothers fell 15.3 per cent to $41.48. “The most acute contagion from the liquidity disease afflicting Bear Stearns today appears to be festering at Lehman Brothers,” analysts at Interactive Brokers said. “The mad rush for protection against further downside drama in its share price appears more or less unmitigated.”Bank of America fell 2.9 per cent to $35.69, while Countrywide, which it has agreed to buy, fell 11.2 per cent to $4.50. Bank of America’s proposed acquisition of the top US mortgage lender has come under increasing scrutiny from investors and lawmakers. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic senator from New York, said Countrywide had been a “main contributor” to the mortgage crisis, and the lender is one of
several facing an early-stage inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Ambac, the bond insurer, lost 34.5 per cent of its value this week, falling to $6.22 despite having its top-notch credit rating reaffirmed by both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. Rival MBIA fell 8.8 per cent to $10.94.AIG the world’s largest insurer, fell 4 per cent to $41.18 after Morgan Stanley said it could be hit by as much as $3bn in losses related to credit default swaps. Insurance companies are facing subprime-related losses that could dwarf the record set by Hurricane Katrina, the worst natural disaster in US history, according to Bloomberg data.The amount of asset writedowns and credit losses reported by the insurance industry has reached at least $38bn, just shy of the $41.1bn in claims from Katrina, Bloomberg data show.WellPoint fell 29.8 per cent this week to $47.09 after the health insurer said it expected a smaller profit because of higher medical costs and economic weakness.Rival Humana fell 30.8 per cent to $43.98 after it revised its own forecasts downward, citing higher-than-expected claims in its standalone Medicare prescription plans. Moody’s cut its ratings outlook on Humana to “negative” from “stable”.Elsewhere in the insurance sector, Progressive fell 11.3 per cent to $15.47 after the car insurer reported weak February results.The insurance sector fell 2.7 per cent this week."

Nine of the 10 industry groups in the index advanced, after all 10 opened the day lower.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.3 per cent, to 12,145.74, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.9 per cent to 2,263.61.Financial shares erased a decline of as much as 4 per cent after S&P said banks have already disclosed the majority of their writedowns.S&P said it expected the bulk of future writedowns to come from “hedge funds, monoline insurers, other insurers, and other financial institutions”.Stocks had slumped early in the trading day after the highly leveraged mortgage bond fund Carlyle Capital said it had defaulted on $16.6bn in debt.Thornburg Mortgage, the exotic mortgage lender which has lost 75 per cent of its value this year, fell 20.7 per cent to $2.26.Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, fell 0.4 per cent to $4.77. The lender said late payments on home loans declined in February and foreclosures increased. Bank of America, which has agreed to buy Countrywide, rose 0.3 per cent to $37.14.Washington Mutual, the largest US savings and loan, rose 4.2 per cent to $12.13. WaMu, which has been battered by losses linked to subprime loans, has been approached by Toscafund Asset Management, the UK hedge fund, with an offer to invest its own money in the company.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government sponsored mortgage entities, rallied strongly. Fannie rose 9.2 per cent to $22.97, while Freddie added 7.6 per cent to $21.30.Citigroup fell 0.7 per cent to $21.07 and JPMorgan fell 1.3 per cent to $38.11. Lehman Brothers rose 2.3 per cent to $45.99. Wachovia, the fourth-largest US bank by assets, fell 2.9 per cent to $27.24.Bear Stearns fell 7.4 per cent to $57 The Wall Street Journal said hedge funds using Bear as a prime broker have been shifting portions of their business to other firms in recent weeks amid widespread speculation the company is facing liquidity problems. Company executives continued to dismiss such suggestions. Alan Schwartz, president and chief executive, said this week that Bear’s “balance sheet, liquidity and capital remain strong”.AIG fell 2.7 per cent to $42.48 after Morgan Stanley said the world’s largest insurer could be hit by as much as $3bn in losses related to credit default swaps. The brokerage cut its recommendation on the stock to “equal-weight’’ from “overweight” and said that if the fixed income crisis deepens the losses could cause a capital shortfall.Gold’s surge above $1,000 triggered a rally among gold miners.Newmont Mining, the world’s second-largest gold producer, climbed to its highest since January after both futures and spot gold hit records. Shares rose 4.7 per cent to $53.78, while Toronto-based miner Iamgold rose 6.5 per cent to $8.31.Retail stocks weakened after economic data showed a larger-than-expected fall in sales. Macy’s, the owner of the eponymous chain and of Bloomingdale’s, rose 0.3 per cent to $23.26. JC Penney fell 0.3 per cent to $39.68.Men’s Wearhouse rose 1.9 per cent to $21.62. The chain of men’s clothing stores forecast earnings that fell short of analysts’ estimates.Noven Pharmaceuticals tumbled after the drugmaker delayed its fourth-quarter and full-year results due to an accounting issue. Its shares fell 10.5 per cent to $10.54.Aspect Medical Systems fell 45.1 per cent to $5.64 after a study said the company’s flagship product, which hospitals use to monitor patients for consciousness during surgery, was largely ineffective.Humana, the health insurance company that has had a rough week, rose 10 per cent to $44.98 after UBS raised its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “sell”.General Motors slid 3 per cent to $20.31 after Morgan Stanley cut its price target on the stock by 10 per cent on concern that slowing US sales will hurt profit.
83;HUM;Humana Inc;2008-03-12T20:43:22Z;US health insurers;;Medical costs for health insurers WellPoint and Humana have risen more than expected this year. The news sent up a warning flare concerning the industry’s worst fear – unanticipated cost acceleration – and burned share prices to a crisp. Rival Aetna reaffirmed its profit forecast, but WellPoint’s warning has nonetheless triggered a sell-off in the sector that wiped out gains posted last year, when investors had viewed it as a haven. That defensive lustre has justifiably worn off. The recent market share wars that prompted insurers to cut their premiums are starting to look ill-timed.WellPoint, an industry bellwether with 35m medical members, priced its premiums on the assumption that medical costs would rise by less than 8 per cent this year. But the volume of high-expense claims steepened across many of its markets, as did doctor and hospital costs. WellPoint overshot cost estimates in its Medicare business, and the subsequent profit warning from Medicare-heavy Humana suggests WellPoint’s Medicare troubles may not be isolated.Humana, however, largely shot itself in the foot. It overestimated demand for expensive brand-name drugs and lowered co-payments, which left it responsible for an inflated portion of members’ drug costs. The co-payment cuts prompted waves of high-cost members to shift into more expensive plans, twisting the knife by raising Humana’s costs further. Conditions should be better for insurers with more underwriting prowess or, in Aetna’s case, minimal Medicare exposure and a growing share of profitable individual and small group customers.Even if WellPoint’s higher costs do not materialise industry-wide, the sector’s outlook is cloudy. Uncertainty over whether the next political administration will favour increased regulation and less private-sector Medicare involvement could worsen as the elections draw nearer. With a lack of clarity over the scope of cost increases now making visibility even worse, most insurers’ risks appear to outweigh their investment prospects.Post and read comments on this Lex
84;HUM;Humana Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
85;HUM;Humana Inc;2008-02-21T23:20:43Z;Top pay-off for workers on the treadmill;;Steve Burd has high hopes for FoodFlex, a new online service that allows customers to track the nutritional quality of the food they buy, using sales data collected on their store loyalty cards.Mr Burd is chief executive of Safeway, one of the big three US supermarket groups. In 2009, he wants to go further, offering employees who use the programme a discount on the costs of health insurance. This would extend benefits already offered to those who participate in fitness monitoring and other healthy activities.“Some people would say you’re kind of intruding,” he says of the effort to use insurance premium cuts to encourage healthy lifestyles. But “the model we’re following has existed for decades in automobile insurance. If you have a lot of accidents, you pay more for your insurance…Healthy behaviour gets re-warded, less healthy behaviours should bear their fair share.”The view is increasingly shared by other US business leaders. Kellogg, Quaker Oats, Johnson & Johnson and Dell are among those who offer either cash incentives or premium reductions to workers who participate in a range of lifestyle, wellness or disease management programmes.“The healthcare system can do the most good by getting people to take more responsibility for their own health,” says Jeff Noddle, chief executive of Supervalu, a retailer with 190,000 employees that is looking at similar “wellness” strategies.Pressing people to take more responsibility for their health is at the forefront of a drive to reform US healthcare by making it more “consumer-oriented”.Proponents argue that soaring healthcare costs can only be contained by a combination of better cost-consciousness and a reduction in demand for health services. An informed, discerning consumer, the theory goes, can do both of those – and, in theory, will make more healthy lifestyle choices in response to the financial incentives offered by wellness programmes.But not everyone is convinced. Dr Stephanie Woolhandler, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a leading proponent of a US national healthcare scheme, warns of the threat to the principle of shared interests upon which health insurance is based. “It pulls the threads apart that keep society together. Part of the reason societies exist is to help take care of each other. It’s morally bankrupt.”Advocates of such programmes point out that current laws prevent insurance companies from offering programmes that ex-clude the unhealthy or make premiums dependent on the results of a wellness programme. Federal regulations last year also limited to 20 per cent the amount by which healthcare premiums can be reduced through incentive schemes.Dr Jonathan Lord, head of wellness programmes at Humana, a US insurer, argues that wellness programmes need to be designed to include all employees. The insurer has been running a “Health Miles” programme with Virgin Life in the US that offers rewards – such as retailer’s gift cards – in exchange for gym activity.“To our surprise more people who signed up for it were in the less-than-healthy than in the healthy category…and we’ve had significant improvements in reports of reduced body mass index and increased exercise.”Some employers have changed their programmes after encountering resistance from employees. Clarian Health Partners, a hospital group in Indiana, last year tried to charge an extra $30(£15, €20) a month for those of its 13,000 employees who failed to meet targets for tobacco use, body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol. After complaints from employees, it instead offered cash incentives of up to $30 in exchange for meeting targets or participating in wellness programmes.Other employers have taken a different approach. Wal-Mart, the largest private employer in the US, is encouraging its 1.3m store workers to set out health-related goals for themselves under “Personal Sustainability Plans”.Aside from the ethics, healthcare experts find that consumers often do not act rationally and make poor decisions on health risks. For instance, news of minor safety risks with a drug can prompt people to stop taking crucial medications for chronic illness.There are those, too, who question whether the money companies are investing in wellness programmes actually delivers lower healthcare costs for the companies themselves.Eric Finkelstein, a researcher on obesity and health at RTI International and author of The Fattening of America, writes that “there is little evidence that these programmes actually save employers money”, in spite of research that shows savings of $3, $4 or $16 per dollar invested.But Humana’s Dr Lord argues that even outside the US – where healthcare may be provided free by the state – incentivised programmes are likely to become increasingly frequent.“The nature of rewards and incentives may not have the same economic element that it has in the US. But I think rewards and recognition will increasingly become part of the whole mechanism of healthcare that we see around the world.”
86;HUM;Humana Inc;2008-02-04T22:04:06Z;US stocks retreat as investors lock in profits;;US shares retreated on Monday when investors sought to lock in recent profits amid fears that a weak jobs market would lead to mounting losses in the consumer credit sector.Financial companies and homebuilders were particularly hard hit as traders bet that rising loan delinquencies and falling house prices would hit corporate earnings.Investors also looked to offload retail stocks after last week’s disappointing jobs report persuaded analysts that a recession was more likely.The S&P 500 closed 1.1 per cent lower at 1,380.82, with the homebuilder sector down 6 per cent and the financial sector losing 2.5 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to 2,382.85 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.9 per cent to 12,635.16.Wachovia and Wells Fargo were among the biggest fallers after Merrill Lynch told investors to sell the banking stocks because of their vulnerability to a worsening housing market. The shares lost 8.3 per cent to $35.53 and 6.7 per cent to $31.39, respectively. Washington Mutual, the savings and loan company, slumped 12.2 per cent to $19.16.“Trying to put a valuation on some of these financials is just really difficult when they keep coming out with these horrible earnings numbers,” said Thomas Nyheim, vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust.Separately, UBS told investors to sell shares in credit card issuers American Express, Capital One Financial and Discover Financial Services, citing expectations of rising credit losses in the consumer finance sector. UBS cut its price target on AmEx from $67 to $45, prompting the stock to fall 3.9 per cent to $47.66. Capital One fell 7.6 per cent to $52.65, and Discover lost 9 per cent to $16.34.Wall Street analysts fear that job losses could lead to rising delinquencies with problems spreading beyond the subprime mortgage market. As a result US banks are tightening lending amid a reduced tolerance for risk, a Federal Reserve loan officer survey showed on Monday.Economists received a shock on Friday after the US economy shed jobs for the first time in 4½ years but in spite of the downbeat report equities chalked up their best weekly performance in almost five years, with the S&P financial sector gaining 8.5 per cent for the week. Traders were left wondering, however, if the gain was a temporary fillip or the start of a meaningful move higher.Among the factors driving the rally were hopes for a rescue of bond insurers which have been threatened with credit downgrades. Ambac Financial and MBIA fell 13.7 per cent to $11.39 and 5.9 per cent to $15.39, respectively, on Monday after the Financial Times reported that any rescue was unlikely to involve private equity firms as they believed the risks were too great.Traders also took profits in the technology sector after last week’s bounce triggered by Microsoft’s $44.6bn bid for Yahoo. The potential mega-merger may come in for close scrutiny after Google said the takeover could open the way for Microsoft to extend its PC monopoly to the internet.The drama probably has more acts to unfold with Yahoo insiders seeing an alliance with Google as one of their best options for fighting off Microsoft. Yahoo rose 3.4 per cent to $29.33, but Microsoft slipped 0.9 per cent to $30.19.Shares in Google closed below $500 for the first time since August, falling 4 per cent to $495.43, after Goldman Sachs removed the online search giant from a conviction “buy” list.In earnings news, Archer Daniels Midland, 2.9 per cent weaker at $44.20, increased quarterly profits to $473m from $441m, but the agricultural producer’s results narrowly missed some analysts’ estimates.Humana, the health in-surer, increased fourth-quarter profits by 57 per cent to $243.2m, beating Wall Street estimates. But the stock fell 3.5 per cent to $78.98.With more than half of S&P 500 companies having reported for the fourth quarter, corporate earnings are on track for a 20.7 per cent fall in the last three months of 2007, according to Thomson Financial, with financials the source of most of the weakness. Technology and energy earnings continue to hold up, increasing an expected 26 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. Profits are forecast to grow by less than 2 per cent in the first and second quarters, before rebounding strongly later in the year.Many analysts see US manufacturers coping well, as exports are helped by a weak dollar. Factory orders rose 2.3 per cent in December, roughly in line with expectations – the biggest increase since July. Last week, US durable goods orders rose more than expected and the ISM manufacturing index expanded.
87;HUM;Humana Inc;2008-01-20T22:13:03Z;Safeway’s premium plan for healthy workers;;US shop workers could find their health insurance premiums being linked to their food-buying habits, if a supermarket initiative wins acceptance.Safeway, which operates more than 1,700 supermarkets across the the country, says it plans to offer its employees discounts on their health insurance if they participate in a service that tracks the nutritional quality of the food they buy at its stores.The move is part of a wider push by leading employers – including Kellogg, Humana and Pitney Bowes to offer lower health premiums to employees who pursue healthy lifestyles.Safeway’s proposals would be linked to the retailer’s online FoodFlex service, launched in November as an offshoot of its loyalty card programme.Participating customers are invited to provide details of their family members, how active their lifestyles are, and whether they have specific health issues.The system uses the information on their Safeway card to deliver a nutritional analysis of their purchases at the store, rated against USDA recommended consumption levels of 25 nutrients and vitamins.It also allows customers to see the relative nutritional benefits of different products and brands. If prompted, it proposes other products, such as a soup brand with lower sodium levels.Steve Burd, Safeway’s chief executive, said the company hoped to tie the Foodflex system into its health plan in 2009.“If someone wants to opt in to demonstrate a nutritious lifestyle, I think we’ll be the first company to grant premium reductions for that. I think other companies will follow.”In 2006, Safeway launched a healthcare plan for its non-union workers that offered discounts to encourage behavioural changes linked to regular company- funded medical check-ups. Staff at its headquarters can also participate in a programme at a gym – similar to a scheme offered in the UK by Pru Health.Safeway said the plan had resulted in a 13 per cent annual reduction in its medical costs per head , and a 30-35 per cent reduction in payments by the workers over its first two years.Mr Burd said that while some of the initiatives could be considered intrusive, the retailer was following the principles established in motor insurance. “If you have a lot of accidents, you pay more for your insurance . . . Healthy behaviour gets rewarded, less healthy behaviours should bear their fair share.”
88;HUM;Humana Inc;2007-12-30T17:00:11Z;Rewards of a virtuous life;;"James Baddeley may succumb to a little festive over-eating this week, but he is determined to compensate by doubling the exercise he does afterwards to burn off the extra calories. And he has a financial incentive to do so.By walking at least 12,500 steps four times a week, measured on a pedometer that he plugs into his computer, he has helped sharply reduce the premiums he pays on a pioneering private healthcare plan.“Saving money ticks most peoples’ boxes,” says Mr Baddeley, who had been afraid of the high premiums on private insurance when he switched employers and had to pay for his own cover. “I think it’s revolutionary. It’s a model that could have a lot more mileage.”Frequent walking is one of the ways that Pru Health, a UK-based insurance company, encourages clients to improve their fitness; another is subsidised gym membership. Mr Baddeley’s coverage costs are greatly reduced while his insurer reduces its medical claims.The model – first developed in Africa – is attracting new clients and sparking corporate imitators. But it could have much wider applications for governments around the world that are struggling to boost prevention programmes to tackle the spiralling costs of obesity.Shaun Matisonn, an actuary who runs Pru Health, a joint venture between Discovery Healthcare of South Africa and Prudential of the UK, says the concept began in the early 1990s when Discovery tried expanding its client base from rich white locals to the less well-off black majority.“We were trying to shift to paying for wellness instead of the way that people currently pay for sickness,” he says. “And we wanted to subsidise [the healthcare costs of] poorer people with the premiums of the rich.”But tough South African anti-discrimination laws provided an extra hurdle to private health insurers: they were not allowed either to refuse clients such as those who were HIV positive or had other higher healthcare costs, nor to charge differential premiums to compensate.The result was Discovery’s Vitality programme, which offers incentives to clients willing to help themselves by changing their eating and exercise patterns or quitting smoking – and reducing their insurer’s healthcare bills in the process.South African customers who agree to a check-up and follow the advice they receive on healthier lifestyles win health points similar to airlines’ frequent flyer programmes, exchangeable for air travel, hotels, discounts on consumer goods and even cinema tickets.The system created other difficulties. Discovery had to repatriate 200 clients after those who had cashed points to travel on Swissair were stranded when the airline went into administration. Children persuaded their parents to switch to the insurer so they could use the points to see the same Harry Potter movie up to 12 times, creating unexpected imbalances in the rewards portfolio.But a recent analysis of half of Discovery’s 2m South African clients suggested that two-thirds had enrolled in Vitality since its launch in 1998. The 15 per cent of these that the company categorised as highly engaged in prevention programmes incurred significantly lower costs per patient, with fewer and less costly prescriptions, lower hospital admission rates and shorter stays.Mr Matisonn concedes that there is a risk of “cherry picking” clients who were already in better shape and committed to a healthy lifestyle, but he estimates that half have changed their behaviour because of the incentives. His company is able to reduce its overall healthcare bill even after allowing for the cost of its points.Others agree. Virgin, which was active in South Africa, has created “Life Care”, a programme linked to its gyms in the US, in partnership with the healthcare company Humana. It estimates 12 per cent of clients have shifted down a body mass index category, from obese to overweight, or from overweight to healthy.Jack Lord, senior vice-president at Humana, says: “Fighting obesity from a public health perspective is boring. It comes from the land of ‘no’. We’re trying to find different pathways. Building rewards and incentives is natural for people. They need something they can measure.”His programme, with 80,000 clients in the US, includes the provision of bicycles, pedometers and even computer-based “exergames” encouraging people to dance. There are “mind games” on mobile phones for older clients designed to defer senility; and it is experimenting with computer simulations to show customers visually the effects of healthier living on their appearance and psychological well-being.Discovery was less successful in the US, struggling in 2000 to enter what Mr Matisonn calls “a fiercely competitive marketplace” where, without the critical mass of clients needed to negotiate bulk medical discounts, it was squeezed out as rival insurers cut their premiums to drive it out of business.But in the UK, Mr Matisonn says appetite has been strong, with 140,000 customers recruited in the past three years. Pru Health offers cholesterol and blood pressure screening, assistance for those trying to stop smoking, and even points for buying fruit and vegetables at J Sainsbury, the supermarket chain.Some individuals like Mr Baddeley are motivated by reducing their premiums. He estimates that the annual charge for his family, if he did no fitness activities, would have been £1,980 – in line with other private health insurers. By carrying out all the healthy activities to achieve “platinum” status, he gets discounts and reimbursements on all his premiums net of any claim that have reduced the cost to just £400 this year.For employers, the rationale may be different. Claire Morrison, human resources manager at Reed Smith Richard Butler, a law firm, says she hopes premiums with Pru Health will at least remain stable while those offered by rival insurers continue to rise.But for most employees, the main attraction has been the healthy perks such as the generous discounts on gym membership and health spas, as well as “activity days”. “It’s about giving something back,” she says. “Associates work very hard, and we take the work-life balance very seriously.”One issue for all such prevention programmes is which activities should be promoted. Mr Matisonn says Pru Health has steered clear of providing incentives or programmes to reduce drinking. “It’s sensitive, and we are not sure how to measure success,” he says. Some important prevention measures – such as MRI scans or mammography – remain too costly for insurers to offer for free.One risk is clients “gaming” the system. He is suspicious of those who clock into their gym several times in a day towards the end of each accounting period in order to win points. Mr Lord says he knows that customers have attached their pedometers to dog collars or put them in the spin drier to clock up miles falsely.Customers may also switch health plans, so rival companies would benefit from the reduced treatment charges that may only pay back after several years.Mr Baddeley says that reimbursement of his premiums means he now has an incentive not to visit a specialist unless he really feels the need, even where that could be imprudent in the long run. “The system works best if you don’t claim, are healthy and are quite lucky,” he says.A final threat for Discovery is that, while it has tried to patent its system and lock in gyms and other partners accepting its reward points, it is difficult to prevent other insurers launching similar programmesBut in the fight against obesity, every little helps. And as private healthcare providers struggle to overcome the challenges of health incentive schemes, the biggest beneficiaries – besides individuals like Mr Baddeley – may ultimately be the world’s public health systems."

Materials stocks also attracted buyers, buoyed by rising commodity prices. Some positive earnings news also cheered the market.The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent at 1,540.98, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent at 2,817.44 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also up 0.5 per cent at 13,870.26. However the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks was flat at 821.72.A two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which starts on Tuesday, was at the front of investors’ minds on Monday.Interest rate futures fully priced in a one-quarter-percentage point cut in the Fed Funds rate to 4.50 per cent on Wednesday, with a small chance of a reduction to 4.25 per cent.“We do not think the Fed will risk disappointing the markets at this week’s FOMC. Although inflation concerns linger, these will likely have to take a backseat to more immediate concerns,” analysts at Credit Suisse said.Chastened by concerns about the health of the US economy, investors have continued to buy large-cap stocks which generate a large proportion of their sales overseas. McDonald’s, up 1.2 per cent at $59.18, and IBM up 0.9 per cent at $114.80, were among the biggest risers on the Dow on Monday.“Large-cap companies with higher international exposure and secular growth drivers should continue to lead [earnings per share] growth and outperform,” analysts at UBS Investment Research said.But Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, had some cautionary words.“In theory, this [strategy] takes advantage of faster economic growth outside the US, with additional translation gains from a weaker dollar,” he said. “Yet, the ‘bite’ of higher interest rates in Europe and a strong currency may be causing leading indicators to roll over across the pond, increasing the potential for 2008 earnings misses.”In earnings news, third-quarter profit at Verizon Communications declined compared with a year ago, but beat expectations. Revenues increased 5.8 per cent to $23.8bn. The stock gained 0.9 per cent at $45.99.Humana, the health insurer, reported a 90 per cent jump in quarterly earnings to $302.4m and boosted its 2007 and 2008 earnings guidance. But the stock was off 2.4 per cent at $73.75.RadioShack was up 4.1 per cent at $20.42 after it swung to a third-quarter profit. Hertz increased third-quarter profit by 51 per cent, helped by rising car rental revenues. Its shares slipped 1.6 per cent to $22.98 on concerns about the outlook for equipment rentals.Office Depot fell 14.1 per cent to $17.43 after it delayed the release of third-quarter earnings due to an independent review of its vendor program funds. JPMorgan cut its rating from “overweight” to “neutral”.US crude’s new high of $93.80 a barrel lifted energy stocks. Exxon Mobil gained 1.5 per cent to $93.61 after the Supreme Court said it would hear an appeal against a demand for $2.5bn in punitive damages for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.Chevron gained 1.3 per cent at $92.88 while National Oilwell Varco rose 2.7 per cent to $74.48.However, oil prices again hit transport stocks.

90;HUM;Humana Inc;2007-10-04T22:07:46Z;Backing for private sector’s NHS role;;"The private sector has a role in the National Health Service, Alan Johnson, the health secretary, said on Thursday as the government offered the clearest indication yet that it remained committed to at least a degree of choice and competition to improve care.After months of mixed signals to both the private sector and the NHS itself, the health secretary said the independent sector would have a role in providing 150 new health centres and 100 new GP practices that were announced on Thursday.Their introduction, along with a pledge that all patients needing non-emergency operations would be screened for the MRSA superbug next year, followed recommendations by Lord Darzi in his interim report on his “next stage” NHS review.With his report launched by the prime minister, Lord Darzi called for the introduction of new providers to help develop more flexible GP opening hours, while adding that “patient choice should be embedded within the full spectrum of NHS funded care”, covering primary care and long-term conditions as well as elective operations.Asked if he was committed to that, Mr Johnson said: “Yes, there is a role for the private sector here, and there is a role for it in the rest of the NHS. But it is about patient care first.”Evidence of that will come today when the Department of Health finally announces the winners of a framework contract intended to make it easier for primary care trusts to buy in private sector help with the commissioning of care.The 14 contractors include four big US health insurers and care managers, Aetna, Humana, Health Dialog Services and UnitedHealth, as well as UK health specialists such as Bupa, Axa PPP and Tribal and the consulting firms KPMG and McKinsey.The department is also to advertise for additional private suppliers for NHS operations and diagnostics ahead of the introduction of “free choice” for waiting list operations from April.Under that patients will be able to choose any approved hospital in the country prepared to treat them at NHS prices.How big a role all that will mean for the private sector will depend on patient choice; on how far primary care trusts take advantage of the new commissioning contract; and on how energetically they seek out private providers to challenge existing GP services. But after months of uncertainty there appears to be at least greater clarity on the independent sector’s role, even if Gordon Brown and Mr Johnson avoided any public reference to it in their launch of Lord Darzi’s report.The costing of initiatives to tackle healthcare infections and to create the new health centres, along with 100 new practices in under-doctored areas – likely to add up to tens of millions of pounds a year – would have to await the announcement of the comprehensive spending review next week, Mr Johnson said.The Conservatives claimed the real aim of Lord Darzi’s report was to downgrade local services, arguing that he was “a trusted clinician who is being used by Gordon Brown”."
91;HUM;Humana Inc;2007-07-30T21:21:40Z;Wall St rebounds on bargain buying;;"Wall Street rebounded on Monday while the deteriorating state of the credit market kept the stocks of companies that had agreed to buy-outs on the defensive.After a choppy morning of trading, a renewed attempt to “buy at the bottom” succeeded by mid-afternoon.The S&P 500 index rose 1 per cent to close at 1,473.91 and had bounced from an earlier low of 1,454.32.Volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix, fell 13.7 per cent to a reading of 20.87. Vix remains 80.5 per cent higher this year.The Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.8 per cent to 2,583.28 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 13,358.31.Small cap stocks also rebounded. The Russell 2000 index gained 0.8 per cent and pared its loss for the year to 0.4 per cent.The sharp rise in volatility and concerns over future deal activity has hit the small- and medium-sized company sector hard.Equity investors continued to monitor the credit market on Monday.A flood of pending new debt issues, in the region of $300bn, linked to this year’s record pace of mergers and buy-out deals, and worries about further losses from mortgage-related investments, cast a pall over sentiment for credit.Lehman Brothers said the $225bn of pending leveraged loan deals “is equivalent to the institutional loan market’s size just two years ago”.Premiums for credit derivative indices that track US and European investment-grade and high-yield bonds have more than doubled in cost since mid-June.After they pushed through new boundaries early on Monday, the indices pulled back, a boost for equities.The recent rise in volatility and in credit risk premiums has weighed on stock prices for many pending buy-out deals and also on the banks that could potentially be left holding bridge loans.Analysts at Goldman said: “It is impossible, even for a wizard like Harry Potter, to reconcile two facts: stocks cannot both melt down because the market fears financial institutions will have to fund and hold levered loan commitments, while at the same time shares of target companies sell off on the belief the same transactions will not close.”Analysts at Goldman Sachs said that 22 pending leveraged buy-out deals offered equity investors an annualised return of 36 per cent if they were completed.Some investors agreed that there were good opportunities in the market for so-called “merger arbitrage” but said risks were paramount.“[It is] a dicey area patrolled by experts and perhaps not a good strategy for retail investors,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “The fact that stocks [that have received buy-out offers] are trading at a
discount may be justified as the cost of capital is higher.”One example is TXU, the Texas utility, which is subject to a $32bn, or $69.25 a share, buy-out offer from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific Group. The stock closed at $65.90 on Monday. The financing for the TXU deal includes an $11bn bridge loan and the banks behind the buy-out include Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers.The S&P Investment bank index rebounded by 1.4 per cent and that cut its loss for the year to 9 per cent.Among other pending buyout deals, First Data was at $32.13 on Monday, below KKR’s $29bn buy-out of $34 a share.Penn National, the racetrack and casino operator that Fortress Group has offered to buy out for $67 a share, traded at $57.80.Hilton Hotels closed at $44.53, below the $47.50-a- share buy-out offer from Blackstone.In other deal news, Dow Jonesfell 5.6 per cent to $51.56, below the $60-a-share offer made by News Corp.A vote to approve the $5bn bid was expected by the Bancroft family after the closing bell on Monday.Earnings season continued and Verizon, the second largest U.S. phone company reported a 4.5 per cent rise in second quarter profit. The Dow stock fell 1.2 per cent to $41.51. Humana, the health insurer, said second-quarter profit more than doubled to $216.8m. The stock rallied 0.4 per cent to $65.08.Archer Daniels Midland rose 0.4 per cent to $34.17. The grain processor’s fiscal fourth-quarter profit more than doubled.Wrigley posted a 20 per cent rise in quarterly results. The stock closed flat at $57.12. Virgin Media rose 4.1 per cent to $25.72 on talk that John Malone’s Liberty Global is weighing a $23bn bid for the UK cable operator. Rural Cellular surged 34.4 per cent to $42.76 after Verizon Wireless agreed to buy the regional network for $2.67bn in cash and debt.Economic data was sparse on Monday, but the rest of the week is replete with reports capped by the July employment report and a manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Friday. Economists expect a gain of 135,000 jobs last month after 132,000 were created in June. The unemployment rate is seen steady at 4.5 per cent for the fourth consecutive month.At the close of trading in New York last week, the S&P 500 index was down 4.9 per cent for the week at 1,458.95 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 4.7 per cent lower at 2,562.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 4.2 per cent lower at 13,265.47."
92;HUM;Humana Inc;2007-07-06T17:42:38Z;Healthcare as horror movie;;"Americans are of two minds about their healthcare system. Only 38 per cent are satisfied with it, according to a New York Times poll taken earlier this year. A main source of worry is the uncertainty that besets the uninsured, whose numbers reach into the tens of millions. But when the same poll asked about the more concrete matter of how people’s own healthcare works, respondents professed themselves delighted. Fully 77 per cent were satisfied, a tally that compares favourably with other western countries.One of the ways in which Michael Moore’s latest documentary, Sicko, is disturbing is that it tries to show how the system fails even those who think they have a comfortable place within it. We meet a 79-year-old man who works loading a trash-compacter to pay for his wife’s prescription drugs; a whistleblower from Humana, the health insurer, who 10 years ago told Congress that employees were promoted for their resistance to approving necessary procedures; and several workers who volunteered to work at Ground Zero after the attacks of September 11 2001 and who now suffer ailments ranging from teeth-grinding to what looks like emphysema. Mr Moore believes the rescue workers would be better off in Canada, Britain or France. He ends the movie with a stunt: taking them by boat for treatment in a hospital in Cuba.Sicko is disturbing in another way. The movie is not communist propaganda. But in a playful, postmodern way, it is a homage to communist propaganda. Lengthy clips are spliced in from old Soviet socialist-realist films full of peasants harvesting grain – for parodic purposes, one assumes. Somewhat less parodically, Mr Moore makes dewy-eyed pronouncements from Cuba, (“They live in a world of we, not me,” he says.) There is nothing wrong with making a movie that uses this style of argument. What is unsettling is how much people seem to like it. The warmth with which the movie has been received (certainly in the theatre where I saw it) shows that there is a steady, even growing taste for what propaganda does – inciting outrage rather than provoking reflection.The US healthcare system is indeed suboptimal even for those it treats best. It is illogical. Corporations get a big tax deduction for insuring their employees, but the self-insured are not entitled to it. The principles for pricing hospital services are opaque. The indigent get charged more for hospital stays than the insured do. Pharmaceutical companies can pay doctors for drug endorsements and testimonials. Since all these problems are the result of market abuses within a system of over-regulation, there is no consensus on whether it is the market or the regulation that is to blame, as a look at recent policy books shows. There are plausible free-market solutions, such as those from David Gratzer, a Canadian physician, in The Cure. Jonathan Cohn, an editor at The New Republic, has written a plea for universal healthcare, Sick. Regina Herzlinger of Harvard Business School has summarised the problems sector-by-sector in a probing book called Who Killed Health Care? Whether one chooses a market or government solution, the challenges of paying for it grow steadily more complex as baby boomers age. Mr Moore makes some constructive points. At least a dozen congressional staffers, he notes, have passed from legislating on healthcare into jobs at pharmaceutical companies, which usually involve lobbying their former colleagues. But it is difficult to isolate these gems amid the omissions, inconsistencies and preaching.Mr Moore implies, for example, that Richard Nixon began the ruination of the healthcare system in February 1971 by supporting insurance plans on the cost-containing model developed by the entrepreneur Henry Kaiser, after the 1930s. However, he lauds Hillary Clinton’s proposed 1993 healthcare reform, which used the same model. Average waiting lists in the Canadian medical system have stretched to months for certain procedures and have become the subject of Supreme Court cases there. But Mr Moore uses his own experience in one hospital waiting room to dismiss the talk of waiting lists as a canard. The US offers free healthcare to the inmates at Guantánamo because it is bound by conventions and civilised norms regarding custody of wards, not because it esteems al-Qaeda terrorists more highly than its own citizens.What makes propaganda is never the argument so much as the spirit in which it is presented. It is not the US healthcare problem that is Mr Moore’s enemy, it is the complexity of it. He rejects subtleties. His goal is not to break through to those who do not agree with him but to drown out the doubts of those who do. Those who sit down to watch Sicko without a broad knowledge of the US healthcare system will leave the theatre with a shallower understanding of the crisis than the one they arrived with.One should face up to the fact that this is the way Americans increasingly choose to get their information on all sorts of issues, not just healthcare policy. The appetite for slanted ideological dramas grows. Mr Moore is not alone in satisfying it. His anti-Bush documentary, Fahrenheit 9/11, was met with the anti-Kerry adverts of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. Perhaps the internet has made this kind of journalism easier. Mr Moore has been described as a “tireless researcher”, but you do not have to be, nowadays. He notes in his film that an online appeal for healthcare horror stories yielded 25,000 of them within a week. In a country of 300m people, any such appeal will provide enough anecdotal evidence to edit into a plausible and even rollicking case for pretty much anything – and to liberate a grateful populace from the heavy burden of level-headedness.The writer is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard"
93;HUM;Humana Inc;2007-04-30T20:57:53Z;Wall Street loses ground;;Wall Street lost ground on Monday, but returns for the leading benchmarks during April ran above 4 per cent, boosted by an earnings season that has exceeded expectations.Although recent data have continued to paint a mixed picture of the economic outlook, the weaker dollar has boosted shares in large companies as investors expect their earnings from foreign operations to rise.“The dollar’s demise provides a benefit for companies with substantive international exposure,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. “The largest 25 firms in the S&P 500 deliver over 40 per cent of their revenue from overseas, compared to about 27 per cent for the S&P 500 overall.”Monday was a case in point as Wrigley’s first-quarter profit rise 28 per cent from a year ago, amid strong sales of chewing gum and currency gains from the weak dollar. Its shares jumped 7 per cent to $58.88.At the close on Wall Street, the S&P 500 index slid 0.8 per cent to 1,482.37, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.3 per cent to finish at 2,525.09.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,062.91, after it had set a record intra-day high of 13,162.06 in early trade.Leading the gains among blue chips was Procter & Gamble, up 2.25 per cent at $64.40 before third-quarter earnings due on Tuesday.For the month, the Dow gained 5.7 per cent, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both rose 4.3 per cent. The Russell 2000 index of small companies lagged the larger company benchmarks with a rise of 1.7 per cent.The pace of gains during April has some investors worried that a tough May beckons, but analysts say momentum favours buying stocks.William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading, said: “The S&P keeps sitting above 1,450, and that momentum suggests an eventual rise to around 1,575/1,600, with any pullback before then presenting a buying opportunity for investors.”The steady de-equitisation of the US market through private buy-outs and stock buy-backs continues to support stocks. The sharp rally in stocks this month has also been attributed to short sellers being squeezed out of bearish trades.Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, said IBM was the leading Dow stock for short sellers. Aside from IBM, Mr Ablin said other Dow companies including Coca-Cola, Microsoft and McDonald’s had also had a large rise in short selling. “Look for these names to spring higher” if the market keeps rising, Mr Ablin said.Shares in IBM rose 1 per cent to $102.21 after a rise of 7 per cent last week.Another boost for the Dow was Verizon. The telecoms group posted an 8.4 per cent rise in net profit for the first quarter, helped in part by asset sales. The result was in line with analysts’ forecasts, but investors focused on the news that it added 1.7m customers. Shares reversed an early decline to trade up 0.8 per cent at $38.18.News of deal activity left a mixed impression on stock exchanges. Shares in the NYSE Group fell 0.9 per cent to $84.33, the Chicago Board of Trade rose 1 per cent to $188.67, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange slid 1 per cent to $516.75.RadioShack said first-quarter earnings rose five-fold to $42.5m from $8.4m a year earlier. Shares in the electronics retailer rallied 4.9 per cent to $29.07.Tyson Foods, the meat producer, reported a profit of $68m during its fiscal second quarter and revised upwards earnings guidance for the full fiscal year. Its shares fell 1.1 per cent to $20.96.Kellogg reported a 7 per cent rise in quarterly earnings. The food maker boosted its outlook for the full year. That drove it to a 52-week high of $54 a share before the shares closed down 0.3 per cent at $52.91.Humana slid 2.6 per cent to $63.24 after the health insurer’s first-quarter earnings beat expectations but were down compared with a year ago. It raised its full-year earnings forecast.

After solid gains last week, analysts debated whether the bull run could continue.“Indicators suggest that equities are becoming as frothy as in May 2006,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. He said JPMorgan was “becoming more nervous about the durability of the current bull run”.Others suggested, however, that the economic background favoured holding stocks. The recent mix of economic data has suggested a combination of moderating inflation and overall economic strength in spite of weakness in the housing and manufacturing sectors. “We do not see significant warning signals for an economic downturn and see little reason to be bearish on the US equities,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.Among M&A deals, Triad Hospital surged 14.7 per cent to $49.65 after it revealed it had agreed to a buy-out from private equity investors for $4.7bn and the assumption of $1.7bn in debt.Lear rose 11.5 per cent to $38.64 after it reported an approach from a group affiliated with Carl Icahn, the investor. The group offered $2.61bn, or $36 a share for the car-parts maker.State Street fell 6.5 per cent to $67.08 after the financial services group said it would acquire Investors Financial Services for about $4.5bn in stock.Herbalife announced that a private equity firm had made an offer of $38 a share, or $2.7bn, for the company. Its shares jumped 21.21 per cent to $40.12.Mills Corp received a $1.56bn offer from Simon Property Group and hedge fund Farallon Capital Management. The mall owner agreed to be bought by Brookfield Asset Management last month. Mills rose 16.8 per cent to $25.87.By the close in New York the Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent lower at 2,470.6. Offsetting technology weakness was KLA-Tencor, up 2.6 per cent at $51.29. The semiconductor maker said its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 18 per cent and it boosted its guidance on the outlook for its fiscal third-quarter.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 12,661.74.One of the best performers in the Dow was Wal-Mart after it released an estimate on Saturday that its January store sales should rise 2.2 per cent, a stronger-than-forecast outcome. Its shares rose 0.9 per cent to $48.52.Humana rose 0.9 per cent to $57.84 after its fourth-quarter net income more than doubled to $155m from the previous year and surpassed analyst estimates. The health insurer also raised its earnings outlook for 2007.

Fannie Mae, up 3.6 per cent at $60.38, and Freddie Mac, up 2.2 per cent at $69.48, capitalised on expectations of less onerous regulation.In contrast, investors sold down the healthcare sector and big defence companies this week. The New York Stock Exchange Healthcare index rose 1.7 per cent early in the week ahead of the elections but tumbled after the election results. The index was down 2.1 per cent for the week at 6,742.80.“There is some concern for healthcare, with the Democrats talking about Medicare and [with] an eye toward lowering prescription drug prices,” said Mr Ablin.Big pharmaceutical groups Merck and Pfizer fell 4.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent to $43.12 and $25.71 respectively during the week. Johnson & Johnson was off 2.2 per cent at $66.29.Among managed health care providers, Humana fell 8.4 per cent to $52, in spite of reiterating its 2006 and 2007 earnings targets earlier in the week. UnitedHealth was down 3.6 per cent at $46.11, and WellCare fell 5.2 per cent to $56.WellPoint and Aetna were lower by 1.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent at $72.89 and $40.24 respectively. Watson-Pharma slid 5.2 per cent to $24.84 after disappointing earnings and legal woes. Bausch & Lomb fell 6.6 per cent for the week to $49.50 after it lowered 2006 and 2007 forecasts following the recall of its ReNu contact lens solution.Defence shares pared some of their post-election losses but on Friday were still down on the week. Lockheed Martin was 1.4 per cent lower at $85.75, Northrop Grumman was down 1.9 per cent at $64.70 and Raytheon had eased 0.2 per cent to $48.90.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 index had gained 1.2 per cent to 1,364.30 for the week and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.5 per cent higher at 2,389.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1 per cent firmer at 12,108.43 after making a record close of 12,176.54 on Wednesday.The small-cap Russell 2000 index was up 2 per cent for the week at 768.07.Dominating earnings releases this week was Cisco, which has risen by about 60 per cent this year.

Shares in the company were 3.1 per cent lower at $37.65.Tobias Levkovich, chief equity strategist at Citigroup, said the broad stock market rally of recent weeks could stall in the next couple of months because the large-cap equity indices were within 2 per cent of the bank’s year-end targets while its small and mid-cap targets had been achieved.“The traditional and widely anticipated seasonal year-end rally may have been pulled forward. Election uncertainty and results could also hamper market trends,” he said.Radio company Clear Channel also reported third-quarter figures.

With the sand still between their toes, they might consider how profitable it would have been had they followed the old advice: “Sell in May and go away.”Given the sharp correction in equity markets in May, it would have mattered how close to the May 5 high they sold. Since that date, the S&P 500 index is down just 1.1 per cent. Selling at any time after May 10 would have left an investor trailing the market and missing out on a surprisingly strong summer for equities.“From mid-June, you would want to have been in there,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. The S&P 500 is up about 6 per cent since then.“I’m not so sure we haven’t done in this cycle what we’ve done in the other four,” he said. “Every time, the consumer was supposed to die. Every time it didn’t happen, and those that cashed out were missing out.”Those who sold would have missed the bull run in healthcare stocks during the dog days of summer. Health insurers Humana and Cigna are both up 23 per cent since Memorial Day on May 29, while Caremark, which helps companies manage their pharmacy benefit programmes, has climbed 24 per cent.Major pharmaceutical groups have also surged, with Merck rising 18 per cent, Pfizer 15 per cent and Forest Labs 34 per cent.While healthcare was a noticeable summer leader, other sectors of the market were patchy. One curious phenomenon has been the mixed fate of telecommunications stocks, which have clustered at both the top and bottom of performance.There was a strong rally in integrated telecommunications companies – the descendants of fixed-line telephone groups that now also provide cable television and highspeed internet.AT&T was the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, adding 19.6 per cent since Memorial Day. BellSouth – soon to be acquired by AT&T – gained 21 per cent. Verizon climbed 12.5 per cent and Qwest Communications soared by 25.7 per cent.However, companies that provide equipment to these telecoms groups went in the opposite direction. ADC, which makes networking equipment, plummeted
41 per cent, while Tellabs sank 32 per cent. JDS Uniphase, maker of telecoms testing and measurement equipment, lost 27 per cent.Even sticking with some of the market indices would have made a tidy profit. The S&P 500 is up 2.4 per cent since Memorial Day, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 1.6 per cent.But it was not all plain sailing – the Nasdaq Composite is 0.8 per cent below where it began the summer. Technology investors would have benefited most from the old adage."

Cigna reported a 62 per cent fall in quarterly profit but the performance was not as bad as analysts had feared. Its shares rose 14.6 per cent to $105.04.Adobe Systems leapt 14.8 per cent to $31.72 during the week after it said that it would meet its earnings forecasts for the third quarter, leading analysts to reiterate their mostly positive ratings on the software maker. However, the stock is still down 14.2 per cent this year.Cosmetics and beauty products group Avon Productsslid 16.2 per cent to $27.51 after it reported a

101;HUM;Humana Inc;2006-05-25T15:52:26Z;Market Insight: Healthcare profit downturn follows rising costs;;The US healthcare sector has taken a sudden nasty turn. Some health maintenance organisations (HMOs), the companies that provide healthcare for most Americans, were punished by investors when they reported decreasing profits in the first quarter earnings season. More puzzlingly, others suffered even when their profits rose.The drop-off followed a prolonged rally. From October 2004 until December of 2005, the relevant S&P sector index gained more than 100 per cent - only to shed more than 20 per cent in the last three months.Earlier this month, Humana posted a 22 per cent drop in quarterly profit, sending shares down 7.4 per cent in one day. Cigna’s shares tumbled over 10 per cent the day it revealed a drop in earnings. Aetna reported a modest increase in profit and beat analysts’ estimates, only to plunge 20 per cent in one day.So what is going on? One figure that scared investors was the medical costs ratio, which has edged higher at some HMOs in recent months.“Medical expenses as a percentage of the premium is equivalent to the cost of goods as a percentage of revenue,” said Phil Seligman, managed health and healthcare analyst at Standard and Poor’s. “If they go up faster than the premiums, then that can slow earnings growth.”Mr Seligman said the largest HMOs have grown almost as big as they can. “With all of the consolidation that is occurring in the industry, we now have giants that are beginning to butt up against each other. When we have more competition in the sector and a finite number of people to become members, then they have to compete for these people.”The result is higher advertising and marketing costs, which squeezes margins.But Charles Boorady, healthcare analyst at Citigroup, argues: “Earnings growth in the sector is still outpacing the market. The analyst community has been bearish and wrong for two years in a sector that was doing well.”Instead, Mr Boorady said some HMOs were deliberately sacrificing profit. “Two companies - Aetna and Cigna - demonstrated a lack of discipline in pricing and extended low margins to get market share,” he said. “In order to get the top line they compromised earnings. That is not the whole industry.”Steven Zaharuk, healthcare analyst at Moody’s, suggested a decline in Aetna’s margins could have been overdue. “Aetna had a very low cost ratio, almost too low,” he said. “Too low can be almost as bad as too high, because then we worry if the company is providing the right level of care.“Mr Boorady says there has been a split in the industry. Some HMOs cater primarily to large employers. Others do substantial business through Medicare Advantage, a publicly funded but privately managed system providing healthcare for seniors.“Medicare is growing much faster with the aging population. This is opening a new opportunity for health insurance,” he said. He cites Humana and UnitedHealth as companies more heavily involved in Medicare Advantage.However, Anthony Soslow, chief investment officer at Global Capital Management, worries about the erratic nature of pricing of the new medicare plans, with HMOs fielding widely varying estimates of the costs of the programmes.“They spent a lot of money to grab customers, but we don’t really know how much it costs for the insurance,” he said. “You’re charging $50 a month and maybe claims will be $60 or $70 a month. There’s a risk in spending that money and competitively pricing it.Mr Zahurak agrees. “I’m concerned about a company that puts all their eggs in into one basket, because the government has not been known to be a good partner ... when I look at companies the one that comes to mind is Humana.”But Humana has not fared as badly since March. Its shares fell 23 per cent only to recover and are now down only 8 per cent since March. Aetna and Cigna are down 27 and 30 per cent for the same period.This suggests Mr Boorady’s working hypothesis may be what is currently driving the market. Investors may be wary of anybody compensated by the federal government, he says, “but high earnings growth will drag stocks higher” .
102;HUM;Humana Inc;2006-05-14T18:22:11Z;Health insurers home in on drug data;;"When Humana, the US health insurer, was recently looking for a new way to analyse the vast amounts of patient data generated by improving medical information technology systems, it turned to the US Department of Defence.The company was in search of skills strikingly akin to those used by the Pentagon to track terrorist cells and monitor threats of a nuclear missile attack. And it got them – in the form of expertise in predictive science that it was able to hire.Jonathan Lord, chief innovation officer at Humana, explains its motivation. “The health insurance industry is receiving inputs that are very much like radar. We can map points out on a screen over time and ask what kinds of things we can do
to change that trajectory . . . I think there are all sorts of
applications.”Tools such as these are fast enabling insurers to analyse patients’ health data, model likely patterns of future illness and take steps to prevent it – ranging from nurse reminder calls to treatments. Yet this new sophistication in IT systems at US health insurers is also changing the face of the US pharmaceuticals market.Patient data can now be analysed quickly and in increasingly intricate and powerful ways, shifting the balance of power away from drugmakers towards the “payers” – the insurers and government agencies that buy their products.This is in turn transforming the industry’s traditional business model, in which drugmakers exercised almost complete control over the information flow around their products.Pharmaceutical companies still start out with a monopoly on information on their own trials. But their assertions about their products’ performance once on the market can now be quickly challenged by payers able to mine medical insurance claims databases for data on a drug’s safety, value and effectiveness. “Payers are smarter than pharma now,” says one healthcare industry expert.John Lechleiter, chief operating officer at Eli Lilly, says it is the one challenge constantly “on the top of his mind” and one of the things that could keep him up at night. “I don’t think anybody really knows our product better than we do. But I think we need to acknowledge that the availability of a lot of digitised data and the availability of a set of patient electronic medical records confers a new perspective for the payers and probably does give them increased influence . . . increased power.”Public scrutiny continues to intensify over high drug prices in the US, whose free-pricing market accounted for 45 per cent of $566bn global drugs sales last year. But private payers’ technology shows the market squeezing back, with or without government pressure.An early sign of the changing landscape came in 2004 when Merck withdrew its painkiller Vioxx. Critics argued that a trial in 2001 showed Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks.Merck continues to argue that no such extrapolation could be drawn until a further study in September 2004 prompted the withdrawal.In another controversy that centred on differences of opinion over safety data, scientists and investigators – among them Eliot Spitzer, New York attorney-
general – alleged that drugmakers, including GlaxoSmithKline, massaged their clinical trial data of Paxil, an antidepressant, to hide apparent risks of suicidal behaviour in children who were given the drug. GSK denies wrongdoing and admitted none in its settlement with Mr Spitzer in August 2004.The two controversies generated frustration that non-
industry analyses of data had gone unheeded. Today, access to powerful data means that payers, hospitals and the US government increasingly have the ability to challenge drugmakers.Rising healthcare costs are also encouraging payers to demand more evidence that new drugs work better than cheaper alternatives. On top of improvements in IT, insurers and public health agencies around the world have developed a range of “pharmaco-economic” techniques to measure the cost-effectiveness of treatments. These “health technology assessment” methods have been described as the “fourth hurdle” – after safety, efficacy and quality – needed for treatments to gain approval. As the use of this type of evaluation grows, the pharmaceuticals sector is engaged in a bout of introspection about what that might mean for the way it operates.Jack Bailey, business-to-
business chief at Eli Lilly, says payers are positioned to make sure drugs do what companies promise, which can improve healthcare’s economic efficiency. “I think we can debate whether it is a 50/50 split on the information [advantage]; is it 90/10 one way or the other? I personally believe it is still at least 50/50, maybe 60/40. But it is rapidly changing,” Mr Bailey says.What are the consequences for pharmaceutical companies? Payers can quickly compare drugs’ effects on diseases and drugmakers’ claims of other future health benefits. They can crunch data to compare drugs, sometimes looking solely to drive prices down. But complex analyses can also help spot potential risks and dangerous side-effects early and can openly challenge drugmakers’ own data.William Crown, president at I3, the pharmaceutical data unit of United Healthcare, an insurer, says: “Pharma will bring in a detailed outcomes study and the managed care organisation [a health insurer that also provides treatment] will look at that and say: ‘Huh, that’s different from what’s coming out of the clinical studies.’ They have the ability to go back and do their own internal analyses.”He adds: “We can query a three-year file of patients, hundreds of millions of [medical insurance] claims and then get a result in minutes. Five years ago it would have been a major research project that would take months.”There are other ramifications. Some experts say drugmakers’ legions of sales representatives, who use company data to back up their sales, will come under closer scrutiny. And some hospital plans are now eschewing industry marketing in favour of their own data and analysis.Insurers’ data, and more importantly the ability to analyse and use this information, is a powerful and valuable asset. This in turn has spurred new businesses. Payers including United Healthcare, through its offshoots such as Ingenix and I3, and Humana are now actively selling their databases and analysis capabilities. Glenn Bilawsky, chief executive of I3, says: “It is new because the technology and the breadth of data really has not been available before on this scale and with this robustness.”The public sector, US government health programmes and regulators are also seeking similar advantages. The government is becoming the largest purchaser of drugs with this year’s launch of subsidised prescription medicines benefit in Medicare, the federal health programme for pensioners.Medicare and its parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services, have projects under way to help develop a better national healthcare IT system. Medicare is also increasingly analysing data on drug cost-effectiveness.In addition, Mark McClellan, Medicare chief, and Mike Leavitt, HHS secretary, repeatedly point to the potential of IT for improved quality, cost benefits, data on patients’ treatment, and signs of side-effects. The Bush administration set a goal for a nationwide electronic medical records system in the next decade but it is unclear whether numerous obstacles, led by cost, can be surmounted.US drug regulators are meanwhile acting quickly. The Food and Drug Administration recently signed contracts with four private-sector groups to tap into their new and powerful data analysis capabilities. Late last year, the FDA awarded contracts worth about $1.4m each with United Healthcare’s Ingenix unit, Vanderbilt University, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and the research unit of Kaiser Permanente, the huge California-based payer.“The databases contain medical claims of healthcare encounters and outpatient drug use which can, in turn, be used to study the association of various medicines with serious adverse effects,” the FDA says.The FDA also established a link in December with the little-known government agency responsible for measuring drug cost-effectiveness for Medicare. The partnership with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will advance research on “drug effectiveness and safety”.So how are pharmaceuticals companies responding? The most fundamental adaptation is likely to be a bitter pill for the drug industry. With a reputation for aloofness, drugmakers have been forced to climb down from a strong position and collaborate with customers. This includes consulting with payers on the kinds of health benefit data they would find useful when evaluating a new medicine.Tom Spann, a consultant at Accenture, says: “The pressure to collaborate is increasing and drug companies are going to have to demonstrate value.”Collaboration starts early. Pharmaceutical groups are now asking at the earliest stages of drug development for input on what would make a new drug attractive to customers. They take this input and use it to design clinical trials that can prove that a new drug will be worth paying for.This is not only prompting more innovative medicines but is also forcing drug companies to think about how a disease should be treated in seven to eight years’ time, when the product comes to market. Drug companies must also become experts in managing the diseases they target, including patient compliance – whether people take their medicine in the prescribed way.Yet once a drug is finally launched, drugmakers face increasing marketing challenges as payers quickly analyse the real-world data at their fingertips on the use of it and other medicines. Payers have seen a business opportunity here, selling their data capabilities to pharmaceutical companies. United Healthcare’s I3 unit uses the insurer’s vast patient medical database to create anonymous analyses of incredible complexity on treatment and health
outcomes.In addition both Dr Lord at Humana and Mr Bilawsky at I3 see opportunities to sell their analysis capabilities overseas to be used on vast government-
subsidised health systems such as those in western European countries. Tony Hooper, US president of Bristol-Myers Squibb, says: “I think most of us are trying to get access to some of this data as quickly as possible. Informatics is going to become a big part of medicine broadly and the pharmaceutical industry specifically.”The drug industry believed in the 1990s that it could enhance its information advantage by acquiring companies that manage large health plans’ prescription drug benefits – known as prescription benefit managers. However, they quickly found out that these companies gave them a very incomplete view of the drugs’ performance in patients.The insurers have the complete view and have become what has been dubbed an “info-mediary” because they have developed sophisticated ways of using the data. This also includes potentially more scrutiny of drug safety, through an ability to comb for signals of unknown side-effects. The FDA will be using these database tools but so will others in the market, including payers.At a time when drug risks are frequently front-page news, drugmakers fear that poor analyses could damage a medicine’s reputation by signalling unsubstantiated side-effects. However, the industry sees that the ability to monitor for potential new risks could also help it and regulators calm public concerns.Eli Lilly’s Mr Lechleiter says: “I have declared inside the company that the launch of our products is simply the next stage of research. Now I think we have the tools that we can use in the form of these databases, that give us much better perspective, a much better real-time snapshot of drug utilisation than any large-scale trial we could
conduct.”Additionally, pharmaceutical companies are closely watching the FDA’s progress in developing guidelines for interpreting future analyses of insurance databases. Analyses can be constructed or interpreted in ways that give dubious results.Nevertheless, drugmakers also see another potential advantage for them in all of these changes. Analyses of drug treatments can be a double-edged sword for payers – there is of course the possibility they can prove that a medicine works better than previously thought.Everyone agrees that this is all for the best if it brings better health, and fewer medical treatments, for patients. And the increased balance of information in private-sector insurers could bring more economic efficiency to healthcare.Whether or not this happens, in a world where whoever controls the gold often rules, drugs companies no longer have a firm grasp on the most precious commodity: information."

Consumer spending in October rose more than expected, by 0.7 per cent, owing mainly to rising food and energy prices, while personal income rose 0.6 per cent, the most since May, and the savings rate declined.Also of note was the 0.4 per cent rise in a keenly watched inflation gauge, again owing mostly to food and energy prices. The data fuel expectations that the Federal Reserve will again raise interest rates this month.Shortly after the open, investors took in data showing manufacturing activity in November rose more than economists had expected thanks to new orders and increased hiring.Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards & Sons, viewed the stock market as ""reasonably valued"" and said he believed the current rally would continue into the new year. The weak dollar was not a cause for concern, he said, because ""the dollar has been weak for three years.""If you find anyone who's not bearish on the dollar, check to see if they have a pulse,"" he added.This, he added, increased the chances that the greenback would rebound before long.In the afternoon, the Federal Reserve released its periodic Beige Book survey of grassroots economic conditions from its district offices, saying that US retailers found it hard to pass on cost increases to consumers. The report said economic activity had been strong while consumer spending was patchy.The broad rally ignored downbeat news from the leading automakers, which reported disapointing monthly sales for November and announced continued productions cuts for the first quarter of next year.
