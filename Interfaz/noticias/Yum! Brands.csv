Brands;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;House-bound bankers pine for office comforts in rush of bond sales;Heavy issuance is complicated by slow internet, ‘wet’ signatures and lively children;Jeff Warren’s commute used to be a 15-minute walk through New York City to Goldman Sachs’ headquarters in southern Manhattan. Since the coronavirus pandemic struck, it has become a 15-second climb to his mother-in-law’s attic.From this makeshift office, he orchestrated the first high-yield bond sale in the US for almost a month on March 30: a $600m deal for Yum Brands, which owns Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell. The deal rounded off a record breaking month of bond issuance from highly-rated US companies, all completed by bankers, investors and corporate treasurers mostly working from home.“It went extremely well but there were challenges that we had to work through,” said Mr Warren, who runs leveraged finance capital markets for consumer companies. “When I am on an 8am phone call with the salesforce and my three-year-old daughter wants to come in and use MS paint while I am talking about raising hundreds of millions of dollars for Yum, it gets complicated.”Mr Warren’s experiences are shared by bankers across the globe who have drummed up huge quantities of debt — and generated record fees in the process — as companies and governments scramble for funds to combat the effects of the viral outbreak.Despite advances in electronic trading, corporate debt tends to be a more hands-on business than the high-speed world of stock markets. “I don’t think systems were designed with quite this in mind — the sheer scale of it,” said Lee Cumbes, head of public sector debt at Barclays, who helped arrange big bond deals for Belgium, Israel and Portugal in recent weeks from his home in London. “It’s been remarkable how well things have worked.”I don’t think we are going to be moving to a complete work-from-home environmentA little over a week before Yum’s bond sale, roughly 800 miles away from Mr Warren’s Long Island attic, Yum’s treasurer Keith Siegner assembled colleagues through Microsoft Teams communication tools, making the decision to raise the cash from his ground-floor home office in the leafy suburbs of Louisville, Kentucky.Given the volatility in markets, he was not certain he would find a receptive audience to buy the bonds, but a calm open to trading in Asia on Sunday, March 29, prompted the decision to launch the next day. Back in Long Island, Mr Warren asked his mother-in-law if he could pay to increase the house’s internet speed to 250 megabytes per second.“I couldn’t take the risk of my VPN logging off in the middle of the night, so we bumped it up,” he said. “I didn’t think I would have to think about that six weeks ago.”Had he been in the office following the 7:30am call on Monday to confirm the deal would go ahead, Mr Warren would have then led a meeting with Goldman’s sales team to walk through the details of the transaction, asking them for guidance on which investors might be interested in taking part. All that activity has now shifted online.But video conferencing and electronic chat channels can do only so much to make deals go smoothly. Two days after Yum’s deal closed, Mr Siegner still faced hurdles. While most of the legal documents could be signed electronically, Bank of New York Mellon requires “wet” signatures for the bond notes that are stored in its vaults, requiring him to send them overnight from his local UPS store. “I wore my mask,” he said. Other bankers describe similar difficulties. Andrew Karp, head of investment grade capital markets at Bank of America Securities, which has led more US deals than any other bank during the recent spate of issuance, said he had most keenly missed the office “hoot” system — a network of speakers on every desk across the trading floor that allows traders and salespeople to broadcast messages to each other. “That’s the one thing you don’t have,” he said, speaking from his home office, converted from his kids’ play area above the garage of his home in Armonk, Westchester, north of New York City. “You can replace that with more chat communication. It just takes more time.”That can be a challenge, say bankers, when they are trying to accurately price billions of dollars of debt. Wild swings in government bond markets have made quotes on trading screens less reliable than normal, they say, leaving them more reliant on counterparts on trading desks to gauge what investors are doing.“In normal times we can shout across the desk,” said Mr Cumbes. “Being there amongst the team, you naturally absorb some knowledge by osmosis. Now there’s a significant increase in calls and inquiries via chat. You have to work a lot harder to stay on top of everything.”It means that despite the deluge of bond sales running smoothly, few bankers expect it to fundamentally change the workplace once restrictions on movement are lifted. “I do think there will be changes in how people work,” said Mr Karp. “But there is a benefit to having people in one place. I don’t think we are going to be moving to a complete work-from-home environment.”

Whether it is late-night snacks or emergency corporate liquidity, markets can shut faster than you think. Yet in the past 10 days, US capital market conditions, while still strained, have eased substantially.Investment grade-rated companies have benefited from falling credit spreads after the Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step of backstopping the market for the best companies.The latest sign of stability comes from Yum Brands, parent company of fast food stalwarts, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC. On Monday it became the first junk bond issuer to tap markets in the coronavirus era. The company sold $600m of high yield debt due in five years with a juicy 7.75 per cent coupon. On Tuesday, demand was hot enough that the bond price rose quickly. Companies and their advisers must think on their feet. The length of the economic shutdown remains unclear and it is difficult to see how any security is trading on fundamental value. The spread on the ICE Bank of America high yield index is at a whopping 900 basis points — but that is still two percentage points lower than the peak level two weeks ago. Windows of opportunity can close as quickly as they opened.Yum said that it would use its new cash for “general corporate purposes”. It could pay down short-term revolver debt. Rating agency Moody’s is not keen on the additional leverage and changed its outlook for the company to negative. But most creditors and shareholders will just cheer bolstered cash balances.Adding to the market enthusiasm, Carnival Cruise Lines is raising $6bn between senior bonds, convertible bonds and common stock. Its ability to tap investors suggest rose-coloured glasses. If an ocean liner can find money right now then all companies should consider being a lot more proactive on raising cash.Lex coronavirus advice exchange.

2;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-03-30T21:46:46Z;Yum Brands raises $600m in first junk bond issue in weeks;Owner of KFC takes advantage of credit market thaw to seek cash to ride out downturn;Yum Brands, the owner of fast food franchises KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, has become the first junk-rated company to raise fresh capital from bond investors since the effects of the coronavirus brought issuance to a standstill in early March. Investors lapped up the deal on Monday, allowing the company to increase its size by $100m to $600m, as it looked to bolster its cash position in the face of a prolonged economic shutdown that has prevented many customers from eating out. About 7,000 Yum restaurants had closed by the middle of this month as a result of the pandemic, including 1,000 Pizza Hut Express locations in the US and 900 KFCs in the UK. Other outlets have been limited to drive-through, delivery and takeaway.The Kentucky-based group has more than 50,000 outlets globally, nearly all of them operated by independent franchisees and licensees.While investment-grade companies have been issuing debt in record amounts this month, investors had refrained from providing new money to lower-quality issuers, fearing rising defaults as cash flows take a hit. Yum is the first high-yield bond issuer to come to market in the US since March 4. “We’ll see how long this window stays open,” said John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management. “We certainly do not think we are out of the storm.”Rating agency Moody’s took a dim view of the deal, placing Yum’s debt on negative watch, indicating it may be downgraded, and castigating the company for increasing leverage. “They are increasing debt levels at a time when the company is facing significant uncertainty surrounding the potential length and severity of restaurant closures and the ultimate impact that these closures will have on Yum's revenues, earnings and liquidity,” said Bill Fahy, a senior credit officer at Moody’s. Yum’s move is part of a broader dash for cash from corporate treasurers, who have been willing to pay higher borrowing costs to raise funds to see them through the worsening economic downturn. The fast food group had already acted this month to improve its cash position, saying on March 18 it had halted a $2bn share buyback programme and tapped lenders for $525m under a revolving credit facility. It said at the time this was “a precautionary measure in order to preserve financial flexibility”. Yum warned that like-for-like sales in the current quarter would decline in a “mid- to high-single digit” percentage range and forecast a bigger drop in the three months to the end of June. It cited an “increasing number of markets” forced to implement social distancing measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, but was unable to quantify the financial effects.Investor demand for Yum’s new bond was strong enough to bring its borrowing cost down from the nearly 9 per cent initially expected to 7.75 per cent, according to people familiar with the deal. But that rate remained a significant increase on the 4.75 per cent the company paid when it sold a 10-year bond last year. The average yield in the US junk bond market had risen from a six-year low of 5.1 per cent in January to 9.5 per cent on Friday, according to data from Ice Data Services, after moderating last week following central bank support. “It’s not about cost of capital at the moment, it’s about access. Every corporate issuer should be borrowing at this point if they can,” said Mr McClain.

Brands;2019-08-12T21:03:50Z;Yum Brands promotes David Gibbs to chief executive;;Yum Brands on Monday said it has promoted veteran David Gibbs to take the helm of the company behind quick serve restaurant chains KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell at the start of next year.Mr Gibbs, 55, who currently serves as Yum Brands president and operating chief overseeing the three main divisions, will succeed Greg Creed, who has served as chief executive officer since 2015 and will retire at the end of 2019.The incoming CEO has been with the company for more than 30 years and held various leadership roles in all of Yum’s brands “including global strategy, finance, general management, operations and real estate”.It was under the 62-year-old’s leadership that Yum in 2016 executed a spin-off of its China business. It was also under him that the Louisville, Kentucky-based company began to handover the day-to-day running of many of its more than 48,000 restaurants to franchisees as the company focused on brand building.“I’m proud of how we’re emerging from our multiyear transformation as a more focused, franchised and efficient growth company,” said Mr Creed. “The best of Yum! is still to come and I’m delighted we have an exceptional leader like David who will drive the next wave of growth for our company.”Mr Creed will remain CEO until the end of this year to ensure a smooth transition, the company said, and will serve as a part-time adviser next year.Mr Gibbs is appointed to the company’s board effective November 2019 and chief executive effective January 1, 2020.Yum Brands shares, which are up 27 per cent year-to-date as of Monday’s close, were little changed after the market close.
4;YUM;Yum! Brands;2018-12-06T07:17:27Z;Pizza Hut pledges revamp as restaurants lose lustre;Yum Brands chain to shift focus on takeaway and delivery outlets;Yum Brands has pledged to revamp its underperforming Pizza Hut chain, reducing the number of traditional restaurants in favour of takeaway venues and new formats in the face of shifting consumer tastes.Pizza Hut’s red-roofed parlours were a dining destination for generations of families but the 60-year-old brand has fallen behind tech-savvy delivery rivals such as Domino’s.“The future of pizza is in delivery and carry out,” Greg Creed, Yum’s chief executive, told the Financial Times. Within five years, he said, sit-down restaurants would account for only about a quarter of Pizza Hut’s global outlets — down from more than 40 per cent at present.Pizza Hut restaurants, once renowned for their salad bars and arcade games, had become a “relic”, said Larry Miller, co-founder of restaurant industry data provider MillerPulse. “It’s lasted a long time but the economics just don’t work any more,” Mr Miller said.In contrast, he said, pizza takeaway and delivery outlets — which are smaller and operate with a fraction of the staff — produced some of the highest returns in the fast-food business.Pizza Hut has lagged behind its stablemates at Yum. Like-for-like sales at the division slipped 1 per cent in the third quarter. Its portfolio, which comprises 17,000 locations, about 7,500 of them in the US, was in need of a “rapid upgrade”, said Dennis Geiger, analyst at UBS.Yum has found success with its other brands, Taco Bell and KFC. Shares in the New York-listed company have rallied 45 per cent in the past two years, giving the group a market capitalisation of $28.3bn. The company operates a total of 46,000 outlets globally and is opening restaurants at a rate of seven a day.17,000The number of Pizza Hut outlets worldwideKFC, the fried chicken brand, produced a 3 per cent rise in same-store sales in the third quarter, and the Mexican fast-food chain Taco Bell increased sales by 5 per cent, helped by new menu items and promotions.David Gibbs, chief financial officer, said the Pizza Hut restaurant format still worked in some markets — he pointed to the UK — but it was “very much related to local tastes and local competition”.He said the UK restaurant business “does reasonably well” and “should continue on for many years and be very successful — but it needs to sit side by side with the delivery carry-out business”.Pizza Hut is planning to shift towards takeaway-centric outlets through new openings and so-called relocations — shutting restaurants and opening delivery stores nearby.Artie Starrs, president of Pizza Hut US, said at an investor meeting in New York on Wednesday that the brand’s “red-roof legacy” meant consumers still associated it with dining out. “People still don’t necessarily associate us with delivery,” he said.Pizza Hut is also testing “fast-casual” units, which do not offer table service. It has opened about 70 such locations, with plans for another 30 over the next two to three months.Consumers had told the company they thought the pizza tasted better at the new outlets — even though the menu and food was the same, Mr Starrs said.
5;YUM;Yum! Brands;2018-03-08T19:39:47Z;KFC returns to delivery supplier after chicken flap;;KFC has switched the supply of 350 of its UK restaurants back to its original distributor, after a move to the German logistics group DHL last month prompted a chicken shortage at the fast food group’s outlets that ruffled British customers’ feathers. The fried chicken chain said on Thursday that it had inked a new long-term supply agreement for more than a third of its UK restaurants with Bidvest, the delivery company which used to supply it before KFC overhauled its British supply chain last year, awarding the contract to DHL. Last month, Yum Brands-owned KFC was forced to temporarily shut hundreds of its 900 UK restaurants after “operational issues” at DHL left a backlog of chicken at the delivery group’s sole UK warehouse in Warwickshire.That led to a shortage of the chain’s key ingredient — as well as other menu items like fries and coleslaw — and prompted questions as to why it had tried to implement the change to a new supplier with a single, new and untested distribution centre without better contingency plans in place.A KFC spokesperson said that it had been “working hard to resolve the present situation” with DHL and its logistics technology provider, QSL.But the spokesperson said a decision had been taken “in conjunction with QSL and DHL to revert the distribution contract for up to 350 of our restaurants in the north of the UK back to Bidvest Logistics”, to ensure chicken could reach its hungry patrons without further disruption.Bidvest Logistics confirmed it would “provide renewed supply” to KFC for the restaurants from March 26. Bidvest’s Paul Whyte said: “We are delighted to welcome KFC back to Bidvest Logistics. As the UK’s leading food service logistics specialist we understand the complexities of delivering fresh chicken. KFC is a valued customer and we will provide them with a seamless return to our network.” A KFC spokesperson said the company would continue to operate with QSL and DHL for the remainder of its restaurants in the country: We’ve been working hard to resolve the present situation with QSL and DHL. This decision will ease pressure at DHL’s Rugby depot, to help get our restaurants back to normal as quickly as possible.As it stands, over 97% of our 900 restaurants are now open for business, although there will be some limited menus before we are back to business as usual.”DHL acknowledged KFC’s move. A spokesperson said that, together with its partners, it remained “fully committed to delivering excellent service to KFC‘s remaining 550 restaurants across the UK”.

6;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T04:25:19+0000;A very bad week for KFC in the UK;Accepting responsibility lets corporate reputations recover quickly;It is important, when operating a chain of chicken restaurants, to have access to chicken. Indeed this would seem to be an existential priority. And — despite the complexity of modern supply chains — it cannot be too hard a bar to clear. After all, an untold multitude of chicken joints manage it, all over the globe, week in and week out.Not, however, this week at the UK outlets of KFC (formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken). Two-thirds of the 900 shops went without their primary ingredient for several days. A few shops remain closed. The result was not panic in the streets (though one shaken customer did despair that she had been left little choice but to go to Burger King). All the same, this was a historic display of corporate incompetence.What will the repercussions be for KFC’s business in the UK? If the problem is not repeated, the damage will be minimal. This is because of how the company has handled itself — and the nature of corporate reputation.What KFC has done well is apologise immediately and unreservedly. While the problem had to do with the transition to a new logistics contractor, DHL, the company did not try to shift the blame. It took out adverts which accepted and even highlighted the farcical nature of the failure. This seems to be an obvious first step for any company in trouble, but it is remarkable how companies fail to take it. Recall the United Continental passenger who, despite having been sold a ticket and given a seat, was physically dragged off a plane — on camera. The company, mind-bogglingly, played down the seriousness of the incident, and even blamed the passenger.KFCs forthrightness will probably be enough to keep its customers loyal because, firstly, no one became ill. KFCs operations in China were not so lucky: a series of health scares there hurt trade so much that the restaurants were spun off into a separate company.Second, a reputation for delivering what the customer wants — once established — is not easy to lose. Consider how quickly, for example, Apple has bounced back from bad mis-steps on mobile reception, cracking screens and mapping. Samsung recovered almost instantly from its exploding-battery fiasco. Corporate reputations can recover swiftly if the companies make themselves accountable and act quickly.That is, of course, if the problems do not recur, and turn into a pattern. KFC management has not disclosed the precise nature of the breakdown in its supply chain (to reassure customers, investors and suppliers alike, it will need to do so eventually). But in recent years, the food and drink industry, perhaps more than any other, has put immense emphasis on cost control.This trend has been led by the private equity firm 3G capital, which controls Kraft Heinz and Burger King. For 3G, shareholder value is everything and efficiency is the means to it. Yum Brands, which owns KFC, has managed to lower costs significantly in recent years.It may not be that KFC’s problems result from excessive thrift. It is worth asking, however, if there is a point at which the companies that feed us have taken so much slack and redundancy out of the system that accidents will become more common. Companies like Yum need to act before that happens. Reputations for competence are resilient but, once damaged, are slow and costly to repair. The danger that relentless focus on maximising returns becomes self-defeating is real. If the food industry loses the trust of consumers, all the efficiency in the world will not help it. That is an outcome it is worth crossing the road to avoid.An earlier version of the story described Ab Inbev and Domino’s Pizza as controlled by 3G Capital. They are not.
7;YUM;Yum! Brands;2018-02-19T18:32:30Z;KFC runs out of chicken in logistics fiasco;Most UK outlets closed after new DHL supply deal fails to deliver;Almost two-thirds of the UK branches of KFC remained closed on Monday after the breakdown of a new supply contract for chicken with delivery network DHL, which had promised to set “a new benchmark” for service to the global fast food outlet.By lunchtime, more than 560 of KFC’s 900 UK restaurants were shut as “operational issues” at DHL left deliveries of chicken “incomplete or delayed” less than a week after the contract started.In one of the worst logistics failures of recent years, the chicken restaurant said its new delivery partner had experienced “a couple of teething problems”, prompting the disruption to restaurants. “Getting fresh chicken out to 900 restaurants across the country is pretty complex,” the company added.Yum Brands-owned KFC overhauled its British supply chain in November, ending its relationship with delivery company Bidvest and entering into a three-way partnership with DHL and previous partner Quick Service Logistics (QSL), which has supplied the fried-chicken chain in Europe since 2011.At the time, DHL described the new contract as a “groundbreaking” move that would see DHL “re-write the rule book” and “set a new benchmark for delivering fresh products to KFC in a sustainable way”.But on Monday DHL, owned by the mail and parcel group Deutsche Post, was forced to apologise to disappointed KFC customers. “We are working with KFC and our partners to rectify the situation as a priority and apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.”Customers of the brand, which opened its first branch outside North America in Preston in Lancashire more than 50 years ago, reacted with anger and frustration on social media. “As if KFC have run out of chicken!! One job! They have one job! #shambles” tweeted one customer.Frank Proud, founder of consultancy firm Apex Insight and a transport and logistics specialist, said: “The riskiest time is always the start of the contract, but usually they put in enough planning on both sides so that when it finally does go live, it has been planned to death. Something has clearly gone wrong but it is difficult to say what.”Mick Rix, national officer for the GMB union, said it had “tried to warn KFC” the decision to move from Bidvest to DHL “would have consequences. “Bidvest are specialists — a food distribution firm with years of experience,” he said. “KFC are left with hundreds of restaurants closed while DHL try and run the whole operation out of one distribution centre — where conditions are an utter shambles.”Adrian Pehl, analyst at Commerzbank, said it was not that rare to see some delays in the supply chain, but usually customers would not be aware of it. “These problems do happen, but when it’s KFC and they close some of their sites, it becomes more public,” he said. The main risk for DHL was reputational damage, he added: “The direct financial impact should be pretty small.”QSL said it “regretted any inconvenience resulting from current supply difficulties to KFC stores in the UK”, and was working to ensure “that regular operations to affected stores resume as soon as possible”.KFC, which uses chicken from British and Irish farms for its “Original Recipe” chicken-on-the-bone menu items but sources meat from overseas suppliers for its other products, was unable to tell fans when local restaurants would return to normal service.“It’s too early to say how long it will take to clear the backlog,” the company said.Employees were being encouraged to take holiday at non-franchised stores owned by KFC where they could not be reassigned to different tasks or stores, the spokesperson added. Workers at those stores on short-term contracts would be paid based on the average hours they had worked each day over the past 12 weeks, KFC said, but where restaurants were run as franchises, different rules could apply.“Franchisees will be seeking their own independent advice, but we’re encouraging them to adopt this policy too,” KFC said.Additional reporting by Adam Samson in London and Patrick McGee in Frankfurt

Brands;2018-02-13T21:57:26Z;Chipotle picks Taco Bell chief as new CEO;;Chipotle shares are red-hot in after-hours trading after the fast-casual burrito chain named Brian Niccol, the chief executive of Mexican fast-food chain Taco Bell, to its top job.The long-awaited announcement sent Denver-based Chipotle shares up more than 10 per cent on Tuesday evening. Investors have been waiting to see who would replace Chipotle founder Steve Ells in the top job after he announced last year he would be stepping back — though still staying on as executive chairman.Mr Ells said in a statement:“Brian is a proven world-class executive, who will bring fresh energy and leadership to drive excellence across every aspect of our business. His expertise in digital technologies, restaurant operations and branding make him a perfect fit for Chipotle as we seek to enhance our customer experience, drive sales growth and make our brand more relevant.”Mr Niccol’s most recent job was chief executive of Taco Bell, a division of Yum Brands, a job he held since 2015. Before that, he held various other leadership positions at Taco Bell and fellow Yum Brands chain Pizza Hut, after getting his start at consumer giant Procter & Gamble.He said in a statement:“I am very excited to be joining Chipotle at this pivotal time in its history. I have tremendous respect for the Chipotle brand and its powerful purpose. At Chipotle’s core is delicious food, which I will look to pair up with consistently great customer experiences. I will also focus on dialling up Chipotle’s cultural relevance through innovation in menu and digital communications. This will attract customers, return the brand to growth, deliver value for shareholders and create opportunities for employees.”Yum Brands also announced on Tuesday that it had tapped Julie Fells Masino, president of Taco Bell North America, and Liz Williams, president of Taco Bell International, to lead that division after Mr Niccol’s departure.Chipotle has been looking to restore the sizzle the once-hot chain lost after a food-safety crisis in 2015, but has since been plagued with lacklustre growth. While Wall Street has been hoping that Mr Ells’ successor would help whet consumers’ appetites with fresh ideas, questions remain about whether the new chief will be allowed free rein, or whether Mr Ells’ continued presence will prove one too many cooks in the corporate kitchen.
9;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

Investors were gobbling up GrubHub on Thursday, sending its shares to an all-time high after it delivered a sharp rise in quarterly profit and announced that fast-food giant Yum Brands had snapped up a 3 per cent stake.Chicago-based GrubHub — which operates a stable of online and mobile food-ordering platforms including OrderUp, Foodler, LABite and its namesake brand — saw its shares hit a record high of $94.89, surging almost 30 per cent and putting them on track for their biggest one-day jump ever since the company went public in 2014.The move builds on momentum that GrubHub has gathered as more people go online or on their phones to order food delivery. Last year, GrubHub shares nearly doubled in value, rising 90.8 per cent and are up 20 per cent thus far in 2018.Grubhub’s quarterly results released earlier on Thursday underscored why investors are queueing up to get a taste. For the three months to the end of December, revenue grew 49 per cent year-over-year to $205.1m, just ahead of the $201.7m that analysts on average were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters data. Net income nearly tripled year-over-year to $53.5m, or 60 cents a diluted share, and well ahead of the 31 cent profit analysts had forecast.The number of active diners — defined as unique diner accounts from which an order had been placed in the past year — hit 14.5m in the fourth quarter, a 77 per cent jump from the same period a year earlier. Analysts had been expecting active diners to clock in at 11.5m for the quarter, according to Factset.In addition to attracting more diners with a growing roster of local restaurants, GrubHub has beefed up its bottom line with strategic moves like its acquisition last year of rival ordering service Eat24 from review site Yelp and agreement to integrate online GrubHub ordering on to Yelp pages, as well as a delivery partnership with Cheesecake Factory restaurants.GrubHub built on that Thursday, announcing that Yum — that parent company of fast-food chains KFC and Taco Bell — had agreed to buy $200m of its stock to help GrubHub build out its delivery network. GrubHub will work with KFC and Taco Bell to test and deploy and support online ordering from those restaurants, as Yum seeks to grab a bigger slice of the growing online delivery pie.Additionally, GrubHub has agreed to expand its board to 10 members with the addition of Yum subsidiary Pizza Hut’s US president, Artie Starrs, as an independent director.“GrubHub was founded to help small business owners and restaurant entrepreneurs grow, and we look forward to supporting YUM’s local operators by driving greater sales and profit growth through access to our 14 million active diners,” GrubHub chief executive Mark Maloney said in a statement.GrubHub said it is targeting $224m-232m in revenue for the current quarter, and $910m-$960m for the full year. That would represent a 43-48 per cent increase over 1Q 2017 revenue of $156.1m, and a 33-40 per cent jump from full-year 2017 revenue of $683.1m.Photo credit: AP
11;YUM;Yum! Brands;2017-10-18T04:00:37Z;US fast-food chains chase growth in small-town China;McDonald’s and KFC push deep into backwater cities where the brands still have cachet;The Chinese county-seat of Zouping, with a population of 700,000, is a backwater by Chinese standards, its bustling high street almost bereft of overseas brands. But it is firmly on the radar of fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken.Two KFC outlets there are magnets for families dining out and young people planning romantic meetings. “It’s pricier than other restaurants, but it’s more special,” says Kong Jianzhi, 35, treating her four-year-old daughter to a chicken burger. KFC and McDonald’s outlets are opening at a rate of more than one a day in China, mostly in smaller towns such as Zouping, to revive growth in China’s fast food market, which generates annual sales of $125bn, according to Euromonitor.Both outlets began to see falling revenues from their China operations after 2012, caused by declining same-store sales as health-conscious consumers lost their taste for fast food.New restaurants will help Yum China, the New York-listed company that operates KFC in the country, increase its revenues by about $180m this year, roughly half of its projected revenue growth, according to Anson Chan, analyst at Daiwa Securities. Yum’s China sales had been flat or falling since 2013, and last year reported annual revenues of $6.7bn.“We operate in 1,100 cities in China, but there are about 900 we are researching. That just shows the potential,” says Joey Wat, Yum China’s chief operating officer and soon to be chief executive.Yum operates 5,300 KFC outlets in China, double that of McDonald’s, which will open 2,000 Chinese outlets in the next five years to roughly double its total.McDonald’s handed 80 per cent of its China franchise to Chinese state-owned investor Citic and private equity group Carlyle in August in what was seen by analysts as an effort to raise capital for expansion. It says that 45 per cent of its restaurants will be located in so-called lower-tier cities by 2020.The brands are looking to tap rising wages in these typically poorer cities. Average incomes rose 5.4 per cent in fourth-tier cities last year, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, significantly faster than the 4.6 per cent growth in the largest cities — although from a lower base.McKinsey defines China’s fourth-tier cities as centres with less than 2.6m people. Consumers in such cities visit western fast-food chains as often as their big-city peers and spend more money in them when they do, according to McKinsey. Analyst Daniel Zipser attributes the higher spending to the fact that trips are often for a “family occasion”. There are other benefits in smaller cities, he says, such as “substantially lower” costs for real estate and labour, meaning greater profitability. But there are pitfalls, too. “It’s easy to hire a person to oversee 100 stores in Shanghai, but not to cover 100 stores in different cities,” says Vincent Lui, analyst at the Boston Consulting Group. More restaurants in far-flung locations means more managers, and more cost, he adds. Maintaining food safety is key to both brands after the 2014 scandal which revealed that McDonald’s and Yum China restaurants had used expired meat. But longer supply chains with stretched oversight increases risks that such mistakes will be repeated, says Mr Lui. Meanwhile, domestic Chinese imitations have established a strong presence in smaller cities, pressuring prices. Dicos, a no-frills fried chicken chain that resembles KFC, has more than 2,000 outlets mostly in small cities. “There is tough competition. In some of these cities the price is decisive,” says Cheng Ke, a partner at Roland Berger, a consulting group. Yum China says its prices are lower in smaller cities.The long-term risk is that consumers in smaller cities might grow tired of fast food like their big-city peers. In the city of Zibo, neighbouring Zouping, local Chen Hao, 41, says: “I don’t think KFC is that healthy. I will only buy it if I’m in a rush.” In an attempt to lure consumers such as Mr Chen, McDonald’s and KFC are altering their offerings in larger cities. McDonald’s has renovated nearly all of its China outlets to give them a more fashionable feel and added coffee bars. It is also sponsoring running events to project a healthier image.With a menu of salads and paninis complemented by freshly squeezed fruit juice, coffee and craft beer, Yum China’s KPRO restaurant opened in the eastern city of Hangzhou last month has little in common with other KFC outlets except that fried chicken is available — without batter. Aimed at “tech-savvy” urban professionals, the restaurant made headlines for its use of facial-recognition payment designed by internet giant Alibaba. Manager Tony Tan says another element of KPRO’s appeal is that “fewer children are seen here than in KFC”.The upgrading efforts seem to be working for KFC which reported same-store revenue growth of 7 per cent in the three months to August 31, after four years in which sales declined or stagnated. “Compared to other local restaurants the environment and the service is better,” says Wang Jiqing, 19, as he sips a KFC latte in Zouping. “It’s a place to bring a date.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueqiao in Hangzhou
12;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Yum China announces CEO succession, posts upbeat sales;;Yum China shares rose in extended trading after Yum Brands’ licensee in mainland China reported upbeat comparable sales in the third quarter, declared a dividend and said its chief executive will step down next year.Yum China said current chief executive Micky Pant, who led the company through its spin-off, would transition to serving as vice chairman of the board and a senior adviser to the company effective March 2018. He will be succeeded by president and chief operation officer Joey Wat.Mr Pant said:Joey has a strong track record of achieving results, and with her unique ability to translate vision and strategy into future world-class operations, I have no doubt that the Yum China business will continue to grow under her strong leadership. Leveraging the unprecedented growth opportunity that China presents, the Board and the Yum China team are confident that she is the best person to take the Company to its next level.The news of the succession came alongside an earnings release showing that same-stores sales — a measure of sales at stores that have been open a year or longer — rose 6 per cent in the third quarter. Same-store sales at KFC grew 7 per cent, while those at Pizza Hut remained flat. Analysts had expected Yum China’s overall same-store sales to rise 2.9 per cent.Revenues grew 8.2 per cent to $2.04bn, topping estimates of $1.99bn.Net income rose to $211m, or 53 cents a share, in the three months ended in August, compared with $192m, or 53 cents a share, in the year-ago period. That was, however, shy of analysts’ expectations for 57 cents a share.“We are pleased to report the third consecutive quarter of delivering positive same-store sales growth,” Mr Pant said. “With revenues exceeding $2 billion in the quarter, restaurant margin, operating profit and net income have all improved.”The board of the company, which spun off from its parent Yum Brands last year, also approved a cash dividend of 10 cents a share and boosted the existing share buyback programme from about $300m to about $550m.Yum China shares rose 3.6 per cent to $41.45 in extended trading.
13;YUM;Yum! Brands;2017-08-03T13:11:48Z;Yum shares lower after Taco Bell misses estimates;;Shares in Yum Brands fell 2.1 per cent to $75 in pre-market trading after missing sales estimates for Taco Bell, its strongest fast-food chain, which has been a regular source of growth for the company.Taco Bell same store sales, a key industry metric, grew 4 per cent, missing expectations of 5.9 per cent, according to Consensus Metrix.Strength at Taco Bell, where the more innovative menu offerings like its breakfast quesadilla and Cinnabon delights have captured consumers’ attention, has been a bright spot at Yum, which also owns KFC and Pizza Hut. Earlier this year the fast-food chain handily blew past expectations, propelling it to an earnings beat.The fall overshadowed the better-than-expected results at KFC and Pizza Hut. Same store sales at KFC grew 3 per cent, ahead of expectation of 2.3 per cent. Pizza Hut sales of the same metric declined by just 1 per cent, ahead of expectations of a 1.5 per cent decrease.Pizza Hut sales were expected to be the focus of the company’s second quarterly results as it attempts to regain positive momentum in the face fewer dine-in customers. The company has been investing in store remodeling and relocations in the face of stiff competition. The decline of 1 per cent compares to a fall of 3 per cent in the previous quarter.Yum’s net income declined 39 per cent to $206m, or 58 cents per share, in the quarter compared to the period last year that included its now-sold China franchise. Revenue declined 4 per cent to $1.45bn. Analysts expected 61 cents per share on sales of $1.4bn.Though shares were slightly weaker in pre-market trading, they were up more than 20 per cent for the year at the end of trading on Wednesday.Greg Creed, chief executive, said:I’m pleased Yum Brands’ intensified focus on our four distinct growth drivers helped deliver another successful quarter . . . We are maintaining our full-year 2017 guidance and are on pace with our multi-year transformation strategy designed to further unlock shareholder value.
14;YUM;Yum! Brands;2017-07-06T20:39:43Z;Yum China shares slide as weak pizza sales spur revenue miss;Tesla stock price poised for biggest weekly drop in more than a year;Investors lost their taste for Yum China Holdings after the operator of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut in China reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter revenue.Shares in the company tumbled 12.9 per cent on Thursday to hit a seven-week low of $34.95 as the Asian offshoot of US fast-food giant Yum Brands blamed continued weaknesses in its pizza chain for the disappointing results.The fall was the stock’s biggest one-day drop since the company was spun off from Yum Brands last year.For the three months to end of May, revenue at the group rose just 0.4 per cent to $1.59bn and a hair shy of analysts’ estimates of $1.6bn.While same-store sales, a key industry metric, grew 3 per cent during the quarter — topping Wall Street estimates for a 2.4 per cent rise — the gains were led by a forecast beating 4 per cent increase in like-for-like sales at KFC, its fried chicken chain.By contrast, comparable sales at Pizza Hut were flat, missing expectations for a 1.5 per cent rise and weaker than the 2 per cent growth clocked in the first quarter. The underperformance came despite efforts by the company to simplify its menu and boost membership via its loyalty programmes in a bid to revive sales growth.“Pizza Hut same-store sales . . . underscore the challenges we faced in the Pizza Hut turnround,” said Joey Wat, president and chief operating officer, in a call with analysts. “ . . . we expect the challenges to drive sales growth will be even tougher [in the second half of the year].”Still, Ms Wat pointed to some recent moves as cause for optimism. The launch of a product called jumbo fruit tea, which Ms Wat describes as “a good combination of fruit cup and tea” has been a hit among younger customers. The company said it was also working to improve delivery efficiencies at the chain.Elsewhere shares in electric carmaker Tesla fell for a third time this week, leaving them poised for their biggest weekly drop in more than a year following a run of bad news.Shares in Elon Musk’s company were down 5.6 per cent to $308.89 on Thursday — taking their drop so far this week to 14.6 per cent. That puts the stock on track for its biggest weekly drop since February 2016, when it fell 15 per cent.Volvo, owned by China’s Geely Automobile Holdings, spooked Tesla bulls after it said on Wednesday it would stop manufacturing combustion engine-only vehicles by 2019 and would only produce hybrids or battery-powered vehicles afterwards. The news comes days after Tesla said deliveries of its Model S sedan and Model X SUV met just the lower end of its guidance, triggering concerns that demand for the company’s vehicles is plateauing.The wider market finished in the red as investors mulled over the latest batch of economic data and the recent rally in technology stocks showed signs of faltering again.At the close of trading, the S&P 500 was down 0.9 per cent at 2,409.75, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.7 per cent at 21,320 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1 per cent to 6,089.47.
15;YUM;Yum! Brands;2017-05-03T12:01:28Z;Taco Bell leads Yum Brands to quarterly beat;;Consumers just can’t seem to get enough of Taco Bell’s ‘innovative’ spins on Mexican-inspired food, like its popular Doritos-taco hybrids. Strength in the business helped propel owner Yum Brands to a beat in its most recent quarter.Yum’s overall revenues slipped in the first quarter to $1.42bn, from $1.44bn in the same three-month period in 2016, but beat Wall Street estimates of $1.38bn. Same-store sales, an important industry metric, climbed 2 per cent.Taco Bell shone, posting like-for-like sales growth of 8 per cent, blowing past estimates of 4 per cent. Yum pinned the strength on “industry-leading value and innovation”.The chain has over the past few years invented a slew of unique offerings that have captured diners’ attention, like tacos that are wrapped in Doritos shells with flavours like “nacho cheese” and “cool ranch”. It also offers breakfast deals, like the $1 breakfast soft taco that competes with offerings at other chains, like industry behemoth McDonald’s.At its KFC division, famous for its fried chicken, comparable sales were up 2 per cent, roughly in-line with Wall Street estimates. Pizza Hut, which is facing stiff competition from the likes of Domino’s Pizza, faced a 3 per cent fall in the key sales metric, worse than the 1 per cent that Wall Street forecast.Yum’s overall net income fell to $280m from $364m. Adjusted earnings per share of 65 cents topped estimates by 6 cents.Shares jumped 3.1 per cent in pre-market trading.
16;YUM;Yum! Brands;2017-02-21T17:53:41Z;Burger King’s owner to buy Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen for $1.8bn;Southern fried chicken chain will be expanded at ‘quicker pace’ in the US and abroad;Burger King owner Restaurant Brands will add Southern fried chicken to its line-up with a deal announced on Tuesday to buy Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen for $1.8bn in cash.Restaurant Brands, which is controlled by 3G Capital and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, said that it will pay $79 a share for Popeyes. The price represents a nearly 20 per cent premium to Popeyes’s February 10 closing price, before speculation over a potential tie-up began percolating.“With this transaction, RBI is adding a brand that has a distinctive position within a compelling segment and strong US and international prospects for growth,” said Daniel Schwartz, Restaurant Brands’s chief executive.The group plans to develop Popeyes, a 45-year old chain, at a “quicker pace” domestically and abroad in the years to come.Brazil-based 3G and Mr Buffett, who have in the past teamed up to acquire Burger King and merge Kraft and Heinz, may sense an opportunity to push into emerging markets where fried chicken has continued to gain in popularity.There are more than 5,000 KFC restaurants in China, a country where the fried chicken brand has had a presence for three decades, according to a filing from Yum China Holdings. That compares with Popeyes that had a store count of 2,688 at the end of December, the majority of which are in the US.The Financial Times and other media groups reported on Monday that Restaurant Brands, which was forged in 2014 when Burger King bought Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons, was in advanced talks to buy Popeyes.The tie-up comes just days after Kraft Heinz, which is still controlled by 3G and Mr Buffett, dropped its bid to acquire Unilever in a $143bn merger shortly after it first publicly disclosed its interest in acquiring the company.Dealmaking in the dining sector is off to a strong start this year, with the Popeyes deal bringing the year-to-date tally to $4.71bn, according to Dealogic data. That comes after the $29.7bn in M&A that was recorded in 2016 — the third-biggest year on record that was led by the $9.5bn spin off of Yum China by Kentucky-based Yum Brands.Popeyes got its start in 1972 as “Chicken on the Run”, which served traditional Southern fried chicken known for its crunchy coating and juicy meat, in suburban Louisiana.After a lukewarm reception the chain rebranded itself as Popeyes — named not after the spinach-eating cartoon sailor but a character in the film The French Connection, according to the group’s website. It also began selling New Orleans-style spicy fried chicken that remains its hallmark today.Popeyes shares surged 19.2 per cent in midday trading on Tuesday to $78.80.
17;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Yum Brands struggles to fire up US sales;;The decision to spin off its struggling China business did little to fire up Yum Brands domestic sales during the fourth quarter.The company behind Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, said same-store sales – a key industry metric – rose by just 1 per cent in the three months to December, below expectations for a 2.1 per cent rise, amid ever rising competition in the fast dining sector.Total revenue for the quarter rose 2.4 per cent to $2.024bn thanks to new store openings and new franchisees. However that is still slightly short of the $2.038bn analysts had forecast.Yum moved to carve out its China business into an independent, publicly-traded company last October after a string of food safety scandals and other missteps in the country marred what was once its biggest growth engine.The company had hoped the spin off would allow it focus on reigniting its US sales growth. But Yum’s fourth quarter results underscore the challenges it faces in the oversaturated US restaurant market.Pizza Hut remains the company’s weakest business, with like for like sales down 2 per cent during the period. KFC and Taco Bell fared better, with each posting same store sales growth of 3 per cent.Net income fell to $267m, compared to the $275m recorded in the prior year period. However, earnings per diluted shares rose from 66 cents a share to 76 cents a share after a series of share buybacks helped shrunk the number of shares in circulation.
18;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Yum China: bit of a turkey;Despite the appetising glaze that group put on its numbers, it has work to do;Delivering good results is as easy as delivering toothsome fast food. Or so New York-listed Yum China’s maiden results, released after Tuesday’s market close, might suggest. The company was spun out of Yum Brands of the US last year. Strong headline numbers disguise a difficult turnround for a business fighting problems from food safety issues to changing tastes.Despite beating the company’s targets, quarterly revenues missed analysts’ forecasts. Most of the growth from leading brands KFC and Pizza Hut came from new store openings. And while KFC registered its first full year of growth in same-store sales in four years, fourth quarter figures suggested gains were tailing off. Worse, declines in same-store sales at Pizza Hut restaurants — only one-third the size of revenues from KFC — offset gains at the bigger brand.Better news came lower down the statement. Operating profits more than trebled for the quarter. This was mainly due to a value added tax reform piloted in May that affected paper and food costs favourably. Aggregate restaurant margin thus improved by more than one-third. Yet even if the tax changes stick — a big “if” — after year-on-year comparisons normalise this May, a further margin bump is unlikely. Meanwhile, increases in wages ate into the tax gain, and commodity prices began to rise towards the year-end.Despite the appetising glaze that the company put on the numbers, it knows that it has work to do. It has promoted the head of the KFC division to chief operating officer for Yum China as part of a strategy to halt Pizza Hut’s same-store sales slide. It is investing in store resizing and refurbishment, which has helped KFC. Delivery and mobile ordering should also bolster growth.A near term fillip might come from a $300m share buyback — less than 3 per cent of outstanding shares. For enthusiasm to last, however, the company will have to show its special recipe for running KFC works at Pizza Hut too.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
19;YUM;Yum! Brands;2016-12-07T08:45:17Z;Profits in China: not safe;Limits on repatriation of earnings have broad implications;Making money in China can be tough for foreign companies. Those that do have the secret sauce are finding it tougher yet to send profits home. The EU Chamber of Commerce in Beijing said on Tuesday that several European companies have been unable to remit dividends overseas due to tighter capital controls. It is the first sign that new rules from China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange will hamper foreign entities operating in China. There are implications for sales of China-based assets, too.Last week, bankers revealed that Safe permission is now required for transfers out of China for as little as $5m, down from a previous limit of $50m. The heightened oversight is initially likely to be more inconvenient for European than US companies. Due to tax reasons, the latter have tended not to remit overseas earnings back to their home country. Apple, which garners one-fifth of its sales from greater China, has chosen to issue debt in the US to fund returns to shareholders, rather than send its profits home.Doubtless, some US companies will already have moved their China profits elsewhere, not least due to concerns over the weak renminbi. Those that have built up funds in the country will be hard hit by the constraints. The incoming Trump administration is expected to alter the tax regime in order to encourage repatriation of earnings, including any “trapped” cash.Foreign companies that are trying to sell assets in China, such as McDonald’s, may also feel the pinch. Sales of China-based US fast food operations have already proven unpopular. In September, having failed to find an outright buyer, Yum Brands chose to spin off its China business instead. Buyers of those shares will also find their profits caught by Safe’s new rules, without the same recourse as Apple to cheap debt. Last week, just one group remained in the running to buy McDonald’s assets, a Sino-US team of Citic Group Corp and Carlyle, the private equity house. With meagre earnings trapped in China, a hard sell may just have become impossible.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Companies do it too.On Tuesday, Alcoa, which split off from its value-added business now named Arconic, and Yum China Holdings, newly separated from Yum Brands, began trading as standalone companies. Here’s how they have fared so far.Shares in Yum China Holdings, which will license Yum brands including Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut in China, jumped eight per cent to $26.16, as analysts at Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on the company with an “overweight” rating and a $32 price target. They argued that the stock has a 32 per cent upside to their price target“While Yum! China comes with unique challenges – including a still nascent recovery in sales following two separate supplier issues (’12 and ’14) and an evolving China restaurant industry, these challenges are largely priced in,” said John Glass, analyst at Morgan Stanley.He added: ‘In our view, as the market appears to be viewing it as more similar to sub-scale, local Hong Kong listed [quick service restaurants] than a larger cap, share leading, cash generative global QSR. With new unit returns still strong, this is a bet on recovering sales.”Meanwhile, Yum shares slid 0.1 per cent to $61.44.Elsewhere, shares in Arconic, the new name for car and aerospace parts businesses, fell 7.5 per cent to $19.91, while shares in the legacy metals business bearing the Alcoa name rose 7.4 per cent to $23.03.The segments that make up Arconic’s business posted $12.5bn in revenues last year, with nearly 40 per cent derived from its aerospace business. However, Arconic, considered the fast-growing business, saw a one per cent drop in sales to $3.4bn in the third quarter, reflecting customer adjustments to delivery schedules in the aerospace industry, softness in the North America commercial transportation market and pricing pressure. By comparison, Alcoa’s revenues were flat at $2.3bn last quarter.Indeed, in the second quarter, Alcoa said it expected more than 10 per cent growth for in the aerospace market* in 2017. But in October, the company said the outlook for 2017 was “hard to predict” amid a “dynamic” environment in the aerospace business. However, the company noted it expects multi-year aerospace growth in the mid-single digits.*The article was amended to reflect growth for the aerospace market.

Steve Easterbook, chief executive, said:Excluding the impact of temporary protests surrounding recent events related to the South China Sea, China’s comparable sales would have been positive for the quarter.Chinese nationalists have been calling for a boycott of Western brands in the country amid accusations that the US had encouraged the Philippines to bring a legal case against China’s claim to most of the South China Sea to The Hague.Beijing reacted with fury to the verdict of the international tribunal, given in July, which found there was “no legal basis” under the United Nation’s Convention on the Law of the Sea for China’s claims to more than 80 per cent of the South China Sea.McDonald’s China sales woes echoed those seen at Yum Brands, the company behind KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. The company, which will separate its China business at the end of this month, said same stores slid 1 per cent in China in the third quarter, and that without the protests like-for-like sales would have been positive for the three month period.Greg Creed, chief executive of Yum, said:Sales were off to a good start in the first six weeks of the quarter in the China Division. However, anticipated tougher laps in the second half of the third quarter were compounded by an international court ruling on claims regarding the South China Sea, which triggered a series of regional protests and negative sentiment against a few international companies with well-known Western brands. If not for this event, we believe the China Division would have delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth.

At the close in New York, the S&P 500 has inched up 0.1 per cent to 2,160.8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to 18,268.5, and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 0.2 per cent to 5,306.9.Elsewhere, shares in gold miners took another hit after the precious metal fell 1 per cent to $1,254.19 a troy ounce as better than expected economic data strengthened the case for an interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve.The NYSE Arca gold miners index, which consists of 39 global companies, fell 2.7 per cent, taking its decline so far this month to 13.1 per cent. However, the index remains up 67.2 per cent in the year to date.Walmart shares slid on Thursday after the world’s largest retailer issued a disappointing earnings outlook for fiscal 2018 as the world’s largest retailer invests in its e-commerce business.Shares in the Arkansas-based company fell 3.2 per cent to $69.36 after it said earnings in fiscal 2018 would be “flat” relative to the previous year, when it expects adjusted earnings in the range of $4.15 to $4.35 a share.That missed analysts’ expectations for $4.45 a share. Walmart has been ramping up efforts to compete with Amazon as consumers increasingly shop online.Shares in Yum Brands slid 1.3 per cent to $87.44 after the company behind Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut said its operations in China once again weighed on overall results as international rulings on the South China Sea triggered a wave of negative sentiment towards western companies.Yum said same-store sales, a key industry metric, unexpectedly fell 1 per cent in China in the third quarter.That compared with analysts’ expectations for a 4.1 per cent gain. The results arrived a month before the company completes the separation of its China business that has worked to revive sales following a food safety scare.The Kentucky-based company reported adjusted earnings of $1.09 a share, missing expectations for $1.10 a share.

Brands;2016-10-05T20:38:19Z;China delivers blow to Yum results ahead of separation;;It is less than a month until the separation is finalised but Yum’s China operations once again weighed on overall results as the company said international rulings on the South China Sea triggered a wave of negative sentiment towards Western companies.Yum Brands, the company behind Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, said same-store sales, a key industry metric, unexpectedly fell 1 per cent in China in the third quarter. That compared to analysts’ expectations for a 4.1 per cent gain.Greg Creed, chief executive, said:Sales were off to a good start in the first six weeks of the quarter in the China Division. However, anticipated tougher laps in the second half of the third quarter were compounded by an international court ruling on claims regarding the South China Sea, which triggered a series of regional protests and negative sentiment against a few international companies with well-known Western brands. If not for this event, we believe the China Division would have delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth.The company added that the impact of the ruling on its sales however lessened through the past two months. The results arrived a month before the company completes the separation of its China business that has worked to revive sales following a food safety scare. Yum China Holdings will begin trading on Nov 1 under the ticker symbol ‘YUMC’.The Kentucky-based company also said profits climbed to $622m or $1.56 a share in the third quarter, compared with $421m or 95 cents a share in the year ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.09 a share, missed expectations for $1.10 a share.Sales slid 3.2 per cent to $3.3bn, shy of forecasts for $3.5bn. Like-for-like sales at Taco Bell and KFC rose more than forecast.Yum shares, which have climbed 21 per cent so far this year, slid as much as 5 per cent in extended trading.
24;YUM;Yum! Brands;2016-09-29T13:09:12Z;Fast food loses its lustre in China;Segment under pressure as consumer tastes grow increasingly sophisticated;Next year marks the 30th anniversary of the arrival of western fast-food chains in China. It will be a subdued affair: growth has been slowing, and not just because of the impact of a spate of food safety scandals. Rather, the Chinese consumer has changed in those three decades as incomes have risen and technology broadens the range of food delivery options on offer.The growth rate of the fast-food sector has lagged that of the food service industry as a whole since 2013, for both Western and Asian operators. Organic growth is driving the business now: the number of outlets increased 10 per cent last year while sales rose just 5.2 per cent, according to the China Hotel Association (see chart).Same-store sales of KFC’s China operations fell 4 per cent in 2015. Due to a low base effect, same-store sales for KFC and McDonald’s were positive year-on-year in the second half of 2015 and the first half of 2016. But this is tepid growth at best compared with the double-digit gains recorded in the early years of this decade, prior to food safety scandals in 2012 and 2014 (see chart).The same-store sales of Japanese-style ramen chain Ajisen fell 7.5 per cent last year, and another 7.7 per cent in the first half of 2016, while those of Yoshinoya dropped 5 per cent in 2015, though they were up a weak 1 per cent in the first half of this year.Despite their slowing growth, western-style fast-food chains, including McDonald’s and Yum Brands’ KFC and Pizza Hut, are still the most popular fast-food brands in China, according to FT Confidential Research’s latest consumer brands survey. Their popularity edged up in the second quarter, compared with our last survey in the fourth quarter of 2015, shaking off the impact of earlier food safety scandals (see chart).The popularity of most Asian-style fast-food brands declined over the same period. Younger respondents showed a clear preference for Western-style fast-food chains, with 56.9 per cent of respondents aged 18 to 24 saying they preferred these. This share was just 44.7 per cent among diners over 35 (see chart).While these Western giants may remain the most popular fast-food options, their market share has eroded in recent years as China’s fast-food sector has become increasingly crowded. KFC’s market share fell to 3.6 per cent last year from 6.4 per cent in 2012, according to Euromonitor. McDonald’s has seen its China market share drop to 2.1 per cent from 2.4 per cent in that time, while that of the top 10 chains has dropped to 8.9 per cent from 11.7 per cent.Indeed, fast-food chains no longer dazzle. A growing number of domestic, full-service restaurant chains are catering to consumers with rising incomes. These chains have brought some of the characteristics associated with the western fast-food chains – standardised products and menus, efficiency and cleanliness – to the Chinese restaurant model with great success. Speed and convenience are no longer sufficient for consumers: China Hotel Association data show that hot-pot restaurant sales grew 15 per cent, while those of Chinese restaurants rose 13 per cent, eclipsing the 5.2 per cent increase among fast-food retailers.So KFC is no longer finger lickin’ good. The Colonel opened his first outlet in China in November 1987, on the south-west corner of Tiananmen Square in Beijing. It now has over 5,000 restaurants across the country, its reach highlighted by the 45.2 per cent of third-tier city residents who said KFC is one of the two fast-food outlets they visited most regularly.But a visit to KFC offers the same, predictable experience, and consumers are turning to aggressively expanding new chains that offer new tastes. Social networks are helping drive this shift. In September last year, 62 per cent of Chinese consumers shared their dining experiences on social networks, according to Weber Shandwick, a far higher share than in Australia (29 per cent), South Korea (42 per cent) and Singapore (40 per cent).We expect rapidly expanding local players, such as Grandma’s Home, a Hangzhou-based chain of Chinese restaurants with over 90 outlets across the country, and Xibei Youmian Cun, which specialises in the cuisine of central China’s Shanxi province, to continue grabbing market share.Fast-food chains have spent years trying to localise their menus – KFC sells egg tarts and chicken with rice – but their homogenised offerings cannot generate the social media buzz that these upstart domestic chains can.Even for these rising chains, the restaurant business is notoriously tough. In Shanghai in the second half of last year more than 60,000 restaurants closed their doors – more than 30 per cent of the city’s total dining establishments. Grandma’s Home has launched restaurants under 16 different brands to try to cater to fickle Chinese consumers.The proliferation of food delivery apps has also eroded the advantage of Western fast-food chains. McDonald’s and KFC once maintained an edge with dedicated couriers and specialised delivery websites. But competition between Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, China’s technology giants, across a range of online-to-offline (O2O) services has spilled over into food delivery. Deliveries to the home or office now account for 8.4 per cent of restaurant sales, more than double that of seven years ago, according to Euromonitor (see chart).O2O food delivery sales increased by an annual average of 77 per cent between 2010 and 2015, with annual revenues of ele.me (backed by Alibaba), Meituan (backed by Tencent) and Baidu food delivery (backed by Baidu) rising to Rmb161.6bn last year from just Rmb9.2bn in 2010, according to iResearch, a Beijing-based research company. These apps have exposed market-leading fast-food chains to competition from hundreds of local restaurants, which have in turn been liberated from the constraints of limited footfall.Multinational fast-food chains have revamped stores and menus to win back Chinese consumers. Both McDonald’s and KFC have expanded their café businesses while Burger King has been renovating stores to provide larger dining areas and expanded its pork and chicken choices to cater to Chinese demand for these meats. McDonald’s took a step further last year with its “Create Your Taste” promotion, allowing consumers to customise their burgers via touch screens. KFC launched a points-based loyalty scheme in December 2015.Although these are all tried-and-tested methods of regaining market share, the core dining experience remains unchanged and, given the fundamental shifts in Chinese consumer tastes, we doubt their efficacy.In response to its struggles, and mounting shareholder pressure, Yum is spinning off KFC’s China operations, announcing the sale of a $460m stake to private equity firm Primavera Capital Group and Alibaba’s Ant Financial Services Group. McDonald’s is seeking bids for franchise rights to its restaurants in China, Hong Kong and South Korea.These strategies will allow headquarters to step back and hand over the reins to local operators. In Yum’s case, the involvement of Ant Financial raises the prospect of a tie-up with Alipay, Alibaba’s ubiquitous mobile payments platform. Theoretically, local operators will be able to respond more quickly and effectively to the challenges posed by local competitors. The Chinese consumer landscape has, however, changed radically since 1987, and with fast-food market growth slowing success will require more than just localisation.FT Confidential Research is an independent research service from the Financial Times, providing in-depth analysis of and statistical insight into China and Southeast Asia.

A similar auction for McDonald’s also saw low demand from investors in China.In the Yum deal, Yum China will become a licensee of its parent company, with exclusive rights to KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell in China. KFC and Pizza Hut have more than 7,200 restaurants in the country.Primavera will invest $410m and Ant Financial will invest $50m, Yum said. Yum China will list on the New York Stock Exchange as an independent company on November 1.Primavera is an investor in Ant Financial, which houses Alibaba’s payment platform along with other financial services. The Chinese technology company raised $4.5bn this year in what was hailed as the world’s largest round of fundraising for an internet group.In an earlier round of bidding for Yum China, Primavera and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek submitted offers for at least part of the fast-food assets, but the deal eventually stalled on disagreement over pricing, sources said at the time.The listing of the franchise in the US was considered another problem for investors in China, sources said. The terms of the deal did not allow for a stock market listing in Asia, a condition that deterred some investors who preferred to have the option of listing in the region.A consortium of bidders including US-based private equity house KKR and Chinese state investor CIC was initially considered the main contender to buy the franchise.

The bid conformed to Yum’s original conditions for the sale, but the buyout group and Yum could not agree on pricing.Temasek also made an offer on the Yum franchise in China but again could not reach an agreement on a transaction value.Temasek and Primavera declined to comment on the discussions, noting that they were confidential.Yum said its was “making great progress toward the separation of our China business,” highlighting its more than $8bn in sales and nearly $1bn of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation last year. “We’re confident that, as a well-capitalised, standalone public company, it will have a long runway for continued growth,” a spokesperson added.Price aside, the listing of the franchise in the US was another problem for investors in China, sources said. The terms of the deal did not allow for a stock market listing in Asia, a condition that deterred some investors who preferred to have the option of listing in the region.A consortium of bidders including US-based private equity house KKR and Chinese state investor CIC was initially considered the main contender to buy the franchise. However, that group dropped out of the process in May, Bloomberg reported.Yum announced the sale of its China franchise last year after coming under pressure from investors to spin off the business into a separately listed entity. China remains the company’s primary source of profit.Chicken sales at KFC gave an unexpected boost to Yum China revenues in the first quarter of the year. Pizza Hut, however, recorded a bigger than expected drop in same-store sales during the period.Yum’s share price, which closed at $90.34 on Monday, was trading at a high for the year to date and was about 38 per cent up from its 2016 low.The failed bids for one of Asia’s largest fast-food franchises has left the Yum sale in the balance. Several regional investment groups have studied the auction but it was unclear if any planned to submit bids, people briefed on the matter said.Yum’s stalled sale comes as McDonald’s struggles to offload its Asia franchise to regional buyers.Like Yum, McDonald’s is also tasked with reducing its exposure to China, where both companies have been hit by food-safety scandals, while also upholding its reputation once the franchise has been taken over by a new operator.As of mid-July, McDonald’s auction had attracted a handful of Chinese bidders.

27;YUM;Yum! Brands;2016-07-26T17:00:55Z;McDonald’s new US menu buzz falls flat;Fast-food shares fall as second-quarter sales fall short and industry demand fades;McDonald’s US sales growth slowed in the second quarter, underscoring a fast food industry-wide weakening of demand and raising questions over the longevity of the company’s turnround in its most important market.The chain posted a 1.8 per cent increase in comparable sales at home during the three months to June, despite a weak annual comparison. The rise is slower than the 5.4 per cent rise in the first quarter and missed consensus estimates from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for a 3.2 per cent increase.The result cements what has been a tough quarter for casual dining and coffee outlets in the world’s largest economy, with companies including Yum Brands, which owns KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, as well as Starbucks and Dunkin ’ Brands all complaining of weak consumer confidence.It also raises questions about whether the promotional buzz over McDonald’s new menu items, the cornerstone of its turnround, is beginning to wane, while competition to lure customers via discounts has intensified.“Broader spending growth is not translating to same-store sales,” warned Jefferies analyst Andy Barish in an industry report on Monday. He added that “the fierce promotional environment and competition from grocery and convenience stores are making it tougher”.McDonald’s total sales for the quarter dropped 4 per cent to $6.27bn as the company sold a portfolio of company-owned stores to franchisees. The sale, which reduces operating costs, helped increase profit margins in its home market, boosting North American operating profits 10 per cent.Earnings fell 1 per cent to $1.25 a share, hit by $230m in one-off charges partly related to its refranchising plan, and the impact of the strong dollar on its overseas profits. Excluding these costs, earnings increased 13 per cent, the company said. Global comparable sales rose 3.1 per cent.Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, said: “I am confident in our system’s ability to stay the course and execute our turnround plan to achieve our goals.”We don’t expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the UKThe company, which derives 10 per cent of profits from Britain, said the impact from the UK vote to leave the EU was mainly from currency fluctuations.The volatility of sterling since the Brexit vote has prompted McDonald’s to increase the amount it expects foreign exchange movements to hit full-year earnings per share to between 9-11 cents, from 5-7 cents before.The broader implications were limited, however. “We don’t expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the UK,” chief financial officer Kevin Ozan said. “While the long-term impact of Brexit is uncertain, in the near term, the most significant impact on our business will be currency translation.”McDonald’s efforts to reduce the number of its store-owned restaurants could help it circumvent another pressure that the industry is facing: higher wages.It has been the focus of the “Fight for $15” campaign for higher hourly wages across America. McDonald’s has raised wages at its own stores, but as it sells off stores, the onus to raise wages will fall on to the franchisees. It said it did not have plans for a further one-time increase at the moment.Jefferies’ Mr Barish said that across the industry restaurants were facing wage inflation in the mid single-digits on a gross basis.McDonald’s shares were down more than 3 per cent to $123.33 in early New York trading.
28;YUM;Yum! Brands;2016-07-26T12:26:58Z;McDonald’s drops as sales growth falls short;;Not lovin’ it so much.McDonald’s US sales growth slowed in the second quarter, underscoring an industry-wide weakening of demand at home, and pushing the world’s largest fast-food chain’s shares down 3.4 per cent in pre-market trading.The company reported 1.8 per cent increase in sales at home during the three months to June, far slower than the 5.4 per cent increase in the first quarter and missing consensus estimates from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for a 3.2 per cent increase, reports Lindsay Whipp.Earlier rivals including Yum Brands, which owns KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, as well as Dunkin Brands and Starbucks reported softer sales blaming weaker consumer confidence.The company said that the increase was helped by its All-Day Breakfast and McPick offer of two items for $5, “despite softening industry growth during the quarter”. In the year-earlier period, US sales fell 2 per cent.Total revenue fell 4 per cent to $6.27bn while earnings fell 1 per cent to $1.25 a share.The company said earlier this month that it would incur a one-off pre-tax charge of $235m, or 20 cents a share (post tax) related to the company’s refranchising plan, general administrative charges and its relocation to central Chicago from the suburbs. It added it expect to incur further charges in forthcoming quarters.Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, has been leading a turnround at the company in an attempt to revive domestic sales. The subdued sales in this most recent quarter will raise questions over how sticky the company’s revival at home is if broader consumer demand across the industry is beginning to ease.
29;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Fast-food chains feel bite of faltering US consumer sentiment;Restaurants from Starbucks to KFC wrestle with America’s waning appetite for eating out;Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ chairman and chief executive, did not hold back this week when he said that political and social unrest were partly to blame for his company’s third-quarter earnings miss.He said that there was a “profound weakening in consumer confidence” in the quarter — US comparable sales growth slowed to 4 per cent from 8 per cent last year. Specifically in its home market, uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, civil unrest and heightened racial tensions, as well as worries about terrorism, had raised anxiety he said.“No one should misinterpret or in any way look at the challenges that we and many, many other companies are facing as something that has been done before. This is quite unusual. It’s unsettling,” he added.Mr Schultz, who has been expanding Starbucks’ food offerings, said that the timing of the relaunch of its loyalty programme had also contributed to the earnings miss. But other companies in the sector have also blamed weakening consumer sentiment on slower sales growth, though none have been as specific as Mr Schultz.Dunkin’ Brands, which alongside the doughnut chain also owns Baskin Robbins, on Thursday unveiled weaker than expected earnings and said that consumers had gone into a “bit of a funk” during the quarter. Yum Brands, owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, said this month that the US was in “a malaise” and that its sales for the quarter had been soft.Greg Creed, Yum chief executive, added that in a June survey by GenForward of 18- to 30-year-olds three-quarters of them said they believed the US was in decline, a finding he described as “not particularly good news from what people are thinking”.This weak sentiment is reflected in figures from the industry association’s monthly restaurant performance index, which measures a combination of current trends and expectations over the next six months. In May, the index fell 0.9 per cent to 100.6, which at more than 100 still pointed to an expansion but at a slower pace, a trend that has been evident for a number of months.The National Restaurant Association said that the dip was due to a net decline in comparative stores sales for the first time in five months, with expectations for future business conditions reaching their lowest in three and a half years. Retail sales at specialist coffee shops are estimated to rise 4.4 per cent this year, the slowest pace since 2013, according to Euromonitor.Brett Levy, an analyst Deutsche Bank, said that slower jobs growth appeared to be weighing on restaurant sales, which he said had an 80 per cent correlation with comparable revenue growth at restaurants.But broader consumer confidence data are not all gloomy. Figures from the Conference Board, a think-tank, showed a slight improvement in June from May. And while the University of Michigan’s June consumer sentiment index showed that wealthier participants were citing worries about losses from equity investments in the wake of the UK vote to leave the EU, its author expected a rebound in July and August.This suggests there are industry- and company-specific issues at stake for casual dining.Deutsche Bank’s Mr Levy said in a report that the recent dip in sales was “the result of a combination of a springtime traffic slowdown, mixed weather conditions and the ongoing intense promotional cadence . . . leaving few unscathed”.Those promotions include a recently ended offer of two items for $5 at McDonald’s, which its website says will return, while Wendys, the burger chain, has a four for $4 deal and Pizza Hut a $5 value meal.As Starbucks increasingly moves into food it opens itself up to such challenges, while the continuing popularity of independent coffee shops is pushing the company to expand its own high-end roasteries.Competition is not limited to eating out. Supermarkets from Walmart to Kroger have, alongside Wholefoods, been expanding their deli counter ranges and offering in-store freshly cooked pizzas and other meals for customers to eat-in or take home. The more sophisticated supermarket offerings get the bigger threat they pose to cafés and fast-food chains.In the near term, it is eating in that may be causing what analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets have estimated is a 3-5 per cent decline in consumer traffic to casual dining restaurants in recent weeks.Chris O’Cull said: “Several disruptions, ie watching primary debates, watching news coverage of recent events, political conventions, presidential debates, etc have resulted, or may result in, more people staying home and ordering pizza.”

Brands;2016-07-14T20:29:56Z;Delta rises on plan to cut seats on UK routes;US stocks at fresh highs as main indices all advance;Delta Air Lines shares advanced on Thursday after the US carrier said it plans to reduce seating capacity growth from its winter schedule following the UK referendum on EU membership.The US carrier, which has been seeking to stem a decline in passenger unit revenues, said it expected to reduce capacity on UK routes amid “additional foreign currency pressure from the steep drop in the British pound and the economic uncertainty from Brexit”.Capacity would drop 1 percentage point in the December quarter, it said, as management remained focused on achieving positive unit revenues by the year-end. System capacity would rise just 1 per cent from the period last year.The news came after American Airlines this week announced a reduction to its planned capacity growth for the year.“The larger carriers are getting more aggressive on reining in capacity growth so they can get an all important metric called PRASM (passenger revenue per available seat mile) to turn positive,” said Jack Atkins, analyst at Stephens. “And if you cut capacity enough, you can do that.”Delta also reported profits of $1.55bn, or $2.03 a share, compared with $1.49bn, or $1.83 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.47 a share topped analysts’ estimates of $1.42 a share.Revenue fell 2.4 per cent to $10.45bn, just shy of analysts’ estimates for $10.48bn.That sent shares in the company up 3.6 per cent to $40.98 and helped trim the carrier’s year-to-date losses to 19.2 per cent.The gains in Delta shares arrived as US stocks moved to fresh highs. The S&P 500 gained 0.5 per cent to 2,163.8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 18,506.4, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 5,034.1.Elsewhere, shares in Line, the Tokyo-based messaging service, rose 31 per cent to $43 in its trading debut in New York.Shares traded as high as $44.49 at the market open — a 35.5 per cent jump compared with the $32.84 the stock was priced at earlier in the week.JPMorgan shares rose 1.5 per cent to $64.12 after the US bank reported second-quarter profits that topped estimates after analysts had lowered their forecasts for the entire sector.Meanwhile, shares in Yum Brands advanced 3 per cent to $88.27 after the fast-food chain raised its full-year profit outlook alongside stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.The owner of KFC and Taco Bell said it expected full-year core operating profits to climb by 14 per cent from the year prior, up from a previous forecast of 12 per cent.Cree shares jumped 10.6 per cent to $27.74 after the maker of lighting and semiconductor products said it was selling Wolfspeed to German Infineon Technologies for $850m in cash as it focused on its core LED lighting business.Chuck Swoboda, chief executive, said the move “unlocks value [and] increases management focus”. The capital raised “combined with improved free cash flow” would be used for deals and further stock buybacks, he added.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar.com
31;YUM;Yum! Brands;2016-05-18T22:40:07Z;Yum to offer $2.3bn in new bonds;;Yum Brands, the parent of fast food chains including KFC and Taco Bell, said it will offer more than $2bn in new bonds, becoming the latest junk-rated company to tap the debt market.The new debt issuance, which includes $2.3bn in senior unsecured notes as well as a new senior secured credit facility of the same size, highlights the trend of groups accessing the debt market while interest rates remain low and investors are hungry for yield. Indeed, PC-maker Dell sold $20bn in debt on Tuesday in the fourth-largest bond sale on record.Kentucky-based Yum said the new debt would be used to fund the return of capital to shareholders, to repay borrowings under an existing revolving credit facility, pay associated transaction fees and expenses and to support general corporate purposes.Yum said the move comes as it targets leverage of five-times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and looks to return $6.2bn in capital to shareholders before the separation of its China business by the end of 2016.

Cut prices, however, and several buckets make Chinese New Year. On Wednesday, Yum Brands said its first quarter China division same store sales rose 6 per cent year-on-year — more than expected. The growth came from a New Year price promotion spurring a finger lickin’ 12 per cent jump in KFC China sales.The reprieve looks unsustainable; price cuts are not a long-term strategy. A trend to eat more healthily will only increase as China becomes wealthier.Still, the pick up is timely: Yum will spin off its China business this year. A valuation mooted at $20bn last year has been sliding. Recent reports said private equity buyers were interested in taking a slice valuing Yum at $10bn. One quarter’s numbers do not ensure a turnround, but they give Yum more bargaining chips for a sale. Its shares rose 4 per cent after hours as investors digested the good news.

33;YUM;Yum! Brands;2016-04-20T22:41:21Z;Yum sales rise on Chinese KFC new year bucket offer;Promotion boosts appetites in the country after previous food scare;Shares in the company behind KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell rose nearly 4 per cent in extended trading, after Yum Brands reported a 6 per cent rise in first-quarter same-store sales at its China division and revised its forecasts.The rise eclipsed estimates for a 2.1 per cent gain in China, compared with a 12 per cent drop in the same quarter a year earlier, after a food scare tied to KFC’s poultry supply chain two years ago.This followed a boost at KFC China, which reported a 12 per cent jump in same-store sales growth that the company attributed to a Chinese new year bucket promotion.Comparable sales increased at all of the company’s divisions, and were up 2 per cent worldwide.That helped the Kentucky-based company report profits of $391m, or 93 cents a share, up from $362m, or 81 cents a share, in the year earlier quarter. Total sales were largely flat at $2.6bn. Analysts on Wall Street were expecting earnings of 83 cents, on sales of $2.7bn.Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 95 cents a share topped estimates of 83 cents.Greg Creed, chief executive, said that while it was early in the year “and there maybe bumps in the road” the group was confident in raising core operating profit growth guidance to 12 per cent from 10 per cent previously.Failure to revive sales in Asia’s largest economy following a food safety scare prompted Yum to announce a plan to spin off its China business late last year.Yum has also reportedly been in talks with KKR and other private equity funds to sell a minority stake in the Chinese business — its largest division.The company has previously said the split should allow each company to target a 15 per cent shareholder return per year.Yum shares have advanced 13 per cent since the start of last year.
34;YUM;Yum! Brands;2016-03-24T11:51:02Z;China spending: less pizza in our time;Chinese consumers are less keen on overseas brands;Consumerism in China is healthy. Chinese consumers’ tastes are becoming healthier too — and more Chinese. Foreign consumer brands are declining in popularity.Few know this better than Yum Brands, a former fast-food favourite whose fried chicken and pizzas once lorded it over noodles and dumplings. This week, private equity groups were in talks to buy one-fifth of its China unit, due to be spun off this year. The price, reportedly, implies a valuation of $10bn for Yum’s China unit. That is less than a third of the whole company’s market capitalisation, even though China contributes 40 per cent of total profit. This imbalance may be warranted: Yum’s China business is struggling. Growth has become dependent upon new stores, rather than higher productivity at each store.Results from a 2015 survey by McKinsey show that consumption of fizzy drinks and western fast food has fallen a fifth since 2012. The move is mirrored in other industries. In 2015, half of those surveyed aimed to buy the most expensive product they could afford in apparel and consumer electronics, a marked uptick from 2012. While premium foreign brands may smack their lips at this news, the trend is not unequivocally good for them. For the same price and quality, an increasing number of Chinese prefer to buy domestic rather than overseas goods.Luxury brands are responding by shrinking store space in China. Burberry reduced its Chinese store count by 10 last year and plans further sales space cuts this year. This may have unanticipated benefits. Scarcity in China enhances cachet. And increased enthusiasm for overseas travel means that sales often just move to tourist destinations.Yum Brands will not be so lucky. Those Chinese turning their noses up at Yum’s ubiquitous fare back home are not likely to gobble more of it as they travel the world.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

It has roiled the food chain’s sales, and sparked a federal investigation.Analysts have noted that other companies, such as Jack in the Box and Yum Brands, have survived food-safety issues, but they have also said the trajectory is uncertain.Chipotle’s shares tumbled 7 per cent in after hours trading on Tuesday. They have crumbled by a third over the past 12 months.

Brands;2016-02-02T21:59:00Z;Chipotle posts first quarterly sales drop in a decade;;Chipotle disclosed on Tuesday its first year-on-year drop in quarterly revenues since at least 2006 after a string of food-safety scares roiled the US burrito chain. The company also said that it was now part of a broader investigation.Shares in the Denver-based company slid 1.5 per cent in extended trading, after the company said its sales fell 6.8 per cent in the fourth quarter to $997.5m, compared to Wall Street’s estimates of $1bn. Same-store sales, a key industry metric, declined 14.6 per cent over the three month period.Profits slid to $67.9m or $2.17 a share from $121m or $3.84 a share in the year ago period.Chipotle also said late Tuesday that it was served with a subpoena broadening the scope of the previously-announced criminal investigation by the US attorney’s office in California.Steve Ells, founder and co-chief executive, who described the fourth quarter as “the most challenging period in Chipotle’s history” also noted that “2016 will be a very difficult year relative to our past performance”.Chipotle was linked last year to six food-safety outbreaks that sickened 487 people across the US. A duo of E. coli outbreaks that initially surfaced in November caused a plunge in the company’s sales in the final months of 2016.The US government said earlier this week it believes the E. coli outbreaks have come to an end, although, investigators were unable to determine the specific ingredient or menu item that carried the bacteria that can cause serious digestive-system symptoms.While other companies, including Yum Brands and Jack in the Box, have survived food-safety scares, many Wall Street analysts remain uncertain over exactly how long it may take Chipotle to recover.Chipotle, for its part, has vowed to become a leader in food safety. It is also planning a big marketing push aimed at reintroducing customers to the chain that is famous for its burritos and guacamole, and assuring them its food is safe.“Unfortunately, despite these efforts, severe traffic declines and continued legal issues … may continue to weigh on sales and a prospective recovery, at least throughout 2016,” Paul Westra, an analyst at Stifel wrote in a note to clients.The shares have rallied 6.9 per cent this week as of the close on Tuesday, but have shed about a third of their value over the past 12 months.

Brands;2015-12-30T10:09:16Z;Music shifts for credit investors in 2015;Return of specific credit shocks jolts bond markets, led by energy sector;The music kept playing in credit markets in 2015, but the tune definitely changed.The return of corporate credit shocks jolted bond investors over the past 12 months, with portfolio managers in both European high-grade and US junk and investment-grade debt nursing considerable losses for 2015. A surge of defaults, led by oil and gas drillers duly arrived as high leverage in the sector left companies exposed to the relentless decline in commodity prices.What has surprised investors this year is how specific companies — rated among the least risky by the major rating agencies — found themselves in unexpected territory, testing the resolve of investors.Volkswagen admitted it had cheated on emissions tests. Anglo American slashed dividends and announced a slew of asset disposals. Petrobras was engulfed in a Brazilian political scandal as the price of crude slid. Yum Brands levered up and said it would split off its Chinese operations.Investors, faced with sudden paper losses as bond prices fell rapidly and pushed up yields, have become more risk averse as debt across at least half a dozen subsectors — including energy, materials, retail, media, pharmaceuticals and telecoms — weakened.“The extent to which investors are shunning the riskiest part of the investment-grade and high-yield space is more extreme than most of us thought at the beginning of the year,” says Tom Stolberg, a portfolio manager with Loomis Sayles. “The aversion to risk is greater than an investor survey in January would have led you to believe.”Investors have pulled more than $36bn from US junk and investment-grade bond funds since the start of June — when oil prices last eclipsed $60 a barrel —, according to figures from Lipper. With Brent crude plumbing its lowest level in 11 years this month, pressure on the energy sector shows little sign of easing as 2016 dawns.The Barclays US high-yield index is set to post its first negative return in seven years, sliding more than 5 per cent. The European corporate aggregate has declined roughly 0.4 per cent, in contrast to its 8.4 per cent return in 2014.This month, Yum was added to the list of so-called fallen angels — investment-grade companies that have had their debt downgraded into junk territory — after Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s cut their ratings on the company’s spin-off plans.Another prime candidate that triggered ructions in credit markets, was Valeant. After it obscured its relationship with a specialty pharmacy group, the company’s bonds maturing in 2025 slumped by more than a fifth before rebounding.Fears surrounding Valeant reverberated through to other junk-rated healthcare companies, including Endo International and Mallinckrodt. That left fixed income investors across the junk space, regardless of sector, asking: what is the risk of contagion?The risks have indeed been digested, as yields have climbed. Rating agencies project a jump in defaults over the coming 12 months, although they are thought to remain broadly centred in the oil and gas and materials sectors.“The one-offs did not help but there were a couple seismic events,” says Bob Michele, chief investment officer for JPMorgan Asset Management. “When it became clear that energy prices would continue to fall, everyone became concerned.”Credit shocks in Europe were more contained. Most energy companies raise finance in dollars and so shocks were limited to individual companies.Volkswagen bonds had several years of income wiped out in the aftermath of the emissions scandal while commodity company Glencore’s bonds were briefly quoted in cash terms rather than yield, as investors worried about the company’s financial health.Later in the year Spanish construction companies Abengoa and Isolux suffered from the slowdown in Latin America where they had exposure. The read across to the rest of the market was limited.“Certainly with Isolux and Abengoa they were fairly well telegraphed,” says Chris Munro, co-head of leveraged finance in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “You had people pre-positioning or taking the view that they were idiosyncratic.”Perhaps the biggest shocks for credit investors was the movement in the interest rate paid to holders of German Bunds. As the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing programme pushed down the risk-free interest rate, coupons on investment-grade bonds also fell.So when the yield on German Bunds rose rapidly during April and May, credit investors saw big losses on supposedly very safe corporate bonds that track government paper.“There are a number of AA-rated US names whose 2015 bonds are trading at 85 [cents to the dollar in] cash and these bonds are six to nine months old. That’s a 20 to 25 per cent annualised loss: that’s not why you buy investment-grade credit,” says Frazer Ross, a managing director on the debt syndicate desk at Deutsche Bank.This has underlined the anxiety heading into the final days of the year, with many investors still on edge as high-yield bond markets deteriorate in the US.“The sensitivity to these sort of moves is heightened,” says one portfolio manager. After the Bund sell-off it led to “that mental situation when people step back and say ‘why do I have paper with a 1 per cent coupon’.”

Brands;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;S&P chops Yum rating to junk;;Some unappetising news for Yum Brands.Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s cut the US restaurant chain’s corporate credit rating to ‘BB’ from ‘BBB’ . The three-notch reduction pushed Yum’s bond rating into junk territory.The move comes as Yum, the company behind KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, announced plans to return $6.2bn to shareholders earlier on Thursday, which S&P said is “a significant shift from the company’s previous financial policy” and “results in our reassessment of the company’s financial risk profile as highly leveraged”.S&P added:The downgrade primarily reflects our expectation of the company’s meaningfully higher leverage as it executes on its newly communicated financial policy with a leverage ratio of about 5x, which results in our assessment of its financial risk profile as “highly leveraged”. We continue to view the company’s business risk profile as “strong”.Failure to reignite sales in Asia’s largest economy prompted Yum to announce a plan to spin off its China business, but its performance outside China has been strong. S&P said its stable outlook on Yum reflected expectations of “improved stability” in its performance following the spin off.Yum’s rating was removed from CreditWatch by S&P, indicating that a further downgrade wasn’t imminent.

Brands plans to return $6.2bn to shareholders was met by a collective yawn by investors on Thursday.Shares in the inanely-punctuated US operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell fell more than 1.2 per cent in early trading, as investors focused instead on the continued weakness in the company’s all important China business, which has been struggling to recover from a series of food safety scandals.In an update on Thursday, Yum said same-store sales in China fell 3 per cent in November, compared to the same period last year. Within this, like-for-like sales were down 1 per cent at KFC while those for Pizza Hut had a 9 per cent decline.Its failure to reignite sales in China was one reason the $30bn company decided in October to split itself into two businesses: one focused on China and the other on the rest of the world.Yum said on Thursday that the split will allow both companies to target a 15 per cent shareholder return per year. Pre-split the company had aimed for earnings per share growth of 10 per cent.Greg Creed, Yum’s chief executive, said:We continue to make solid progress on our planned separation into two independent, publicly-traded companies – Yum! Brands and Yum! China – each with compelling growth strategies, distinct investment characteristics, and optimized capital structures. We believe this transaction is a classic example of ‘one plus one equaling more than two’ .

Shares in Eli Lilly, which have gained 25 per cent so far this year, rose 5.4 per cent to $86.50.Merck shares climbed 2.9 per cent to $54.57 after the drugmaker was also upgraded to “overweight” from “equalweight”, and the price target on the stock was lifted to $66 from $64.Concerns about competition for Merck’s arthritis drug Remicade, which accounted for 5.7 per cent of its 2014 sales, and Januvia, part of its successful diabetes franchise, were overdone, said Mr Meecham. He also noted that while its pipeline of new drugs were not blockbusters, “they add up and are nearly free at the current valuation”.That helped push the S&P 500 pharmaceuticals industry index higher by 2.3 per cent.Pharma and biotechs were under selling pressure earlier this summer as high drug prices charged by some companies attracted political scrutiny. Mr Meacham said: “We view it more as election season rhetoric than a push toward near-term structural changes.’’Shares in Yum Brands climbed 2.7 per cent to $74.48, after analysts at Cowen upgraded the stock from “market perform” to “outperform” and raised their price target on the stock to $88 from $77.Earlier this year, Yum, the owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, announced plans to spin off its China division, which accounted for about half of the company’s revenue in 2014. Slowing economic growth and food safety scares hurt the company’s efforts to turnround sales in the region.With Yum’s reorganisation “on the horizon”, investor focus is expected to shift from concerns on China to optimism for Taco Bell, according to Andrew Charles, an analyst at Cowen.“Outside of China, Yum’s highly franchised business model provides stability that can more predictability return more than 10 per cent annual growth after three years of missing targets,” he said. He also expects Yum to discuss plans to return cash to shareholders through share buybacks at its December investor meeting.Cummins shares fell 7.9 per cent to $92.43 after analysts at Bank of America cut the engine manufacturer to “underperform” from “buy” and lowered their price target on the stock to $90 from $115.Shares in mining equipment maker Joy Global fell 13.2 per cent to $13.33, after analysts at Bank of America downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “neutral” and cut the price target by more than 52 per cent to $10.Overall, the S&P 500 was led higher by gains in financial and health care stocks.By markets close, the S&P 500 gained 1.1 per cent to 2,102.63, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 per cent to 17,888.35.

The broader S&P 500 retail index declined more than 5 per cent over the week.Retailers have attributed weak results to warm weather and the strength of the US dollar, which has hurt tourist spending. Analysts said weak customer traffic has resulted in higher inventory and that could drive more promotional activity during the key shopping seasonNordstrom shares tumbled more than 16 per cent to $53.05 after the upmarket retailer said it now sees earnings in the range of $3.40 to $3.50 a share, compared with its previous outlook for $3.70 to $3.80. This missed analysts’ estimates for $3.80.Meanwhile, the retailer expects to increase same-store sales for the year by 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent, below its previous forecast.Nordstrom said profits fell nearly 43 per cent to $81m or 42 cents a share, shy of analysts’ estimates for 72 cents a share. Adjusting for one-time items earnings of 57 cents a share also missed.

45;YUM;Yum! Brands;2015-10-21T08:41:28Z;Store ownership is least of Yum’s China problems;Bigger issues are weathering competition and recovering from food safety scandals;"Yum Brands has more problems in China than who owns its vast but struggling chain of fast food stores, say analysts after the company’s decision to spin off and list its China operations.While activist investors have succeeded in forcing Yum to separate out its Chinese stores, mainland food industry analysts say the bigger issue will be enticing consumers back to the brand after several years of increasingly intense competition from local rivals, food safety issues and a broad shift toward healthier food options in China.For the past quarter century, when China wanted fast food it often turned to the mainland’s first, largest and most famous quick service international chain, Yum’s KFC — the gold standard for foreign brands on mainland china.But 25 years is a long time in China, and KFC’s cachet has faded. It is no longer viewed as a dining-out venue for the aspiring middle classes, retail analysts say, and more crucially it is not even considered the gold standard in food safety, after recent food safety scares that have severely depressed mainland sales.Earlier this month Yum said recovery in its China business — which accounts for about half of group operating profit — was taking longer than expected, causing it to cut its full-year earnings forecast. KFC’s nearly 5,000 restaurants in China recorded only 3 per cent same-store sales growth in the last quarter while same-store sales at sister brand Pizza Hut dropped 1 per cent.The company’s appointment last week of activist investor Keith Meister to its board had heightened expectations of big change to come. Mr Meister’s fund had amassed a stake of almost 5 per cent in Yum and was pushing for a spin-off of the Chinese business.Yum was upbeat about the future in its statement announcing the split: “China’s consuming class is expected to double from 300m in 2012 to more than 600m people by 2020, providing a strong tailwind to the growth of Yum China. The business remains on pace to open about 700 new locations in 2015 and is targeting expansion to over 20,000 restaurants in China in the future.”You don’t go to Kenya to compete in long-distance running, you don’t come to China to compete in restaurants — in both cases the local competition will run you into the groundBut Jeffrey Towson, private equity investor and professor of investment at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management in Beijing, says: “People think the deal is leveraged against Chinese middle class growth but that should be factor number two; factor number one should be, how are you going to beat the competition?“Yum has 6,900 restaurants in China but there are 3m restaurants in China — it’s the largest, but it’s tiny,” he says. “My advice is you don’t go to Kenya to compete in long-distance running, you don’t come to China to compete in restaurants — in both cases the local competition will run you into the ground.”But Yum could still just as easily succeed as fail in the notoriously volatile restaurant market, he adds: “Step one is give this thing some independence and let them make their own decisions.”Shi Jun, catering industry analyst at Beijing-based Alliance PKU Management, reckons the separation will not have much impact on Yum in China.“Yum’s biggest problem in China is to compete with its local peers as the brand’s novelty wears off” and as it is no longer regarded as the healthy option.But Zhu Danpeng, a food industry researcher, thinks that “it will be easier for Yum China to change menus and be more innovative after the separation . . . (which) could help Yum to be more nimble”.“It’s like localisation 2.0,” says Torsten Stocker, Greater China retail partner at AT Kearney, referring to KFC’s long-term strategy of being highly localised on China.“The hope is they can do that better than they did it before . . . but as always the devil is in the details.” He adds, however, that “I don’t think it suddenly becomes a failure story after 25 years”.Additional reporting by Jackie Cai"

Part of the decline was attributable to a stronger US dollar and the divestment of a business. But the results still showed continuing signs of weakness for a company once famous for its mainframes and floppy disks.IBM has seen its sales decline year-on-year every quarter since the first quarter of 2012, according to data from Bloomberg. Meanwhile, its strategic imperatives unit, focused on forward-looking markets such as cloud computing, is growing quickly but remains a small part of its total portfolio.“We continue to see challenges for IBM’s core business and expect sales to decline as growth in strategic imperatives will be more than offset by declines in the core business,” wrote Sherri Scribner, a research analyst at Deutsche Bank, in a note to clients on the heels of the report.IBM’s shares tumbled 5.7 per cent to $140.68, pushing the stock to a year-to-date decline of 12 per cent. Its market value has plunged more than 40 per cent since hitting $242.7bn in 2012.Elsewhere, shares of Yum Brands rallied 1.9 per cent to $73.05. The parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, among other brands, said it would spin off its China unit. Until recently, the group had been a bright spot for the fast-food chain, but food safety scares and strategic mis-steps have caused the China division to stagnate.Monster Beverage was another big advancer on the day. The maker of energy drinks is testing its products at select McDonald’s locations, according to an analysis by Robert Ottenstein, head of Evercore ISI’s global beverages research team. Mr Ottenstein said the results had been “positive”. The shares rallied 5.2 per cent to $139.61.United Technologies jumped 3.9 per cent to $95.64 after the US industrial heavyweight revealed stronger than expected quarterly profits and a $12bn share buyback plan. It said the buyback included a $6bn accelerated share repurchase using the net proceeds from its sale of helicopter maker Sikorsky.Harley-Davidson, the biggest US maker of motorcycles, skidded deep into negative territory after its quarterly results trailed estimates, and it cut its expectations for worldwide shipments this year. The shares dropped 14 per cent to $48.25, knocking its year-to-date loss to 27 per cent.The Nasdaq biotechnology index tumbled 3.2 per cent, with more than 130 per cent of the companies it tracks in the red on the day. The sector, which has been a favourite throughout the bull market, has faced intense volatility as scrutiny of drug price increases among some politicians has escalated.The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,030.77, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1 per cent to 17,217.11 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.5 per cent to 4,880.97.

Yum Brands may have been cornered into believing so. The US fast-food titan, whose fortunes have long been tied to the world’s most populous country, succumbed to the inevitable on Tuesday when it announced that its KFC and Pizza Hut units in China would be spun off to shareholders. The gambit has been speculated upon for years. The irony is that China is an albatross, not an engine.Even so, the theory is simple enough: shorn of its Asian offshoot (to be called Yum China), shares in the US-based business, which earns steady revenues from its franchisees, will re-rate higher.The two businesses separately will be worth more than they currently are together. The reality might be different; Yum China’s locations are virtually all company-owned and it will have to pay royalties to its former parent while no longer sheltering under its umbrella.And it is a damaged brand; supply chain problems, first involving poultry antibiotics in 2012 and then expired meat in 2014, have hurt KFC’s image in China in recent years. It seemed that the brand was recovering by mid-2015.However, in its third-quarter earnings announcement two weeks ago, Yum said that the recovery at KFC was slowing and that Pizza Hut Casual Dining, accounting for a third of Yum’s Chinese profits, had seen its business deteriorate sharply at the end of the third quarter.Yum cited the economic and stock market pullback, along with increased competition and failed marketing initiatives. The 3 per cent drop in like-for-like sales was fully 25 basis points below expectations, with fourth-quarter sales forecast to fall by as much as low double digits.Yum shares initially fell a fifth before rallying 10 per cent. But the wide gap that still remains to its pre-results share price shows that corporate reshuffling alone cannot override its operational problems in China.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

While its KFC brand was beginning to show signs of recovery after food scandals last year, it was not at the pace that the company had been anticipating, dragged down in part by the country’s economic slowdown.Marketing miscues at Pizza Hut have also weighed on sales in China, contributing to a string of earnings downgrades in recent months.“I am tempted to say that KFC’s best days in China are probably behind them. They are dealing with a lot of tough trends,” said James Roy, analyst at China Market Research in Shanghai. These challenges include rising labour costs and rents, labour shortages, changing consumer tastes and increasing competition.Yum, however, believes that growth in the middle class has a long way to run and that its restaurants in the country could increase in number to 20,000, from 7,000 now. The business generates about $1bn in annual cash flow, half of which is used for opening new outlets and capital investment.“Yum is taking an important step in establishing the right corporate structure and capital structure to maximisew long-term shareholder value,” said Mr Meister.Activist investors have played a critical role — sometimes welcomed but often not — in the upheaval at American food and beverage companies during the past few years, pushing for cost cuts and greater efficiency. Earlier this year Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square built up a 7.5 per cent stake in international snacks company Mondelēz.For Yum, the move marks its biggest change since it was split off from PepsiCo in 1997.Advisers to large multinational companies are increasingly pushing their clients to engage with activist investors in an effort to avoid acrimonious campaigns that attract negative media attention and distract management from running the company.“Corporates understand that they can’t avoid interacting and speaking to activist investors and the activists have understood that if they want to be respected, they need to talk to management in a friendly manner — otherwise they will struggle to win the backing of shareholders when they want something changed,” said one banker.Daniel Loeb’s Third Point Capital, which owns a 0.83 per cent stake in Yum, had suggested “an alternative ownership structure” at the company.Micky Pant, who was appointed chief executive of Yum’s Chinese operations earlier this year, will head the new company, while Greg Creed will be chief executive of Yum. The company did not give valuations for the separate companies or say where the China-focused group would be listed. It plans to give more details on December 10.“Following the separation, each standalone company will be able to intensify focus on its distinct commercial priorities,” said Mr Creed.Yum also said that it planned to increase its debt, a move that it expects to push its credit rating to non-investment grade from Baa3 at present. The debt could be used to increase returns to shareholders through share buybacks or dividend increases.Yum China operates differently from the rest of the company. The restaurants are company owned, in contrast to the franchise model that operates in the US and the rest of the world. It also has a separate supply chain. As a result, Yum said it did not expect there to be any incremental operating costs from the split.

However, revenues only climbed 7 per cent from the same period a year ago.Yum said on Thursday that same-store sales in the China division could range from 0 per cent to 4 per cent, with a better showing from KFC, but a weaker one at Pizza Hut.Mr Meister runs Corvex, one of Yum’s biggest shareholders, with a roughly 5 per cent stake. He said at an investment conference in May that Yum should spin off its China division, claiming it would increase the value of the business.It is unclear precisely what his current plans are, but he wants Yum to move quickly.“This is a company with multiple avenues for unlocking significant long-term value, and I look forward to working with the board and management to expeditiously finalise a plan that we believe can deliver that value to shareholders,” Mr Meister said.Yum shares rose 4.2 per cent to $72.21. They are down 0.9 per cent this year.Shares in Spirit Airlines dropped 15 per cent to a near two-year low on Friday after the budget airline was downgraded by Morgan Stanley.The bank changed its rating on the Florida-based airline to “equal weight” from “overweight”, and cut its target from $66 to $53.On Thursday, Spirit cut its revenue guidance for the rest of this year, saying: “Prices in the markets we serve are low, and we don’t expect that to change in the foreseeable future.”Tight competition has squeezed revenues across the airline industry, despite lower fuel costs.Walmart shares failed to show any signs of recovery on Friday, after their eighth worst one-day drop on record on Wednesday.Shares in the largest US retailer fell 0.8 per cent, after dropping 1 per cent on Thursday and 10 per cent on Wednesday. Walmart shares are down 31 per cent this year.Already struggling as many of its customers fail to prosper from the US recovery, Walmart warned on Wednesday that profits would be depressed over the next two years as it spent to build its e-commerce business.Shares in Wynn Resorts were under pressure after the casino resort operator revealed that the slowdown in the key gambling territory of Macau deepened last quarter.The operator’s revenues in Macau — the only part of China where casinos are legal — fell 38 per cent as cracks in the wider economy and Beijing’s crackdown on corruption hit traffic.Shares in Wynn slipped 1.2 per cent to $72.90.US equities posted their third consecutive week of gains as corporate earnings have been strong enough to appease investors. The S&P 500 Index rose 0.5 per cent to 2,033.11 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 17,215.97. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 4,886.69.

Yum declined to be more specific about the timing of the report.Mr Meister said earlier this year, when it emerged that he had invested $1.5bn in the fast-food chain operator, that he would push for Yum Brands to spin off its Chinese operations.Daniel Loeb’s Third Point Capital owns a 0.83 per cent stake in Yum, and in May had suggested the company could explore “an alternative ownership structure”.“We have had a constructive dialogue with the board and management over the last several months,” said Mr Meister, who previously worked with Carl Icahn, in a statement on Thursday. “This is a company with multiple avenues for unlocking significant long-term value, and I look forward to working with the board and management to expeditiously finalise a plan that we believe can deliver that value to shareholders.”Shares in the company, which also operates the Taco Bell chain, rose 1.1 per cent to $69.29 in after-hours trading.Yum has been struggling to turn around its Chinese operations after sales were hit by a food-safety scandal at KFC. Although it is showing signs of recovery there, the pace has been slower than expected amid the country’s economic slowdown. At the same time, demand at its Pizza Hut chain has fizzled, partly due to marketing failures, the company said earlier this month.Underscoring Yum’s struggles in China, just a week after it cut its annual forecast for full-year earnings, the company on Thursday further reduced its outlook due to “volatility” in the market that provides half of its operating profit.The increasingly unpredictable nature of its operations in China has prompted the company to start issuing monthly sales updates until the end of the year, to give investors more transparency.RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar, said that the board appointment combined with the results of the strategic review “could signal big changes are ahead for Yum”. He said that among the possibilities were a debt issue to fund a share buyback, which is something that he said Mr Meister had floated in the past.“The bigger question is whether or not they really aggressively look at a separate Chinese entity,” he added. That would involve the consideration of risks of a local spin off at a time of volatility in equity markets, Mr Hottovy said.The business model in China is centred around company-owned restaurants and an independent separate supply chain, whereas the rest of the business, is based on a franchise model. This meant that a split of the Chinese operations would not result in much loss of scale, analysts said.Fund manager Third Point wants company to consider splitting off Chinese operationsRead moreThe rest of the Yum business outside of China is performing steadily, while Taco Bell has been a bright spot for the company in the US.Although KFC and Pizza Hut were struggling in China, it was believed that investors might be keen to take a stake in a separate Chinese business based on a long-term outlook for the economy: one of wage growth, an expanding middle class and urbanisation, analysts said.Just a week ago, in its third-quarter earnings announcement, Yum said it expected full-year earnings per share to be in “low-single” digits, compared with earlier forecasts for 10 per cent growth.On Thursday, it reduced those expectations further, saying it now forecast EPS to range from zero to “low-single” digit growth.Yum Brand’s shares have fallen 4.9 per cent year-to-date, compared with the S&P 500, which has declined 1.7 per cent.Other American companies that have spun off part of their overseas operations include McDonald’s, which has listed its Japanese business locally but has retained a 50 per cent stake.
51;YUM;Yum! Brands;2015-10-08T18:36:26Z;Yum: Yuck;The fast food group is having trouble in China;"Fast food is bad for you, whether in your stomach or your portfolio. This week, fried chicken, taco and pizza vendor Yum Brands delivered soggy results. It blamed the poor performance on slower than expected growth in China, which accounts for more than a third of its operating profit. The stock slumped nearly a fifth in response.Everyone agrees that China’s economy is slowing; the only debate is how much and why. So, many will assume that Yum’s problems are macroeconomic. They are not.The issue is not that the Chinese consumer is choosing to save rather than spend. Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo, owned by Fast Retailing, fell short of expectations for its full year numbers this week — but not because of China. That market delivered profits up two-thirds year on year.The spending stretches to food as well. Starbucks’ China revenues are still growing, for example. It is Yum in particular that is going sideways.In fact, the fast food category is stumbling worldwide. Junk food popular in the 1980s and 1990s has been losing its appeal. McDonald’s top line has stood still for four years, despite efforts to introduce healthy menus. Even in the US, where unhealthy is the national pastime, golden arch revenues have gone nowhere.More importantly, for companies operating in China, the Chinese consumer learns quickly — about both the good and the bad. As social media spreads, brand destroying food safety scandals (of which Yum has had a few) are hard to contain. And as tastes become more sophisticated, lost consumers may not return. Yum’s numbers in China have bounced back from the scandals, just not as strongly as expected. Middle-class preferences do not extend to the cheap and cheerful.China’s economic growth may be slowing, but the economy is still growing and with it retail sales. Capturing that growth, however, is no longer easy: foreign brands are not assured cachet irrespective of product. Chinese diners have moved on from junk food.

52;YUM;Yum! Brands;2015-10-07T14:35:02Z;Third-quarter EM pain for dollar earners;Earnings hit to be felt most by US exporters to emerging markets;US companies with global operations focused on emerging market countries are bracing for weaker earnings courtesy of a stronger dollar as the quarterly results season unfolds over the coming weeks.Investors soured on the S&P 500 during the third quarter, alarmed by signs of slowing global growth, led by China and other emerging market countries.Now, as S&P 500 companies report results and outline their prospects for the rest of the year and early 2016, investors expect weakness from EM operations will be offset by the dollar trading relatively steadily against major developed currency partners during the third quarter.In a sign of what beckons for US earnings, SABMiller this week revealed a big hit from the continuing weakness of emerging market currencies against the dollar. The London-based producer of Miller Lite, Grolsch and Peroni makes 70 per cent of its sales to emerging markets.PepsiCo, the US snacks and beverage group, also saw roughly $2bn sliced off revenues in its just-completed quarter as currency swings cut into its sales abroad. Yum Brands, the owner of KFC and Taco Bell and Dupont, also warned this week of the dollar’s impact on earnings.A strengthening dollar hurts US companies with large overseas operations since the same amount of money made outside the US is worth less when translated back into dollars.A blended rate of reported results and estimates shows third-quarter revenue for companies in the S&P 500 with less than 50 per cent of sales in the US fell 13 per cent year over year compared with a rise of about 1 per cent for those with more than half of sales in the US, according to FactSet.While the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of its major peers such as the euro, sterling and Canadian dollar, rose only 0.8 per cent during the period, it significantly appreciated against emerging market currencies during the period.JPMorgan’s emerging market currency index, which measures the most heavily traded EM currencies against the dollar, is down 8.25 per cent.Indeed, investors said the impact of the dollar would be bifurcated.“Broadly speaking, if you look at the S&P 500 the impact of currency in the third quarter will be significantly less than in the first half of the year, but the impact will be in companies that are doing a lot of business in Russia, China or Latin America,” said Oliver Pursche, chief executive at Bruderman Brothers.The dollar will be less of a drag for US multinationals doing business in the western hemisphere as well as in Japan and Australia, he said.James Liu, global market strategist with JPMorgan Asset Management, sees “a light at the end of the tunnel” for the dollar and earnings.“The third quarter should be the last quarter we have these real negative year-on-year comparisons,” he said.With the earnings season about to get under way, the Commerce Department this week reported that in August the gap between US exports and imports swelled more than 15 per cent to $48.3bn, highlighting how a strong dollar has affected the trade balance.

However, the company declined to give any more detail before an investor call on Wednesday, when it said it would provide more information on its plans to revive demand.The Louisville, Kentucky-based company’s third quarter was also hit by the strong dollar. Total quarterly revenue rose 2 per cent to $3.43bn, while operating profit, of which about half comes from China, rose 10 per cent to $603m. Earnings per share rose 6 per cent to 95 cents in the third quarter, or 14 per cent to $1 excluding extraordinary items.China was not the only market where Yum struggled with Pizza Hut, whose total operating profit dropped 3 per cent to $67m. The brand’s sales were unchanged in the US despite the recovering economy, and fell in developed markets such as Australia.Taco Bell continued to be the bright spot for the company, where operating profit rose 6 per cent to $132m.
54;YUM;Yum! Brands;2015-08-21T16:52:25Z;China: unfavoured nation;People in glass global powerhouses shouldn’t throw stones;"People in glass houses might consider investing in stronger windows. China bears responsibility for much of the world’s current economic malaise. Despite reported growth of 7 per cent — the economy is slowing; it has become a drag. In contrast, the US’s second-quarter growth is estimated at a mere 2.3 per cent over the prior quarter — less appealing, but at least accelerating.China’s slowing growth is not a big surprise. Authorities are trying to rebalance the economy away from investment and exports to a more consumer-led model. Yet recent data has led to doubts about whether China can achieve its aims. On Friday, the Caixin purchasing managers’ index fell for the third month in a row to 47.1, contracting more than expected. Factory output, new orders and inventories all showed trends worsening at an even faster rate than July’s two-year low. Also worrisome, smartphone sales into China fell for the first time on record, says Gartner.Furthermore, state attempts to reboot retail investor enthusiasm with stock-market-supporting measures have undermined belief in the central government’s competence. The knock-on effects have spread beyond China’s plummeting stock markets (among only a handful of major indices still in the black for the year). This week, waves of selling rolled round the emerging markets. Even the US was eventually caught in the wake.This US sell-off may, in fact, be just. Many American companies, such as Yum Brands and Qualcomm have relied too heavily on China driving revenues while skimping on investment. Even at Apple, growth in China has helped the company increase dividends by 18 per cent in the 12 months to January; capital expenditure only rose by single-digits. According to Factset, S&P 500 companies spent nearly $1tn on share buybacks and dividends in the same period. Meanwhile, capital expenditure — to strengthen those glass houses — is expected to fall by 3 per cent this year.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
55;YUM;Yum! Brands;2015-08-13T17:15:42Z;China economy: down in the data mine;You cannot trust the numbers — or perhaps you don’t want to;"It may just have been bad timing. China’s announcement of a looser renminbi peg came only a few days after a downbeat report on exports. So when the renminbi news hit, there was a common shocked response: China’s economy must be much weaker than we thought.This reading took hold despite the availability of another explanation: China is keen that the IMF add the renminbi to the list of reserve currencies. This requires that it be more market-driven; the loosening was a step in that direction.Why is it even possible to regard the peg as an economic indicator? The conventional answer is simple and cynical: you can’t trust the official economic numbers, so you have little choice but to read into official pronouncements and actions.China’s official GDP growth figure does look suspiciously stable. And plenty of other official figures have been telling a scary story for some months now. Rail freight volumes have been falling, by at least one official measure, since early last year. Electricity production first gave a frighteningly weak reading last summer. Cement output went negative in March. Housing starts have been deep in the red throughout 2015.These data series are all volatile and, of course, are much easier to read retrospectively. All the same, many of them tell a similar story — which makes one wonder why the news of the last week has constituted a shock.Big, prominent companies have also been making dreary noises about operations in China for some time. Yum Brands has been reporting double-digit declines in same-store sales in China restaurants even as its supply scandals receded into the past. Hershey cut targets on weak China growth two months ago. Then reports arrived that Audi’s sales growth in China would be negative. United Technologies reported sharp declines in its Chinese elevator and air conditioner businesses in July, too.Optimistic investors have looked to China for so long that it may have become less stressful to dismiss weak (and unusually unequivocal) data than be cautioned by it — the latest instance of a timeless phenomenon.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

57;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
58;YUM;Yum! Brands;2015-05-17T04:52:31Z;Yum Brands China operations pique interest of analysts;Questions for KFC owner as grannies flock to China restaurants alongside bigger-spending customers;Analysts last week descended on Yum Brands in Shanghai with a volley of tough questions after billionaire investor Dan Loeb suggested the US fast-food chain consider hiving off its Chinese operations.The annual Shanghai investor conference, scheduled long before Mr Loeb’s intervention, came as the fate of the woe-laden China operations of the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut is uppermost in investors’ minds.What Mr Loeb dubbed a play on a “unique open-ended middle-class growth story in China” is valued at $20bn-$22bn by analysts. But the view from the streets is rather less gung ho, with restaurants as likely to be stuffed with thrifty grannies as the upwardly mobile middle-class patrons referred to by Mr Loeb.For the past quarter of a century, KFC was the gold standard for foreign brands among Chinese. But now its restaurants, especially in big cities, play host to grannies entertaining an only grandchild or elderly matchmakers running impromptu dating agencies alongside the more lucrative customers.“I am tempted to say KFC’s best days in China are probably behind them. They are dealing with a lot of tough trends,” says James Roy, consumer analyst at China Market Research in Shanghai.These challenges include rising labour costs and rents, labour shortages, changing consumer tastes and increasing competition. This suggests that Yum faces more structural problems than simply a blip caused by the recent food safety scandals.“Yum China has recovered from previous downturns in its business. However, each time the recovery has taken longer and requires more marketing expenditure,” says Li Junheng of JL Warren Capital.“Yum’s challenges in China are mostly structural, rather than one-off. These structural issues are unlikely to disappear with financial engineering that focuses on expanding the stock multiple and ignores fundamentals.”KFC faces growing competition from more innovative start-up fast-dining concepts.“China is evolving away from that type of restaurant. They need to do something to remain relevant — and they aren’t doing it as well as, for example, McDonald’s,” says Mr Roy.They need to do something to remain relevant — and they aren’t doing it as well as, for example, McDonald’sYum recently reported a 12 per cent annual same-store sales decline in the first quarter and weaker margins. But Greg Creed, its chief executive, predicted a better second half to the year.KFC’s decline comes at a time when foreign retail brands are struggling in China not just in the fast food sector, but in many areas including supermarkets, electronics and home improvement retailing. Big international brands such as US retailers Best Buy and Home Depot have been forced to abandon China in recent years.But Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein, who attended the conference, sees a brighter future for Yum in China. “They appear to be recovering from the supply chain scandals.“While they acknowledge the market has become more competitive . . . because of the advantages they have always had here, scale, brand recognition and supply chain, there is every reason to believe they can retain their market share leadership,” she says.Torsten Stocker, greater China retail partner at A.T. Kearney, the professional services firm, says it is too soon to predict the demise of one of the mainland’s most famous brands. “It is natural that a ‘market creator’ like Yum will have to work extra-hard to stay ahead of the competitors that it often spawns itself,” he says.Additional reporting by Jackie Cai

For many, that was true even when oil was at $100 per barrel.“Depletion gets ignored because it is not a cash item, and capex gets ignored because it is funding future growth,” he argued. “When someone doesn’t want you to look at traditional metrics, it is a good time to look at traditional metrics.”As well as Pioneer, the companies singled out in the presentation on Monday were EOG Resources, Whiting Petroleum, Continental Resources and Concho Resources.Mr Einhorn — who made his reputation shorting Allied Capital, a mid-cap lender in the US, from 2002 — likened the companies to St Joe, a Florida landowner that could not develop its land profitably even at the peak of the housing bubble.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

That’s at least what the stock price would indicate. Last summer a meat supplier to Yum, whose brands are KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, was discovered to be selling expired meat. Yum’s shares naturally dipped. Yet, since their trough last October they have rallied a third — that includes the reaction to reports late last week that multiple hedge fund investors have taken stakes in the fast food conglomerate.A single supply chain mishap could be an aberration. But Yum faced another one in 2012 when a company from which it bought chickens was alleged to be improperly using hormones and antibiotics.Yum generates more than half of its revenue in China, with no signs of its expansion slowing there. The wager on Yum could be seen as how sharply China rebounds. But as a conglomerate, Yum’s remaining appendages are starting to get more attention.In the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, same-store sales in Yum’s China division were off 16 and 12 per cent, respectively, because of the bad publicity from last summer. However, it still plans to open 700 locations in the country in 2015, increasing its store count by a tenth. Yum believes that even with 4,800 KFCs, its core Chinese brand, there is room for three times more. In the first half of 2014, before the scandal, same-store sales were up 12 per cent in China and its operating margin was nearly 20 per cent.Setting China aside, burritos and tacos are becoming quite popular elsewhere. Same-store sales at Taco Bell were up 6 per cent the last two quarters as the company’s efforts at targeting youth and introducing menu innovation (such as breakfast items) are working. Yum restaurants in China are company-owned, but most stores elsewhere are owned by franchisees who are responsible for the capital investment in stores. Yum’s net debt-to-earnings ratio (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) is a modest one times. One financial manoeuvre could be separating the Chinese business and then adding leverage to the remaining businesses.With the recent run-up, its shares are trading at 26 times 2015 earnings (even while this year’s earnings growth may be just 10 per cent). That seems juicy, but throw in the words “China” and “spin-offs” and the hype becomes explainable.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Brands;2015-05-04T03:49:42Z;US fast-food chains return to Japan amid McDonald’s backlash;Influx of foreign brands underscores shift in consumer trends away from traditional cuisine;Rebuffed once in the 1980s, a number of US fast-food chains from Taco Bell to Carl’s Jr are flocking back to the land of tofu and sushi.Their return comes amid a backlash in Japan against America’s best-known burger brand — McDonald’s — following a series of food safety scandals.“In some ways, McDonald’s slump is driving the entry of other foreign chains,” says Hisakazu Matsuda, president of Japan Consumer Marketing Research Institute.But the influx of foreign chains also underscores a broader shift in consumer trends away from the country’s traditional fish and rice-based cuisine.Just as Japan’s sushi and ramen noodles are hits in New York and London, the country’s younger generation are willing to queue for hours to eat Eggs ’n Things pancakes from Hawaii and to get hold of a $10 container of Garrett Popcorn from Chicago.Government data show the consumption of rice in Japan has halved over the past half-century, while meat eating has more than tripled.Demand for convenience cuisine has increased, with the proportion of food spending on dining out or eating ready-to-cook dishes now at about 44 per cent, from less than 30 per cent in the mid-1970s, according to Foodservice Industry Research Institute.Word of the latest culinary booms in Paris or Los Angeles also spreads fast thanks to Twitter and social media, making it easier for foreign brands to gain a foothold in the Japanese market.“The world has changed so much,” Melissa Lora, president of Taco Bell International, said on the opening day of its first store in Tokyo a fortnight ago. “People are interested in new and interesting flavours. It’s the perfect timing for us.”Yum Brands, the Kentucky-based operator of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, is trying to boost the international presence of its restaurants as sales wane in China due to food safety concerns. Last summer, one of Yum’s suppliers — also used by McDonald’s — was exposed selling out-of-date meat.Mr Matsuda says companies are putting the lessons learnt from their brief stints in Japan in the 1980s to use by returning with strong local franchise operators and adapting to tastes.Taco Bell, for instance, is selling shrimp and avocado burrito for Y590 ($4.94) and a taco rice bowl for Y530, both at prices cheaper than the ones offered at existing Mexican restaurants in Japan. Its outlets will also have an open kitchen format so consumers can see the ingredients going into their meals.Combined with shifts in consumer tastes, prime minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to stoke inflation have also played a role. Yuiko Mitani, research analyst at Euromonitor, says the weaker yen against the US dollar makes it cheaper for US-based companies to invest in Japan. The relaxing of restrictions on imports of foreign beef have also helped, with conditions set to improve further if a Pacific trade deal can be reached between the US, Japan and 10 other countries.In addition to Taco Bell, CKE Restaurants, which owns California-based burger chain Carl’s Jr, plans to open its first store in Tokyo in the autumn and expand to 150 outlets across Japan in a decade.New York burger chain Shake Shack, which went public in the US in January, is making its first foray into Asia with a store in Japan next year. It plans to open 10 stores by 2020. It is not just burger chains that are moving in: 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria, which operates mainly in California and Las Vegas, is set to open next year.Industry experts say Japan will still be a tough market to crack for foreign chains. Burger chains such as Wendy’s and Burger King have already withdrawn and returned with a much smaller footprint. Euromonitor data project that Japan’s fast food market grew about 16 per cent in total to $43bn from 2009 to 2014, but is expected to expand at an annual rate of less than 1 per cent over the next three years, with the burger category declining most steeply.Amid a global shift toward healthier foods, Shake Shack calls itself “fine casual”, deliberately setting itself apart from traditional fast-food chains. It markets its ShackBurger, which costs about $3 more than a Big Mac in the US, as “100 per cent all-natural Angus beef. No hormones and no antibiotics ever”.“Shake Shack offers the fine dining experience in a more casual way that customers can enjoy at affordable prices. It’s not a regular fast food restaurant,” says Ryota Tsunoda, director of Sazaby League, its local partner, which also introduced Starbucks to Japan.Among the crowds waiting in front of Taco Bell in Tokyo last week was Tomoko Ikeda, a 42-year-old web designer, who opts for fast-food chains that use a lot of vegetables. “I want to eat fast food that is healthier,” Ms Ikeda said. “So I want to try Shake Shack next.”Menus only in JapanIt is no easy task trying to keep finicky Japanese consumers happy. To maintain their interest, foreign fast-food chains often go out of their way with quirky marketing campaigns. One of the longstanding favourite tactics is offering products that are limited to the Japanese market.For this year’s April Fools’ Day, Burger King created a perfume with the scent of the patties of their Whopper burger with a catchphrase: “No Whopper, No Life. Wear it & Have it.” The limited bottle of perfume called Flame Grilled Flagrance was sold for Y5,000 ($42) with a Whopper burger for one day only.The perfume followed a burger last year wrapped in black buns and cheese coloured with bamboo charcoal, and topped with squid ink ketchup. The US chain returned to Tokyo in 2007 after a six-year hiatus. In September, Wendy’s also offered a crab salad burger for Y820 that was only sold in Japan.
62;YUM;Yum! Brands;2015-05-01T15:32:29Z;Activist investor Daniel Loeb takes $1bn stake in Yum;Fund manager Third Point wants company to consider splitting off Chinese operations;The activist hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb (left) has emerged as a shareholder in Yum Brands, in a development that could put pressure on the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut to split off its Chinese operations.Mr Loeb’s Third Point Capital has taken a stake of $1bn in Yum, which is recovering from two food safety scares at KFC in China, and the activist has set out some of his prescriptions for the company in his latest letter to investors.As well as operational and menu improvements at the company’s US restaurant chains — including “more handheld chicken sandwiches, which are one of the fastest growing items on the American lunch menu” — Mr Loeb also suggested Yum could explore “an alternative ownership structure”.“We think investors should want to own Yum for its unique open-ended middle-class growth story in China and its strong and growing franchise-led cash flows outside China,” he told investors.“We also expect that Yum management, consistent with their prior public statements, will consider a variety of value-enhancing actions to ensure that the market properly rewards its investors for both compelling earnings streams.”Analysts, including Stifel’s Paul Westra, have suggested Yum could spin off its Chinese operations in a flotation on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. About 6,700 of Yum’s 41,500 restaurants are in China, and the country accounted for 52 per cent of the company’s revenue last year.Yum’s chief financial officer, Pat Grismer, addressed the question of a China spin off at a Bank of America conference this year. “That is not in the best interest of shareholders at this point in time,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that there couldn’t be a different point in time where an option like that may make sense. But right now, our job number one is to fix the China business.”Prior to the food safety scandals, the strong China division had helped offset broad challenges in the US, where consumer tastes have shifted from traditional greasy fare to fresher, more natural options that are considered healthier. The entire industry is struggling — on Monday, McDonald’s will unveil a turnround plan aimed at solving slumping sales growth.The company’s shares rose 4 per cent on news of Third Point’s stakebuilding, giving the company a market capitalisation of $38.8bn.Mr Loeb avoided the pointed criticisms of strategy and barbs against management that characterise his most aggressive campaigns, but he did serve notice on Yum chief executive Greg Creed that he expected improvements in the US at KFC and, in particular, Pizza Hut.He wrote: “Pizza Hut started as a casual dining concept and then expanded into delivery, but the complexity of doing both has the company operating at a competitive disadvantage relative to Domino’s in delivery.”Yum’s sales in China were dented by successive food safety scandals, which have been a recurring problem for the fast-food industry in the country. Last year, a local television station found a KFC supplier putting new labels on expired meat, among other safety violations. An earlier scandal, two years previously, involved excessive use of antibiotics at a chicken supplier. Same-store sales were still falling at 12 per cent, year on year, in the first quarter of 2015.In reference to Mr Loeb’s appearance on its shareholder register, Yum Brands said: “We appreciate their confidence and investment.”

Brands;2015-03-03T17:14:01Z;Carmaker slide blamed on icy weather;US stocks slip from record levels, Nasdaq retreats from 5,000;US carmaker shares slipped on Tuesday after results from the country’s largest manufacturers fell short of Wall Street expectations, blunted by icy winter weather that kept consumers out of dealer showrooms.Ford Motor, Fiat Chrysler and General Motors reported February sales below forecasts with executives from the first two pointing to the bitter cold for some of the impediment.Vehicle sales at Ford fell 2 per cent from a year earlier to 180,383 units, shy of projections for a 5.8 per cent gain, with double-digit percentage declines by its Taurus, Focus and Fiesta cars.While Chrysler and GM fared better — sales climbed 5.6 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively from the prior year — they were not able to hurdle forecasts for stronger gains.The lacklustre sales figures were a blow to investors expecting further strength from a sector that has proved a resilient engine in the US recovery.Manufacturers have increased production at factories across the country as demand rose and several analysts expect that larger and more expensive vehicles, including pick-up trucks and SUVs, could gain share in the market after the slump in fuel prices.Economists with Deutsche Bank noted that easing credit conditions — over the last four quarters motor vehicle loans have ticked 8.7 per cent higher — coupled with strong job growth would likely buoy auto sales this spring as wintry conditions abated.“Any potential weakness in February vehicle sales will likely be short lived and once weather patterns normalise, vehicle sales should trend meaningfully higher, which was exactly what happened last year,” said Joseph LaVorgna, an economist with Deutsche.Overall, sales were expected to advance 9 per cent from a year ago to an annualised pace of 16.7m units.Ford shares fell -2.4 per cent to $16.17 while General Motors rose 0.5 per cent to $37.80. Shares of Fiat Chrysler trading in New York declined 3.3 per cent to $15.31 while Volkswagen ADRs slid 3 per cent to $49.30.Yum shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $81.51 after analysts with Baird cut their rating to “neutral” from “outperform”, citing the stock’s double-digit gains this year, which have outpaced the S&P 500.The brokerage said shares now traded above its price target and that the current price/earnings premium against the S&P exceeded its two-year average, despite limited visibility on Yum’s turnround in China.“We remain confident in longer-term fundamentals but we still see elevated risk on Yum — especially at current valuation metrics — related to the uncertain timing/trajectory of the China recovery,” said David Tarantino, an analyst with Baird.US stocks slipped on Tuesday from record levels, including the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which just a day earlier eclipsed 5,000 for the first time in 15 years.The index, which slid 0.6 per cent to 4,979.90, remained within 1.2 per cent of its record closing high, propelled over the past year by gains in Apple, its largest constituent.The broader S&P 500 declined 0.5 per cent to 2,107.78 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.5 per cent lower to 18,203.37.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
64;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Walmart sends wage signal to US business;Other companies may find it harder to afford such a response to rising political pressure on pay;"“Every time you use a self-checkout lane or a touchscreen ordering system, it’s a task that used be part of someone’s job description.”That was the stark message in a 30-second advertisement that ran on national TV networks in the US last year. The voiceover was accompanied by images of shop assistants and waitresses vanishing into thin air, only to be replaced by machines. The commercial formed part of a campaign funded by the restaurant and retail industries against President Barack Obama’s calls to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10, compared to the $7.25 level last set more than five years ago.On Thursday, Walmart broke ranks with many other employers of low-paid workers and said it would pay all of its employees a starting rate of $9 an hour, rising to $10 an hour for existing staff by February 2016.Many expect the focus to turn now to whether other low-pay employers, especially in the fast-food sector, will follow suit, either because they are competing for the same entry level workers, or because public pressure and statewide minimum wages make it impossible to hold out.Tara Sinclair, chief economist at jobs website Indeed and a professor at George Washington University, said the move would “reverberate well beyond the retail sector”.Businesses throughout the “low-wage economy” would now feel extra pressure to raise pay, said Damon Silvers, the policy director for the AFL-CIO, America’s union umbrella organisation. “As the largest private sector employer in the country, Walmart has tremendous power to shape economic trends.”The move comes as companies find themselves in the middle of a fierce debate in the US about the minimum wage — which last increased in 2009 — and broader income stagnation. Minimum-wage workers now earn 20 per cent less in real terms than in the late 1960s, sparking calls from unions and Democrats for companies to offer bigger increases.President Obama renewed his calls for a higher federal minimum wage in a report to Congress on Thursday, but White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz welcomed signs that businesses such as Walmart were meanwhile taking action on pay unilaterally.“We continue to call on Congress to give all workers in America a wage . . . hike. But given their recalcitrance on this . . . we’re going to continue to make progress in other ways,” he said.Companies in much of the US already have to pay more than the federal minimum, after 29 states introduced higher minimum wages from January, including Washington state, Oregon and Connecticut. All of those floors remain below $10 an hour, however.On January 5, 1914, Henry Ford stunned his competitors in the burgeoning Detroit auto industry by doing the unexpected. He offered workers $5 a day for their labour — more than double the going rate.Continue readingEven at $10, a Walmart worker with a family of four would need to rely on government assistance to be taken above the federal poverty line, said David Cooper, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-centre think-tank.The EPI has called for a bigger increase in the federal minimum to $12.50 by 2020, saying this could provide raises for close to 40m workers directly or indirectly through the “ripple effects”.Walmart said that $10 an hour was just its starting wage and that it aims to quickly move people beyond entry-level pay, with its average staff wage standing at $13 an hour.The $1bn cost of Walmart’s decision was eye-catching, but represents a fraction of its $486bn in annual revenue. Investors still reacted negatively, sending its shares down by more than 3 per cent.Analysts were divided on the ramifications. Goldman Sachs warned that “Walmart’s cost of doing business is clearly rising, reflecting . . . self-imposed wage pressure”.Walmart’s cost of doing business is clearly risingYet Nomura’s Robert Drbul applauded the move. “We believe this . . . is quite logical and long overdue. We are optimistic that this investment will ultimately translate into a better customer experience, driven by higher associate satisfaction and higher retention, longer term.”In raising pay Walmart was acting in its own corporate interest, argued Justin Wolfers, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He cited evidence that improving workers’ earnings can boost a company’s productivity, as well as improving retention.“There is good reason for them to expect there is a pay-off from this,” as the company attracts better workers and gets more out of them, he said.The company’s decision probably also reflects a tightening labour market, with America’s private sector adding jobs for the longest uninterrupted period on record.Walmart has signalled for some time that it was ready to tackle the minimum wage issue at its stores, which has prompted a spate of strikes organised by unions and employee groups. It is not the first retailer to offer higher wages — Ikea, Costco, Whole Foods and Gap are among those pay rates above the federal minimum.However, the fast-food sector, dominated by McDonald’s and Pizza Hut owner Yum Brands, has been much more resistant to higher wages.McDonald’s has argued that its local franchisees, rather than the company, are responsible for working conditions. But its latest quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission contains several warnings that a rise in minimum wages could hurt its business.“The impact of campaigns by labour organisations and activists to promote adverse perceptions of . . . our brand,” could hamper the company’s ability to grow profits and sales, McDonald’s said in the filing, as could an “increasing focus on workplace practices and conditions”.Yum Brands’ annual filing contains a similar warning: “Competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees, which could adversely impact our profit margins.”Yum is also facing litigation relating to its employment conditions. Its Taco Bell unit has been named in a number of class action lawsuits, which allege it underpaid workers, denied them meal and rest breaks, and handed out improper wage statements. The company denies the allegations.There is good reason for them to expect there is a pay-off from thisThe company negotiated a settlement with drivers at its Pizza Hut chain, who filed a separate lawsuit claiming they were not reimbursed for their vehicle or uniform costs.Yum, which already operates with low costs, could find it harder to absorb wage increases than Walmart. Labour costs as a percentage of sales at its Taco Bell stores are already running at 38 per cent. Last year, the restaurants reported a profit margin of 18.9 per cent, a decline of 60 basis points, which it attributed to “commodity inflation and higher food and labour costs”.McDonald’s and Yum did not respond to requests for comment.Walmart looks to Asda for inspirationWalmart’s decision to spend $1bn to boost the wages of 500,000 low-paid workers brings their pay more into line with that of Asda, Walmart’s UK subsidiary, writes Andrea Felsted.The changes at Walmart will mean that 500,000 full-time and part-time workers in its US stores will eventually be paid the equivalent of about £6.47 per hour. Asda’s starting hourly rate is £6.89, above the UK minimum wage of £6.50. It also offers a bonus scheme, and the opportunity for Asda employees to buy Walmart shares at a discounted rate.The changes at Walmart will apply only to the US business, and will be funded by that territory. There are no plans to make any changes to pay levels at Asda. But Walmart increasingly looks to Asda, which it acquired in 1999 for £6.7bn, for inspiration on everything from grocery home shopping, to food sourcing and fashion. A number of senior Asda directors, including former finance director Judith McKenna, pictured, have recently been elevated to roles at the US group.Asda also draws on the clout of Walmart, for example jointly sourcing products for Black Friday discounting after the Thanksgiving holiday. Asda has pioneered the tradition in the UK — with mixed results for the retail industry.Asda also revealed this week that it would overhaul its branding to look more like its parent. It will introduce elements of the Walmart logo — yellow rays of sun — into the Asda brand identity. It will also adopt Walmart’s catchphrase: “Save Money. Live Better”. The increasingly close co-operation between the two companies has raised questions as to whether Asda will ditch its identity, and simply be known as Walmart in the UK, with the brand overhaul the first step to this.Andy Clarke, chief executive of Asda, insists this is not the case. He says it is the first time that the chain has sought to reinvigorate its identity for over a decade. It is doing so now because it is about to begin a big refurbishment of its stores.“The brand of Asda in the UK is loved by customers,” says Mr Clarke. “This is not the first step; it’s the step. It’s about refreshing the brand.”"
65;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-10-24T18:07:22Z;McDonald’s: Eating their lunch;The world’s largest restaurant chain has missed a dramatic shift in what consumers want to eat;It is lunchtime in downtown Chicago, and the Chipotle Mexican Grill on Franklin Street is packed with customers hungry for burritos, tacos and fajitas. Among those satisfying his Mexican craving is Sameer Mazhary, one of the millions of diners who have made Chipotle one of the fastest-growing restaurant chains in the US over the past decade.“Chipotle is a different breed,” he says. “It’s like an evolution from fast food.”There is a McDonald’s a few blocks away, but Mr Mazhary, 28, says he has not stepped through the Golden Arches in a decade. “I learnt about the food, and what goes into it and it kind of turned me off,” he says.As he speaks, people rush by with bags from Potbelly Sandwich Shop, Freshii, Noodles & Co and another Chipotle, three blocks away, where the queue stretches on to the sidewalk. Wyatt Steele, 32, is a regular at this branch, visiting once a week or so. He says he grew up eating at McDonald’s but has not bought anything beyond a coffee there in years. “I don’t trust the ingredients, I don’t trust the way I imagine they put together their food . . . with chemists in a lab getting the taste and smell just right,” he says.Tastes are changing in the US, and this is bad news for the world’s largest restaurant group. The children who grew up eating Happy Meals are not hungry for Big Macs. Like Mr Mazhary and Mr Steele, they are as concerned about where their food comes from and what is in it as they are about how much it costs or how fast they can eat it.If Mr Steele is any indication, the future does not bode well. “If I had any kids, I likely would not take them to McDonald’s either,” he says.Throughout the US, McDonald’s largest market, the company’s fortunes in recent years have tracked those of its crucial low-income customers, who have not recovered from the financial crisis.McDonald’s is the biggest fast food player, with 35,000 global outlets and $28bn in annual revenues, and its challenges have been similarly large-scale. The company has seen same-store sales in the US fall in 10 of the past 12 months. This week, it said its global same-store sales fell more than 3 per cent during the third quarter, with profits down 30 per cent. By contrast, Chipotle on Monday reported a 19.8 per cent rise in same-store sales and a 57 per cent jump in profits.The problems for McDonald’s are not limited to the US. Growth in Europe is even slower, while Asia sales have slumped on a Chinese food safety scandal. A rebound in Russia may be even further off, after Moscow opened hygiene and finance investigations into nearly half of the company’s 450 outlets, which some see as retaliation for EU and US sanctions.Speaking to investors this week, Steve Ells, Chipotle’s co-chief executive, took a swipe at the fast food model epitomised by McDonald’s – once the Mexican chain’s largest investor. “The traditional fast food sector has traded food quality and taste for low-cost and ease of preparation,” he said.Judging from comments made this week by Don Thompson, McDonald’s chief executive, the fast food pioneer agrees with him. McDonald’s said it would take “decisive action to fundamentally change” its business in ways that would better position it to compete with Chipotle and other “fast casual” restaurants. It also plans to slash $200m-$300m in spending and open fewer restaurants this year.Customers want to understand the source to make sure they know what’s in it, where it came from and the integrity of the sourcesMr Thompson’s plans add up to a radical departure from the basic McDonald’s formula, with changes to its menus, stores, customer service and technology. It is also taking on negative perceptions about its ingredients with an advertising campaign that gives customers a chance to ask what goes into McDonald’s food. The question is whether these changes will be enough to transform the quintessential American burger chain in the face of a major shift within the US restaurant industry.So-called fast casual restaurants are marketed as healthier alternatives to traditional fast food, serving fresher ingredients that are often organic or locally sourced. But fresher may not always mean healthier: a Chipotle burrito with chicken, white rice, pinto beans, cheese, guacamole and salsa contains 1,100 calories – 60 more than in a Big Mac and large fries. But the segment is growing at 9-10 per cent a year, compared with 2-3 per cent for traditional fast food chains, according to food consultancy Technomic.Because fast casual customers tend to have higher incomes than fast food consumers, there is debate about whether Chipotle and other such chains are stealing McDonald’s customers. But there is no doubt that they are having a significant impact on the way traditional players do business.Yum Brands, which operates the KFC and Pizza Hut chains, has launched fast casual taco and Vietnamese sandwich joints, along with adding a gourmet menu at its Taco Bell restaurants. Wendy’s popular Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger is a clear play for those dollars, and the chain has launched prototype fast casual outlets in recent years.As US consumers have become more concerned about the obesity epidemic – and more critical of the food industry’s contribution to it – beverage, snack and restaurant companies have all moved toward offering more healthy options. McDonald’s has added salads and apple slices to its menu, but these changes have done little to stem slumping sales.The company has also become a focal point in the debate over pay inequality and the minimum wage, with a study by the pro-labour National Employment Law Project stating that about 700,000 McDonald’s employees receive roughly $1.2bn in annual public assistance.When Mr Thompson succeeded Jim Skinner as chief executive in June 2012, there were signs that the company’s nearly decade-long streak of same-store sales growth was coming to an end. But few expected the company to hit the wall quite so hard.“He came out at a critical inflection point in the restaurant sector, at the same point when fast casual was really taking off,” says RJ Hottovy, analyst at Morningstar. “You had consumer preferences changing quite quickly.”I don’t trust the ingredients, I don’t trust the way I imagine they put together their food, with chemists in a lab getting the taste and smell just rightMr Hottovy says the company’s response has been “a series of missteps”, including the introduction of many new menu items, which has been blamed for confusing customers, and deep discounting that has infuriated franchisees already coping with thin margins. Ultimately, Mr Hottovy says, the company has been caught flat-footed by a dramatic shift in consumer tastes.Among these shifts is the emergence of a new generation of burger chains. Fast-growing Smashburger, Umami Burger and Elevation thrive by offering organic ingredients including arugula (rocket salad), mushrooms and chipotle lime aioli. The family-owned Five Guys has grown to more than 1,000 outlets by offering customisable burgers that are far from healthy, but succeeds by promoting its fresh ground beef and pure peanut oil.McDonald’s is responding by expanding a test programme at four locations in southern California that give customers greater choice in their burger toppings. Using a touchscreen, they can select from 22 options, including caramelised onions, bacon and grilled mushrooms.All of the chain’s plans are good “in theory”, says Mr Hottovy. “But we’ve been promised a lot of things the last couple years by this management team and haven’t seen follow-through.”If the customisation programme expands, it would herald a significant change to the McDonald’s model, which has made reliability and uniformity its stock-in-trade.The McDonald’s formula was codified in 1958 when Fred Turner – the protégé of founder Ray Kroc, whom he later replaced as chief executive – wrote the company’s operating manual that remains the blueprint on which its restaurants run. It dictates there can be no more than six patties on the grill at a time and that fries can be no thicker than 0.28 inches. There are two pickles on every Big Mac, Double Cheeseburger, McDouble and Quarter Pounder with Cheese, one pickle on a regular burger or cheeseburger, none on a Filet-O-Fish and three on the Angus Deluxe, Angus Bacon & Cheese and the Angus Mushroom & Swiss.Departing from the formula by allowing customers more choice in their burger toppings could solve another problem: it could help alleviate suspicions about what goes into them.McDonald’s is also trying to attack the negative perceptions about its ingredients with a new marketing campaign entitled “Our food. Your Questions”.“Customers . . . want to understand the source of the origin to make sure they know what’s in it and where it came from and the integrity of the sources,” Mr Thompson said this week.The top consumer-submitted questions on its homepage speak to the scale of the challenges McDonald’s must overcome: “Is the McRib made from real pork?”, “Is ‘pink slime’ [a meat-based additive] in a Chicken McNugget?”, “Why doesn’t your food rot?”, “Are there worms in your beef?”, “Do you make your fries with real potatoes?”Bob Goldin, an analyst at Technomic, says it will be tough to change perceptions. “I think there are a lot of questions about the integrity of the food and the quality of the ingredients on the part of consumers,” Mr Goldin says. “McDonald’s is trying to say ‘we use whole-muscle meat and real milk’, but I don’t know if that resonates.“So much of it is fried and heavily breaded and I think that almost goes against the perception of good quality,” he adds. “If Chipotle fried up everything they serve would they have that reputation of food with integrity?”

Brands;2014-10-08T15:27:58Z;Yum Brands: a fowl result;This year’s problems are not the first of this type – and are unlikely to be the last;"From handbags to chicken nuggets, the mighty Chinese consumer seems to be experiencing a hiatus. Latest to fall foul of this trend is Yum Brands – owner of names including Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut. Its third-quarter earnings were resilient, but it cut the full-year growth outlook in half. The culprit is China.The market has salivated over Yum’s China business for much of the past decade. And with good reason: the country has grown to account for half of sales, from around one-tenth a decade ago. Sales outside the US and China have been flat; the US has been on a steady decline. So last year the whole company’s top line stalled as China flattened.Despite all this growth, operating margins in China have been on a steady decline, from 18 per cent in 2009 to 11 per cent last year. US margins have gone the other way: up 9 percentage points to 23 per cent. Comparisons for the third quarter are harder to produce. The company changed its reporting from a purely geographical basis to a mix of geography and brands last year.The slide in China is unsurprising. Yum is not alone in its pursuit of the Chinese consumer. Competition has forced up costs and put pressure on a fragmented supply chain already inadequately policed. And so, in July, one of Yum’s meat suppliers was exposed selling out-of-date and dirty product. The impact has been severe. Third-quarter same-store revenues fell 14 per cent and margins dropped nearly 5 percentage points year on year. The company blamed loss of scale efficiencies, as well as write-offs of inventory.Yum thinks that the effects will wear off after six to nine months, based on previous experience. But this is part of the problem. China food scares are all too frequent. The company had similar scandals in 2005 and 2013.Even now, the brand may recover. But the latest scandal has emphasised the company’s big overseas weakness: lack of supply chain control. Should this indigestion keep repeating, low margins may move from being one-off to structural.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex"

Brands;2014-10-08T09:31:54Z;China food scandal hits Yum Brand sales;KFC owner blames safety scare for cut to full-year profit forecast;The food safety scandal that has hit fast-food chains in China and Japan has dented third-quarter sales at Yum Brands, prompting the KFC and Pizza Hut owner to cut its full-year profit forecast.Yum said that same-store sales in its Chinese mainland restaurants fell 14 per cent between June and September year-on-year, which the group blamed on “adverse publicity in July surrounding improper food handling practices by a former supplier”.Along with the likes of McDonald’s, Yum has been one of was one of several foreign fast-food brands to have been tainted by food safety issues in the country.Shanghai’s food safety watchdog in July launched an investigation into a meat and poultry processor after an undercover investigation by a local television station found the company to be putting new labels on expired meat, among other food safety violations.KFC and McDonald’s, both of which used the US-owned meat processor to supply their Shanghai outlets, subsequently apologised to their Chinese customers. China accounted for 35 per cent of Yum’s total operating profit in 2013.Kentucky-based Yum said that publicity over the supplier, a subsidiary of US-based OSI, had hit sales at its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in China – in spite of the fact that OSI was not a big supplier to these brands.“This triggered extensive news coverage in China that has shaken consumer confidence and impacted brand usage,” Yum said. “Even though OSI was a minor supplier, sales at KFC and Pizza Hut were disproportionately impacted given our category-leading positions.”Margin’s at Yum’s China restaurant division fell by nearly 5 percentage points year-on-year to about 15 per cent in the third quarter, the company said.Uncertainties in China prompted Yum to cut its forecast for 2014 earnings per share growth from 20 per cent to 6-10 per cent.“It is difficult to confidently forecast the exact trajectory of China sales,” the company said, adding “in our experience, sales typically take six to nine months to recover from these types of events”.Yum said same-store mainland sales have begun to improve but are still negative and the new EPS forecast was based on the assumption that they would remain negative for the fourth quarter.David Novak, chairman and chief executive, said Yum expected to open “at least 700” new restaurants in China this year, in spite the bad publicity. Yum has more than 6,400 restaurants in China – 4,600 of them KFCs.Some 18 months ago, Yum’s sales in China were hurt by a previous food quality scandal ago involving excessive use of antibiotics at a chicken supplier.Gao Jianfeng, fast-food analyst with Shanghai-based Bogo Consultants, said: “Yum has encountered such scandals so frequently in recent years that the impact (of the latest headlines) has been magnified.”“The scandal exposed fundamental management loopholes that are different from problems with a single batch of products,” he said.Additional reporting by Zhang Yan

The company has been buoyed by an optimistic analyst community.Three-fourths of analysts who cover the company recommend Mobileye a buy, according to data from Bloomberg.Shares in the company climbed 7 per cent to $56.60, taking its advance since its debut this year to more than 52 per cent.McDonald’s said on Tuesday that the safety scare at one of its suppliers in China will cost the company between 15 cents and 20 cents a share in the quarter because of lost sales and the costs of “recovery efforts”.Sales in Asia-Pacific were down 14.5 per cent in August from a year earlier.The safety scare in China, which also struck Yum Brands, adds to headaches for chief executive Don Thompson.Sales in the US continued to fall last month, McDonald’s said. Same-store sales declined 2.8 per cent in the country, adding to a 3.7 per cent drop in comparable sales globally.McDonald’s shares fell 2 per cent to $91.09 while rival Burger King declined 1 per cent to $31.85 and Yum slipped less than 1 per cent to $72.07.Organic food company Annie’s soared 38 per cent to $46.10 after it said General Mills would purchase the company for $46 a share.The deal, worth $820m, is expected to close later this year. Executives with Annie’s said the combination would allow it to expand its reach and increase efficiency.General Mills shares fell less than a per cent to $53.17.Home Depot confirmed that its payment data systems were breached, leaving customers who shopped at US and Canadian stores potentially exposed.Home Depot, whose shares have dropped since disclosing last week that it was investigating a possible breach, said on Monday that it will offer card monitoring services to anyone who used a payment card at a Home Depot store from April.The company’s shares fell 2 per cent to $88.93.Barnes & Noble, the US books retailer, climbed 3 per cent to $24.09 on Tuesday – its highest level since 2009 – after it said its quarterly loss was narrower than Wall Street expectations.The company reported a loss of $28.4m, or 56 cents a share, on revenues of $1.2bn. Analysts had forecast a loss of 63 cents per share.Same-store book sales, which exclude the Nook, fell 0.4 per cent in the quarter from a year ago.The figure was better than the 1.9 per cent decline recorded in the prior quarter, when severe winter weather crimped February traffic.Overall, US equity markets slipped on Tuesday ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting. The S&P 500 declined 0.7 per cent to 1,988.44 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 17,013.87.

69;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-08-22T08:47:57Z;Fast food faces indigestion in China amid rapid expansion;;"One month after the expired-meat scandal that dented the sales and reputation of western fast food in China, office worker Arthur Han contentedly chews his burger and proclaims that now is the best time to eat at McDonald’s in China – while the heat is still on from the food safety authorities.Mr Han says he does not normally eat at the US burger chain, whose brand image for cleanliness and quality was shaken last month by an undercover television investigation that accused it and several other western fast-food companies including Yum Brands and Burger King of using a mainland supplier that relabelled expired meat.In a country where food safety is one of the biggest political issues, the $200bn fast-food industry has been propelled again into the spotlight. The latest issue comes as the rapidly growing sector is grappling with a host of other issues. These include escalating competition from local players; rising rents; labour shortages – and the fundamental difficulty of procuring safe supplies in a market that is both fragmented and growing rapidly.McDonald’s said this month that the scandal – which led Shanghai authorities to close down the affected factory of Shanghai Husi Food Co, a subsidiary of US food group OSI, and detain staff – initially had a “significant negative impact” on sales, though it could not estimate the outcome for the full year.Yum said its brands KFC and Pizza Hut also saw sales drop initially, adding that if the decline persists it could have a “material effect” on full-year earnings per share. But analysts say that, whatever the impact on western brands, it is unlikely local players will be able to mop up the leftovers.Food safety “is not just something that affects McDonald’s and KFC, they are just the best known”, says Torsten Stocker, partner at consulting firm AT Kearney. “If it’s a problem they are facing, why would others be any different?”Many diners seem to realise that western brands are not the only ones with a problem: one young office worker eating lunch at a local fast-food outlet this week displayed a length of wire that he had just pulled out of his meal and told the Financial Times that the only solution was to “ignore it”.That, say observers, speaks to the issue of suppliers. Most of China’s half a million food processors are far too small or unsophisticated to serve enormous and exacting clients such as the foreign chains.Analysts say suppliers have failed to keep up with expansion in the sector, with companies such as Dicos increasing its restaurant numbers by 40 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with last year, to 2,200 stores.Hence a string of scandals have shaken the faith of China’s twenty- and thirtysomething white-collar workers. Brands such as Yum’s KFC in particular have been hit by one highly publicised supplier scandal after another; Yum sales had just begun to recover from a 2012 scare over antibiotics in chicken, when the expired-meat scandal broke last month.A fundamental shift towards healthier Chinese-style cooking is redefining the industry, and consequently propelling domestic chains to challenge foreign evadersAnd problems with food quality have also coincided with other trends that have challenged western fast-food brands, industry analysts say.“Fast-food consumers in China have shifted away from their original curiosity about western fast food, and nowadays they are pickier and more focused on health,” says Shi Jun, catering industry analyst at Beijing-based Alliance PKU Management.“Twenty years ago, a McDonald’s or a KFC might have been one of the few locations in some towns that had air conditioning and a clean bathroom, but now there are lots more alternatives; competition has greatly increased,” says Shaun Rein, of China Market Research Group in Shanghai.KFC remains far and away the market leader with 4,600 outlets, more than double the 2,000 McDonald’s. But Dicos – a Taiwanese-owned fast-food chain strongest in lower-tier cities, with cheaper menus – recently eclipsed the US burger chain with 2,200 stores. It plans to have nearly 3,000 by the end of the year.Private equity investors have backed a plethora of local fast-food chains, which are slowly building market share in the highly fragmented Chinese market, offering food that is closer to local tastes and marketing themselves as healthier. One such is Actis, which invested in a local hotpot chain, Xiabu Xiabu.This is driving consumer choice in fast food, according to Mintel. The research company says: “A fundamental shift towards healthier Chinese-style cooking is redefining the fast-food industry, and consequently propelling domestic fast-food chains to challenge the foreign fast-food leaders.”Mr Han, at the McDonald’s diner, says that if he had the time, he would definitely eat Chinese. But the fast-food industry is counting on the fact that in China – as in other markets – people will continue to be pressed for time. With a rapidly growing market that still, for all its problems, generates net margins of 15-20 per cent, fast-food operators have little intention of throwing in the towel.Additional reporting by Zhang Yan"
70;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-08-08T16:21:35Z;McDonald’s investors lose their appetite;;McDonald’s shares remained under pressure after the world’s largest fast-food chain detailed the fallout from a food safety scare in China, which has significantly depressed sales in the region.The company, and rival Yum Brands, have been felled by an undercover news report that depicted food safety lapses at Shanghai Husi, a division of OSI that supplies the two companies in China, where employees were alleged to re-label expired meat.McDonald’s reported on Friday that in July same-store sales in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and African markets fell 7.3 per cent, far worse than the 0.2 per cent decline Wall Street expected. The division represents roughly 10 per cent of McDonald’s overall sales.The fast-food chain’s US division did not fare much better, with same-store sales down 3.2 per cent compared to a year earlier.The figures underline the challenges the world’s largest restaurant group, like many fast-food chains, faces as its key low-income consumers struggle to recover from the financial crisis.Mark Kalinowski, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, said the July results indicated McDonald’s could report its first full-year of same-store sales declines since 2002.“As best as we can tell, they were the worst worldwide month in the last 10 years, once trading-day adjustments are taken into account,” Mr Kalinowski said. “McDonald’s also commented to no longer expect “relatively flat” same-store sales for the full-year worldwide.”McDonald’s shares fell less than 1 per cent to $93.48, taking its losses this year to 5 per cent. The broader Russell 3000 Restaurant index has fallen 3 per cent over the same period.Gap was among the leaders on the benchmark S&P 500 after the retailer reported same-store sales ahead of Wall Street forecasts, as the company’s turnround takes hold.The company said global same-store sales rose 2 per cent, compared with consensus forecasts for a 0.5 per cent gain. Gap expects to earn between 68 and 69 cents per share in the second quarter, when excluding certain gains.Analysts with Sterne Agee said the results, which were aided by sales of clearance merchandise, demonstrated “improving fundamentals”.“Although the Gap brand remained negative, -2 per cent, this was a significant improvement from June’s -7 per cent and was the brand’s second best performance this year,” Ike Boruchow, of Sterne Agee, said. “Importantly, new fall product hits stores later this month.”Mr Boruchow raised his price target to $48 from $46 and lifted his 2014 and 2015 full-year profit forecasts.Gap shares climbed 6 per cent to $42.57. Rival Guess advanced 2 per cent to $26.65 while PVH, the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, rose 4 per cent to $114.43.Shares in San Francisco-based game-maker Zynga fell 1 per cent to $2.88 after slipping into a 14-month low earlier in the day on news the company missed Wall Street expectations for its second-quarter results. Zynga reported bookings of $175m, below forecasts for $191m, while revenue dropped by a third compared with the same quarter last year.Zynga’s price has fallen steadily in recent months, sliding from $5.50 in March to below $3 in August, as investors questioned the company’s ability to develop new content.Monster Beverage Corp’s stock rose 7 per cent to $69.45 as the company beat earnings estimates, although it disappointed on net sales.The California energy drink company reported on Thursday that earnings per share rose by 32 per cent to 84 cents, exceeding analyst expectations of 75 cents. Monster’s stock has dropped by 7 per cent over the past month as investors anticipated weak second-quarter results, but RBC Capital Markets and JPMorgan raised their price targets for the company in the aftermath of the positive report.Shares in Nvidia rose 9 per cent to $19.00 after at least seven analysts raised their target prices on the company following its strong earnings report released on Thursday.The graphic chipmaker posted a 33 per cent increase in earnings during the quarter ended July 27, and forecast revenue for the current quarter at $1.2bn, above analysts’ expectations.Driven by strong PC sales, net income during the quarter ended July 27 reached $128m, or 22 cents per share, up from $96m, 16 cents per share, last year.Overall US equities were stronger on Friday after choppy trading over the week. The S&P 500 rose 1.2 per cent to 1,931.59 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 16,553.93. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8 per cent to 4,370.90.
71;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-07-31T16:11:12Z;Yum leads S&P 500 fast food sector lower;;Fast-food chain shares were blunted on Thursday after one of the sector’s largest restaurant operators warned it had seen “significant” deterioration in Chinese sales amid a new food safety scare.Yum, the Kentucky-based operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, said that an undercover July news report has had a “significant, negative impact to same-store sales at both KFC and Pizza Hut in China over the past 10 days”.The report depicted food safety lapses at Shanghai Husi, a division of OSI that supplies Yum and McDonald’s in China, where employees were alleged to relabel expired meat.Yum, which had recently recovered after a year of sales weakness in China relating to a separate 2012 food safety scare, said it was “too early” to know when sales would rebound.“If the significant sales impact is sustained, it will have a material effect on full-year earnings per share,” the company said in a statement. Yum said it no longer purchases products from Shanghai Husi.Analysts with Wells Fargo and RBC cut earnings targets for 2014 and 2015, as China represents an outsized share of overall Yum sales compared to other markets.“With the current meat supply issue receiving widespread media coverage, we expect the consumer response to most closely resemble that of the 2013 antibiotic issue – meaning KFC and Pizza Hut are likely to see a shortlived, but meaningful, same-store sales hit,” Jeff Farmer, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said.Shares of Yum declined almost 5 per cent to close at $69.40, McDonald’s fell 1.45 per cent to $94.56 and Starbucks, which has more than 1,000 stores in China, dipped 1.55 per cent to $77.68. Burger King Worldwide shares declined just short of 1 per cent to end the day at $26.38.Whole Foods was under pressure after third quarter same-store sales fell short of expectations and the grocer cut its full-year earnings guidance.The Austin, Texas-based company lowered the top end of its full-year outlook, following three previous cuts to guidance. It now sees 2014 earnings per share in a range of $1.52 to $1.54, compared to a range of $1.52 to $1.56 earlier.Whole Foods forecast full-year revenue growth between 9.6 and 9.9 per cent, compared to earlier expectations as high as 11 per cent.The company also said same-store sales rose 3.9 per cent from a year earlier, shy of Wall Street estimates for a 4.8 per cent gain.“With comps running well below 6 per cent long-term goals, we believe valuation will remain under pressure,” Mark Wiltamuth, an analysts with Jefferies, said. Mr Wiltamuth lowered his price target on the company to $41 from $46.Whole Foods shares fell 2.28 per cent to $38.22. Rival grocers declined on the figures. Fresh Market slipped 2.5 per cent to $29.93, Kroger slid 1.51 per cent to $49.98 and Sprouts Farmers Market dipped 2.8 per cent to end at $30.51.US defence contractor L-3 Communications led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 after the company said it was conducting an investigation into alleged misconduct that led to overstatements of sales and income at its aerospace division.The company, which makes communications systems used in drones and aircraft carriers, said that contract cost over-runs had been “inappropriately deferred” and net sales were overstated.“The company believes that the amounts associated with these adjustments are the result of misconduct and accounting errors at the Aerospace Systems segment,” the company said in a statement. “The misconduct included concealment from L-3’s Corporate staff and external auditors.”L-3 shares declined 12.27 per cent to $104.96.Synchrony Financial, the North American store credit business partially floated by General Electric, edged higher on its debut on Thursday, despite broad declines in US equity markets. Shares rose as much as 1 per cent to $24 before paring gains. Synchrony priced 125m shares at $23, the bottom of its $23-$26 range.Overall, investors sold off US equity positions. The S&P 500 fell 2 per cent to close at 1,930.67 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.88 per cent to 16,563.3.

72;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-07-29T22:12:19Z;US labour regulator deals blow to McDonald's;;A top US labour regulator has told McDonald’s it is jointly responsible for working conditions at its franchisees’ restaurants, a decision that if upheld could deal a blow to the long-running fast food franchise model.The National Labor Relations Board said on Tuesday it would name McDonald’s a “joint employer” with its franchisees in legitimate employee complaints, a decision that could mean the burger chain is liable for unfair labour practices at its over 14,000 US restaurants. Roughly 90 per cent of the chain’s US outlets are owned by franchisees.The board said it had found that 43 of the 181 labour practice complaints filed against the world’s largest restaurant group since November 2012 had merit. McDonald’s, which has vowed to contest the decision, could be included as a joint employer in each complaint.The news comes as fast food workers throughout the country rally for union rights and a $15 minimum wage. McDonald’s has consistently argued that its 3,000 franchisees – and not the parent company – set wages and are responsible for working conditions, a position that could become more difficult to hold if the decision is upheld.McDonald’s said it “believes that this decision changes the rules for thousands of small businesses, and goes against decades of established law regarding the franchise model in the United States”.Steve Caldeira, chief executive of the International Franchise Association, said the decision “would upend years of federal and state legal precedent” and “would be a devastating blow to the franchise business and franchise model”.Many large fast food companies, including Yum Brands and Burger King, use the franchise system, which allows them to keep costs down while collecting royalties and fees from franchisees.Fast Food Forward, the workers’ group that is organising for unionisation and a $15 wage, said the ruling “carries widespread implications for the fast food industry”.“Despite McDonald’s repeated assertions that it does not control employment decisions at its franchised restaurants, the NLRB . . . [said the] company is indeed an employer that exerts substantial power over its employees’ working conditions,” the workers’ group said.The news comes months after McDonald’s became the subject of class-action lawsuits in three states by employees who accuse it and its franchisees of systematic wage theft.The suits allege McDonald’s and its franchisees illegally underpaid employees by forcing them to work “off the clock”, not paying overtime and deleting hours from their timecards.
73;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-07-25T14:01:20Z;Rapid China expansion comes back to bite western food chains;;"The footage is grainy and dull, the hidden camera jerky, but the image of the light pink meat falling on the floor and being tossed back into the processor’s maw is vivid enough.An undercover investigation by Dragon TV of unhygienic practices and relabelling of expired meat has led to the closure of a giant meat processing plant near Shanghai that supplied KFC, McDonald’s and Starbucks in eastern China and Japan.Such food safety scandals occur regularly in China, but this one was different.The plant in question was US-owned and its clients were the foreign brands that attract Chinese consumers in part because they are usually trusted to have higher standards.OSI Group, the privately held Illinois-based meat processor whose Shanghai plant is accused of relabelling expired meat amid other systemic violations, apologised and said on its website it would “not try to defend it or explain it”.For the western restaurant chains, the scandal is embarrassing, but there was at least one warning sign.In a labour dispute that OSI’s Shanghai branch won last year, a plaintiff seeking medical compensation for exposure to chlorine said in court that he had objected to the practice of relabelling expired meat. “He never brought up the issue when he was in the company, and I don’t think it’s appropriate to him to mention that in court. He didn’t have evidence,” said Xia Yugang, the lawyer representing the company in the case.KFC’s success has inspired McDonald’s to adapt its standardised US fare to Chinese tastes by including more chicken-based products. This has pushed up demand for chicken raised by the industrial farms springing up around the country as China moves away from small-scale village agricultureSee belowEven so, partners like OSI are so important to the rapid expansion in China of western restaurant chains that they cannot be easily replaced.Some US chains have grown by leaps and bounds in the country, opening hundreds of stores annually and enjoying profit margins of more than 20 per cent for many years running.To offer standardised products on a massive scale, they created supply chains from scratch or relied on established US partners, making the food safety violations in Shanghai more an American problem than a Chinese one.China accounts for more than half the revenues of Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, and few western firms have bet as much on the country as has the Kentucky-based company. Yum is the largest western restaurant operator in China with nearly 6,400 outlets, while McDonald’s has about 2,000 restaurants and plans to open 300 more this year.China “is vital for a company like Yum and it’s very important for a company like McDonald’s – it’s an area that they’ve invested quite heavily in,” says RJ Hottovy, analyst at Morningstar.The stock market rewarded KFC’s aggressive strategy. Analysts recommended Yum stock as a proxy for China growth and pummelled McDonald’s for failing to match KFC’s success in rolling out new products with Chinese flavour.Paradoxically, supply chain worries contributed to KFC’s rapid expansion, according to Warren Liu, who oversaw its China business development from 1997 to 2000. The company feared the burgeoning fast food sector would quickly outpace China’s ability to provide raw materials, as well as labour and prime locations.Most of China’s half a million food processors are far too small or unsophisticated to serve enormous and exacting clients like the foreign chains.As the first chain to enter a province, KFC could rent prime locations, pin down government approvals and secure supply sources before anyone else got to them, Mr Liu writes in his book KFC in China: The Secret Recipe for Success.Expanding supermarkets and fast-food chains provided an opening for American cold storage, logistics and food processing companies to move into China, much as US carmakers investing overseas bring along suppliers they have worked with for decades.Barry Friends, of food consultancy Technomic, says companies like Yum and McDonald’s “basically go to Asia and try to replicate their US operations – with the exception of the use of local labour”.OSI is a prime example. In the 1970s, the Otto family brought in Sheldon Lavin, a financier, to help expand their meat processing business amid increased demand from McDonald’s in the US. Mr Lavin eventually bought out Mr Otto and his two sons and became full owner and chief executive. When McDonald’s entered China in the 1990s, OSI came along. McDonald’s has said it is sticking with its long-term supplier on both continents.Fast-food chains basically go to Asia and try to replicate their US operations – with the exception of the use of local labourMr Lavin’s connection with McDonald’s runs so deep that he is a trustee for its flagship Ronald McDonald House charity, which helps house the families of hospitalised children.OSI now processes 300m chickens a year in China, about 3 per cent of the country’s total.While McDonald’s imported its US network, KFC developed a local supply chain by working with its state-owned Chinese partners – many of which had existing, if rudimentary, logistics operations, says Mr Liu.KFC now has 650 suppliers in China and owns most of its distribution system. This gives it more flexibility than McDonald’s, which prefers a stable of dedicated suppliers. That approach can make KFC’s supply chains harder to oversee.Over time, the two rivals’ strategies have converged: “Due to fast growth and rapidly rising product volume demand, also as a risk-management measure to diversify sourcing risk, both brands have crossed into each other’s original supply base: [McDonald’s is] buying from local suppliers and KFC buying from imported suppliers such as OSI,” Mr Liu says.A spokesperson said: “Even if we begin with imports, McDonald’s always tries to also introduce local suppliers if they can meet our quality and food safety screens.”As OSI developed in China, ploughing $750m into processing plants across the country since the 1990s, it acquired other clients. Its now-troubled Shanghai plant and another in Kunming were set up in 2008 to serve KFC.McDonald’s Japan, which sourced about a fifth of its McNuggets from OSI’s Shanghai plant, has since declared it will stop buying any McNuggets from low-cost China.Food industry experts say better auditing of the entire supply chain and better margins for suppliers could help prevent violations.The temptation for suppliers with too much stock is to find a way to sell it, legally or otherwise, to avoid a loss, experts say. Frozen food that is only a few days past its expiration date is very difficult to detect.The safety experts advocate tracing products to their source and better monitoring of what happens to expired or discarded food. Other weak links include the logistics companies delivering food from factory to restaurant, and regulators with cozy ties to the factories they oversee.Sebastien Breteau, founder of AsiaInspection, which counts a major fast-food chain among its clients, says: “In the food industry a lot of people still have the attitude of ‘not seen, not caught’.”Additional reporting by Owen Guo, Christian Shepherd and Jennifer ThompsonSuppliers struggle to meet KFC’s voracious appetiteThe menu at KFC China doesn’t look quite like it does anywhere else in the world. It offers Peking Duck-inspired chicken rolls, congee (rice porridge) and fried dough sticks, writes Lucy Hornby, whose personal favourite is an egg custard pastry.KFC’s success has inspired McDonald’s to adapt its standardised US fare to Chinese tastes by including more chicken-based products.All that has pushed up demand for chicken raised by the industrial farms springing up around the country as China moves away from small-scale village agriculture.KFC buys about one-quarter of all the chickens raised in China, a KFC purchasing manager told a potential supplier a few years ago. Before that, KFC management lamented that regional centres were bidding against each other, driving up the cost of the birds.KFC gets meat and vegetables from foreign-run farms and from the few Chinese companies capable of producing food on an industrial scale. But sometimes its demand is more than its suppliers can produce.In late 2012, China’s largest poultry producer Liuhe was revealed to be meeting its contract with chickens sourced from smaller local farms that were injecting poultry with excessive amounts of antibiotics. The revelations sent KFC’s same-store sales down 20 per cent in the first quarter of 2013.That was only one of KFC’s public quality embarrassments. In 2005, it blamed an unnamed supplier for using the cancer-causing Sudan I red dye in New Orleans roast chicken wings; that same year two Chinese media reports surfaced of KFC restaurants selling products that had passed their expiration date, according to Warren Liu’s book, KFC in China.KFC requires chickens of a standard 2.5kg, so it can typically only accept a fifth of the birds from any given industrial farm, thus increasing the difficulty of simply switching suppliers if a problem crops up.“McNuggets are easy to replace because they can be frozen for a year. You could fly a 747 in; it’s the same nuggets, same price,” says one food industry veteran.Other products are harder to substitute: “The thighs are tougher to replace.

Brands;2014-07-22T17:07:16Z;Chipotle outpaces rivals on strong sales;Results contrast with those from McDonald’s;Chipotle continued to outpace rivals in the fast food sector, reporting strong gains in same store sales as peers including McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell fail to ignite consumer interest.Profits at the chain known for its steak and barbacoa tacos climbed 26 per cent to $110.3m, or $3.50 a share, in the quarter to June 30. Sales climbed 29 per cent to $1.05bn as same-store sales rose 17.3 per cent.Analysts on Wall Street had expected profits of $3.09 a share from sales of $990m.The results contrasted with those from McDonald’s, which once again saw tepid demand in the US for its burgers and fries. Same-store sales at the company’s US outlets declined 1.5 per cent in the quarter, a steeper dip than analysts expected.While McDonald’s has continued to focus its strategy around lower cost items through its dollar menu, executives at Chipotle have lifted prices at the chain’s 1,600 restaurants since April, a decision they argue has offset rising food inflation.The move received little push back from Chipotle’s fervent following and the company now expects same-store sales to increase by a “mid-teens” percentage over the remainder of this year.“We continue to believe Chipotle [is] the best growth story in restaurants,” Jeffrey Bernstein, an analyst with Barclays, said. “With most restaurants struggling to drive positive traffic, Chipotle remains an anomaly, justifying an outsized valuation.”Shares in the Mexican restaurant chain soared 12 per cent to $659.77 on the news, while McDonald’s retreated 1 per cent to $96.27. Taco Bell owner Yum Brands advanced 1 per cent to $74.84.Harley-Davidson led the benchmark S&P 500 lower on Tuesday after the company cut its outlook for full-year shipments.The motorcycle maker now forecasts a 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent rise in shipments this year compared to 2013. In April, it had predicted growth of between 7 and 9 per cent.The company pinned the blame on poor weather and a lull in sales of one of its models before the release of a new version later this year.Harley-Davidson shares fell 5 per cent at $63.46.Profits at Coca-Cola, the world’s biggest soft drinks maker, slipped in the second quarter as sales in the US failed to lift off.The company said net income fell 3 per cent to $2.6bn, or 58 cents a share, in the quarter to the end of June. Revenues were also under pressure, falling to $12.6bn from $12.7bn.Coca-Cola, which built its brand and fortune selling the world fizzy drinks, is grappling with a US market that is losing its taste for sugary drinks.The company said Coca-Cola volumes in North America edged up 1 per cent in the quarter, while overall sales in the region were flat.Shares in the company fell 3 per cent to $41.19 while rival PepsiCo declined 1 per cent to $89.17.Crocs, the struggling maker of colourful plastic clogs that were ubiquitous a decade ago, announced it will close or convert up to 100 of its stores and lay off 183 employees.The closures are expected to save $4m in 2014 and $10m in 2015, as Crocs seeks to save cash and revive its business.Crocs announced the move along with second-quarter earnings that were ahead of Wall Street expectations. Shares of Crocs advanced 13 per cent to $16.72.Netflix shares dipped 5 per cent to $431.09 after the company said its international expansion would drive losses in the division higher.The company, which started in the US, has expanded aggressively across Europe and racked up losses of $712m abroad since 2012.The initial losses have not dented Netflix’s ambition beyond the US. It plans to add service in France and Germany this September. Analysts with Jefferies said the expansion would “pressure” the company’s margins.Overall, US equity markets rose after a report showed the sale of previously owned homes recovered more than expected and core inflation in the country eased.The S&P 500 advanced 0.5 per cent to 1,983.53, touching a new record high earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 17,113.54.

75;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-07-22T09:48:37Z;Foreign fast-food chains face China disruption;;Foreign fast-food chains in China could see their supply chains disrupted as authorities step up checks on a key meat supplier, following allegations that it was passing off expired products as fresh.China’s State Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday ordered checks on all eight mainland processing plants owned by Illinois-based OSI Group, after an undercover investigation by a local television station found that meat past its sell-by date was being relabelled as fresh in Shanghai.It also ordered checks on all clients of the Shanghai plant, Shanghai Husi Food, which has been closed by local regulators.The more extensive checks are so far limited to OSI subsidiaries rather than China’s meat processing industry as a whole.OSI said it was “appalled” by the food safety issue and “sincerely apologised” to both its clients and any consumers affected. “Our company management believes this to be an isolated event,” it said.Starbucks on Tuesday joined Yum Brands’ KFC and Pizza Hut as well as McDonald’s in pulling products from the plant, although the US coffee chain said its only affected product was a chicken and apple panini sandwich. Ikea said on its Weibo account that it had previously sourced meat from Husi, but stopped last September.The Husi processing plant primarily supplied foreign fast-food chains in Shanghai and the surrounding region, but it also provided McDonald’s in Japan with about one-fifth of its Chicken McNuggets. McDonald’s said it was re-routing McNuggets from other Chinese processing plants as well as from Thailand.Fast-food chains tend to rely on food processing companies that can supply standardised products at volume, making it difficult to switch suppliers at short notice.“A large company normally has more than one supplier, never just one. But the question is, can the alternates replace the volume that has been displaced? That’s where it gets tougher,” said Matthieu David of Daxue Consulting.Foreign fast-food chains generally have a better reputation among Chinese consumers than do their domestic rivals, but food safety is a constant concern as supply chains have had to scale up quickly while still meeting global standards.Many have tended to rely on foreign-owned processors in an effort to better control quality, especially in the wake of a 2008 scandal in which Chinese milk supplies were found to be deliberately contaminated with melamine, a chemical byproduct of coal, in an effort to fool quality tests.At least six babies died and 50,000 were hospitalised after drinking infant formula laced with melamine.

Brands;2014-07-21T17:09:53Z;Regional banks slip after BB&T setback;;Regional US banks were under pressure after BB&T missed Wall Street forecasts and said it would set aside reserves ahead of a Department of Housing and Urban Development audit.BB&T, the second-largest regional bank trailing only PNC Financial, said it built an $85m reserve in the period regarding its compliance with Federal Housing Administration requirements.The North Carolina-based bank said the department had not asserted any claims as of yet but that it had identified losses incurred by the FHA on defaulted loans ranging from $25m to $105m.“This has been an industry issue for many FHA originators, and we believe this is the appropriate course of action for BB&T,” chief executive Kelly King said.Ms King, speaking to analysts, added that it could be a “year and a half or so before we find out what the final determination is” regarding the inquiry.The announcement accompanied BB&T’s second-quarter results. Profits declined 22 per cent from a year earlier to $425m, or 58 cents per share. Excluding some expenses, the bank said its earnings per share would have been 70 cents, short of analyst expectations.The company blamed higher personnel expenses for the weaker than anticipated results.Nonetheless, the bank said it was aided by a 7.2 per cent rise in annualised loan activity from a quarter earlier, including a bump in commercial and industrial loans.The results weighed on the wider sector as BB&T shares slipped 4 per cent to $37.33, leading the benchmark S&P 500 lower. SunTrust Banks declined 1 per cent to $39.28, BankUnited slid 1 per cent to $32.30 and PNC remained unchanged by close of trading at $83.88.Yum Brands, the operator of the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, declined after the Shanghai food safety watchdog said it had closed a poultry processor that supplies some of its outlets.The move followed an undercover investigation by a local television station that found the processor to be putting new labels on expired meat, among other safety violations.KFC and McDonald’s, both of which used the US-owned meat processor to supply their Shanghai outlets, apologised to their Chinese customers.China remains central to Yum’s business, accounting for more than half of the company’s overall sales last year. Shares of Yum fell 4 per cent to $74.13 while McDonald’s slid 1 per cent to $97.55.Botox maker Allergan advanced 2 per cent to $171.14 after it said it would cut 1,500 jobs, or 13 per cent of its staff.A reduction in headcount comes during Allergan’s three-month, $50bn takeover battle with Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose takeover advances it has rebuffed since they were first made in April.Valeant, whose bid is supported by Allergan’s largest shareholder, Wall Street hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, has sought to portray Allergan as saddled with inefficiencies and having a bloated cost structure.Allergan described the cuts as part of an “ongoing effort to improve efficiency and productivity”.It will take a charge of between $375m and $425m to pay for severance costs. Valeant shares rose 3 per cent to $125.54.Toymaker Hasbro was under pressure after it missed Wall Street quarterly sales expectations, despite an 8 per cent rise in sales.The company said revenues were lifted by rising Marvel and Transformer toys, offset somewhat by a dip in game sales.Hasbro shares fell 3 per cent to $51.78 while rival Mattel declined 1 per cent to $35.96.Overall, equity markets trended lower as geopolitical tensions continued to ferment with US President Barack Obama calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to ensure that investigators have full access to the site of the Malaysia Airlines plane that crashed in Ukraine last week.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,973.63 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 0.3 per cent to 17,051.73.

77;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-07-21T09:04:34Z;McDonald’s and KFC hit by China food safety scandal;;A supplier to McDonald’s and KFC in China has been accused of supplying rotting meat to the fast-food chains and falsifying product expiration dates, in the latest food safety scandal to hit the country.It is also the latest blow to foreign fast food companies operating in the country, where promises of rapid growth – there are more than 4,400 KFC restaurants alone – are being undermined by food safety issues.The Shanghai food safety watchdog said on Monday it had closed a meat and poultry processor on the outskirts of the city after an undercover investigation by a local television station found the company to be putting new labels on expired meat, among other food safety violations.KFC and McDonald’s, both of which used the US-owned meat processor to supply their Shanghai outlets, apologised to their Chinese customers.Foreign food companies generally enjoy a better reputation among Chinese consumers than domestic competitors, but a series of local media exposes over the past several years have clouded that reputation.The most recent scare hits KFC, the fried chicken chain owned by Kentucky-based Yum Brands, just as it was recovering from a local investigation 18 months ago that found excessive antibiotic use by its poultry supplier. China accounted for 35 per cent of Yum’s total operating profit in 2013.“Once the news gets out it is going to be difficult for them to convince Chinese consumers that [KFC] can put the needed checks in place on their suppliers,” said Ben Cavendar, a Shanghai-based analyst at China Market Research Group.Food safety is a perennial issue for companies reliant in China upon supply chains that have had to quickly scale up while meeting international quality standards. But the processor involved in this case, Shanghai Husi Food, a subsidiary of Illinois-based OSI Group, has been in operation for almost two decades.“We are working with relevant government departments and an investigation is under way,” said an employee at the Husi plant in the Shanghai suburb of Jiading.OSI Group began supplying McDonald’s in China in the early 1990s, when the fast food group first ventured into the country only to discover that local supply chains did not exist.OSI operates eight meat or poultry processing plants in mainland China.In January, US retailer Walmart recalled “five spice” donkey meat sold in its stores in Jinan city in eastern China after it said tests found that the product contained fox DNA.Yum said it had launched an investigation into Husi and required all KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to seal up and cease using any meat from the supplier.“Food safety is the most important priority for us,” the company said. “We will not tolerate any violations of government laws and regulations from our suppliers.”McDonald's said it had suspended sourcing from the plant, and expected a temporary shortage in some items.KFC and McDonald’s restaurants in Beijing appeared to be as busy as usual, although some customers said they were sticking with chilled drinks for now.“What can you do?” sighed one mother, after purchasing a chicken burger for her son at a McDonald’s in an underground mall in Beijing. “You can only avoid the food for a while. As long as you don’t eat it on a regular basis, it should be fine.”Another hamburger muncher snarled: “Can you please not talk about this while I am eating?”Additional reporting by Owen Guo and Neil MunshiTwitter: @HornbyLucy
78;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-07-17T16:57:40Z;UnitedHealth climbs on surging sales;;US health insurance providers continued a year’s long ascent on Thursday as the country’s largest health insurer reported better than expected results, buoyed by healthcare reform.UnitedHealth, the Minnesota-based insurer, said sales jumped 7 per cent from a year earlier to $32.6bn, lifted by a surge in Medicaid enrolment linked to the Affordable Care Act.Profits at the company fell 2 per cent from the same period a year earlier to $1.4bn, or $1.42 per share. Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of $1.26 a share on sales of $32bn.The results are the latest to show the impact President Barack Obama’s signature law has had on the healthcare sector, lifting sales at hospitals and insurers as more consumers enrol in Medicaid or private health insurance purchased through an online exchange.Over the past year, 730,000 people have enrolled in Medicaid services offered by UnitedHealth, including 380,000 people in the second quarter.“We plan to grow next year as we expand our offerings to as many as two dozen state exchanges,” chief executive Stephen Hemsley said on a call with analysts. “This approach is consistent with our long stated plan to take a prudent first year position, and then build and expand in 2015 and 2016.”Analysts with Deutsche Bank called the results “solid”, particularly the “earnings beat from UnitedHealth’s Health Benefits business”.The industry broadly advanced following the company’s results. UnitedHealth shares climbed to all-time high by midday trading before paring back to $85.11 by close, a 2 per cent jump. Shares in WellPoint rose 1 per cent to $113.44, Humana jumped 3 per cent to $131.17 and Aetna increased 2 per cent to $83.68.SanDisk shares led the benchmark S&P 500 lower after the flash-memory producer forecast third quarter sales shy of Wall Street expectations.The company said it expected net revenues in the third quarter to range between $1.68bn and $1.73bn due to supply constraints in the second half of the year.Shares in the company sunk 14 per cent to $93.21, wiping nearly $3bn off the company’s market capitalisation.Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, who succeeded Steve Ballmer in early February, said the company would cut up to 18,000 jobs over the next year.In a memo to employees, Mr Nadella insisted the reductions, which will primarily impact the Nokia handset business, were “the first step to building the right organisation”.The shrinkage of Microsoft’s workforce is the single largest cull in the company’s history.“The headcount reduction related to the Nokia business indicates that Microsoft is not going to let Nokia become a potential ‘black hole’ of spend,” Kirk Materne, an analyst with Evercore, said.Shares of Microsoft rose 1 per cent to $44.53, its highest level since 2000.Yum shares tumbled 7 per cent to $77.01 after the company said its US business remained weak despite recent investments.The company behind the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, has ceded ground to rivals including Chipotle and Domino’s.Global sales rose 10 per cent from a year earlier to $3.2bn while profits increased 19 per cent to $334m, or 73 cents a share. Both figures matched analysts’ forecasts.“We are obviously disappointed with second-quarter results, particularly with the very poor performance in our US division,” chief executive David Novak said of Pizza Hut.Mr Novak said he now expected the unit’s full-year operating profits to fall “well short of our expectations”.Analysts with brokerage Jefferies said the domestic KFC business would also “continue to struggle” and commodity cost inflation would weigh on Yum’s margins.Mattel, which is best-known for its Fisher-Price and Barbie brands, reported a sharp drop in second-quarter profits on Thursday, with net income down 61 per cent from a year earlier to to $28.3m.With the exception of American Girl, Mattel’s key brands all sank in the quarter. Barbie sales were down 15 per cent, Fisher-Price fell 17 per cent and Hot Wheels slipped 2 per cent.The toy maker’s shares declined 7 per cent to $36.46.Overall, US equity markets declined after a Malaysian Airlines passenger flight crashed in Ukraine.The S&P 500 fell 1.2 per cent to 1,958.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9 per cent to 16,976.81.

79;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-07-10T17:41:02Z;Fish roe and cream-cheese crust: pizza, Hong Kong-style;;If the pineapple and ham combo on the standard Hawaiian is an aberration for the pizza purists of Naples and Rome, then how about clams and peaches, a flying fish roe and cream cheese stuffed crust, or pepperoni drizzled with a sweet berry and pomelo sauce?These recipes – all recent specials in Hong Kong’s chain of Pizza Hut restaurants – are not the work of a rogue chef but the result of company policy that gives local franchisees the freedom to take the basic menu and run with it.“It’s a bit weird but there’s no harm trying it,” says Gladys Tsim, a marketing manager for an insurer who eats at Pizza Hut once or twice a month. She particularly likes the pizzas that have thousand island dressing in place of tomato sauce, a popular option in Hong Kong. “I love it,” she says.In a city filled with eateries, Pizza Hut’s 38 sit-down outlets seek to offer “affordable luxury” to Hong Kong’s middle class diners. That helps explain its habit of adding upmarket ingredients such as scallops, crayfish and organic pumpkin to its pizzas. It even offers lobster bisque.There are certain “brand standards and core items” that make Pizza Hut what it is, says Kurt Kane, chief marketing and food innovation officer. But Pizza Hut, part of Yum Brands, the US restaurant group, also sees the “talk value” of the wilder and wackier menu options in some overseas outposts as helping to generate buzz in an often overcrowded marketplace.Pizza Hut’s Hong Kong operation, which is a partnership with Jardines, the local conglomerate, is one example where experimentation has bred business success.The company holds an annual three-day event to generate ideas, where chefs, managers and suppliers gather to plan the menu for the next 12-18 months, on the basis that a new headline-grabbing product must be launched every two months.Day two sees attendees mock up new items in play dough. Only on the final day do they head to the kitchen to test ideas. The best – about one in three – go through a further 15 months of testing before making it on to the menu, only to disappear a few weeks later.“I would not have a wild card on my table, because I don’t have room for risk”, says Richard Leong, chief executive of Pizza Hut Hong Kong.Some ideas may seem bizarre to those familiar with the Pizza Hut brand in the west but have been huge successes, such as the pizza shaped like a Chinese blossom, cheese fondue, or the current in-demand item – the fish roe stuffed crust.“In Hong Kong, people love Japanese food. They love sushi,” adds Mr Leong. “They can automatically relate to it.”Sometimes a Hong Kong original has been exported across the region, and even to the USMany creations get left on the cutting room floor, such as a Valentine’s day special dreamt up by one chef – a black squid ink pizza that could be set on fire at the dinner table.A key challenge is balancing innovation with what is kitchen-friendly. If a pizza takes too long to make, it does not matter how good it tastes.Sometimes a Hong Kong original has been exported across the region, and even to the US.Mr Leong and his team helped create the “Cheesy Opera Pizza” – a deep-pan pizza with a swirling stuffed crust but topped with yet another, thinner, crispy pizza.When they presented the idea to headquarters in Dallas, there were raised eyebrows, says Mr Leong. But it went on to be a hit across Asia.“The more creativity the better,” says Mr Kane, who believes that when bringing pizza into new markets it is important to give customers a “safe adventure”.Of course, not every experiment finds universal favour. Loyal fan Ms Tsim gave the recent Peking duck special pizza a definitive thumbs down. “I hated it,” she says, adding that the taste was too bizarre even for her.
80;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-07-09T16:40:57Z;Chipotle extends hot streak;;Chipotle Mexican Grill, the restaurant chain that has developed a fervent following across the US, climbed on Wednesday after brokerage Wunderlich Securities said recent price hikes by the chain have not blunted sales.Wunderlich analyst Robert Derrington said traffic trends were little changed by an average 5.5 per cent increase to prices, sending shares 3 per cent higher to $604.11.Mr Derrington now expects the company to report same-store sales growth of 11 per cent in the second quarter, compared to an earlier 8 per cent forecast.“Operators in various geographies we recently spoke with mentioned little if any pushback from customers, perhaps aided by the fact that the company hadn’t raised prices in almost three years,” Mr Derrington said.The restaurant chain, which began increasing prices in April, has likely completed the roll out across its 1,600 locations, he added.Chipotle executives blamed rising food inflation for the need to increase prices, including a 25 per cent jump in beef costs in April from the end of 2013.Wunderlich lifted its price target on Chipotle to $560 from $542 and reiterated its hold rating.The company’s shares, which have advanced 12 per cent since the year’s start, have outperformed much of the fast food sector, including those of McDonald’s, Yum Brands and Domino’s Pizza. Chipotle has mapped out an aggressive expansion over the current year, expecting to open as many as 195 new restaurants.Since the year’s start, the Russell 3000 restaurant index – which includes the largest US restaurants and holds a market capitalisation totalling $286bn – has risen 3 per cent.Garmin shares led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 after Pacific Crest Securities lowered its rating to underperform from sector perform as inventory of its new vivofit fitness band accumulates.Analysts with Pacific Crest said Wall Street sales expectations for the fitness band were overestimated and a new, larger iPhone could weigh on sales of Garmin’s personal navigation devices.“We have concerns about the underlying strength of the outdoor and fitness businesses, which contribute over half of the company’s operating profit and are critical, in our view,” analyst Brad Erickson said.Garmin shares fell 5 per cent to $57.23 while Telenav slid 2 per cent to $5.47.Shares of Alcoa jumped 6 per cent to $15.67 after the metal mining company turned a profit following two straight quarters of losses.Profits in the quarter to June 30 were $138m, or 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $119m a year earlier. Sales were little changed from a year earlier at $5.8bn.Alcoa’s results come two weeks after it agreed to buy UK-based Firth Rixson, a maker of aeroplane engine and landing gear components, as the US company seeks to expand its divisions behind everything from aerofoils used in jet engines and sheets used in the auto industry.American Airlines, the world’s largest airline, was buoyed on Wednesday after the company said it expected second quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile, a key industry metric, to rise between 5.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent from a year earlier.The forecast followed a profit warning on Tuesday from Air France-KLM, which weighed on the airline sector.Shares of American Airlines advanced 4 per cent to $41.96 while rival Delta inched 1 per cent higher to $36.94.Container Store shares slid 9 per cent to $24.72, touching the lowest level since they began trading last November, after the retailer said sales in the three months to May 31 missed Wall Street forecasts.“Consistent with so many of our fellow retailers, we are experiencing a retail ‘funk’,” chief executive Kip Tindell said, referring to a 0.8 per cent decline in same-store sales.Overall, US equities snapped a two day losing streak ahead of and following the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,972.83 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5 per cent to 16,985.61.

81;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-05-01T16:21:57Z;Yum chooses Taco Bell chief as next CEO;;Yum Brands has chosen Greg Creed, head of its Taco Bell restaurant chain, to take over from chief executive David Novak, as the company recovers from a sales slump in its China division.Mr Novak will retire at the end of the year after nearly 15 years at the helm and become Yum’s executive chairman, the company announced Thursday. He will also form the office of the chairman to lead overall corporate strategy, which will include himself, Mr Creed and Sam Su, the head of Yum’s China business.Mr Creed has been with Yum for around 20 years, previously serving as chief operating officer. Analysts have praised his three-year tenure as chief executive of Taco Bell, in which the Mexican-food chain has outperformed Yum’s KFC and Pizza Hut chains.“That brand for them has really been clearly the best of the three that they have,” said Jack Russo, analyst at Edward Jones. Part of that success has been driven by the popularity of the Doritos Locos Taco dish, which Mr Creed oversaw.Mr Creed’s focus must now shift from the US, where most Taco Bell restaurants are located, to Yum’s global operations, which are focused on emerging markets, in particular China.The company is China’s largest western restaurant group by sales and number of outlets, with more than 6,300 restaurants. China contributes around half of Yum’s total revenues, but it has struggled recently.Food safety concerns and an avian flu outbreak over the past year sent Yum’s China same-store sales plummeting. But the company seemed to be rebounding by the first quarter of this year, when global sales rose 9.2 per cent from a year earlier to $2.9bn, the best pace in more than a year, and China sales jumped 20 per cent.The China business’s firmer footing made this an ideal time for Mr Novak to retire, RBC analyst David Palmer said in a note to investors.Mr Palmer said Mr Novak had led the company through a “rapid metamorphosis” over the past 15 years, including moving it from owning nearly 50 per cent of its US stores to owning less than 10 per cent today. During Mr Novak’s tenure, the China business rose from 2 per cent of group profits to almost 40 per cent.The Kentucky-based company has more than 40,000 restaurants in 125 countries.Shares in the company were down 1 per cent, to $76.22, in morning trading in New York.
82;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-04-25T22:23:07Z;US fast food: pass the napkins;Fast-food stocks are struggling in an important market, and they are not cheap;There has been some indigestion in fast food of late. Mighty McDonald’s, which hit on the right recipe for much of the past decade, has struggled with products and pricing, particularly in the US. Yum Brands, the owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, was hurt in its key China market with food safety concerns and an outbreak of avian flu, although those seem to be passing. Burger King has proved an outlier, with profit gains following a shift to a franchise model, which has enabled aggressive cost cutting and satisfied shareholders’ stomachs. But the latest quarter proved a tough one for all three in the US.McDonald’s saw its same-store sales slump by 1.7 per cent. Comparable store sales at rival Burger King were flat, and Yum’s US business was soft as well. Anyone selling anything that the buyer had to go outside to get has blamed the very cold weather in the US this winter for lacklustre performance. The fast-food chains were no different.It is reasonable that bad weather played a role. But these companies also cater to lower-income US consumers. They have struggled even as middle and higher income diners, who have been bigger beneficiaries of appetising developments such as the rally in the US stock market and the ability to refinance home loans. McDonald’s, for instance, has faced weak US same-store sales for the past several quarters.Looking forward to the rest of the year, the chains could also face some pressure from rising costs from commodities, such as beef and cheese. And this business is highly competitive. There is always the chance that one player comes up with a new quadruple cheeseburger or breakfast taco, garnering a bigger share of the business – or, worse, cuts prices on its value meal. In the stock market, McDonald’s trades at a meaty 17 times forward earnings (despite its troubles), while Yum trades at 21 times (for the growth promise of China) and Burger King, like other franchise-based businesses, earns a premium multiple (27 times). With so many issues, it looks like a good time for investors to stay at home for dinner.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

84;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-04-23T02:13:25Z;McDonald’s misses target as quarterly earnings dip 5%;;McDonald’s reported a 5 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings, missing expectations as harsh winter weather and a slow economic recovery kept US customers at home.Don Thompson, chief executive, said the company’s “priority markets” – the US, Germany, Japan and Australia – drove the decline, adding the company was refining its menu and refocusing its marketing in order to “reignite our business momentum”.The world’s largest restaurant company introduced a number of new items to drive traffic last year, but analysts said the complicated menu confused consumers and slowed down service.Peter Bensen, chief financial officer, said first-quarter commodity costs rose nearly 3 per cent. Analysts said that because of the purchasing power that comes with its size, McDonald’s should be better able to weather high commodity costs than Chipotle, which announced last week that it would raise prices as retail beef costs have reached their highest level in decades.The news comes as McDonald’s faces renewed competition in its key breakfast category, which generates around 25 per cent of US revenues. Last month Yum Brands launched a Waffle Taco at its Taco Bell restaurants.Mr Thompson told analysts on a call that Yum’s breakfast push had not affected sales. “It seems every year there’s someone new that is making a run [on breakfast],” he said. “We have not seen an impact relative to the most recent competitors that entered the space.”McDonald’s responded by offering free coffee at its stores for a week, in order to draw customers away from Taco Bell and its chief morning competitors, coffee sellers Dunkin’ Brands and Starbucks.In China – which the company said was its fastest growing market in terms of store openings last year, with 275 new outlets – McDonald’s is facing an increasingly competitive market as homegrown brands, catering to local tastes, make big inroads.McDonald’s, which significantly trails Yum’s KFC in number of stores and sales in China, said last week it would introduce a more localised store design, and boost the percentage of outlets run by local franchisees to 20-25 per cent next year, from 12 per cent now.The Illinois-based company reported earnings of $1.2bn, or $1.21 a diluted share, in the three months to March, compared with $1.27bn, or $1.26 a share, during the same period last year. Sales grew 1 per cent, from $6.61bn to $6.7bn.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.24 a share on $6.73bn in sales.McDonald’s, along with other fast-food chains, has struggled for more than a year as its target low-income consumer has yet to fully recover from the global financial crisis.US same-store sales have fallen for the past five straight months, and were down 1.7 per cent for the quarter compared with the same period last year. Overall, global same-store sales rose 0.5 per cent, boosted by a 1.4 per cent increase in Europe. The Asia, Middle East and Africa market saw sales increase 0.8 per cent.Shares in the company were down 0.4 per cent at $99.32 at the close of trading in New York.Additional reporting by Patti Waldmeir in Shanghai
85;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-03-06T17:59:25Z;Staples slumps after stores retreat;;Staples shares sank at the greatest pace in more than six months – erasing more than $1bn from its market capitalisation – after the US office supply retailer said it would close hundreds of stores amid stalling sales.The Massachusetts-based company said it will shut as many as 225 stores as part of a plan to trim $500m from annual operating expenses by 2015.Staples attributed the move to shifting habits of US consumers, who increasingly purchase printer ink and other supplies online and from competitors like Amazon.The company said sales would continue to decline at its US stores in the first quarter and profits would be shy of Wall Street forecasts.“A year ago, we announced a plan to fundamentally reinvent our company,” chief executive Ron Sargent said. “With nearly half of our sales generated online today, we’re meeting the changing needs of business customers and taking aggressive action to reduce costs and improve efficiency.”The decision comes just days after RadioShack, the struggling electronics chain, said it would close as many as 1,100 shops as it consolidates its business.Closures at Staples will affect 12 per cent of the company’s 1,846 storefronts in the US and Canada.The announcement was coupled with its fourth-quarter results, which fell below Wall Street forecasts.The company said sales slid 11 per cent from a year earlier to $5.8bn. Profits rose to $212m, or 33 cents per share, compared with $78m in the year-ago period.Analysts had forecast quarterly earnings of 39 cents a share on sales of $6bn.The company was met with a wave of analyst price target cuts and a downgrade from Janney Capital Markets to neutral from buy.“The company had years to close and shrink the store base, and stuck to its guns, and that decision is likely to impact them for the foreseeable future,” Janney analyst David Strasser said. “This is too little, too late, in our humble opinion.”Shares in the company declined more than 15 per cent to close at $11.36.Costco shares also weighed on the benchmark S&P 500 on Thursday, falling 2.76 per cent to $113.26, as profits at the warehouse retailer fell 15 per cent.The company said profits dipped to $463m, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared with $547m a year ago.Sales climbed 6 per cent from a year earlier to $26.3bn, approximately $300m below analyst expectations.Chief financial officer Richard Galanti blamed the decline on weaker sales of non-food items, particularly during the run-up to the Christmas holiday.Lower fresh food gross margins and currency swings also hampered Costco’s results.Mr Galanti estimated severe weather lowered February sales by 1 per cent on a call with investors.“The firm indicated that much of the earnings shortfall reflects trends early in the quarter,” Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler said. “In addition, the company reported February sales that show well versus broader retail but tracked slightly light of expectations.”Yum Brands shares climbed after broker Robert W. Baird upgraded the fast-food chain to outperform on the prospect of improving Chinese sales, the company’s largest single market.“Following five quarters of same-store sales declines, we are optimistic that Yum China is poised for a rebound in 2014 . . . given the company’s solid positioning across segments, upcoming sales drivers (including KFC brand restage in Q2), and encouraging progress on margin initiatives,” Baird analyst David Tarantino said.Mr Tarantino increased his price target to $87 from $79. Shares in Yum advanced 3.3 per cent to $77.28.Overall, US equity markets drifted higher as a report from the labour department showed initial claims for unemployment benefit declined.The S&P 500 rose 0.17 per cent to close at 1,877.03, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.38 per cent to 16,421.89. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed 0.13 per cent lower at 4,352.13.
86;YUM;Yum! Brands;2014-02-04T23:19:06Z;Yum: appetising figures;Any slowing in China will inevitably have an impact;That was satisfying. China was once the reason to buy Yum Brands, the owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. But last year, it was the reason to sell it. Food safety concerns and an outbreak of avian flu resulted in plummeting sales in the region, where Yum gets about half of its revenue. General concern about emerging markets this year and fresh bird flu reports have not helped sentiment. Investors were looking for some reassurance that a recovery of Yum in China was intact. And that is what they got.In the fourth quarter, the company beat earnings expectations. And then it reaffirmed its 2014 target for at least 20 per cent EPS growth and double-digit growth. Same store sales in China still fell – 4 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with an 11 per cent decline in the third quarter and decreases of 20 per cent in the first and second quarters.But cost cuts at restaurants drove margin expansion of 40 basis points to 14.3 per cent in China, which means Yum will need less revenue growth in order to meet its earnings target. Management also said fresh reports of avian flu had not had a big impact on KFC sales in China at the national level, even if same store sales have not been as strong in areas where reported cases have been pronounced.All of that was appetising enough for investors to bid the shares up by 9 per cent. At $72, Yum trades at 20 times forward earnings. That is below the five-year high of 22 times, but above the average of 17 times. It is prudent for shareholders to be wary of how the latest bird flu outbreak develops. But assuming the company is moving beyond these issues, the question becomes what is its future growth opportunity in China.It may not be what it was in the past. And any slowing of economic growth there will inevitably have an impact – also on the appeal of the shares.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Brands;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Gannett’s rise fails to last the course;;Rising advertising demands as the Winter Olympics begin and nearing midterm elections in the US lifted shares of Gannett in New York on Tuesday.Gannett, which publishes USA Today and owns 23 regional television stations, rose 2 per cent in afternoon trading to $27.05, following the company’s fourth-quarter results. But the shares closed at $26.36, down 0.57 per cent.“Increased advertising demand in connection with the upcoming Winter Olympic Games that are going to be starting in a few days, and political elections, make for a promising and exciting 2014,” chief executive Gracia Martore said.Quarterly profits fell 12 per cent from a year earlier to $91m, or 39 cents per share, on a 10 per cent decline in revenues. Adjusting for restructuring and asset impairment charges, Gannett said it earned 66 cents a share, a penny above Wall Street forecasts.Ms Martore added that a split of the company was not in the works “at this moment in time”. Instead, she said the group was focused on increasing possible synergies between its publishing and entertainment businesses, following the $2.2bn acquisition of broadcasting group Belo in December. Ms Martore noted that she and Gannett’s board constantly evaluate the appropriate structure for the company.A sharp jump in European sales in the final three months of last year sent shares of Michael Kors 17.27 per cent higher to $89.91, the top performing stock on the benchmark S&P 500.The New York-based chain reported profits of $229.6m for the quarter, or $1.11 per diluted share, up from $130m in the same period in 2012. Revenues climbed 59 per cent to $1bn.Same-store sales climbed 28 per cent in the quarter, including a 73 per cent rise in Europe, as the entry-level luxury retailer takes market share from rivals including Coach.Randal Konik, a Jefferies analyst, said there was no denying the company’s “superior growth story” over the past several years, but warned investors that sales were likely to slow down in the near term.“As Michael Kors continues to take share from Coach, we believe the brand is reaching a saturation point and see diminishing returns as the product becomes increasingly ubiquitous,” Mr Konik said. “Thus, we anticipate a gradual deceleration in momentum from here.”Investors bid shares of Yum Brands, the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, 8.9 per cent higher to $72.06 on Tuesday as the company stuck with its profit targets for 2014.The company, which released full-year results after the market close on Monday and counts China as its most important market, shrugged off concerns that a resurgence of avian flu would hamper its sales, as it did last year.Revenue for the year to the end of December fell 4 per cent to $13.1bn, as same-store sales fell 13 per cent in China compared to the year before.Net income declined 32 per cent to $1.1bn, or $2.36 per diluted share, below already downward revised market expectations of $1.3bn.Both revenue and income were hurt by sliding restaurant margins, which fell 2.7 percentage points in China as the company turned to deep discounting to revive its fortunes.JC Penney shares lagged behind following an update on its financial performance, which showed its liquidity above $2bn.Same-store sales rose 3.1 per cent for the nine weeks to the end of December and the retailer reported its first increase in sales since 2011. However, analysts on Wall Street were concerned that the company had to shift to deep discounting to woo consumers back to its shops.“We believe this undermines the sales-to-margin bull case thesis for now . . . with elevated risk to fiscal year 2014/15 assumptions given a customer we believe management is finding harder to hold,” JPMorgan analyst Matthew Boss said.Shares in the company declined 10.5 per cent to $5.08.US equity markets rose broadly on Tuesday, following steep declines a day earlier. The S&P 500 advanced 0.76 per cent to 1,755.20 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.47 per cent to 15,445.24. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.86 per cent to 4,031.52.
88;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Yum Brands shakes off bird flu fears;;Yum Brands struck a bullish tone for 2014 even after the fast food group reported a 5 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings which showed food safety concerns continued to weigh on its China division.David Novak, chief executive, called 2013 a “challenging year” for the company behind the Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell brands. However, he reaffirmed a previous forecast of double-digit earnings growth, sending shares up 4.22 per cent, to $68.95, in after-hours trading in New York.The Kentucky-based company reported net income of $321m, or 86 cents a share excluding one-time items, for the three months to December 28. That compared with $337m, or 83 cents a share excluding one-off items, during the same period a year earlier. Revenues fell 1 per cent, from $4.18bn to $4.15bn.Analysts had expected earnings of 80 cents a share on $4.26bn in sales.The news comes days after Shanghai began a three-month ban on live poultry sales and as Hong Kong launched a three-week ban on Chinese poultry and killed 20,000 birds after mainland Chinese imports tested positive for bird flu.Jonathan Blum, chief public affairs officer, said the company was “not seeing any impact nationally on our sales in China” from the fresh reports of avian flu.Food safety concerns and an avian flu outbreak early last year sent Yum’s China same-store sales plummeting. But the company went on a marketing offensive and was thought to be recovering when it reported positive sales growth in November and December.Same-store sales in China fell 4 per cent during the quarter, and fell 13 per cent for the full year.August 2013: The chief executive of Fonterra apologised to Chinese consumers for a food safety scare that threatened to damage the reputation of the world’s largest dairy exporter in one of its most important marketsThe company is China’s largest western restaurant group by sales and number of outlets, with more than 4,400 KFC restaurants alone. China contributes around half of Yum’s total revenues.Yum is not the only company being hit by bird flu concerns in China.On Friday Donnie Smith, chief executive of Tyson Foods, the largest US meat processor by sales, said the company would slow the pace of its China expansion as mainland demand for chicken continues to suffer.Mr Smith told analysts on a conference call that the company no longer expected to break even in China in the fiscal year ending in September. Because demand for chicken had not rebounded from the food safety and avian flu scares that began in late 2012, there was a “substantial oversupply of chicken”, he said.“Now, there are new concerns about avian influenza,” Mr Smith said. “Because of these factors, we decided to slow down on building more chicken farms beyond those currently planned for this fiscal year until market conditions improve.”Tyson ultimately plans to build 90 large chicken houses in China in order to supply its processing plants with quality-controlled poultry raised in sanitary conditions.
89;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-11-04T19:21:52Z;China: Red restoration;Foreign companies are looking for signs that tough tactics are no more than short-term political moves;"In the tranquil surroundings of the Diaoyutai State Guest House in Beijing two weeks ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping was almost effusive as he welcomed an all-star group of global capitalists.“Many of you are renowned entrepreneurs and business leaders in the world today and you all have profound insight into the global economy,” Mr Xi told the likes of Mike Duke, Walmart CEO, Indra Nooyi, the head of PepsiCo, Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola chairman, David Rubenstein, Carlyle Group founder, and Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, the former AIG boss. “Your suggestions are a very important source of inspiration for the Chinese government.”These comments were intended to signal that the world’s second-largest economy remains open for business. But many international businesses have picked up a different, more worrying signal during Mr Xi’s tenure. Since he came to power a year ago, foreign companies have been targeted by corruption investigations, price-fixing accusations and state media-led smear campaigns.“The perception amongst foreign investors is that it is getting harder to do business here,” says Michael Crain, Beijing director of administration for law firm Bingham McCutchen, which advises international companies doing business in China. “In most of the government investigations and media exposés this year the focus has definitely been on the behaviour of foreign companies.”Mr Xi’s friendly tone at the guest house was in stark contrast with the nationalist rhetoric, communist revivalist symbolism and crackdowns on all perceived challenges to Communist party rule that have characterised his tenure since he took power.As the most senior members of the party gather for a crucial meeting this week, global companies that rely on China for an ever-increasing share of their sales and profits will be listening closely to see which message Mr Xi chooses to send.Chinese leaders have suggested that this meeting, known as the Third Plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, will be the most significant since the 1978 gathering that transformed the country. Few expect detailed policy initiatives to be announced but it will set the tone for an administration that is expected to rule until 2023. This meeting, and the signals that come out of it, could determine how global companies fare in the world’s most enticing market.A strong dose of nationalistic, neo-Maoist rhetoric could portend tough times for foreign investors, while a continuation of the welcoming language used at the Diaoyutai meeting may signal an improvement in their fortunes.When he was installed at the top of the party, many within the Chinese system were hopeful Mr Xi would push bold economic and political reforms, including strengthening the legal system and reducing the role of the state in the economy.But Mr Xi has instead fallen back on the tools and symbols of the past in an attempt to halt the erosion of party legitimacy.This “restoration” of Communist imagery and tradition has been fuelled by a heavy dose of nationalism and has been accompanied by a wave of government attacks on foreign businesses in selected industries.GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceuticals company, recently revealed that its medicine and vaccine sales in China had fallen 61 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, following a high-profile investigation into the company’s alleged bribing of officials and doctors.Many in the industry say GSK’s alleged practices, some of which it has acknowledged, were far from unusual and that most domestic Chinese competitors are much more brazen in paying bribes.The government has also launched industry-wide investigations into pricing of medicines and milk powder and in August levied its biggest ever penalties for pricing violations, fining six infant milk formula companies a combined $110m.Late last month, Japan’s Meiji Holdings became the first international company to pull out of China’s baby formula sector, saying it could no longer compete in a market that is expected to double in value by 2017 from its current $12.4bn.The decision came after Meiji was forced to lower prices by the government investigation and after local media reported Beijing would give Rmb30bn ($5bn) to Chinese milk-powder makers to help them compete with foreign rivals.“These actions are about strengthening the legal system, purifying the market environment and protecting consumer rights but they also show how China doesn’t need these foreign enterprises any more,” says Bao Dike, managing editor of the PKU Business Review. “It’s not just that we don’t need foreign companies to provide jobs and tax revenue, it’s also a fact that these foreign companies are occupying the market that belongs to [Chinese] state and private enterprises.”…The group of international business leaders that lined up at the State Guest House in late October to pay homage to President Xi were all members of the advisory board of the Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management.This extraordinary who’s who of global industry shows just how important the Chinese market has become to many multinational companies and how the balance of power has shifted markedly in favour of the mandarins who control access to this market.Conspicuously absent from the event were Tsinghua board members Andrew Witty, CEO of GSK, and Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.Mr Cook was forced to issue a humiliating public apology and a promise to improve customer service policies in April following an intense campaign of criticism from state media.In March, Volkswagen recalled 380,000 vehicles in China after state television said they were unsafe. In recent weeks several state media reports have targeted Samsung for its smartphone warranty policies and Starbucks for overcharging for its lattes.Since KFC was the target of state media stories last December alleging food safety problems, sales at its parent Yum Brands have slumped by over 10 per cent this year.“The government is very aware of the enormous value of the Chinese market for multinationals and it is becoming more ruthless in ensuring that the money is kept in the family rather than letting outsiders grab the fat profits that are available now,” says Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese politics at Sydney University. “Politically it is also a very easy populist move to beat up on foreign companies; much easier than taking on big Chinese companies and their powerful domestic backers.”In the government investigations of the pharmaceutical and milk-powder sectors, Beijing appears to have adopted a traditional strategy known as “killing the chicken to scare the monkey”.By pursuing foreign companies the authorities are sending a message to entire industries that they intend to clean things up in order to provide quality products at reasonable prices in industries about which the public is concerned.By forcing multinationals to lower prices and improve their offerings they are hoping to raise the bar for domestic competitors as well as provide concrete examples to the masses of how their lives are improving under the new administration.The series of government investigations has been accompanied by a boisterous wave of media campaigns targeting popular global companies for alleged violations of consumer rights.These have often been led by the largest state media outlets, particularly state broadcaster China Central Television, and have been juiced up with inflammatory accusations of racism and disdain for Chinese consumers.“We are actually witnessing two different things: one is the exposing of foreign companies’ bribery and bad behaviour in China and the other is CCTV’s ridiculous populist reports that are not necessarily directly ordered by the top leaders,” says Li Huafang, an independent economist and popular newspaper columnist.“I actually think the new administration wants to strengthen regulations for both foreign and domestic businesses.”…Mr Li and many other analysts believe that what appears to be a concerted and organised campaign of economic nationalism is more likely just fallout from Mr Xi’s much broader domestic political agenda.By this logic, companies such as GSK, KFC, Mead Johnson, Apple and Starbucks are collateral damage in the new president’s campaign to consolidate his power, shore up Communist party legitimacy and avoid political instability.The two sides of this campaign are Mr Xi’s ruthless handling of any perceived challenges to continued one-party rule and his efforts to address the main complaints of his citizens.In that sense, it is not contradictory for Mr Xi to personally praise global capitalists while some of their businesses are targeted under his watch. That is because those attacks are not an end in themselves but rather a side-effect of his primary goals.The rough treatment of some foreign businesses “stems from Mr Xi’s need to establish his authority, to impose his will; this is a very common tactic among new rulers”, says Wang Lixiong, a prominent political writer. “We need to wait until he has consolidated power to see what his real intentions are.”One popular interpretation of Mr Xi’s conservative lurch is that he is consolidating power by adopting what is described in China as a traditionalist “leftist” approach in preparation for an eventual move to the more liberal reformist “right”.But so far there has been nothing to suggest he will eventually shift direction.“I don’t see any evidence from his background or persona or from the way that the current system is structured to suggest that Xi is moving to the left because he wants to move to the right,” says François Godement, professor of political science at Sciences Po and director for strategy of the Asia Centre in Paris. “We’ve really had all indications to the contrary and this seems more like wishful thinking.”The good news for international companies is that, for now, many of them are still being formally welcomed by Mr Xi.As long as they can show that their investments and operations in China support or at least do not get in the way of efforts to garner support for the party and its leadership, they will probably be allowed to stay and even thrive.But “increasingly multinational companies will in all sorts of subtle and not subtle ways be made to adapt their behaviour to meet the political and economic needs of the party”, Mr Brown says. “It is quite a rational response for the government in Beijing to leverage this great prize which is their domestic market.”——————————————-Rehabilitating history: Xi turns to Mao to tighten the party’s grip on the futureAnyone wanting to know which way the political winds are blowing in China just needs to read the propaganda signs posted all across Beijing.As the Communist party prepares to hold the third plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, those signs lay out the central themes of President Xi Jinping’s term so far – conservatism, traditionalism and shoring up authoritarian one-party rule.Along with countless billboards proclaiming Mr Xi’s “Chinese Dream” slogan – or the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” – several motifs from a bygone era jostle for attention.“Study Lei Feng, devote yourself to others, upgrade your behaviour” commands a large poster in a chic Beijing neighbourhood.This “obey morality and observe good manners reminder notice” refers to a legendary propaganda character, Lei Feng, from the early 1960s whose (probably fictional) exploits are the subject of ridicule and cynicism for many ordinary Chinese people today.Lei Feng was supposedly a soldier in the People’s Liberation Army who secretly washed his comrades’ socks at night, revered Mao Zedong and died at the age of 21. Although someone called Lei Feng probably existed, the posthumous propaganda campaigns describing his life of selfless devotion to Mao, the party and modest good deeds are almost certainly fabrications.It might seem counterproductive to reach for a discredited and outdated symbol to shore up legitimacy. But the Lei Feng campaign is part of a wider effort by Mr Xi to rehabilitate history and explain why the party should remain in charge.“Xi is drawing from the register of the 1950s and particularly the early 1960s when the party launched successive Leninist political movements,” says François Godemont, a professor of political science at Sciences Po.“He is trying to bring about a ‘red restoration’ and consolidate his grip on power.”The result is a barrage of language not heard in China for decades as Mr Xi promotes the Maoist “mass line” governance method and orders cadres to carry out “criticism and self-criticism” sessions.In the past three decades, Chinese leaders have tried to play down the Maoist era from 1949 until 1976 to avoid subjects such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.But Mr Xi has explicitly said the Mao era should be rehabilitated.This is partly because much of his legitimacy derives from his pedigree as the son of Xi Zhongxun, a communist guerrilla leader who went on to be a senior official under Mao but was purged in the early 1960s.By referring to the period before his father’s fall from grace, Mr Xi is seeking to boost his own image as the son of a revolutionary founding father.A less savoury aspect of his campaign has been the arrest of hundreds of people considered to be political “troublemakers”.“All the signs are that what Xi wants is to strengthen the system and his own position, rather than risk structural change that would reduce the power of the existing establishment,” says Jonathan Fenby, director of China research at Trusted Source.——————————————-Letters in response to this article:Local values with a global impact / From Mr Peter MarshThe recipe for enduring growth / From Dr Mario Mariniello"

91;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-10-08T23:34:51Z;Yum: no light at the end of the tunnel in China;;"It’s déjà vu all over again.Yum! Brands on Tuesday released third quarter results – and once again the US operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell missed market expectations as its China business continues to suffer.Third quarter sales in China – a country that accounted for half of group revenue and profit last year – fell 11 per cent, led by a 14 per cent decline at KFC.Once feted as a textbook case study of how to succeed in China, Yum’s KFC division has struggled to keep customers from fleeing following a safety scare involving some of its chicken suppliers last year and new outbreaks of avian flu earlier this year. Sentiment towards the chain has also been dented by accusations that the ice it used in its China stores is dirtier than toilet water.As a result of its continued China woes, Yum! said it now had to cut its full-year earnings expectations.From the earnings statement:Based on KFC China sales for September, it is now unlikely China Division same-store sales will be positive for the fourth quarter. Given lower-than-expected China sales and a higher-than-expected full-year tax rate, the Company now estimates a high-single to low-double-digit full-year EPS decline versus prior year, excluding Special Items. This compares to our previous guidance of a mid-single-digit decline in EPS.Shares fell nearly 8 per cent in after market trading as the market digested the profit warning.Despite the rather grim numbers, David Novak, Yum!’s chairman and CEO, remained – as in previous quarters – upbeat over the company’s prospects.“Despite the disappointing third-quarter performance, I remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver strong, sustainable growth in the years to come,” said Novak.“Even with our recent challenges, KFC is unquestionably the category leader in China and we remain confident sales will fully recover from the adverse publicity surrounding the December poultry supply incident.”Sure, Pizza Hut sales in China are up 5 per cent for the quarter. But make no mistake, KFC, with 4,463 outlets across China, remains Yum!’s bread and butter business in the country.No less worrying, it looks like Yum!’s image problem in China is not limited to just its fried chicken business.From Yum! again (emphasis ours):Our Little Sheep business has performed below expectations since we acquired a controlling interest in February 2012. While we continue to have confidence in the long-term potential of Little Sheep, the sales and unit growth we forecasted at acquisition have not materialized……In May 2013, negative publicity from quality issues with other unrelated hot pot concepts in China further significantly impacted sales at Little Sheep, even though there was never an issue with the quality of Little Sheep products.

A net impairment charge for certain Little Sheep assets totaling $258million was recorded as a Special Item, consistent with the classification of the $74 million gain that was recorded in 2012 upon our consolidation of Little Sheep.Related reading:

92;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-10-08T22:49:58Z;Yum Brands: deep fried;Poor results in China have not deterred investors even though no turnround in sight;"Yum Brands is giving its shareholders repeated lessons in humility. On Tuesday night the restaurant chain reported third-quarter results. Its crucial China division, which was expected to be wobbly, was even wobblier: same store sales fell 11 per cent from a year ago, and total sales were up only 2 per cent. The company cut its target for full-year earnings. The shares lost 7 per cent of their value in late trading, hitting $66, near two-year lows.Yum has now delivered deeply negative comparable sales results in China for four straight quarters – that is, since news broke of a government inquiry into the company’s poultry supply chain. Consider how unlikely the prospect of a year of stagnating revenue and falling profit in China must have seemed 12 months ago; at that point, investors had been feasting on double-digit sales growth for years. Yet happen it did. In fact, it looks like the market never accepted the possibility that anything had really changed. While Yum’s valuation fell from 27 to 23 times trailing earnings between November 2012 and the following February, it quickly recovered thereafter. The share price bounced, too. The implication was that a full and timely recovery was approaching. Tuesday’s numbers have undercut that prediction as well.Will expectations recover as quickly this time around? Will the market continue to imply confidence that underlying trends in Yum’s China business are strong? Perhaps but Yum reversed itself and no longer predicts a turnround in the fourth quarter. The habit of optimism has been hard to break, even with practice.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
93;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-10-08T21:53:12Z;Yum shares hit as earnings plunge 68%;;Shares in Yum Brands fell nearly 8 per cent in after-market trading on Tuesday after the company reported a 68 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings and reduced its annual outlook as it continues to be hit by challenges in China.Yum has seen same-store sales in China, which accounts for more than half of its total revenues, decline for seven consecutive months, including an 11 per cent drop in September. The company, which operates the KFC and Pizza Hut chains, said it was no longer likely that China sales would turn positive during the fourth quarter.The Kentucky-based company reported net income of $152m, or 33 cents a diluted share, for the three months to September 7, down from $471m, or $1 a diluted share, during the same period last year. Revenues fell 3 per cent year on year to $3.47bn, missing expectations of $3.53bn.Excluding a $258m, or 55 cents a share, writedown on Little Sheep, the hot pot chain in China in which Yum acquired a controlling interest last year, Yum reported earnings of 85 cents a share. Analysts had expected 93 cents.Yum’s China same-store sales fell 11 per cent compared to the same period last year. Operating profits there fell 11 per cent to $335m, from $374m.Yum is China’s top western restaurant operator by sales and number of outlets, with nearly 6,000. Most are KFC and many are company operated rather than franchised.The company had gone on the offensive to try to limit damage from a food safety scandal late last year that saw some of its suppliers accused of excessive use of growth hormones and antiviral drugs in poultry, along with an avian flu outbreak earlier this year.China same-store sales have yet to recover fully, though analysts agree with the company that such food safety scares generally have a short shelf life.“Despite the disappointing third-quarter performance, I remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver strong, sustainable growth in the years to come,” said David Novak, chief executive.He said the company expected a high single- to low-double-digit drop in full-year earnings this year compared to last. The company expects to achieve 20 per cent year-over-year earnings growth in 2014.

95;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-09-06T20:46:53Z;Yum just can’t seem to shake off its China woes;;"By Pan Kwan Yuk and Eric PlattPoor Yum! Brands. The inanely-punctuated US operator of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut just can’t seem to catch a break in China – its single most important market.The company, which makes about half of its revenues and profits from China, said on Friday that same store sales in the country fell 10 per cent in August as its KFC division continues to shed customers following a safety scare involving some of its chicken suppliers last year and new outbreaks of avian flu earlier this year.The August numbers make for grim reading. They come on the heels of a 13 per cent decline in same-store sales in July, a 10 per cent drop in June, a 19 per cent fall in May, a whopping 29 per cent collapse in April and a 13 per cent decline in March.Yum! executives have told investors in the past that declining sales would be “relatively short-lived” and the message was no different on Friday.“We expect China Division same-store sales will continue to improve, and expect to report positive same-store sales growth for the fourth quarter,” the company said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Brave words. Whether investors believe that is another matter. Yum! is set to host a China investor and analyst conference on Monday in Shanghai. Expect some tough questions from the crowd.Shares in Yum! rose less than 1 per cent in after hours trading following the announcement. The stock is up 11 per cent over the past 12 months.Related reading:

96;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-08-13T16:11:14Z;Yum Brands hit by poor Chinese sales;;US markets continued a slow downward trend as Yum Brands fell on new sales data that showed its Chinese business continued to struggle.Shares in the restaurant chain operator fell 2.1 per cent to $72.93 and have lagged behind the S&P 500’s performance in 2013, up only 9.7 per cent. The benchmark index is 18.8 per cent higher on the year to date.Yum reported sales on Monday after the bell that its businesses in China had fared worse than anticipated, feeding concern that the company was struggling in one of its key markets.The company has fought to repair its reputation in China since allegations in late 2012 that it violated food safety regulations by injecting poultry with antiviral drugs and growth hormones.Yum is part of a growing group of US companies that are struggling because of international exposure.“S&P 500 companies continue to invest in international operations in search of new growth opportunities, however, international markets do not appear to be the reliable source of growth that has been anticipated,” said Greg Harrison, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, in a note.“Strength in earnings is driven by the US, with US-focused companies showing strong growth in earnings and revenue and internationally focused companies showing earnings and revenue declines.”The S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,693.91 as an afternoon rally took the index into positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2 per cent to 15,449.36 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.4 per cent to 3,684.14.Apple was one of the day’s biggest movers, up 4.8 per cent to $489.57 after activist investor Carl Icahn tweeted out that he had taken a large stake in the iPhone maker, and was pushing for another share buyback.Airline stocks were sharply lower after news emerged that the US Department of Justice had sued to block the merger of American Airlines and US Airways.US Airways fell 13.1 per cent to $16.36 in a matter of minutes and AMR Corporation, which operates American Airlines, plunged 44.4 per cent to $3.23.AMR has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since November 2011.The news sent rival airlines down as well, with Delta down 7.1 per cent to $19.55, United Continental 7.5 per cent lower to $30.73 and Southwest Airlines 1.8 per cent off at $13.47.Homebuilders were under particular pressure from a 9 basis point rise in US 10-year Treasury yields.PulteGroup was off 2.3 per cent to $15.37, Lennar fell 2.6 per cent to $32.16 and DR Horton dropped 1.5 per cent to $18.54.The rate jump also sent Reits broadly lower with Annaly Capital Management off 2.9 per cent to $11.62 and American Capital Agency 2.7 per cent lower at $22.71.Drugmaker Eli Lilly added 4.3 per cent at $55.88, on reports that one of its lung cancer drugs performed well in recent trials.Microsoft’s summer resurgence was stalled by Stifel Nicolaus, which downgraded the company from “hold” to “buy”.Shares in the computer maker fell 1.3 per cent to $32.23 but remain up 15 per cent over the past six months.The S&P 500 logged only its second positive sessions in the past seven trading days but trading volumes have been muted along with losses. The index remains only 1.3 per cent off its all-time highs.Tim Speiss, chairman of the personal wealth advisers group at accountancy EisnerAmper, said that while some short-term barriers may prevent US stocks from setting new highs any time soon, the broader picture remains bright.“S&P equities are up 150 per cent through yesterday’s close since March of 2009. We remain on the trajectory of economic recovery and economic valuation recovery and to me that’s the big story,” he said. “It’s clear an economic recovery is under way.”
97;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-07-29T09:37:08Z;Chart of the week: fast food in China;;"Yum Brands may be the leading company in the Chinese fast food market with over 5700 outlets, but recently it has seen a sharp decline in sales in the country.Although Yum has suffered from headline-grabbing food scares (bird flu and banned antibiotics), are there bigger structural shifts afoot in Chinese fast food? Chart of the week takes a look.The Chinese fast-food industry is growing, but not as fast as it used to. According to the Chinese statistical office, the number of fast-food outlets had a double-digit growth rate until 2010, but it has slowed down since to only 6.5 per cent in 2011. Market research agency Euromonitor forecasts the number of fast-food outlets to grow at a progressively slower rate to just 3.8 per cent in three years time.The slowdown is even more dramatic when looking at restaurant area, which grew at an annual rate of less then 1 per cent in 2011 after a growth of about 20 per cent for the previous 4 years. And the number of dining seats contracted in 2011 for the first time after previously growing at double digit rate since the data was first collected in 2005, according to the Chinese statistical office.So what are the options for fast-food operators? There are still opportunities for growth – but through taking market share, rather than simply expanding with the market.Independent fast food operators still represent a huge 98 per cent of the number of fast food outlets and about 84 per cent of the fast food market in China, according to Euromonitor. Independent outlets have lost market share to chains in the last few years, and they are forecast to lose up to 7 percentage points in market share in the 2007-17 period, even if they remain relatively stable in terms of proportion of number of outlets.Yum Brands was one of the main gainer as it increased its market share from less than 5 per cent in 2007 to 6.5 per cent in 2012 – that’s nearly 3 times larger than the second largest operator, McDonalds.But the competition between fast food chains is becoming fierce, and western brands face the additional challenge of price competition from local operators and of the rising appeal for Chinese food chains. “We are seeing a shift among many Chinese consumers back towards local products and brands” said Matthew Crabble, Director of Research Asia Pacific at Mintel.According to the Mintel report, a minority of Chinese consumers see western fast food as more nutritional, better quality or equally healthy as Chinese. The majority of the interviewed would prefer to have more Chinese fast food chains and nearly half of the respondents would prefer western fast food restaurants to provide localised products. “Western fast food like KFC and McDonalds are perceived to be less healthy. People don’t trust [western chains] as much as independent operators for food safety reasons. Local food is believed to be healthier.” David Huang, Mintel’s head of research in China told beyondbrics.Western-style fast food chains are trying to adapt and in March 2013, KFC launched traditional Chinese dishes on its menu such as curry chicken rice, Furong vegetable soup, and pickled cabbage.But domestic operators are changing too, looking to expand, create brands – like Kung Fu – and even offer western-style food but at a cheaper price than international operators, as Hua Lai Shi Catering is doing.Yum might have some specific problems in China, but the fast food market overall is getting tricky: price sensitive consumers, changing tastes and slowing growth.Related reading:

98;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;McDonald’s: still hungry;The company’s recent performance might inspire investors to turn to Yum;"New McDonald’s shareholders must feel unsatisfied. Over two years, the stock has returned 17 per cent. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index has done 3 times better. McDonald’s second-quarter results, released on Monday, will not help; they disappointed on both sales and earnings. A weak global economy is limiting pricing power, especially in the US, and management says the rest of the year will be “challenged”. The shares fell 3 per cent.Yet long-term shareholders are patting their bellies contentedly, after a 500 per cent 10-year return that whips the index. Of course when the global economy is slow, the company that invented the globalisation of restaurants is going to feel it. The question is whether now is the time to own a huge, efficient, proven company, or to find a way to target growth.The obvious way to focus on growth is with Yum! Brands, the operator of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC. It has proportionally more of its stores in the emerging world than McDonald’s does, and owns more of them outright, as opposed to franchising them. Food safety concerns drove Yum’s same-store sales in China, where it makes half of its sales and more than a third of its profits, down 20 per cent in the second quarter. But Wall Street analysts think these problems, which will probably result in falling sales and profits this year, are a blip. They expect double-digit sales growth in 2014 and 2015, twice McDonald’s rate. Yum’s shares have held up nicely, and they trade at 23 times forward earnings to McDonald’s 17.The choice seems simple enough, then. McDonald's for steady global performance, Yum for a leveraged play on emerging market growth.Remember, though, that during the past five years, McDonald’s has increased sales, on average, almost as fast as Yum (5 versus 6 per cent) and that it does draw a fifth of its profits from developing countries. The biggest difference between the two companies may be the supersized short-term expectations for growth at Yum.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

101;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-07-10T22:25:23Z;Yum Brands suffers on China woes;;Yum Brands, operator of the KFC and Taco Bell chains, reported a 15 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings as food safety fears at its Chinese unit took their toll.However, the company said the unit was recovering and remained on track to open more than 700 new units this year.The Kentucky-based company reported net income of $281m, or 56 cents a share excluding special items, for the three months to June 15, down from $331m, or 67 cents a diluted share, during the same period last year.Revenues for the quarter fell 8 per cent, from $3.17bn last year to $2.9bn. The results beat analyst expectations of earnings of 54 cents per share, but fell below expectations of $2.93bn in sales. They improved on the first quarter, which saw a 26 per cent drop in earnings from last year.In China, which accounted for about 17 per cent of total operating profits and nearly half of revenues in the second quarter, same-store sales fell 20 per cent compared with the same period last year. Operating profits there fell 63 per cent to $68m, from $182m.Yum is China’s leading western restaurant company by sales and number of outlets, with nearly 6,000. Most are KFC and many are company-operated rather than franchised.David Novak, chief executive, said intense media attention surrounding an avian flu outbreak earlier this year, and allegations in December that some Yum suppliers in China had injected chicken with growth hormones and antiviral drugs beyond food safety limits, was subsiding, and same-store sales were bouncing back.The company went on the offensive to try to limit damage from the scandal, vowing to strengthen supplier oversight and cutting ties with more than 1,000 small producers used by its 25 poultry suppliers.“The good news is that China sales are recovering as expected,” said Mr Novak. “For the total China division, we remain on track to open at least 700 new units this year.”The company estimates that China same-store sales in June fell 10 per cent from last year, compared with a 19 per cent drop in May. Yum expects same-store sales in the country to be positive by the fourth quarter.Analysts agreed that the company would soon be putting its China troubles behind it.“We assume a solid rebound from food safety-related issues as these types of issues have a track record of being short lived,” said Mitchell Speiser, of the Buckingham Research Group, in a pre-earnings note to investors.The company reiterated its expectations that earnings per share would suffer a mid-single-digit drop in 2013. Mr Novak said he expected a “big bounceback year in 2014”.Shares in the company were up marginally, to $72.89, in after-market trading in New York.
102;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-07-08T16:47:03Z;Dell rises but US tech stocks struggle;;Dell shares led a strong open to the week’s US equities trading after news emerged that an influential shareholder advisory firm has backed founder Michael Dell’s proposal to take the computer maker private.Shares in the company rose 3.2 per cent to $13.44, and have traded near the $14 range since January when word of buyout discussions first broke.Dell has struggled as it looks to reduce its dependence on a steadily shrinking PC market and become a broader technology company.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,640.49 as a broad rally was led by the energy and consumer sectors, while some tech stocks were under pressure on concerns about the global PC market.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was down 2 per cent after analysts downgraded Intel. Like Dell, Intel has been hit by concerns that the decline of PC sales will damage its core business. Shares in the chipmaker were down 3.6 per cent to $23.19 after downgrades from Evercore Partners and Citigroup.However, declining PC sales only tell part of the story. In the growing mobile chip market, it is far behind competitors.“They have almost no share in the 3G market, which is heavily dominated by Qualcomm, Samsung and some others,” said S&P Capital IQ analyst Christine Amracost. “They have some small wins, but on the 3G they really haven’t been there yet.”She added that Intel is preparing to release its new mobile chip in 2014 to directly compete with the industry leaders.“The game really starts in 2014,” she said.Apple’s struggles, along with Intel, meant the tech-heavy Nasdaq lagged behind the broader rally, up 0.2 to 3,484.83. Apple shares were off 0.6 per cent to $415.05.Sprint Nextel shares were down 1.1 per cent to $7.08 after the company said more than half of its investors chose to receive cash instead of stock in SoftBank as part of its acquisition deal, exceeding the money available for the scheme.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent to 15,225.15. American Express, up 1 per cent to $77.04, and Walmart, 2 per cent higher to $76.71, helped drive the blue-chip index.Utilities were among the strongest sectors, breaking a recent downward trend that has coincided with rising US Treasury rates and better performance from more cyclical sectors.The Southern Company rose 1.7 per cent to $43.85, Dominion Resources added 1.1 per cent to $56.88, and PPL gained 1.7 per cent to $29.85.For all the concerns about rising interest rates and the upcoming end of quantitative easing, the S&P 500 is only 2.7 per cent off its all-time highs hit in May.The Russell Small-cap index hit an all-time high on Monday, adding 0.3 per cent to 1,008.76, having passed the 1,000 mark for the first time on Friday.It has also performed noticeably well when compared with the other major indices since the market top in May. Up 18.8 per cent on the year to date, the Russell has since the beginning of June outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 2 percentage points.The earnings season began with Alcoa reporting earnings just after the bell on Monday.

104;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-06-18T11:36:05Z;Mengniu Dairy seeks to rebuild reputation with Yashili stake deal;;China Mengniu Dairy is looking to rebuild its reputation and secure safe supplies of baby formula with a bid to buy Chinese milk powder producer Yashili International, in a deal that is worth more than HK$12.6bn ($1.6bn).China’s efforts to secure safe food supplies and popular brands can be seen in several deals including Shanghui’s recent $4.7bn bid for Smithfield of the US and Bright Food’s takeover last year of Weetabix.Mengniu has been struggling to recover from a 2008 milk contamination scandal in China, when several companies were found to have sold baby milk tainted with poisonous chemicals. Mainland Chinese have been flooding into Hong Kong and other markets to buy foreign brand baby milk powder ever since.Demand for formula is booming in China due to a decline in breastfeeding, partly as a result of more women rejoining the workforce quickly after giving birth. Euromonitor, a research group, expects annual demand for formula to double to $25bn over the next four years, by which time China will account for half of all sales globally.However, even as the market has boomed, Chinese producers’ sales have been hampered by the scandal. Sales at Mengniu, which is China’s biggest dairy company, fell 3.5 per cent between 2011 and 2012.The company has been trying to rebuild its image by buying into more reliable businesses. It recently bought a 28 per cent stake in China Modern Dairy, a milk producing company, from the private equity companies CDH Investments and KKR.In May it also signed up for two joint ventures with Danone of France, with the French food group investing €325m.Trading in shares of Mengniu and Yashili has been suspended in Hong Kong since last Thursday on speculation that a deal was imminent. The Zhang family, which controls Yashili with a 52 per cent stake, and Carlyle, the private equity firm that owns 24 per cent, have committed to selling their full holdings to Mengniu.Mengniu shares are up more than 23 per cent since the Danone deal, while shares in Yashili are up 81.5 per cent so far this year.The takeover offer of HK$3.50 a share is pitched at a 9.4 per cent premium to Yashili’s closing price before the shares were suspended last week. Shareholders can take all cash, or can take HK$2.82 in cash and 0.681 of a share in the acquisition vehicle, a private entity 100 per cent owned by Mengniu.The share option on the deal was structured at the request of the Zhang family, who will take 10 per cent in the private vehicle, according to one banker familiar with the deal.Yashili, which is based in Guandong province and has several factories producing formula in China, secured approval last December to build a factory in New Zealand.UBS advised Mengniu and HSBC and Standard Chartered will provide financing. Yashili was advised by Somereley, a Chinese boutique investment bank.
105;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-06-06T20:43:19Z;Yum rises as S&P 500 returns gains;;Shares in restaurant group Yum Brands challenged year highs on positive news about revenue from China as US stocks rallied in the afternoon leading up to Friday’s US payrolls report to finish in positive territory.The company, which operates brands such as Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, rose 4.1 per cent to $70.84. A report from OTR Global that said sales in Yum’s KFC China stores rose in the second half of May helped offset recent food safety concerns.During a four-week span beginning in late March, Yum shares dropped just over 10 per cent after being unable to shake worries about its poultry in China, which produces almost half of the company’s revenue.All 10 sectors on the S&P 500 finished in positive territory. The benchmark index gained 0.9 per cent to 1,622.56, having lost as much as 0.6 per cent and briefly dipping below the 1,600 level before closing at a session high.The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.7 per cent to 3,424.05, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished back above the 15,000 level, adding 0.5 per cent to 15,040.62.After the close, Monsanto announced a new $2bn share buy-back plan that would begin once the current $1bn repurchase plan was finished. That sent shares 1.6 per cent higher to $100.25 in after-hours trading.Verizon Communications helped telecoms lead all sectors with a gain of 3.5 per cent to $49.97. The company recently announced a deal with the National Football League to stream games on its products, helping to offset news that the US government had compelled the company to hand over records of telephone calls.Sprint Nextel rose 1.9 per cent to $7.34 and Frontier Communications rose 1.7 per cent to $4.12. The sector suffered a 7.7 per cent fall in the second half of May, but was up 2.2 per cent on the day.US technology group Oracle fell 2.3 per cent to $33.35 after analysts at Berenberg Bank downgraded the company from “buy” to “sell”. In March, disappointing revenue and a cautious outlook sent shares tumbling. The company is now nearly flat on the year to date.Apple also traded lower, losing 1.5 per cent to $438.46, and is now down 17.6 per cent in 2013.US data remained in focus, as new weekly jobless claims came in at expectations, and helped set the scene for Friday’s non-farm payroll numbers, which could prove to be a crucial report both for the future of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing programme and consequentially US equity markets.The upcoming employment report and in-line jobless claims helped to level the market after Thursday’s sell off, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial.“The data will have an impact on the market. Traders and investors are hesitant to make a commitment before the data,” she said. “What analysts are trying to determine is what the Fed is thinking. That really is why you have the nervousness in the market . . . The market has become hypersensitive to data related to employment.”Sodastream rose 2.7 per cent to $71.24 on reports that the company was being targeted for acquisition by PepsiCo, which denied the news. PepsiCo shares were up 0.6 per cent to $81.6.In capital markets news, LightInTheBox shares rose 22.2 per cent to $11.61 in its first day of public trading. The e-commerce retailer is the first Chinese company to float this year, raising $78.9m on Thursday night.Big-box retailer Home Depot advanced 2.9 per cent to $77.26, continuing a strong 2013 that has been helped by an improving US housing market. The company’s shares are up almost 25 per cent year to date.Netflix suffered a 2.6 per cent fall to $217.74 after news broke that Amazon had signed a new licensing agreement with Viacom to stream television shows. Amazon rose 0.3 per cent to $267.83.

The New York listed company has 39,000 restaurants in over 120 countries, but the key one is China, which provides 45 per cent of revenues. The outbreak of bird flu was always going to hit sales, and the company revealed on Tuesday that China same-store sales in the last quarter fell 20 per cent. Shares recovered quickly though – either it wasn’t as bad as expected; maybe the shares were due a bounce; or perhaps the company’s positive guidance for the rest of the year and into 2014 convinced investors. Whatever the reason, it was a down-up-down week."
107;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-04-23T22:48:57Z;Yum profits hit by food safety fears;;Yum Brands, operator of the KFC and Pizza Hut fast-food chains, reported a 26 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings, as food safety concerns continued to hurt its Chinese business.The Kentucky-based company reported net income of $337m excluding special items, or 70 cents per share, down from $458m, or 76 cents per share, during the same period last year. But the company beat analysts’ estimates of earnings of 60 cents per share, sending its shares up 5.63 per cent in after-market trading to $67.76.“While better than expected, the first quarter was extremely difficult for Yum Brands,” said David Novak, chief executive. “There is no doubt 2013 will be a challenging year for our company. With news of avian flu, there will obviously be more volatility with our China sales recovery.”Overall revenues for the first quarter came in just below expectations, falling 7.6 per cent from $2.74bn to $2.54bn, against expectations of $2.56bn.In China, which accounts for nearly a third of total operating profits and around 45 per cent of revenues, same-store sales during the quarter fell 20 per cent, against a 14 per cent rise during the same period last year.Yum is China’s leading western restaurant company by sales and number of outlets, with about 5,500. Most are KFC and many are company-operated rather than franchised.A recent avian flu outbreak in China that has killed nine people will probably hit sales further, with same-store sales likely to fall 30 per cent in April compared to a year earlier, the company said.“Historically, the impact of avian flu publicity has initially been dramatic at KFC but relatively shortlived,” Mr Novak said. “We will stay the course with our plans to develop at least 700 new units in China this year to lay the foundation for future growth.”Allegations in December that Yum’s suppliers in China had injected chicken with antiviral drugs and growth hormones beyond food safety limits sparked outrage, with some customers calling for a boycott on social media network Sina Weibo. That led the company to embark on a public relations campaign to educate consumers about the safety of its food.In February, Yum went on the offensive to try to limit damage from the scandal, vowing to strengthen supplier oversight and cutting ties with more than 1,000 small producers used by its 25 poultry suppliers.The company reiterated its expectations that earnings per share would suffer a mid-single-digit drop in 2013.
108;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-04-23T01:00:19Z;Pizza Hut has gamers in its sights;;Starting on Tuesday, with a swipe of their hand or a tweak of their joystick, gamers will be able to supplement Call of Duty with a call for pizza.Pizza Hut is launching an application for Microsoft’s Xbox gaming console that will for the first time allow players to order food using their controller, in the latest skirmish in the long-running digital battle among the US’s big pizza chains.The app also offers the chain an ideal, captive audience in what is traditionally considered pizza’s target demographic – couch-bound young men.Pizza chains have long been at the forefront of digital ordering, and competing apps are probably in the works for both pizza and other restaurants with delivery services, said RJ Hottovy, restaurant analyst at Morningstar.“Pizza Hut and Domino’s and even Papa John’s have done a great job of getting their message out there with social media, online apps, and interesting online ordering portals,” said Mr Hottovy. “I think it’s the next logical evolution [for] any restaurant that has delivery.”The app will be available for download on the Xbox Live dashboard, and will allow gamers to build their own order by swiping through toppings, crust style, side dishes and beverages using both the controller and motion- and voice-recognition software via the Kinect camera accessory.It will offer targeted deals for the closest of the company’s 6,300 US stores, and give customers the option to share details of their orders via Facebook.Kurt Kane, chief marketing officer for Pizza Hut, said the app would also connect with Xbox’s large audience beyond the more stereotypical college dormitory dwellers.“Gaming is probably mislabelled as only a young adult male’s domain. You have that, but it’s got a very broad platform,” he said. “You have adults very active, men and women, there’s a very broad footprint around gaming.”The idea was pitched to the company by Microsoft, with which it already had a advertising and marketing relationship.Consumers are increasingly using Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation to access online video, including Netflix and Hulu. It was Hulu’s app which helped inspire Pizza Hut’s own, Mr Kane said.Pizza Hut, the world’s largest pizza chain by number of restaurants, and its parent company, Yum Brands – which reports earnings on Tuesday – have been at the forefront of digital ordering. According to the company, a Pizza Hut pizza was the first item ordered via the Internet, in 1994.Yum’s KFC restaurant chain, meanwhile, earlier this month launched a “mobile wallet” smartphone app that will allow customers to order and pay for food before they arrive at an outlet.
109;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-04-11T14:13:49Z;Beyondbrics: Bird flu gives business a cold;;"Chinese businesses from rural poultry farms to the luxury Shanghai Four Seasons hotel are beginning to feel the impact of a bird flu outbreak that has killed nine people.Taobao Marketplace, the ecommerce platform of the Alibaba internet group, confirmed that as of Wednesday it had banned online trading of live poultry in the Shanghai region.The Four Seasons was among several upmarket Shanghai hotels to take chicken off the menu. Some international schools in the city have removed eggs and poultry from their cafés and started doing temperature checks on people entering their campuses. And KFC, one of China’s most successful foreign restaurant chains, has seen a fall in sales.The outbreak of a new form of bird flu – H7N9 – has seen 33 people fall ill including the nine who have died, according to the government.Aware of public anger over the secrecy that surrounded the handling of the Sars epidemic a decade ago, the authorities have this time been more forthcoming with information. They have taken well publicised countermeasures, notably in closing poultry markets in Shanghai this month.But Chinese citizens have still questioned on the internet whether they are getting the full story about the new virus.The World Health Organisation has said that there is, as yet, no evidence that the virus is being passed from one human to another.The reported cases have been confined to eastern China and concentrated in Shanghai, the country’s financial capital.Taobao said that, for now, poultry products sold online in places outside Shanghai were not affected by its ban. But the company said that if it received any new directives from the government they would be implemented, including suspending poultry sales in other areas.The poultry is sold by farms, mainly to individual buyers. Producers claim the birds are live at the point of order; they are then slaughtered and shipped in vacuum-sealed packaging. One farmer in rural Zhejiang province, near Shanghai, said his sales had fallen from 100 birds a month before the outbreak to “almost zero now”.Yum! Brands, which owns KFC, said in a statement on Wednesday: “Within the past week, publicity associated with avian flu in China has had a significant, negative impact on KFC sales.”KFC had already been struggling after a media storm over antibiotics found in its chicken. In March, before reports of H7N9 emerged, KFC’s monthly same-store sales were down 16 per cent from the previous year, according to Yum!Some Chinese companies are starting to cancel business trips or ban meetings. Online retailer JD.com sent a letter to staff over the weekend asking them not to meet clients or go on business trips. However, with no human-to-human infections yet confirmed, most companies are conducting business as usual.Meanwhile, the outbreak may be an opportunity for ecommerce as fears of infection prompt more people to stay at home and shop online. Cao Lei, a director at the Hangzhou-based China e-Business Research Center, told Bloomberg that the 2002-03 Sars outbreak helped to make e-commerce popular just as it was getting started.Additional reporting by Patti Waldmeir in Shanghai, Li Wan in Beijing and Julie Zhu in Hong Kong"

Meanwhile, the CBOE Vix index, a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500 and a gauge for investor nerves, rose 6.1 per cent to 12.34 after touching a six-year low a day earlier.“On a normal day, a jump in the Vix like this would definitely catch your attention, but considering where we are coming from it should be expected,” Mr Kinahan added.Shares in Yum! Brands were among the best performing stocks on the benchmark to start the day after the fast-food chain operator said its business in China picked up in February.The company, which operates fast-food restaurants such as KFC and Taco Bell, gained as much as 5.4 per cent in early morning trading. Its shares closed 1.3 per cent higher to $68.73.Jefferies’ analyst Andy Barish said the stock, which trades at a multiple of 23 times its forward earnings forecast for 2013, was fairly valued despite the better-than-expected sales results.Meanwhile, Costco rose 1.3 per cent to $103.75 as the wholesale retailer said higher membership fees helped it beat analysts’ forecasts for its latest quarterly profits. The company also reported a pick-up in market share against its competitors, including Walmart. Shares in Walmart were 0.9 per cent higher at $73.60.JC Penney, a US department store chain, climbed 4 per cent to $15.65 as it moved to deny market rumours that its chief executive was planning to step down amid the company’s troubles.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.3 per cent to 3,242.32, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished fractionally higher to 14,450.06.Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer and Dow component, rose 0.9 per cent to $83.70 as reports said the company had received a 200 jet order from budget airline operator Ryanair Holdings.Shares in computer product maker Hewlett-Packard were 1.8 per cent higher to $21.40 as the UK’s Serious Fraud Office said it had launched an investigation into Autonomy, the software maker, acquired by the company for $11bn in 2011.The S&P 500 energy sector index was 0.1 per cent higher as benchmark crude prices rose.Refiners including Valero Energy, which gained 4.2 per cent to $45.55, pared some of their losses after a recent sell-off.Heading into Tuesday’s trade, analysts at Barclays said the ten largest publicly traded independent refiners had lost a total market value of $5bn. They added that the declines may be due to investor concerns over the impact of an increase in biofuel prices.Google lost 0.9 per cent to $827.61 as the internet search and advertising company agreed to pay $7m in a settlement with 38 US states for violating privacy rights.VeriFone rose 6 per cent to $21.68 a day after the electronics payments services company said its longstanding chief executive would step down. The company, which has lost 27 per cent from the start of the year, recently acknowledged that it had struggled in shifting from hardware-based business into software services.John Williams, analyst at UBS, said the management change should be a reason for investors to reconsider its shares: “Investors who were uncomfortable with management may not take a fresh look.”

113;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-02-25T16:28:11Z;Yum Brands tightens Chinese supply chain;;Yum Brands is fighting to restore its battered image in China, vowing to tighten monitoring of its mainland supply chain after a chicken safety scare dealt a big blow to its sales in the country.Earlier this month, Yum Brands, owner of the KFC fast-food chain, forecast a drop in 2013 earnings due to the fallout from food safety concerns surrounding its Chinese business. Allegations in December that the company’s suppliers had injected growth hormones and antiviral drugs into chicken beyond food safety limits hit confidence in the brand, which had previously traded on its reputation for food that is safer than domestic fast-food competitors.On Monday, Yum, the biggest foreign restaurateur in China by sales, went on the offensive to try to limit damage from the scandal, announcing that it would strengthen oversight of its suppliers and expand drug testing, and added that more than 1,000 small producers used by the company’s 25 poultry suppliers had been eliminated from its network.Yum blamed the problem on “ineffective management” at some individual farms, adding that its goal would be to “work on the survival of the fittest of the chicken suppliers”. The company will move closer to a vertically integrated model where chicken is sourced from its own farms in China, but that “will require a big investment and it is also not easy to acquire land as breeding farm in China”, the company said.Yan Qiang, consumer analyst at Hejun Consulting, said the announcement was a good start, “but consumers will judge by the results rather than how loud you make your voice”.Yum sales are likely to continue to feel the impact of the scandal for at least three to six more months, says Shaun Rein of China Market Research in Shanghai, noting that the scare had hit the entire fast-food sector in the country, not just KFC. “Chinese consumers trusted western fast-food brands because they thought they had better control of the supply chain,” but KFC’s statement today outlining problems with the sector “make it sound like it is impossible to control the supply chain”.Yum, which operates Pizza Hut as well as KFC in China, dominates even the burger chain McDonald’s in the mainland fast-food market. It arrived in the country earlier than other fast-food brands, and has long been seen as a model of how to localise a foreign brand while marketing its food as safer than that of local restaurants. Yum said last month that fourth-quarter same-store sales in China, which account for 44 per cent of its total profits and about half of revenues, had fallen 6 per cent.Bian Jiang of the China Cuisine Association said at a press conference with Yum in Beijing: “The chicken incident has had an impact on the whole catering industry [in China]. Many consumers do not dare to eat chicken, and this is definitely not a good sign: in Chinese cuisine, chicken is inevitable.”● H.J.

If the cod is destined for the dinner plate, it may travel another 10,000 miles once it’s dead.Trawled in the Bering Sea, the fish slaps down on a conveyor belt in Qingdao, eastern China. In a vast, chilly factory, a small army of workers attack the semi-frozen fish with glinting knives, separating flesh from bone in ever finer parsing.After it is frozen and loaded into the belly of a cargo ship, the fish disembarks at a processing plant in Europe or the US. It may make yet another journey before ending up, finger-shaped and breadcrumbed, on the plate of a schoolboy in Moscow.The travels of the cod illustrate the lengths to which the $4tn food industry will go to feed the world while making a profit. It also provides a glimpse of how many hands food passes through from farm to fork, giving unscrupulous bit-players a chance to turn a bigger profit for themselves.Consumers are increasingly alarmed that failures and abuses of this convoluted supply chain mean they have little idea what they are eating and whether it is safe. Horsemeat has ended up in so-called beef lasagnes in the UK and other parts of Europe. In the US, Yum Brands – parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut – this month issued a profit warning after high levels of antibiotics were discovered in its chicken. In 2008, melamine-laced milk in China killed six babies and left hundreds of thousands more sick.In the weeks since the horsemeat scandal broke, governments and the food industry have pledged to increase testing of meat. But regulating a fragmented global supply chain is only going to grow more complicated as the food industry prepares to feed an extra 2bn mouths by 2050.Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods conglomerate behind Flora margarine and Dove shampoo, sells 30,000 differently sized products in Europe alone. Globally it calls on more than 160,000 product and service providers linked to production.The distance these goods travel, from farm to factory to shop, is equivalent to going to the moon and back twice a day, every day. “That’s how much our logistics infrastructure has to deal with today,” says Pier Luigi Sigismondi, chief supply chain officer.Robert Lawson, co-founder of Food Strategy Associates and a former industry executive, says a supermarket may have 20,000 product lines, many of these with 10-20 ingredients.“The idea you can check every supplier and every ingredient they are supplying you with – it doesn’t compute. You can’t. It is too enormous a task and at odds with what everyone wants, which is cheaper food.”Add to that DNA testing, a common practice following the horsemeat scandal, “then the end of cheap food is nigh”, he says.Multinational manufacturers such as Unilever conduct much of their quality control right through the chain. But as Nestlé discovered when it was obliged last week to withdraw pasta meals from shelves in Italy and Spain and processed products containing meat from a German supplier, monitoring every link in the chain is tough given multiple layers of outsourcing.“There will be a before and after horsemeat, just as there was a before and after melamine,” says José Lopez, executive vice-president of operations at Nestlé, the world’s biggest food company. “The after will have DNA checks with suppliers, and that means we will have added costs.”These DNA checks, he and others reckon, will not be restricted to horsemeat but extend to other species which, like horsemeat before the revelations, companies would not have thought to test for.“I think we will have to invent new ways of managing traceability of the goods we produce. There’s a need for enhanced traceability, not just documented but also analytical,” he adds.It is a sentiment echoed across the divide of politicians, suppliers and retailers – notwithstanding the blame game that was the inevitable initial reaction – and a revision of the rule book is in many ways overdue.Laws in much of the developed world have their roots in previous eras where the focus was on safety over provenance. Enforcement has also fallen behind as cash-strapped governments cut inspectors.…In the US, outrage at industrial food production methods came in the early 20th century, following the publication of The Jungle, Upton Sinclair’s expose of the Chicago meatpacking industry. Legislation followed, creating the predecessors of two agencies that now oversee most of the food industry. The US Department of Agriculture regulates meat, poultry and some egg products, while the Food and Drug Administration regulates most of the balance, including processed foods – as well as prescription drugs and medical devices.Some see the FDA’s heavier workload as a weakness. “The FDA has too many jobs and too few people to do their jobs adequately, and as a result food safety can get the short end of the stick,” says Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.“The USDA has inspectors in the plants every single day …while the FDA may not visit a plant for five or 10 years.”But the food industry frequently turns to third-party auditors who test supplier facilities for the retailers and restaurants that buy their products.“You had that void and third parties became what was necessary in order for the suppliers to be able to communicate to buyers that they had the food safety controls in place,” says Robert Whitaker, chief science and technology officer at the Produce Marketing Association, a trade group.Cranswick, a midsized UK supplier of meats and pastries, will have nine UK Food Standards Agency inspectors and two veterinarians on each of its sites at any given time, says Adam Couch, chief executive. “The procedures we have to abide by in the UK can make us inefficient and if it is cheaper elsewhere, unscrupulous traders will take that option.”His view is echoed by a food safety executive at Bright Foods, the Shanghai-based dairy group. “The government’s sampling inspection also happens more frequently in recent years. The strength of government policing is so strong that sometimes it is even too much for us to take.”For other manufacturers, a big problem is meeting non-standardised rules across a host of different markets. “We think regulation is good,” says Mr Lopez. “Standardised regulations would be better.”Grumbles about lack of harmonisation reverberate through the food chain. One former industry executive talks about plans to launch a chilled product, in which he checked temperatures in European retailers’ fridges. They went as high as 16°C, and only the UK abided by the recommended 0°C to 5°C.Lack of standardisation also means production costs vary – and can provide another incentive to look further afield for produce. Take pork. Britain imports half the pork it eats, which is both a symptom and a cause of what can go wrong in the food chain. It is a symptom of the UK unilaterally adopting animal welfare rules that raised production costs, say farmers. As a result, a Danish sow’s living conditions are less bucolic but her bacon is much cheaper.As the scandal surrounding beef products adulterated with horsemeat spreads, health regulators are also worrying about the growing problem of illicit alcohol. Cash-strapped countries have imposed higher excise taxes on spirits, raising prices and fomenting a thirst for fake tipple.The problem was highlighted last year when 30 people died from drinking tainted rum in the Czech Republic, leading to a temporary ban of liquor sales.To continue reading, click hereFarmers are the very first link in the food chain – and often occupy the weakest position in it. Whether midsized British pig farmers or smallholders in the Ivory Coast, they can lack the scale of the big retailers and manufacturers that buy their products. Many farmers face great pressure to keep costs as low as possible or risk being forced from the business.Fairtrade, a standard-setting body, uses cocoa to illustrate the point. Four companies accounted for more than half the world’s $82bn of chocolate sales in 2010 and have pummelled growers’ share of the spoils: cocoa growers, it says, receive just 3.5 per cent of the average retail value of a chocolate bar, compared with 18 per cent in the 1980s.Giving the farmer a fairer share, enabling him to invest more to improve yields and quality, would in turn help improve the supply chain, says Justin Sherrard, a global strategist at Rabobank.Many multinational manufacturers and some retailers concur. The biggest players have teams of agronomists to help farmers boost yields. McDonald’s has devoted an entire global advertising campaign to its bonds with farmers.…China – a key link in the global supply chain, and fast becoming the world’s largest grocery market – was forced to respond to the melamine scandal. The government dedicated more money and manpower to food safety, but analysts say the results have been mixed.“I don’t see any qualitative change in the Chinese government’s food supervision after the melamine scandal was exposed,” says Wu Heng, the founder of Zhichuchuangwai, a website tracking China’s food safety.“The most significant administrative change was the establishment of a national food safety commission, but its real function remains to be seen.”Zhou Zhiren, of the Government Management School of Peking University, sees food safety improving “step by step, thanks mainly to the awareness of food safety among the public and media supervision”.Eric Trachtenberg of McLarty Associates, a US strategic advisory firm and a former USDA official in Beijing, is more upbeat thanks in part to a restructuring of the industry in China, with more modern supermarkets and greater penetration by multinationals that bring in higher international standards.“When you have modern retail, you have companies with better control over the supply chain,” he says.But Mr Trachtenberg, like others, is also quick to cite the role of Weibo, the Twitter-like messaging service in China.“There is fear of social media: if a product is not good, it’s going to be on Weibo in three seconds and within a day you will have thousands of people commenting on it.”That resounds across the global food industry: fear of public reprisal, and losing reputation, is every bit as potent whether propagated by teenagers on Facebook or activists camped out in far-flung parts of the world.And scandals hurt. In the week after the horsemeat scandal broke in Britain, retail sales of frozen burgers, the product that sparked the revelations, fell 40 per cent, according to Nielsen, the market research group.The irony is that all these discarded burgers and uneaten horsemeat lasagnes add to tonnes of wasted food, which does nothing for the bottom line of any players in the food chain.“There is such a huge amount of slack in the system at the moment in how badly we are doing things,” says Tristram Stuart, author of Waste. “The very fact there’s a series of idiocies within our food supply chain [means] there’s also an opportunity.”Farmers and consumers can only hope it is an opportunity used to maximise quality and pricing – rather than exploited for the reverse.Additional reporting by Yan Zhang in Shanghai

117;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-02-04T23:23:34Z;Yum Brands: wings clipped?;Chinese poultry scandal has not gone away;"Yum Brands shares are going to do as well, in the long term, as its restaurants do in China. Roughly half its profit comes from China, and the company is opening a huge number of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut stores there – 889 in 2012, a 17 per cent increase. Until recently, it has expanded Chinese same-store sales nicely too. If Yum can keep this up, its sluggish US operations become less important and its prospects in other emerging markets, such as India, more exciting.A government inquiry into the safety of Yum’s poultry supply chain, and the accompanying bad publicity, drove same-store sales in China down 6 per cent in the fourth quarter, which was reported on Monday evening. This is not too worrisome in itself. Restaurants with strong brands can overcome quality problems. Same-store sales growth had been slowing before the inquiry, however. Back in the third quarter, all the same-store growth was from price increases; volumes were down. A slowing economy could explain this. But Yum’s returns on capital are so high in China – it says its cash returns on a new restaurant can reach 50 per cent a year – that one must wonder when competition will ramp up.These anxieties will only be increased by the company’s new 2013 profit outlook. Management said it could not reliably predict how long it would take Chinese sales to recover but, on the assumption that same-store sales growth returned in the fourth quarter, earnings per share would fall in 2013. It is hard to read this as a confident statement about either the end of the supply chain scandal or the firmness of the underlying market. Yum’s shares fell 9 per cent in the regular trading session and after hours on Monday, and look to be stalled until the China situation becomes much clearer than it is today.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
118;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-02-04T23:00:44Z;China concerns eat into Yum profits;Shares slide 6% on future earnings warning;Yum Brands, owner of the KFC fast-food chain, has forecast a drop in 2013 earnings due to the continued fallout from food safety concerns surrounding its Chinese business.The Kentucky-based company said it expected a mid-single-digit drop in earnings per share in 2013, as it announced fourth-quarter earnings. Its shares tumbled about 6 per cent in after-market trading.“Due to continued negative same-store sales and our assumption that it will take time to recover confidence, we no longer expect to achieve EPS growth in 2013,” David Novak, chief executive, warned.Allegations in December that Yum’s suppliers had injected growth hormones and antiviral drugs into chicken beyond food safety limits sparked outrage, with some consumers calling for a boycott on Sina Weibo, the popular social media network.Yum last month said same-store sales in China in the fourth quarter, which account for 44 per cent of its total profits and around half of revenues, had fallen 6 per cent.Fast food consumption in China has grown rapidly in recent years, with western groups, including KFC and McDonald’s enjoying a reputation for quality ingredients. That made the allegations against Yum particularly damaging. Yum is the country’s leading western restaurant company by sales and number of restaurants.The company said the “past seven weeks of media attention have been intense and negative towards the KFC brand image”, and meant that same-store sales in China for January and February combined would drop 25 per cent compared with the same period last year.Jack Russo, analyst at Edward Jones and Co, said Yum would recover but the shares fell sharply as few had expected December’s food safety scare in China to continue into 2013.“For 10 to 12 years in a row they’ve increased EPS, so for them to say 2013 is going to be down is really a surprise,” he said. “The carry-over impact is really the big story here.”The company expects same-store sales in China to improve throughout 2013 and see positive growth by the fourth quarter.Jonathan Blum, chief public affairs officer, said Yum will launch an aggressive marketing plan soon after Chinese New Year next weekend that involves product innovation and working with suppliers to rebuild the brand’s reputation.“We’ve had adversity before – we always bounce back,” he said. “Our brands are resilient.”In the fourth quarter, Yum reported earnings of $337m, or 72 cents a share, including exceptional items, compared with $356m, or 77 cents, during the same period last year. Revenues rose 1 per cent year-on-year to $4.15bn.Excluding special items, Yum saw earnings of 83 cents per share. Wall Street analysts had forecast 82 cents per share on $4.12bn in revenues.“Although Yum already has begun addressing the concerns with consumers, we would not be surprised if the ongoing media attention has pressured consumer sentiment and [same-store sales] for KFC China in Q1,” David Tarantino, analyst at Baird, said in a pre-earnings note to investors.For the full year, same store sales in China rose 4 per cent, down from a 19 per cent rise in 2011.Yum reported full-year earnings of $3.38 per share, including special items, on revenues of $13.63bn, compared with $2.87 per share on $12.63bn in revenues during 2011.
119;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-02-04T22:30:23Z;KFC in China: it’s bad, bad, bad;;"As expected, a dreadful fourth quarter for Yum! Brands following furor over a food safety scare in China.Like-for-like sales growth in China – a market that now accounts for half of total group revenues and profits – fell 6 per cent for the quarter, compared to the 21 per cent increase seen during Q4 of 2011.But the worst is yet to come. The company said it expects same-store sales in China to fall “approximately 25 per cent for January and February combined”.From Yum’s press release:Given current uncertainties related to KFC sales in China, it is difficult to confidently forecast our overall financial performance. We have made the assumption that KFC China same-store sales will improve as the year progresses and will be positive in the fourth quarter. With these assumptions, we estimate a mid-single digit EPS decline in 2013 versus prior year, excluding Special Items. This includes an expectation for a significant decline in EPS performance in the first half of the year followed by EPS growth in the second half.The single decline in 2013 earnings per share will come after the group – which also operates Taco Bells and Pizza Huts – delivered 11 consecutive years of EPS growth.Small wonder investors headed for the hills on Monday. Shares in Yum! were down by as much as 6 per cent in after-market trading and has lost 14 per cent since the end of November when the company first warned on its China business.Yum!, the biggest foreign restaurateur in China by sales, became ensnared in the food safety scandal after a state television report found that some of KFC’s poultry suppliers had injected an excessive level of antiviral drugs and growth hormones into their chickens in order to accelerate their growth cycles.The allegations sparked outrage, with some consumers calling for a boycott on Sina Weibo, the popular social media network.David Novak, Yum!’s chief executive, acknowledged on Monday it would “take time to recover consumer confidence” in China, which generated more than $1bn in operating profits last year for the group.Nonetheless, he remained upbeat over the group’s prospects in the country:Although we cannot predict how long it will take to restore sales, we are steadfast in our belief that the power and popularity of the KFC brand in China will ultimately drive a full sales recovery. Having weathered other storms in the past, we know that our brands are resilient. As a result, we will stay the course with our target to develop at least 700 new units in 2013 in China to lay the foundation for future growth, and will not let this event detract from our unparalleled China growth opportunity.Related reading:

Shares rallied in after-hours trading and rose again on Wednesday, closing up 4.4 per cent to $204.72.Better than expected results from both companies, as well as gains in Apple, scheduled to report results after market close, lifted the S&P 500 information technology sector, which was up more than 1 per cent by midday, even though broader markets were mixed.Apple shares closed 1.9 per cent higher at $514.17 ahead of the most anticipated earnings release.After the market close, the iPhone and iPad maker announced $13.81 in earnings per share, slightly above estimates, however it missed expectations on revenues due to lower iPhone sales. The stock lost more than 5 per cent in extended trading following the announcement.The benchmark S&P 500 dipped in and out of negative territory, however, the index finished the day 0.1 per cent higher at 1,494.78, hitting a fresh five-year high.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.5 per cent higher at 13,779.17. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 3,153.67.A research note from Bespoke Investment Group said more than three quarters of stocks on the S&P 500 index were overbought – trading above their 50-day moving average. The research says such overconfidence often leads to a sharp drop weeks and months after.“Markets are waiting for more substantive news from the Congress on the fate of the debt ceiling,” said Jeremy Zirin, chief equities strategist at UBS Wealth Management.Commenting on the technology sector he struck an optimistic tone: “Valuations are at a two decade low and trading at an 8 per cent discount to the benchmark. Among the S&P 500 sectors, we expect the tech sector to have the strongest returns in 2013.”Jerry Webman, chief economist at OppenheimerFunds, while optimistic about equities in general, cautions that national equity markets are misleading.“Investors should look at companies not from the point of view of the geography of their headquarters but their operations – where their revenues are coming from and where are their largest costs.”“While we see a broad-based rally, as fundamentals and the global economy improve, we will see that markets will get selective,” he added.In earnings news, McDonald’s shares were higher after the world’s largest fast-food chain restaurant by sales modestly beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations.The company struggled in 2012 with disappointing sales and declining profits during the global slowdown and competition from the likes of Yum Brands and Wendy’s. Its share price lost 12.1 per cent last year, making it among the worst hit Dow components.On Wednesday, McDonald’s shares added 0.6 per cent to $93.48.General Dynamics shares fell after the defence contractor reported an annual loss following an impairment charge in the fourth quarter due to a decline in government spending in the US and overseas. The stock dropped 1 per cent to $71.45.United Technologies, diversified industrial group, reported that fourth-quarter profit jumped 55 per cent to $2.06bn. Shares were 0.7 per cent higher at $88.07.In other earnings news, AMD shares added 11.4 per cent to $2.73 after the semiconductor company reported higher profits than expected by analysts.In contrast, Coach shares shed 16.4 per cent to $50.75 after quarterly earnings missed analysts’ expectations. The largest handbag maker in North America reported lower sales during the holiday season as well as sluggish recovery from superstorm Sandy.
121;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-01-10T12:55:43Z;Yum apologises for handling of food scare;;Yum Brands, owner of the KFC fast-food chain, has issued a belated apology to consumers in China for the way it handled a recent food scare, underlining the struggles that the US company faces in the increasingly competitive Chinese market.Yum, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut in China, is the biggest foreign restaurateur in the country by sales, dominating even McDonald’s in the fast-food market. It arrived in China earlier than other fast-food brands, and has long been seen as a model of how to localise a foreign brand while marketing its food as safer and of higher quality than that of local restaurants.Last month’s food scare, prompted by a state television report saying that some chickens supplied to KFC and McDonald’s had excessive amounts of antiviral drugs and growth hormones, hit sales hard. Some consumers called for a boycott of the company on Sina Weibo, a popular microblogging site.Same-store sales fell 6 per cent during the fourth quarter, Yum said in a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing earlier this week, attributing this to “adverse publicity associated with a government review of China poultry supply”.Problems in China are a serious matter for Yum, since the mainland accounts for almost half of the company’s revenues.“They are falling behind the competition in China because they have failed to evolve their business model with the changing Chinese consumer,” says Shaun Rein of China Market Research in Shanghai. “Their outlets look dingy and dirty compared to McDonald’s . . . They haven’t really localised as well as McDonald’s, not in terms of food but in terms of ambience.”Consumers in China often look to fast-food outlets as a dining out experience, unlike in the west, where they are seen as a convenience.Su Jingshi, chairman and chief executive of Yum China, wrote on the company’s Weibo microblog: “It now appears there were regrettable shortcomings in the self-checking process . . . and a lack of internal communication.”The company apologised for being too slow to shift to different suppliers, saying also that it failed adequately to report test results to the government and lacked “swift and transparent external communications”.The apology was greeted with some scepticism in the blogosphere, where several comments criticised it as too little too late: “Now your business is not good so you realise you should come out and make an apology. What did you do at first?” asked one. Another said: “No matter how they apologise, how can they make sure it will never happen again?”Additional reporting by Yan Zhang in Shanghai
122;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-01-08T22:31:06Z;Wall St lower at start of earnings season;;Shares in Yum Brands, which owns fast-food restaurant chains such as KFC and Pizza Hut, dropped sharply after the company warned that a controversy surrounding its Chinese operations would hit fourth-quarter earnings.China accounts for about half of Yum’s profits and revenues, and is expected to generate $1bn in operating income in 2012. The stock lost 4.2 per cent to $65.04 on Tuesday.David Tarantino, analyst at Baird, slightly lowered his fourth-quarter estimates for the company but remained optimistic about the outlook. “We are trimming estimates for the fourth quarter and 2013. We are optimistic that recent issues in China – negative headlines regarding supply chain – could prove transitory in nature, and as a result, we view the one-year-out risk-reward on Yum as attractive for patient investors.”Overall, US stocks continued to move lower as investors turned their attention from fiscal cliff-related issues to corporate fundamentals. Alcoa kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season in earnest, reporting after the closing bell.Analysts’ expectations for corporate earnings have come down significantly since the beginning of the year and are expected to be near the 3 per cent growth mark, according to S&P Capital IQ.Earnings were disappointing in the second and third quarters, as companies were reluctant to invest in an uncertain economic environment before Congress struck a budget deal earlier this month.Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, said that earnings results this week would give investors clues to whether the fiscal cliff battle had inflicted any damage on corporate profits.“We saw weak business investment act as a drag on growth during the third quarter of 2012. This generally extended into the fourth quarter as corporate leaders were more likely to sit on cash, or return it to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, rather than make longer-term investments by increasing capital expenditures or ramping up hiring.”The S&P 500 index closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,457.15, retreating from its multi-month peak reached after an impressive post-cliff rally last week. With the exception of healthcare and materials stocks, all S&P 500 sectors were in negative territory, with telecoms leading losses, down 2.5 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,328.85 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2 per cent to 3,091.81.Alcoa officially kicked off the earnings season by reporting slightly better than expected profits on higher revenues. The US’s largest aluminium producer also raised its estimate for 2013 global aluminium demand growth from 6 per cent to 7 per cent. Shares rose 1.9 per cent to $9.30 in after-hours trading.Apollo Group also reported quarterly earnings after the closing bell, but the results disappointed investors and shares sold off in after-hours trading, falling 3.2 per cent to $20.92. Revenues at the largest for-profit higher education company in the US decreased as enrolment continued to fall at its flagship universities for the third straight quarter.Monsanto shares rallied 2.7 per cent to $98.50 after the producer of genetically modified seeds reported surprisingly strong earnings and raised its outlook for fiscal year 2013. The company said net income rose 170 per cent as demand jumped in Latin America, while last year’s US drought drove genetically engineered seed demand.Shares in Sears Holdings lost 6.4 per cent to $40.16 after the operator of department stores in the US and Canada announced the sudden departure of Lou D’Ambrosio, its chief executive. Eddie Lampert, the hedge fund manager who chairs and controls Sears Holdings, is to take over the reins.Shares in Celgene Corp rose 6.6 per cent to $91.41 after analysts at two brokerages upgraded the biopharmaceutical company’s stock rating.Piper Jaffray raised its ranking to “overweight” and analysts at RBC Capital upgraded the stock to “outperform”.Shares in GameStop fell 6.3 per cent to $23.19, as the US video games retailer reported a 4.4 per cent drop in total sales over the nine-week holiday season and narrowed its fourth-quarter earnings estimate.

124;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-01-08T00:25:52Z;Yum’s China woes: it’s the toxic chickens;;"So it was the toxic chicken accusations afterall.Shares in Yum! Brands fell more than 5 per cent in aftermarket trading on Monday after the inanely-punctuated US owner of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut said China sales fell more than expected.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company, which makes about half of its revenues and profits from China, said same-store sales there fell 6 per cent during the fourth quarter, compared to the 4 per cent contraction it had previously forecast at the end of November.At the time, David Novak, Yum’s chief executive, blamed the “softer” sales in China on the country’s weakening economy. But as beyondbrics first noted last month, Yum’s China woes also probably have to do with uproar over the “fast” chicken scandal.In November, Chinese media accused Su Hai Group, one of the chicken suppliers to KFC (Yum’s flagship brand in China with 3,700 outlets), of injecting antiviral drugs and growth hormones into poultry in ways that violated mainland food safety regulations.This was followed by a CCTV report a month later that accused another KFC supplier, Liuhe Group, of similar practices that helped accelerate the growth cycle of the chickens from 100 days to just 40 days.Shortly after the TV report aired, the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) said it found that eight of the 19 batches of chicken samples Yum sent to a testing laboratory in 2010 and 2011 contained overly-high levels of antibiotics.While Yum said it had severed its ties with Liuhe and pledged to cooperate with the authorities, the damage has already been done.From Yum’s filing:Due to adverse publicity associated with a government review of China poultry supply – and the corresponding significant impact on KFC China sales during the last two weeks of December – we now expect China Division same-store sales to be -6% for the fourth quarter of 2012, versus our previous forecast of -4%. The Company expects full-year 2012 earnings per share, excluding Special Items, of approximately $3.24.This compares with the average EPS of $3.26 expected by 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company plans to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2012 results on Feb. 4.Shares in Yum are down nearly 9 per cent since the company issued its surprise sales warning on November 30. The fall excludes the drop seen in aftermarket trading on Monday.In a country that has been rattled by food scandals that range from tainted milk to exploding watermelon, Yum has its work cut out before it if it is to win back China’s ever more discerning diners.Related reading:

125;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-01-08T00:19:25Z;Yum licking its wounds in China;;Shares in Yum Brands fell in after-market trading on Monday after the owner of the KFC fast-food chain warned that a controversy surrounding its Chinese operations would hit fourth-quarter earnings.“Due to adverse publicity associated with a government review of China poultry supply – and the corresponding significant impact on KFC China sales during the last two weeks of December,” same-store sales fell 6 per cent during the fourth quarter, Yum said in a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing.Yum had previously forecast a quarterly 4 per cent drop in same-store sales at its KFC outlets. Yum’s shares fell more 5 per cent in after-market trading.China accounts for around half of Yum’s profits and revenues and is expected to generate $1bn in operating income in 2012. It is also China’s leading western restaurant company by sales and number of restaurants.Allegations last month that Yum’s suppliers had injected growth hormones and antiviral drugs into chicken beyond food safety limits sparked outrage, with some consumers calling for a boycott on Sina Weibo, the popular microblogging site.Fast food consumption in China has grown rapidly in recent years, with western groups, including KFC and McDonald’s, enjoying a reputation for quality ingredients. That made the allegations against Yum particularly damaging.In late November, when the Kentucky-based company warned that same-store China sales would fall 4 per cent – the first quarterly decline since 2009 – Yum’s shares fell more than 10 per cent. Same-store sales rose nearly 20 per cent in 2011 compared to the year prior.Analysts have questioned why the company’s performance has deteriorated while other groups, such as Starbucks, continued to see growth in sales and a time when China’s economy improved after a period when growth fell.Weiwei Chen, chief financial officer of Yum’s China business, said in December that Beijing’s plan to double per capita income in China was expected to bring 600m more people into the consumer class, increasing demand for fried chicken and pizza.The company, which will report its fourth quarter and full-year results on February 4, said in its filing with the SEC that it expects earnings per share, excluding special items, to be $3.24.
126;YUM;Yum! Brands;2013-01-01T14:32:05Z;S&P 500 poised for new highs in 2013;;After finishing 2012 on a high note, investors believe US equities are bound to extend last year’s run.Progress made in US fiscal negotiations, easing eurozone fears and recent supportive economic data from China and other developing nations may help set the stage for higher corporate profits and stock gains, analysts say.“As we begin the new year, improved confidence is perhaps the result of strides made on many fronts,” says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Mr Paulsen is forecasting that the benchmark S&P 500 will rise to record levels in the year to come, after notching an impressive 13.4 per cent gain in 2012 in spite of recession fears and a jump in global market volatility.But while at the start of last year investors bet heavily on technology companies such as Apple, this time around most are favouring cyclical sectors such as basic materials and industrials.“The sectors that tend to benefit from economic growth will see the most benefit in the coming months,” says Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones.The group was among the top performing on Monday, when Wall Street rallied as details of a deal to avoid the looming fiscal cliff started to emerge. New manufacturing data from China also supported bullish sentiment, helping companies such as Cliffs Natural Resources, the international coalminer, record large gains.Oliver Pursche, portfolio manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services, says fears of a US recession in 2013, which weighed on stocks in the last quarter, are misplaced.“Economic data both in the US and globally have been fairly robust recently but markets have not recognised these positive developments because all eyes were set on the fiscal cliff debate,” he says.Mr Pursche adds that he has taken some profits ahead of expected increases in capital gains and dividends taxes. He is now betting on stocks of companies with solid balance sheets and dividend policies, and expected revenue and earnings growth of 8 per cent or higher.“One of our favourite sectors is food and beverages,” he says. “We think the group is well positioned to meet those three goals and there’s been a lot of activity. We like companies like Pepsi and Yum Brands, but we are not just focusing on large-caps. There are some opportunities on smaller companies as well.”But not all analysts are as enthusiastic, pointing to potential weakness in consumer confidence and spending patterns, which could inhibit companies’ growth.Barry Knapp, chief US equities strategist at Barclays, says the consumer discretionary sector is particularly vulnerable as household income growth remains weak. Adding further pressure to that group of stocks, which is already reeling from a disappointing holiday selling period, is an expected rise in payroll taxes for many Americans.“That will mean people who are living from pay cheque to pay cheque will see their budgets shrink, putting some pressure on retailers,” Ms Warne adds.Mr Knapp says value retailers, in particular, may bear the brunt. That includes companies such as Macy’s, Sears, Kohl’s, JC Penney and Dillard’s, which saw large gains on Monday after recent weakness. Any relief from higher taxes may provide only a temporary boost to middle-class consumers’ spending habits, he says.Whatever happens in 2013, some investors are just hoping that the attention shifts away from policy makers and back on to the economic fundamentals of companies.J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, says: “The market has been asking Washington for clarity on the rules but it has instead been held hostage on multiple occasions, adding to people’s worries about their businesses.”
127;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-12-24T18:26:34Z;Stalled fiscal cliff talks weigh on Wall St;;US equity markets inched lower in holiday-shortened trading on Monday, as hopes faded for a resolution to the fiscal cliff of automatic spending cuts and tax increases before the year end.There was little sign of even a partial fix as both parties blamed one another for stalled negotiations. John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, suffered defeat last Friday when his proposed “Plan B” did not garner enough support within his party.President Barack Obama’s concessions over tax increases were rejected by the Republicans last week. Both parties agreed to continue negotiations this week.Analysts at PNC Financial Services were optimistic about the prospects of a budget deal, however.“We still believe a deal will get done to avoid the majority of the fiscal drag, but it may not happen until early in the new year. Nevertheless, we continue to expect spates of financial market volatility through the negotiation process,” they wrote in a note.While trading volumes were low on Monday with most investors away on holidays, volatility rose markedly. The CBOE Vix index, which measures implied volatility on the S&P 500 index, rose 4.1 per cent, adding to gains in the last four sessions.The benchmark S&P 500 index traded in a narrow range and finished 0.2 per cent lower at 1,426.66, with most major sectors in negative territory.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,139.08 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3 per cent to 3,012.60.Defying the market, some stocks performed well after a flurry of upgrades from analysts. TripAdvisor, an online travel booking company, rose after analysts at Needham & Company raised their share price target from $38 to $51. The shares jumped 4 per cent at the open but gave up most of their gains to finish 0.7 per cent higher at $42.25.JC Penney, the troubled department store group, jumped as high as 4 per cent but gave up early gains to finish 1.4 per cent higher at $19.87 after some analysts issued positive reports about store traffic and business in the crucial Christmas shopping season.Shares in Yum! Brands, which owns fast food restaurant chains such as KFC and Pizza Hut, added 1.8 per cent to $65.014 as analysts at Bank of America reaffirmed their “buy” rating with a share price target of $76.Ford was another winner in Monday’s trading, with shares jumping 4.5 per cent to $12.40 amid higher volume.Among heavy fallers was Hewlett-Packard, dropping 2.3 per cent to $14.01. The manufacturer of PCs took a $8.8bn hit last quarter, when it wrote down the value of its $11bn purchase of Autonomy, the UK enterprise software company.First Solar, fell 2.1 per cent to $30.26. The manufacturer of solar modules has lost more than 10 per cent since the beginning of the year.Advanced Micro Devices, manufacturer of microchips, was among losers on Monday, shedding 4.2 per cent to $2.48. The stock has lost more than half its market value since January.
128;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-12-21T22:35:21Z;Pizza Hut to shut 70 high street outlets;;Pizza Hut plans to close around a fifth of its sit-down restaurants as the chain withdraws from the UK’s struggling high streets in an effort to boost flagging profits.The chain, which has 330 restaurants, wants to close about 70 of them and open some new ones in shopping centres and transport hubs.“We have a number of restaurants in the wrong locations, in particular on high streets which don’t attract the footfall they did five to 10 years ago,” said Jens Hofma, the Dutch managing director of Pizza Hut UK. “We need less high streets and retail parks, which are in decline, and more shopping malls, leisure centres and, potentially, travel hubs such as railways and airports.”The shift comes after Rutland Partners, the private equity group, bought Pizza Hut’s eat-in restaurants from US-based Yum Brands in November for an undisclosed sum. Mr Hofma, who worked for KFC – a Yum brand – in the Netherlands and Germany, said Pizza Hut would invest £60m over the next five years to refurbish restaurants.Pizza Hut opened its first restaurant in the UK in 1973, but as the chain faced increasing competition from Italian casual dining rivals such as PizzaExpress and the Restaurant Group-owned Frankie & Benny’s, sales volumes went down and profitability declined, according to the company.“We have been slow in responding to that change in the landscape – we were resting on our laurels,” said Mr Hofma.In Birmingham’s Bullring the company has opened one of four “new generation” outlets. The revamp includes soft lighting, glass walls, booth seating and a prominent salad bar. There is also pasta cooked in-house and thin-crust pizzas – although the orange sauce splashed on the BBQ Americano pizza is as cloyingly sweet as before.Mr Hofma, who works a shift as a waiter every two weeks, said that the restaurant still had a lot of persuading to do. “There’s a gap in perception between what we’re doing in our restaurants and what the public think,” he said. “We’ve got to make sure our pizzas are worth the premium and the effort, rather than a takeaway pizza or buying one at the supermarket.”If the new concept proves successful Yum, which continues to own the brand and operates Pizza Hut’s takeaway business, will roll it out across Pizza Hut’s international portfolio.“In 2012 profitability improved . . . we are in the middle of a turnround,” said Mr Hofma. “Once we get lunch and dinner [right] then we will start to look at breakfast.”Struggling restaurant chains have been ripe turnround targets recently. Earlier this year, Burger King, the US restaurant chain, sold a 29 per cent stake to Justice Holdings, a UK investment vehicle, which took the company public again.
129;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-12-19T14:37:08Z;Poultry scare hits Yum Brands’ reputation;;Yum Brands, which owns the popular fast-food chain KFC, saw its reputation in China shaken on Wednesday by allegations that its suppliers injected antiviral drugs and growth hormones into poultry in ways that violated mainland food safety regulations.Chinese consumers, spooked by a seemingly unending series of food quality scares, responded vociferously on Sina Weibo, the popular microblogging site, with a handful calling for a boycott of KFC or even of western fast food in general.In urban China, high property prices, long commutes, gruelling working hours, a later marriage age and smaller families have added up to rapid growth in fast food consumption in recent years.Foreign fast food has a far better reputation in China than in the west, although China’s consumers are rapidly becoming more sophisticated and conscious of the dangers of fat-laden eating, many still see brands such as KFC and McDonald’s as a guarantee that they are at least eating quality ingredients that will not poison them. That makes allegations such as those levelled against Yum potentially damaging.Yum, which last week warned of its first quarterly fall in same store China sales since 2009, said in a statement released in China that it is “actively co-operating” with government authorities to investigate the claims, made in a state television broadcast on Tuesday night. “If we find any illegal conduct by the suppliers, we will definitely deal with it seriously,” the statement said.But some consumers were not satisfied and vented their frustration on Sina Weibo. “KFC, I cannot easily believe in you now. Before the final investigation report comes out, I’d better boycott you for a while,” said one. “I appeal to everyone to boycott KFC and McDonald’s. Your children will become chemical hormone packages if they continue eating it,” said another.McDonald’s, which was also mentioned in the broadcast, issued a statement in China saying that its chicken was tested by a third-party laboratory and complied with government standards. “Please feel safe to eat it,” the company said.With $1bn in operating income this year, China accounts for about half of Yum’s profits and revenues. It is the country’s leading western restaurant company by sales and number of restaurants.Analysts have questioned why Yum’s performance has suffered so dramatically even as China’s economy, which has slowed, appears to have stabilised. Yum has blamed weakened consumer spending, but other groups, such as Starbucks, have continued to see growing sales in China.Additional reporting by Yan Zhang
130;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-12-10T23:46:29Z;McDonald’s – happy meal;Value options revive sales but tricky choices await for the Golden Arches;It has been a disappointing year for the makers of the Happy Meal. No wonder investors were pleasantly surprised on Monday when McDonald’s reported a 2.4 per cent jump in global same-store sales for November, beating analysts’ expectations. The upbeat month follows two back-to-back quarters of disappointing earnings and, in October, the first decline in monthly comparable-store sales in nine years.Indeed, performance under the Golden Arches has deteriorated this year as the global economy faltered. Most of the burger chain’s revenue comes from outside the US. Meanwhile, competitors such as Burger King, Yum Brands and Wendy’s have shored up their menus, luring customers with new items. McDonald’s shares have lost more than 10 per cent this year, making them among the worst performers in the Dow.An aggressive push on its value options – such as the Dollar Menu – revived sales growth in November as did the improving popularity of the cheddar bacon onion sandwich. December should also get a boost from the reintroduction of the McRib sandwich. The shares gained 1 per cent on Monday, beating the broader market.The turnabout in November is a good sign, but McDonald’s faces challenges into 2013. First, a focus on value options threatens to put pressure on margins. Then there are tough comparisons ahead: same-store sales rose 6.7 per cent in January this year and 7.5 per cent in February. Perhaps most important, though, innovation looks trickier for McDonald’s against its peers. It led the way in expanding the fast-food menu with healthy options and better coffee, but the competition is playing catch-up. At $89, the shares trade at 15 times forward earnings, in line with their historical average, a sign that investors are waiting to see if McDonald’s can keep surprising them.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Brands, owner of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell branded fast food chains, is set this month to rollout expansion plans for Ukraine, a vast country of 46m consumers where 74 McDonald’s restaurants are among the group’s busiest globally with no competition yet from traditional rivals.The US-based group is expected to launch its first KFC restaurant in Ukraine on December 14. Three leading franchisees have been chosen to expand the group’s presence in Ukraine and the nearby region.People familiar with the group said that more than 100 KFC restaurants at a cost of $2m each could be opened up within five years.“If you look at the quick service restaurant penetration of Ukraine, it is many times lower compared to nearby Poland and Russia,” said Petro Matiaszek, senior vice-president of US-based Global Restaurant Group, one of the franchise partners chosen by Yum! Brands.“If you are going to bring another quick service restaurant into a country that only has McDonald’s, then it’s got to be KFC. In the future, we want to bring other international brands into Ukraine as well,” he added.Yuriy Kosyuk, chief executive of London-listed MHP, Ukraine’s leading poultry producer, said his company was negotiating to become a supplier for KFC’s expanding business in Ukraine and abroad.
132;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-12-07T02:39:56Z;KFC in China: it’s not just the economy;;"Yum Brands, operator of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, gave a robust defense of its business in China on Thursday, saying the surprise four per cent contraction it expects to see in its fourth quarter sales there is just a blip.The company, which spent the last two decades conquering the Chinese fast food scene, blamed the sales stumble on the slowdown in the Chinese economy. Yet in a country where the fight for stomach share is fierce and diners are as picky as their tastes are fickle, there are reasons to think that Yum’s China woes go beyond the catch-all of weaker consumer spending.After all, other groups, including McDonald’s and Starbucks, have continued to see sales grow in China. (McDonald’s saw Q3 like-for-like sales in China increase 3.6 per cent while Starbucks’ LFL Q3 sales in China and the Asia Pacific region were up 12 per cent. Elsewhere, Prada on Thursday reported a 43.6 per cent jump in sales from Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau) for the nine months to the end of October.)Of course, that is not to say that growth in Chinese consumer spending has not shown signs of slowing: Mulberry, Burberry, and Chow Tai Fook are among those that have blamed faltering demand in China for their weak earnings in recent months.But what the differences in performances suggest is that Chinese consumers have become much more discerning when it comes to parting with their renminbi – be it for a handbag or for food.On this front, KFC might do well to have a trawl through diners’ comments on Weibo – a Twitter-like service in China.From Reuters:Interviews with diners in Shanghai and Beijing, and a review of comments on Sina Weibo – China’s equivalent to Twitter – show many diners are unhappy with KFC’s half a dozen or so price increases in recent years, as well as changes in the local menu.The new products “are horrible, not as good as before,” said Queen Hu, 24, a consultant at accounting firm PwC. She used to eat frequently at KFC when she was in college, but has since cut back to about two to three times a year.And then there are the toxic chicken accusations.Late last month, Chinese media accused Su Hai Group, one of the chicken suppliers to KFC (Yum’s flagship brand in China with 3,700 outlets), of feeding toxic chemicals to chickens to accelerate their growth cycle from 100 days to a mere 45.The report, which has been dismissed as “untrue” by Yum, struck a nerve with consumers – who have been rattled by an endless series of food safety scandals in recent years. So paranoid are consumers in China about possible food contamination that a lucrative cottage industry has developed in Shenzhen in southern China, where people make daily crossings into Hong Kong to stock up on everything from baby formula to soy sauce for resale in the mainland (HK is seen to have more stringent regulatory standards and a powerful consumer watchdog).As Yifeng Mao, the head of equity research at Goldpebble Research, noted in this blog post, KFC has been able to command a hefty premium on its offerings because of the perceived safeness of its food:KFC foods occupy the premium market segment, meaning that it is somewhere in the range of double to triple the prices of local restaurants with similar menu offerings. For example, a chicken thigh and a chicken wing are about RMB 8.5 and RMB 4 at KFC, but only RMB 4 and RMB 3 at Country Style Cooking Restaurant Chain (NYSE: CCSC), a KFC knock-off. KFC’s claim to the premium segment lies in its environment – it’s clean, spacious, well-lit and, at least by Chinese restaurant standards, well appointed.But luxury comes with a price tag. An average meal there costs about RMB 25 (~$4) per head, placing KFC in the premium fast-food segment of the industry, not in consumer staple but discretionary spending category. Given the pleasant dine-in atmosphere and nutritious and safe image it has created, locals are happy to pay for it. But all this could change especially as the economy is cooling down.And check out this chart compiled by Mao, summarising the findings of an informal survey conducted by China’s three leading internet sites on their views of KFC in the wake of the toxic chicken furor.Tainted poultry aside, could Yum and its KFC brand simply be a victim of its own success?Yum, now the biggest foreign restaurant chain in China, has grown at a neck-breaking pace in recent years. It will have opened 800 new stores in the country by the end of the year and plans to open another 700 next year. How much fried chicken – however finger lickin’ good they might be – can one really eat?As Starbucks has discovered with its business in the US, at some point, sales are just going to get cannibalised by the new store openings (Remember that Starbucks opening a Starbucks in a Starbucks toilet story in The Onion?).And then, there is the competition. Along with rising wages and food costs and more cautious consumers, Yum now also has to contend with intensifying competition from both Western and local fast food chains.Burger King has recently announced plans to open 1,000 new stores in China over the next five to seven years.Meanwhile, thanks in part to an influx of venture capital and private equity funds in recent years, names such as Ajisen, a Japanese noodle chain; Kung Fu, which sells Chinese comfort food; Banana Leaf, a Thai curry chain and Da Niang Dumpling are increasingly giving their western counterparts a run for their Big Macs and fried chickens.Analysts think KFC still has room to grow in China. As Mao noted, for every million people in China there are only 3.5 YUM restaurants, compared with 58 in the U.S.Yum’s improbable rise to becoming the top dog in the Chinese restaurant scene might have made it the subject of many business case studies. But to stay there, it will need to find a new secret recipe to woo China’s ever more discerning diners.Related reading:

133;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Yum still has a taste for China;;Executives at Yum Brands, the operator of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, on Thursday defended the company’s recent stumbles in China and promised a return to faster sales growth next year.“I’m very confident we’re going to have solid same-store sales growth,” David Novak, Yum’s chief executive, said at the company’s annual investor conference in New York. “I believe in our China business model as much today, if not more, than I ever have.”Shares of Yum fell more than 10 per cent last week when the company warned that its fourth-quarter same-store sales in China would decline 4 per cent year-on-year, marking the first quarterly fall since 2009.With $1bn in operating income this year, China accounts for about half of Yum’s profits and revenues. It is the country’s leading western restaurant company by sales and number of restaurants.Analysts have questioned why the performance has suffered so dramatically even as China’s economy, which has slowed, appears to have stabilised. Yum has blamed weakened consumer spending, but other groups, such as Starbucks, have continued to see growing sales in China.Mr Novak acknowledged that Yum had overestimated its ability to maintain its torrid pace of growth in China, where 2011 same-store sales rose nearly 20 per cent from the prior year. This year sales will rise by 6 per cent, and Yum predicts sales could continue to be sluggish during the first half of 2013 before picking back up in the second half.“It’s simply a function of China getting to be a whole lot bigger,” said Pat Grismer, Yum’s chief financial officer. “With a bigger base, you’re going to grow more slowly.”Yum said that it was facing higher rents and wage costs at its restaurants in China’s biggest cities, pressuring its margins. In light of that, it would take a more “considered” approach to rolling out restaurants in what it calls “tier one” cities while accelerating the pace of development in smaller cities and rural areas.Yum remains optimistic about its China business because of Beijing’s strategy of driving economic growth via domestic consumption rather than through exports and government investment.Weiwei Chen, chief financial officer of Yum’s China business, said that the government’s plan to double per capita income in China was expected to bring 600m people into the consumer class, ramping up potential demand for its fried chicken and pizza.Shares of Yum rose 1.6 per cent to close at $66.92 on Thursday.
134;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

Brands;2012-12-04T20:39:38Z;Baidu, Sina drop on SEC/China accounting impasse [updated];;"The clash between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and China over accounting regulatory standards probably won’t come to a head for another ten months. But the prospect that the SEC’s high-profile attack on the Chinese affiliates of the Big Four and BDO could lead to a wholesale delisting of Chinese companies from the US stock market appeared enough to spook investors.Shares in Nasdaq-listed Baidu, often described as China’s Google, fell 5.8 per cent on Tuesday to $90.37. Meanwhile, Sina, which runs the Twitter-like Weibo service and is also listed on Nasdaq, saw its shares crash 7.9 per cent to $41.89.Both stocks, which are now trading at two-year lows, experienced heavy trading volume. Baidu saw 11.8m shares exchanged hands, compared to its average of 5.2m, while 8m Sina shares were traded compared to an average of 2.5m.Other US-listed Chinese stocks that were hit on Tuesday include:To be sure, not all the price drops can be solely attributed to Monday’s SEC news. Tudou for example posted disappointing Q3 results last week while sentiment for Melco has been hit by reports that China and Macau have cracked down on junket operators that feed gamblers to Macau casinos.Still, the SEC’s decision to launch administrative proceedings against the Chinese affiliates of the Big Four – Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PwC – and BDO for refusing to produce audit papers related to nine Chinese companies suspected of accounting fraud can only further weigh on investor sentiment towards Chinese companies listed in the US.As Paul Gillis, author of the China Accounting Blog and a professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management, noted on Tuesday, the move could mark the beginning of the end. (H/T Kate Mackenzie over at Alphaville for the spot).I believe that this marks the beginning of the process to deregister Chinese accounting firms from the PCAOB and to ban them from practice before the SEC. Unless resolved, this will likely lead to the delisting of U.S. listed Chinese companies. Multinational companies in China may also face issues since PCAOB rules require an auditor playing a substantial role in the audit of an MNC be registered with the PCAOB.…I expect the next action we see is the PCAOB releasing a proposed rule that will revoke the registration of any accounting firm it cannot inspect. I expect that we see this in the next few weeks. The proposed PCAOB rule would be sent out for public comment, which should be vociferous. Any rule has to be approved by the SEC.News of the SEC charges could not have come at a worse time for US-listed Chinese companies, which have seen their shares hit hard after allegations of financial fraud and accounting issues at some Chinese groups (particularly those that came public in the US through reverse mergers) came to light.The Bloomberg China Reverse Merger index, which tracks small Chinese companies that joined US bourses in reverse mergers, has lost 71 per cent of its value since its peak at the start of 2010. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index, which tracks the the 55 most-traded Chinese shares in the US, is down nearly a quarter from its peak last year – including a one per cent drop this week.But the biggest loser in all of this is not necessarily the small Chinese companies – some of which have seen their shares plummet so much already in the wake of the Sino Forest scandal that many are delisting and being taken private by either private equity groups or mainland banks anyway. Instead, it will be the big Chinese companies like Baidu and Sina and potentially US multinationals with China operations.From Paul Gillis again:For the last two decades, China has been near the top of the league tables for inbound foreign direct investment, much of which has come from U.S. MNCs. These MNCs are typically audited by the same Big Four firm in the United States and in China. The U.S. firm takes overall responsibility for the audit, but farms out work to its affiliates around the world that then audit local operations.He uses the hypothetical example of Yum Brands, operator of KFC, and which derives nearly half of its revenues from China:Yum Brands is audited by KPMG in the U.S. and its China operations are most likely audited by KPMG Huazhen. I am not picking on Yum Brands for any reason other than they were the first MNC I saw when I looked out my window.Assuming KPMG Huazhen audits Yum Brands China operations, does it play a substantial role in the audit? Yum Brands reports that 29% of its assets are in China, as are 44% of its revenue and 50% of its gross profits. I think by any measure the audit work on Yum Brands in China is substantial to the audit of Yum Brands.So, what happens if KPMG Huazhen is deregistered? Clearly, KPMG in the U.S. needs to have the China operations of Yum Brands audited if it is going to express an opinion on the consolidated financials statements. If they are all deregistered, there will be no accounting firms in China that can play a substantial role in the audit. The only option would appear to be for Yum Brands to allocate the China audit to enough firms so that none of them individually is playing a substantial role. If we focus on gross profits and use a 5% test, they will need to find more than ten firms to do the work. While that can be done, it would be cumbersome, expensive, and would likely reduce audit quality.So for MNCs, no reason to panic, but the future might be painful.Related reading:

136;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-11-30T23:39:47Z;China worries weigh on Yum Brands;;Shares of Yum Brands fell more than 10 per cent on Friday on fears that recent struggles in its China business are worsening.The company, which operates KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, announced late on Thursday that it expected same-store sales to decline 4 per cent year-on-year in China during the fourth-quarter.David Novak, Yum’s chief executive, said that “softer” sales in China were offset by progress in other countries and the US. China sales grew 21 per cent in the same quarter during the prior year, making it difficult for the company to sustain that momentum.“We are extremely confident Yum China remains the best growth story in the restaurant industry,” Mr Novak said.Yum is the biggest foreign restaurant operator in China, surpassing even McDonald’s, and has been a pioneer at integrating its brands into Chinese diets. China accounts for nearly half of Yum’s revenues.However, its rapid pace of expansion combined with rising costs and slowing economic growth have hampered Yum’s China business in recent quarters.“The deterioration in traffic is likely to weigh negatively on investor expectations,” Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research, said.Yum expects to open 700 restaurants in China next year, down from 800 in 2012.Ms Senatore suggested that Chinese consumers are being cautious because of the recent government transition and that they will be more likely to start spending again once they have greater clarity about their new leadership.Last month, McDonald’s said it also saw signs of weaker consumer spending in China’s big cities, where most of its restaurants are concentrated.In spite of its new challenges in China, Yum’s same-store sales are expected to rise 4 per cent in its other international restaurants and 3 per cent in the US. A resurgent Taco Bell has helped revive Yum’s fortunes in the US in the last year.Yum has maintained its 2013 outlook, projecting earnings per share to grow 10 per cent.The company announced the sales outlook ahead of its annual investor conference in New York next week.Yum’s shares fell 10.33 per cent to $66.78 on Friday.

Talks between Republican and Democratic leaders soured on Thursday, adding to pessimism among investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent higher for the week to 13,025.58. The Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.5 per cent to 3,010.24.Meanwhile, US corporates continued to issue a record number of special dividends to escape higher taxes on equity income payments.Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, said: “Investors are rewarding tax-prudent action by US corporates, which are using their coffers to issue special dividends ahead of the tax rises next year.” Dividend taxes, which stand at 15 per cent, could rise to more than 40 per cent unless politicians can avoid the fiscal cliff.Costco, which runs warehouse-style discount stores, said on Wednesday it would pay out a special $7 dividend in December. Shares in the company rose 6.42 per cent to $103.99 for the week. Dillards, the department store retailer, said earlier in the week it would issue a one-time cash dividend of $5 a share. Its shares notched up a 2.9 per cent gain to $88.91 for the week.However, Whole Foods Market, the upscale grocery chain, was an exception among stocks that issued special dividends this week. The company’s shares fell 1.8 per cent to $93.36 as it said it would pay a $2 special dividend before the end of the year.A week after holiday shopping season began, retailers remained among the most-discussed stocks as data showed the effects of superstorm Sandy, which battered the US northeast seaboard last month, affected businesses. Economic data published this week showed US consumer spending declined in October. US department store data showed falling sales for the month of November despite a post-Thanksgiving shopping surge.The reports limited gains for consumer discretionary sector stocks and companies on the S&P 500 retailing index, which rose 0.7 per cent and 0.8 per cent for the week.Macy’s, the department store chain, extended its decline from Thursday when it reported its first monthly fall in same-store sales in three years. The company’s shares fell 7.3 per cent for the week to $38.70. Kohl’s, the department store retailer, dropped 14.6 per cent to $44.65.Shares in Groupon, the daily deals group, saw heavy losses on Friday after the troubled company’s chief executive Andrew Mason survived a board meeting at which his leadership role was said to be at stake. Still, the company recorded a 5 per cent gain for the week to $4.19. Since its public float last year at $20 a share, Groupon has shed 79 per cent.Yum Brands, which runs Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and other fast food restaurant chains, fell 9.4 per cent to $67.08.Shares in Netflix, the internet streaming and home DVD delivery company, fell 1.5 per cent to $81.71 as a competitor emerged for the company’s Mexico business. América Móvil, the company run by the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, said it would launch a Netflix-style service known as Clarovideo at a cheaper monthly price for consumers.Knight Capital Group, the electronic trading and market-making company, rose 35.3 per cent to $3.37 as it received takeover offers from two competitors this week.
138;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-11-22T12:13:47Z;Investing in China – post-growth pains;As China shifts toward consumption, what should investors do?;China is falling back to earth, seemingly without a thud. The past decade was about breakneck growth. This one will be about sustainable growth – which recent economic data suggest it might be able to achieve without crashing first. That means a shift away from wasteful infrastructure investment toward consumption, while stamping out corruption and looking after the environment along the way. That is the aim, at least. But how should investors play this shift?Equities look cheap. The Hang Seng trades on 11 times forward earnings, half the level at the end of 2009, and 1.4 times book value. But then banks make up two-fifths of the index and they are cheap for good reason – many stimulus-spending debts are yet to be repaid. Meanwhile much of the excitement in consumer stocks is already priced in, yet costs and competition are intensifying. For example, Tingyi, the noodle company, trades on 33 times earnings. The same can be said of foreign companies with big exposure to China such as Yum Brands and luxury goods makers. Only the valuations of US-listed Chinese stocks have cooled as short sellers pick them off.As for resources, China is still urbanising so there is still demand. But the binge is over, and the global resources industry needs to adjust. Recent government spending plans should benefit the railway, healthcare, natural gas, and waste and water sectors, as well as those where regulation should loosen – gas price reform, for example. PetroChina has started to rally on those expectations.That leaves fixed income and exposure to renminbi appreciation. For investors with access to the mainland bond market, returns on local government bonds are as high as 15 per cent. But this market is nascent and a grasp of the finances of provincial governments is required. Offshore dim sum bond prices have risen recently, but the market remains small and illiquid.

139;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-11-09T18:24:57Z;Pizza Hut UK unit to be sold;;Yum Brands, the US operator of Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell, is selling its dine-in Pizza Hut business in the UK as it continues to increase investment in fast-growing markets such as China.Yum said on Friday that Rutland Partners, a UK private equity group, will pay £20m to Yum as part of a broader £60m plan to restructure and refurbish the 330 restaurants. Yum will continue to operate the pizza delivery business.“The new investment and expertise that Rutland bring to the brand will help the team to further enhance the guest experience and complete the turnround story,” said Mark Fox, a Yum managing director.Rutland said it was attracted to the “iconic appeal” of the Pizza Hut brand and that in spite of the challenges the chain has faced in recent years, its performance was already on the upswing.Pizza Hut has struggled to compete with PizzaExpress and Domino’s Pizza in the UK, as customer service lagged behind and it was slow to modernise its restaurants.Last year Yum said it would look to unload the restaurants, as part of a broader plan to “refranchise” in developed markets. It took a $76m charge as a result of the decision.“As our focus shifts to high growth, high return businesses, we decided this business would be better served in the hands of a capable franchisee,” David Novak, Yum’s chief executive, said last year. “The refranchising decision for this business reinforces our commitment to shareholders to leverage high-return franchise fees and concentrate even more company equity on high growth, high return businesses in emerging markets.”Pizza Hut came to the UK in 1973. In 2006 Yum paid £112m for the 50 per cent stake held by its joint-venture partner, Whitbread.Rutland traditionally likes to invest in physical assets and looks to own, operate and turn around businesses over a two to three-year period, in the hope of at least doubling its money. The fund, which was founded in 1986, has raised over £500m in committed capital.Struggling restaurant chains have been ripe turnround targets recently. Earlier this year, Burger King, the US restaurant chain, sold a 29 per cent stake to Justice Holdings, a UK investment vehicle, which took the company public again.
140;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-11-08T18:23:27Z;McDonald’s first montly sales fall since 2003;;McDonald’s reported its first monthly sales decline since 2003 on Thursday, adding to pressure on Don Thompson, the company’s recently installed chief executive, to get the world’s largest restaurant chain by sales back on track.McDonald’s had breezed through much of the economic downturn, expanding aggressively into the breakfast and beverage markets, while its rivals stumbled. However, a more competitive restaurant landscape and diminishing demand for traditional fast-food have started taking a toll.In October, global comparable store sales fell by 1.8 per cent year on year at McDonald’s. The declines were spread evenly around the world, with sales in the US and Europe down 2.2 per cent, and sales in Asia, the Middle East and Africa down 2.4 per cent.“McDonald’s lagged behind as it faced difficult comparisons and an intense value seeking by consumers,” said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research.Mr Thompson said “the pervasive challenges of today’s global marketplace” were responsible for the company’s disappointing performance.McDonald’s is facing tougher competition in the US from revitalised chains such as Burger King and Wendy’s, along with an onslaught from restaurant groups that offer healthier fare such as Panera and Chipotle. Internationally, Yum Brands, which operates KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, has been keeping the pressure on McDonald’s.On Thursday Wendy’s, the number two US hamburger chain, reported a 2.7 per cent increase in its quarterly same-store sales, highlighting the more vigorous competition McDonald’s faced.Last month, Mr Thompson blamed a weak global economy and sluggish consumer demand for the company’s weak third-quarter earnings. He has promised to refocus on the McDonald’s “dollar menu” and unveil more creative menu options next year.“I am confident that our strategies and the adjustments we are making in response to the current business headwinds will build sales momentum and drive sustained, profitable growth,” Mr Thompson said on Thursday.Shares of McDonald’s closed down just under 2 per cent to $85.13.
141;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-10-29T17:53:49Z;Burger King earnings fall despite revamp;;Burger King, the US fast- food chain, reported a steep drop in its third-quarter earnings Monday as its refranchising efforts ate into revenues.Net income at Burger King fell 83.3 per cent to $6m, or 2 cents a share, as revenues declined by 25.8 per cent to $451.1m. The results were better than Wall Street analysts predicted, and the company’s same-store sales rose.Burger King’s revenues fell because it has been selling off company-owned restaurants to franchise owners. The company, which went public this year, overhauled its marketing strategy and is putting more effort into overseas expansion.“We completed our first full quarter as a public company with continued positive momentum despite the challenging global economic environment,” said Bernardo Hees, chief executive.Burger King’s new approach comes at a challenging time for the US fast-food industry. McDonald’s and Chipotle this month reported quarterly results that were disappointing, blaming weakened consumer demand.According to a recent survey from Consumer Edge Research, low and middle-income consumers are being hurt by high petrol prices, while fears about the US “fiscal cliff” of looming tax rises and government spending cuts are holding back spending.Jeffrey Bernstein, restaurant analyst at Barclays, said the results were a sign that Burger King’s marketing efforts and revamped menu were working.The industry has also become more competitive, with “better burger” chains stealing market share from the traditional hamburger giants. Yum Brands, which operates KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, has been refocusing investment into the US.
142;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-10-21T19:28:40Z;McDonald’s – cause for indigestion;Latest disappointing results could see investors going elsewhere to satisfy their appetite;"Investors aren’t lovin’ it, but they aren’t absolutely hating it either. In the third quarter, McDonald’s served up its second consecutive set of disappointing results and warned of more pressure to come. Net income dropped 3 per cent to $1.5bn from the same period a year ago, while revenues slipped only marginally to $7.15bn. That follows a 4 per cent year-on-year drop in net profit and flat revenues in the second quarter.With more than two-thirds of its revenue coming from outside the US, McDonald’s has been hit by the faltering global economy. Meanwhile, competition is heating up at home as Burger King, Wendy’s and Taco Bell, owned by YUM! Brands, are luring customers by rolling out some of the same strategies that have helped McDonald’s to prosper. Burger King now serves chicken wraps alongside Triple Whoppers, and “premium blend coffee” is poured at some Wendy’s outlets. And the cost of commodities is high.With all of that to swallow, some indigestion from the McStellar stock performance of recent years is no surprise. McDonald’s shares topped $100 in January, more than double their 2008 low. This year’s rumblings have siphoned off 12 per cent, including Friday’s 4 per cent decline. At $89, McDonald’s trades at 17 times this year’s earnings. That is below Starbucks (26 times) and YUM! (21 times), which have higher projected growth rates, but still no value meal.McDonald’s has some leeway, particularly in uncertain times, as it is viewed as big and stable. (Shares in younger and scrappier Chipotle Mexican Grill, for instance, fell 15 per cent on Friday on warnings of slowing traffic; they are down almost 30 per cent in 2012.) The world’s largest restaurant chain also carries a dividend yield of more than 3 per cent. But any more bad news and more McDonald’s investors might just get hungry and start looking elsewhere to satisfy their appetite for stability.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
143;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-10-19T20:10:28Z;McDonald’s grim on global economy;;McDonald’s executives offered a grim assessment of the global economy as persistent consumer weakness ate into third-quarter profits.“When the economic crisis began an 2008, few people thought the environment would still be as uncertain and fragile as it is today,” said Don Thompson, chief executive of McDonald’s, on Friday. “It is clear, however, that this operating environment is the new norm.”The disappointing results mark the second consecutive downbeat quarter for Mr Thompson, who took over last summer with the challenge of extending the company’s run of success.Net income at McDonald’s fell 3 per cent year on year in the quarter to $1.45bn, or $1.43 a share, as revenues fell slightly to $7.1bn. The results trailed projections of Wall Street analysts.McDonald’s has been battling high commodity costs along with tougher competition from the likes of Yum Brands, which has been dominating in China and resurgent in the US. Rivals such as Burger King and Wendy’s have revamped their menus and adopted strategies from the McDonald’s playbook while the spread of “better burger” restaurants has encroached on its hamburger market share.Outside the US, McDonald’s said austerity measures in Europe are weighing on its sales and that the slowdown in China is concentrated in big and medium-sized cities where the company has most of its restaurants.Comparable store sales rose less than 2 per cent in the US, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The company said sales are negative so far this month, signalling a slow end to the year.Analysts questioned Mr Thompson as to why the company thrived during the worst of the economic downturn but had suddenly lost its footing.“Global sales were lower than in any quarter even during the peak of the financial crisis at a time when macro indicators like consumer confidence were much worse,” said Michael Kelter, a Goldman Sachs analyst. “Why is McDonald’s not weathering the macro turbulence as well as before?”Mr Thompson pointed to currency volatility and high commodity costs associated with the drought last summer. He promised “tactical shifts”, such as a renewed focus on the company’s “dollar menu” and more interesting menu options next year.Shares of McDonald’s declined 4.5 per cent to $88.72.“We admire McDonald’s global footprint and best-in-class operations, but we also believe that a combination of decelerating comps and continued margin pressure from commodity inflation and other cost inflation will constrain earnings-per-share growth in the future,” said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research.

Consumers in Asia, especially in China, have been less enthusiastic about unhealthy stuff of late. Consumer goods companies have been filled with tales of Asian woe in the past week or so as they have updated the market on trading. The trend has hit most parts of the sector, from soft drinks (Coca-Cola’s third quarter volume growth in China fell from 11 per cent to 2 per cent) to the harder stuff (Asian numbers from both SABMiller and Diageo missed expectations), and fast food (Yum Brands, owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, said same-store sales growth in China had slowed from 19 per cent to 6 per cent).Investors have so far remained unperturbed by the bad news coming from one of the sector’s few reliable growth markets. The S&P Global Consumer Staples index has been flat for the past month. It has done well since the financial crisis, with a return of 40 per cent in the past five years, so it is hardly surprising that happy shareholders are reluctant to sell. In any case, a lot of the worst news has been company specific. Diageo’s Asian weakness was partly down to difficulties in South Korea, while SABMiller’s China problems came from competition in Sichuan. Nestlé’s emerging markets performance was hit by floods in Pakistan and a typhoon in the Philippines.In overall growth Asia is still well ahead of Europe and North America, but the trend is slowing and shares in some consumer groups have not yet reacted to the new reality. Rémy Cointreau, which according to Bernstein derives 40 per cent of its operating profit from cognac sales in China, still trades on 23 times forecast earnings. And Yum Brands shares look fully valued on 20 times forecast earnings.

Most global stock markets ended the week on a sour note and the S&P 500 posted its biggest weekly drop in four months, as worries about weak global growth and its impact on corporate profitability, offset a handful of upbeat corporate reports.The broad measure of US stocks ended the session 0.3 per cent lower, wrapping up a 2.2 per cent decline in the week, as investors shunned data showing the strongest US consumer confidence numbers in five years.The dollar index also fell, trading 0.1 per cent lower and higher demand pushed 10-year yields down 1 basis point to 1.65 per cent.The FTSE All-World equity index fell 0.2 per cent on the day, but stocks in Asia rose 0.4 per cent.Gold ended the week at $1,753 an ounce, but the amount of bullion held in gold-focused exchange traded products hit a record 2,583 metric tonnes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The pullback on Wall Street came as traders continued to fret about prospects for the rest of the global economy and how this would be shown affecting company earnings and forecasts during the US third-quarter reporting season.Company announcements continued on Friday with reports from two of the country’s largest financial institutions.In spite of the strong performance in mortgages, the results from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have not been particularly well-received, a reaction that dovetails with a sense of increasing microeconomic pessimism following downbeat statements from the likes of Chevron, the energy group, Cummins, the engineer, Alcoa, the aluminium producer and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices.Shares in Indian software group Infosys slumped on Friday after revenue forecasts were shy of analysts’ expectations, contributing to a 0.7 per cent drop for the Sensex.The dip was in contrast to much of Asia as the region welcomed the US jobs data overnight and also efforts by Japan and China to reduce tensions over a territorial dispute that has been hurting the two countries’ economic relations.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 was down just 0.2 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.7 per cent and the Shanghai Composite rose 0.1 per cent ahead of the release of major Chinese economic indicators next week.Trade data are set to be unveiled on Saturday, with inflation numbers due on Monday and third-quarter growth figures on Thursday.Meanwhile, the euro rose 0.2 per cent to $1.2958 amid rumours that Spain will seek a bailout this weekend, despite its finance minister saying on Friday his country is not being pressured to do so.The yield on Madrid’s 10-year paper fell 14bp on the day to 5.63 per cent.“If Spain delays requesting for help, market sentiment should gradually deteriorate,” analysts at Barclays say. “If it does make the request, we would expect the [euro] rally to have legs”.Industrial commodities also struggled to make much headway as this week’s International Monetary Fund downgrade of its forecast for global economic expansion weighed on sentiment.Copper fell 0.8 per cent to $3.7 a pound and Brent crude fell 80 cents to $114.73 a barrel.Additional reporting by Jamie Chisholm in London
146;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-10-09T22:44:42Z;Yum to step up pace of China openings;;Yum Brands is increasing the number of fast-food restaurants it will open in China this year, betting that it can continue to sell more fried chicken and pizza in spite of signs of an economic slowdown.The US-based operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell said on Tuesday it will open 750 restaurants in China this year, up from the 700 it had previously projected. The company, the leading western fast-food restaurant group in China, was hit by rising costs earlier this year but rebounded in the third quarter.Net income at Yum jumped 25 per cent to $471m, or $1 a share, from $383m, or 80 cents, in the third quarter of last year. Revenues rose 9 per cent to $3.5bn.Some analysts have warned that Yum could be overexposed to China at a time when economic growth is weakening. China accounts for more than half of Yum’s total profits and the company is continuing to bet on the growing popularity of its restaurants there.“There are 1.3bn people in China and 300m who are able to easily afford our food today and that number is growing quite considerably,” said Jonathan Blum, Yum’s chief public affairs officer. “We’re outpacing our competition there considerably.”Yum’s China business has offset struggles in the US in recent years, but in the third quarter the company showed signs of turning that around. US operating profits rose 13 per cent year-on-year and sales at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell all grew.The company received a boost last week when David Einhorn, an influential hedge fund manager, said he was shorting the stock of Chipotle, a Yum rival, because of a resurgent Taco Bell. He said the recently introduced “Cantina Bell” menu, which is more upscale, was starting to take back market share in the Mexican fast-food category.Analysts at Bernstein Research said this week that persistent sluggishness in the US economy bodes well for quick-service restaurants such as Yum as consumers hold back from splurging on fine dining. Lower labour costs and easing commodity costs are expected to improve margins at restaurant groups.Yum, whose earnings exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts, raised its earnings outlook for the year.

Brands;2012-10-09T21:41:36Z;Tech stocks lead Wall Street sell-offs;;Technology stocks, including Apple, led a Wall Street sell-off, with most of the sector’s heavyweight names dragging the rest of the market lower in a volatile trading session.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5 per cent to 3,065.02.“We may be seeing a psychological sell-off in the broader market based on what’s been going on with Apple,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.“It’s a pattern we’ve seen before, when the company’s stock tends to sell off after a product release. The momentum on Apple has been so negative over the past week, it will be important to see how investors react going into the holiday season.”Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, dropped as much as 1.8 per cent but recovered somewhat to close 0.4 per cent lower at $635.85.The stock is now 9.4 per cent lower from its peak of $702, reached on the day its iPhone 5 was released internationally.Microsoft shares fell 1.7 per cent to $29.28 and Google lost 1.8 per cent to $744.09. In an effort to avoid an antitrust war with Brussels, the search group offered to label information from its in-house services that are included in its search results pages.Amazon shares fell 3.1 per cent to $250.96 after news reports that Walmart began testing same-day delivery from its own stores, directly challenging the world’s largest online retailer.Oracle, the software group, was also hit badly, down 1.7 per cent to $30.65.Shares in Netflix, the subscription video service, were down 10.85 per cent to $65.54 after analysts at Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “buy”.Analysts said that with the 31 per cent rally in the past two weeks, “the risks outweigh the reward heading into the third quarter”.The stock gained more than 10 per cent during the previous session after analysts at Morgan Stanley said it was undervalued.Research In Motion, the BlackBerry maker, was another big loser, down 5.3 per cent to $7.80. The stock rebounded off its record lows recently after the company said it added 2m new subscribers during the third quarter.Intel shares fell 2.7 per cent to $21.90 after analysts at Nomura downgraded the chipmaker’s stock, saying: “Shares have tracked the direction of gross margin over the past decade. And thus far in 2012 that trend has continued.”In broader markets, US equities fell sharply ahead of results from aluminium producer Alcoa and from Yum! Brands, the operator of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut – both seen by investors as setting the tone for the third-quarter earnings season.Most analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies to have declined during the quarter as the global slowdown took its toll.The S&P 500 index fell 1 per cent to 1,441.48, retreating from its multiyear highs reached last week. Nine of 10 major sectors were in negative territory, with only energy registering modest gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 13,473.91.Alcoa shares closed 0.1 higher to $9.13 but rose 0.5 per cent in after-hours trading after the aluminium producer beat analysts’ expectations. The company reported improved productivity and the $143m net income loss was less than expected.The company also said it would pay $85m to settle a long-running lawsuit brought by Bahrain’s state-controlled aluminium company, Aluminium Bahrain, over alleged corruption.Yum! Brands closed the day 1.3 per cent lower at $66.04. But its shares rallied 3 per cent in after-hours trading as the company’s earnings per share beat estimates.The restaurant chain, with extensive operations in China and India, saw margins improve in the third quarter, although revenue of $3.57bn missed estimates.Workday, a business software company, raised the price of its initial public offering, set to take place later this week.In an updated filing, the loss-making company said it now expected to price its shares at $24-$26, up from the $21-$24 range set last week. Valued at the midpoint of its expected price range, Workday’s IPO is set to raise $569m and give it a valuation of about $4bn.Oil group Newfield Exploration was among the highest risers on the S&P 500 index, climbing 6.1 per cent to $32.63 after it said the sale of its assets in the Gulf of Mexico to W&T Offshore had been finalised.Peabody Energy, the largest US coal producer, also rose 5.7 per cent to $23.93Among materials, Cliffs Natural Resources rose 2.1 per cent to $41.68 while United States Steel rose 3.5 per cent to $21.1.Ford shares closed 0.4 per cent higher at $10.09 in volatile trading after Morgan Stanley reiterated its “overweight” rating with the price target of $17.Edwards Lifesciences tumbled 21.2 per cent to $84.6, making it the worst-hit stock on the S&P 500, after the cardiovascular equipment maker warned that third-quarter revenues would be lower than expected.
148;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-07-23T23:50:15Z;China: not lovin’ McDonald’s quite as much;;"Among the more glaring details in McDonald’s weaker-than-expected second-quarter results on Monday is the performance of its Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa division.After seeing revenue from the division jump 18 per cent last year and 5.5 per cent in the first quarter, demand from these markets has ground to a screeching halt and was nearly flat for the three months to the end of June.Like-for-like sales increased just 0.9 per cent, operating margins fell 170 basis points to 15.3 per cent and operating income dropped 2 per cent (although they increased 1 per cent on a constant currency basis).McDonald’s does not break out revenue contribution in APMEA by countries – except to say that China, Australia and Japan collectively accounted for over 55 per cent of the $5.1bn in revenues made by the division last year.But make no mistake – slowing growth and rising costs in China is the big story in the APMEA numbers.True, like-for-likes sales in China rose 2.2 per cent during the quarter. But this trails the 10 per cent increase reported by Yum Brands, owner of KFC and McDonald’s main rival, in China last week. In addition, McDonald’s said most of this is being driven by the “value” segment [read: low margin] of its menu as consumers there cut back.This from Don Thompson, McDonald’s chief executive, during Monday’s analyst call:In China, consumers are reacting with greater caution as the economy has slowed. We’ve seen this particularly in our tier 1 cities where we are more heavily concentrated. We’re also seeing high competitive activity focused on value…Value lunch and the recently launched value dinner are driving sales and guest counts that contributed to second quarter’s comparable sales increase of 2.2% and market share gains in our top five cities.Like Yum, whose Q2 profit was hit by rising wages and food prices in China, McDonald’s also reported weaker margins in its APMEA unit as a result of new store openings, which tend to start out with lower operating margins.As Peter J. Bensen, chief financial officer explained:A lot has been written about China and the pressure on wages there, so we’re experiencing wage pressure there as well.The numbers matter – even if according to McDonald’s, China accounted for less than 3 per cent of its total consolidated operated income.For general China investors, this is yet another sign that the slowdown in the Chinese economy is filtering down to the pockets of the country’s much talked about rising middle class. So be prepared for more downbeat news from US companies that have significant exposure to China.For global fast food retailers, which have been riding the wave of the 10-20 per cent a year growth in China’s fast food industry, the fight for stomach shares is going to get ugly.Burger King has recently announced plans to open 1,000 new stores in China over the next five to seven years (it currently has 63), while Yum, the market leader with 4,000 stores, said it will open a record 700 stores there this year.McDonald’s, which already has 1,400 stores in China, plans to open another 225 to 250 restaurants this year. And let’s not forget local players such as Kung Fu, which sells Chinese comfort food; Banana Leaf, a Thai curry chain and Da Niang Dumpling and Ajisen, a Japanese noodle chain.May the best burger, fried chicken, noodle/rice chain win.Related reading:

149;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-07-23T17:17:36Z;Global slowdown eats into Big Mac sales;;McDonald’s blamed a slowing global economy for disappointing quarterly earnings on Monday, warning that declining consumer confidence and rising costs will be a drag on profits this year.The world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues reported a rare drop in its quarterly earnings, with sales growth slowing around the world. The results failed to meet expectations from Wall Street analysts and shares of McDonald’s closed down 2.88 per cent to $88.94.The results overshadowed the start of tenure of new chief executive Don Thompson, who has promised anxious investors that the company’s leadership transition will be smooth. Second-quarter net income fell 4 per cent year-on-year to $1.35bn, or $1.32 a share, and revenues were flat at $6.9bn. The consensus earnings-per-share forecast was $1.38.“As you can clearly see, we are operating in a more difficult global environment,” Mr Thompson told analysts.The majority of McDonald’s sales come from overseas, making it more vulnerable to the impact of a stronger dollar. In the US, the company continues to cope with stubbornly high unemployment, along with the prospect of rising beef costs due to the prolonged drought.“Signs of deceleration, notably in the US, have started to materialise,” said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research.McDonald’s executives pointed to austerity measures in Europe and slowing economic growth in China as points of weakness.“In China, consumers are reacting with greater caution as the economy has slowed,” Mr Thompson said. “We have seen this particularly in our tier-one cities where we are more heavily concentrated.”Peter Bensen, chief financial officer of McDonald’s, said that the protracted nature of the downturn has caused structural shifts in the way people eat.“It is really starting to constrain consumer behaviour,” Mr Bensen said. “In several of the markets there [Europe], the eating out market is just simply declining and people are staying at home. And the magnitude of the issues in Europe are having ripple effects around the world.”Economic headwinds have tended to benefit McDonald’s, as consumers trade down to its relatively affordable fare. However, the company is facing tougher competition in the US from Burger King and Wendy’s and an increasingly strong rival abroad in Yum! Brands, which operates KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.McDonald’s has thrived in recent years by adding higher-end and healthier options to its menu, but Mr Thompson said on Monday that the company would refocus on value to bring in more customers.“We have to crank up our messaging …just a little bit more to appeal to some of these consumers who have less confidence in the overall economy and therefore, reduced their disposable spending,” Mr Thompson said.
150;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-07-18T23:04:05Z;Yum profits hit by higher China costs;;The rising cost of doing business in China ate into second-quarter profits at Yum Brands, the US-based operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, which is the country’s dominant western fast-food company.China is Yum’s biggest market and its operating profits there fell by 4 per cent year-on-year to $182m. Rising wages and food prices continued to shrink the company’s profit margins even as sales increased.“High inflation drove restaurant margins down,” said David Novak, Yum’s chief executive. “We expect this to be shortlived, returning to double-digit profit growth in the second half of the year.”Overall, Yum’s net income rose 5 per cent year-on-year to $331m, or 69 cents a share, with sales up 14 per cent to $2.7bn. The results missed analysts' expectations. Yum’s shares fell 2.1 per cent to $64.20 in after-hours trading.Yum’s rising costs in China are attributed to its rapid pace of expansion and new hiring associated with adding delivery service to its KFC restaurants, many of which are now open 24 hours. Wages rose 13 per cent in the second quarter.Yum’s same-store sales in China were up 10 per cent compared with the same quarter a year ago and the company said it will open a record 700 stores there this year. The company currently has more than 4,000 restaurants in China.“In the prior couple of quarters, they have talked about staffing up in anticipation of a big step up in growth,” said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research. “That’s certainly happening now that they’ve increased the unit growth rate yet again, so I think we’re seeing upfront costs to support more rapid growth – a good thing over the long term.”Last week, government data showed China’s growth fell to 7.6 per cent in the second quarter, its slowest since early 2009. A property market downturn and weak exports were a drag on the economy and a sharp decline in inflation has cleared the way for more aggressive policy easing.Jonathan Blum, a senior vice president at Yum, said the slowing Chinese economy is affecting the entire retail sector, including restaurants. But he said falling food prices would help Yum’s profit margins, which declined from 19.7 per cent in the second quarter of 2011 to 15.6 per cent in the latest quarter.Bucking the company’s usual trend, weakness in China was offset by strong sales in the US. Operating profits in the US rose 26 per cent year-on-year to $166m, with sales growth led by Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.Rival McDonald’s reports its second-quarter earnings next week. Last month McDonald’s warned that weakness in Asia weighed on its monthly sales.
151;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-06-16T00:33:07Z;Burger King looks to take a bite out of McDonald’s in China;;"How do you say “burger wars” in Mandarin?Because that is what China’s ever growing number of cash-rich, time-poor diners can expect to see after Burger King on Friday announced an ambitious plan to take on rival McDonald’s in one of the world’s fastest growing fast-food markets.Burger King has teamed up with private equity group Cartesian Capital and members of the Kurdoglu family, a Turkish franchisee of the company, to open 1,000 new stores in China over the next five to seven years.It will not be an easy battle. Burger King currently has just 63 restaurants in China, against McDonald’s 1,400 while Yum Brands, operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell and the dominant player in the country, has about 4,000.While China’s fast food industry has been growing at a blistering rate of 10-20 per cent per year to hit Rmb 260bn ($40.8bn) in 2010, the battle for “stomach share” in the country has also become equally fierce.Indeed, Burger King faces competition not just from McDonald’s and KFC but also Asian and local fast food chains.Thanks in part to an influx of venture capital and private equity funds in recent years, names such as Ajisen, a Japanese noodle chain; Kung Fu, which sells Chinese comfort food; Banana Leaf, a Thai curry chain and Da Niang Dumpling are increasingly giving their western counterparts a run for their Big Macs and fried chickens.In a sign of how successful local chains can get, Little Sheep, a Mongolian hotpot chain, is now part owned by Yum.The move to expand into China comes at a pivotal time for Burger King. The group has struggled in recent years against McDonald’s and a resurgent Wendy’s, which recently overtook it for second place in the US for burger market share.And unlike Yum – which earned more operating profit in China than in the US – Burger King is still very much dependent on the fortunes of its core North America market – where 60 per cent of its stores are located.Revenue fell 3 per cent last year to $2.3bn with like-for-like sales down 0.5 per cent.Given its sluggish performance in the US, perhaps it is only natural that Burger King looks elsewhere, namely in emerging markets, for growth.The company, which was taken private 3G Capital, a Brazilian-backed private equity group in a $3.25bn deal in September 2010, announced similar plans to expand its presence in Brazil last June.And last week it announced plans to open several hundred restaurants in Russia through a joint venture with a franchisee and a Russian investment bank.It is still far too early to say whether Burger King’s focus on emerging markets will pay off. Talk is cheap and execution will be key. There has been no shortage of western firms burned by hastily thought out plans to expand in markets such as China. (Barbie, Best Buy, Home Depot, anyone?)But with the company preparing to go public again after announcing in April that it had sold a 29 per cent stake to Justice Holdings, a UK investment vehicle let by Bill Ackman, the activist investor, management at Burger King will probably want to offer serve up more proof that it has what it takes to do fast food battle in China, Brazil, Russia and beyond."
152;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-06-15T22:34:00Z;A thousand Burger Kings to bloom;;Burger King, the US fast food restaurant chain, has said that it plans to open 1,000 stores in China through a new joint venture, in an effort to gain ground on rivals Yum Brands and McDonald’s.The group is joining forces with Cartesian Capital Group, a private equity firm, and members of the Kurdoglu family, a Turkish franchisee of the company. It expects to open the restaurants within the next five to seven years as part of a major international expansion.“Expanding our brand’s presence in China further exemplifies our company’s commitment to strengthening our global restaurant portfolio and establishing a strong brand presence in key growth markets around the world,” said Elias Diaz Sese, president of Burger King Asia-Pacific.Burger King currently has just 63 restaurants in China, while Yum, the operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, has about 4,000 outlets and McDonald’s has 1,400.Last week Burger King announced plans to open several hundred restaurants in Russia through a joint venture with a franchisee and a Russian investment bank. The company announced similar plans to expand in Brazil last year.The moves come as Burger King is preparing to go public again after announcing in April that it had sold a 29 per cent stake to Justice Holdings, a UK investment vehicle let by Bill Ackman, the activist investor.The company is also looking to regain its footing in the US, where it recently fell behind Wendy’s to third place in the “burger wars”. The company is working on improving its beverage offerings and developing healthier options on its menu.However, some public health advocates questioned the sincerity of those motives this week when Burger King unveiled an ice-cream sundae topped with bacon as part of its dessert line-up.
153;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-06-08T18:19:04Z;McDonald’s suffers weak Asia sales;;McDonald’s sales in Asia fell last month, raising fears of the impact on companies of weakening consumer confidence in China .Sales were weaker than expected in all regions, but analysts were especially surprised by declines in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive, attributed the weak sales to an “increasingly challenging global economic environment” but was optimistic that the world’s largest restaurant chain by sales could still deliver long-term growth.McDonald’s said that global volatility and austerity measures in Europe would “significantly pressure” its second-quarter results and that the impact of currency fluctuations would cut its earnings by up to 9 cents a share.Shares of McDonald’s fell 0.6 per cent to $87.89 in mid-afternoon trading.Global same-store sales at McDonald’s rose 3.3 per cent year-on-year, led by a 4.4 per cent rise in the US and a 2.9 per cent increase in Europe. Sales in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, however, declined by 1.7 per cent in spite of projections of growth.Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research, attributed the weak sales in China to softening consumer confidence, the launch of cheaper “value” meals and tougher competition from Yum Brands. Yum, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut in China, is the leading restaurant chain there and McDonald’s has been battling to gain market share.Signs of an economic slowdown in China have become a growing concern for investors. Those worries have been compounded by rising wages, which have narrowed profit margins for companies looking to build up their presence and hire more workers.On Thursday, China’s central bank cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 in an effort to stimulate growth. China’s economic growth slowed to 8.1 per cent in the first quarter, down from 9.2 per cent in 2011 and 10.4 per cent in 2010.The US has continued to be the most consistent performer for McDonald’s, and innovative breakfast products such as blueberry banana nut oatmeal and drinks such as the Cherry Berry Chiller helped support sales domestically.However, analysts noted that customer numbers had increased at competing fast-food restaurants, which have been borrowing tactics from McDonald’s. Meanwhile, so-called “fast-casual” chains such as Panera and Chipotle have become increasingly aggressive rivals.McDonald’s sales in Europe were led by growing demand in the UK, France and Russia, but weakness in Germany held back sales growth.
154;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Yum steps up McDonald’s battle;;Yum! Brands, the operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, is looking to export its thriving Chinese business model to India, as the US fast-food group steps up its battle with McDonald’s overseas.Managers from the company’s emerging markets teams will visit China on Wednesday to learn how the company has managed to grow so quickly there – and how to apply those strategies to India and other developing countries.“We’re going to share what we have learnt in China, because we think that the model can be adapted in emerging markets,” David Novak, Yum’s chief executive, said during a recent interview at the company’s headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky.“What we’re doing in India is we’re getting flagship locations, just like we do in China and we’re going into both large cities and smaller cities earlier on, because in China we learnt that,” he said.China is one of the only countries in the world where McDonald’s is not the dominant western restaurant chain. Yum’s success there has been attributed to its willingness to localise its menu to cater to Chinese tastes, and the development of its own supply chain.This strategy has helped Yum grow from 600 outlets in China in 2001 to more than 4,000 today. In comparison, McDonald’s has about 1,400 restaurants. Analysts at Bernstein Research said recently that Yum’s “dramatic first mover advantage” could make McDonald’s a perennial runner-up behind KFC.Yum entered India nearly 15 years after its foray into China in 1987. It now expects to have 550 KFC restaurants in India by 2015 – more than it had in China after 15 years – and to generate $1bn in sales there.Some analysts have suggested that Yum faces unique challenges in India, including increasingly onerous government regulation and the lack of its own distribution system. The first attempt to bring KFC to India, before it was spun off from PepsiCo in the 1990s, unravelled after widespread protests over its ingredients and its treatment of chickens.However, Yum suggests that India is set to follow in China’s footsteps and that the country has inherent advantages, such as a young population that is increasingly dining out. Yum also has a “protein” advantage over rival McDonald’s, which has limited its hamburger sales in India because beef is not widely eaten.Mr Novak said that, as in China, Yum is tailoring its India menu by region, and KFC is turning up the spice on its chicken.“We have spicier, ‘Fiery Drums’, or chicken legs, that will knock your socks off in terms of the heat level,” Mr Novak said.
155;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-04-18T22:46:13Z;Turn in US business lifts Yum profits;;Yum Brands, the operator of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, has reported a sharp jump in its first-quarter profits, as efforts to revive its sluggish US business have started to pay off.Net income at Yum rose 76 per cent year-on-year to $458m, or 96 cents a share, as total revenues increased by 13 per cent to $2.74bn.Wednesday’s results exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts, but Yum’s share price slipped in after-hours trading on signs that the company’s vaunted China business could be showing signs of cooling.Yum’s same-store sales in China rose 14 per cent from the same period a year ago, but operating margins there continued to narrow due to rising commodity costs and wages. The first quarter sales increase was weaker than during the fourth quarter of 2011, when they rose 21 per cent.Yum’s international business has been outpacing its restaurants in the US in recent years, but during the first quarter its US operations showed new signs of life. Comparable store sales rose 5 per cent year-on-year during the quarter, after declining in the first quarter of 2011, and operating profits grew by 27 per cent.Sales at Taco Bell led Yum’s US business. The chain had a difficult 2011 after a lawsuit falsely claimed that the company was not using real beef in its tacos but a new menu line-up helped lure customers.“While we realise there is much work to do, we are optimistic we will dramatically improve our US brand positions,” said David Novak, Yum’s chief executive.
156;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Burger King: fries with that, gentlemen?;The natural question now is whether Justice Holdings has overpaid;They paid too much. That was the consensus when 3G Capital took Burger King private in 2010 for a total enterprise value of $4bn, or nine times trailing earning before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. How did things go? Well, Justice Holdings has just paid $1.4bn and will get 26 per cent of Burger King’s common shares in return. This now puts the enterprise value of Burger King at $8bn – an ev/ebitda multiple of 16 times (14 times if you follow Burger King’s practice of excluding restructuring and other costs). By comparison, the multiples for global powerhouses McDonald’s and Yum Brands are 11 and 14 times. Arcos Dorados, the largest Latin American McDonald’s franchisee, trades at 12 times.3G’s partners put $1.2bn of cash into the original deal and borrowed the remainder of the price. They also paid themselves a near $400m dividend last year, thank you very much. If they had sold the whole company at the price Justice has paid, 3G would have more than doubled its money in a year and a half. Over the same period, McDonald’s and Yum shares have returned 38 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively. Consensus now: would you like fries with that, gentlemen?The natural question now is whether Justice has overpaid. Same store sales fell last year and Burger King is losing share in the US. But Ebitda last year was a third higher than the period just before the buyout, due mainly to cost control. The proportion of restaurants that are franchised has risen slightly, which should stabilise financial results, and the geographic mix has shifted away from North America and towards high-growth Latin America. Both shifts are set to continue. But the current valuation implies that Burger King will execute its restructuring strategy perfectly.

157;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;New McDonald’s chief left with tricky task;;"When Jim Skinner took over as chief executive of McDonald’s almost eight yeas ago, the hamburger chain was in its darkest moment.The company’s chief executive, Jim Cantalupo, died of a heart attack after just 16 months in the job in April 2004. Seven months later his successor, Charlie Bell, resigned after being diagnosed with cancer, leaving the post to Mr Skinner, who was billed the “accidental CEO”.McDonald’s was also hit by negative publicity. The documentary Super Size Me was playing in cinemas, showing the world through film-maker Morgan Spurlock’s diet the dire effects of subsisting on McDonald’s.“Everything was going wrong for McDonald’s,” says Steve West, analyst at ITG Investment Research. “The restaurants were disgusting and the food was horrible. The best thing that happened to McDonald’s was Super Size Me.”McDonald’s announced on Wednesday that Mr Skinner would retire this summer, ending a 41-year career that he began as a trainee restaurant manager in Carpentersville, Illinois. The 67-year-old will be replaced by Don Thompson, who has been chief operating officer since 2010.Mr Skinner, an architect of the company’s “plan to win” strategy that has become a playbook for the fast-food industry, leaves with the reputation as a turnround artist and leaves his successor with the challenging task of maintaining the company’s momentum.Last year, McDonald’s recorded its strongest comparable store sales in the US since 2006 and plans to invest $2.9bn this year to open another 1,300 outlets, including nearly 175 in the US, 250 across Europe and 250 in China.In February, it had its 106th consecutive month of positive same-store sales growth in the US. Its stock price has soared more than 200 per cent since Mr Skinner took the top job, eclipsing $100 a share this year.“It’s been one successful product after the next,” says Peter Saleh, restaurant analyst at Telsey Advisory Group. “They changed their methodology to find out what consumers were interested in before coming to market with new products.”McDonald’s has thrived in recent years by focusing on the breakfast trade and expanding its beverages, while continuing to cater to recession-weary diners with its dollar menu. It has put pressure on rivals such as Yum! Brands, Burger King and Wendy’s, while displacing Starbucks, Smoothie King and even cereal makers in serving the breakfast market. “They’ve revolutionised the entire industry,” Mr West says.In spite of those successes, Mr Skinner’s tenure was marred by many of the controversies that have plagued McDonald’s for years and that Mr Thompson will face when he takes over. The company continues to be targeted by public health and animal rights groups for its contribution to the growing obesity epidemic and the treatment of the animals it consumes.“[Mr] Skinner’s pride was a ‘plan to win’ that largely made children’s health the loser,” says Sara Deon of Corporate Accountability International. She notes that obesity rates among children and Hispanics, on whom McDonald’s focuses much of its marketing, have risen disproportionately during Mr Skinner’s time as chief executive.“Parents and health professionals would like to see CEO Skinner take Ronald McDonald and the suite of McDonald’s predatory marketing practices into retirement with him,” she adds.Although a lot of attention has been focused on McDonald’s efforts to sell premium hamburgers and high-end coffee, Mr Skinner has worked to change its public image by replacing its playgrounds with flatscreen televisions and wireless internet, lowering the profile of Ronald McDonald, its mascot, and selling more apples and fewer French fries to children.“They’ve changed the perception of food quality, what a McDonald’s restaurant should look like and what it means to work there,” says Sara Senatore, Bernstein Research analyst, noting that the biggest changes have been in Europe. “The French used to call it ‘mal boeuf’ and people would joke about having McJobs.”Analysts say Mr Thompson’s challenge will be matching his predecessor’s success and fending off rivals that seek to replicate McDonald’s strategy.Yum! Brands, the operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, remains dominant in China and Asia; Wendy’s and Burger King have been improving ingredients and upmarket “better burger” chains are evolving from fad to trend status in the US, eating into McDonald’s core business.“When your stores are generating that much money, the question is how do you keep growing?” said Darren Tristano, executive vice-president of restaurant consultants Technomic.……………………………………………………………..Engineer set to take the helmIf McDonald’s is sometimes compared to a well-oiled juggernaut, it is only fitting that its next chief executive, Don Thompson, is a trained engineer, writes Alan Rappeport.The Chicago native and 22-year McDonald’s veteran began his career as an electrical engineer at Northrop Corporation, the defence contractor, and after joining the restaurant chain in 1990 worked his way up the operations side of the business.Mr Thompson has flipped burgers, turned round the troubled San Diego market, been in charge of the Midwest division and was president of McDonald’s USA.Analysts expect the transition to be relatively smooth, especially compared with the turmoil that surrounded Jim Skinner’s ascension to chief executive when tragedies struck his two predecessors.However, Mr Skinner’s retirement has come sooner than some analysts predicted and the company will now have to find a new chief operating officer to fill Mr Thompson’s role.In a 2007 interview with the Financial Times, Mr Skinner contemplated his retirement and joked that his successor would have big shoes to fill.“We have learnt through our own distress regarding potential leaders at McDonald’s [that] it’s important to have people available to do the job,” he said. “We have a lot of people who could do this job. Probably none as well as me.”Mr Thompson’s rise is a testament to his patience. Other top executives, including the company’s previous chief operating officer, decided to leave McDonald’s after losing hope that they would replace Mr Skinner.According to a report in Crains Chicago Business last year, Mr Thompson considered leaving the company early in his career, but stayed on at the advice of McDonald’s diversity chief, who urged him to switch from developing robotics and electronics to operations.When he takes over the chief executive post from Mr Skinner in June, Mr Thompson will be one of the most high profile African-American chief executives in the US.“I’m humbled to take the baton as chief executive of McDonald’s,” Mr Thompson said, adding that he would continue to modernise the company’s 33,000 restaurants and expand the menu beyond its traditional hamburgers and fries."

Bank of New York Mellon, another large player in the industry, was off 1.2 per cent to $21.69.Money market funds, which invest in highly liquid securities such as US Treasuries, are used by institutional investors to park large amounts of cash not invested elsewhere. But their reputation as safe havens suffered during the financial crisis, when investors in one fund were hit by losses.According to reports, the SEC will propose scrapping the funds’ fixed $1 net asset value and require the funds to set aside capital against losses. Floating net asset values would reduce the funds’ appeal as a cash substitute, while capital charges could eat into already meagre returns.“The proposals as reported could decimate the industry,” said Jeff Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, “but if the market thought the proposals would go through unaltered, we’d be seeing bigger share price falls. The expectation is that the SEC has aimed high but will compromise.”Elsewhere, US stocks followed European indices lower in early trading as Greek default worries continued to weigh on sentiment but reversed course after a positive job openings report.US employers ended the year needing to fill 3.38m jobs, 258,000 more than at the end of November.“The total level of unfilled vacancies matches the peak in September and indicates the willingness of private employers to step up the pace of recruiting,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,347.05, within 16 points of its post-2008 high reached last year.UBS equity analysts argued the rally could have further to run, with risk appetite still well short of extreme levels and many investors yet to rotate out of defensive sectors into cyclical names.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 12,878.2, as shares in Coca Cola rose 0.8 per cent to $68.55 after earnings, and some adjustments, beat analyst expectations.The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.1 per cent to 2,904.08, as shares in Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the index, hit an all-time high of $469.43, before paring gains slightly to $468.83, a gain of 1.1 per cent.Coal miners sold off after an Environmental Protection Agency official told Congress the agency’s rules were “underpinning” a transition from coal to gas among US power producers.Alpha Natural Resources fell 5.2 per cent to $22.31, and Peabody Energy was off 3.8 per cent to $37.41.Banks stocks traded slightly lower, with Citigroup falling 0.7 per cent to $33.07, as it faced pressure from a key shareholder to raise its dividend.MasterCard hit an all-time high of $394.48 in the afternoon session, after announcing a doubling of its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share.

Brands;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
160;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-02-07T00:17:28Z;Yum’s China margins prove unpalatable;;Yum Brands, the US-based operator of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains, said that profit margins at its restaurants in China, where it has a dominant presence, narrowed sharply last year as labour costs soared.Margins at the group’s China restaurants declined by 2.4 percentage points to 19.7 per cent in 2011 from the prior year. Yum on Monday pointed to 20 per cent wage rate inflation along with an 8 per cent increase in commodities costs.Analysts have predicted that the risings costs of doing business in China would shrink margins at companies such as Yum, which has been investing heavily in the country.According to an analysis by Bernstein Research, Yum’s labour costs are the result of its rapid pace of restaurant openings in China but the company should eventually see its margins re-expand after those stores are up and running.Keith Siegner, analyst at Credit Suisse, said that he also expects margins to widen again in 2012, suggesting that the additional purchasing power that Chinese consumers are gaining thanks to rising wages will benefit Yum.“KFC and Pizza Hut used to be premium priced in China,” Mr Siegner said. “With rising wages, a much larger percentage of the population is able to afford them.”In spite of narrowing margins, Yum’s reliance on China continued to be evident in its fourth quarter and full-year results.“The highlight of 2011 was again the exceptional performance of our China business,” David Novak, Yum’s chief executive, said.The company opened 656 new restaurants in China last year, driving a same-store sales increase of nearly 20 per cent.Overall, Yum had a strong final quarter, with net income rising 30 per cent from the same period in 2010 to $356m, or 77 cents a share, and company sales up 16 per cent to $3.55bn. The results were stronger than Wall Street analysts predicted and sent Yum’s stock price up 2.39 per cent to $64.70 in after-hours trading.Although Yum’s international restaurants have been thriving, its US business continues to be a drag. During the fourth quarter, same-store sales were up 1 per cent, led by Pizza Hut, which helped offset declines at KFC and Taco Bell.Taco Bell has been under pressure from Chipotle, another Mexican fast-food chain, and weathered negative publicity last year due to accusations that it was not using real beef in its tacos. This year, the chain faced another storm when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked Taco Bell to a salmonella outbreak that sickened nearly 70 people across the US.
161;YUM;Yum! Brands;2012-01-24T19:57:02Z;McDonald’s: keep your eyes on the fries;The restaurant chain has proved it can generate global profitable growth;"What is more American than McDonald’s? Lots of things. Almost 60 per cent of the company’s profits are earned internationally. And it is becoming less American all the time; just a 10th of restaurants opened last year were in the US.International growth has played a crucial role in McDonald’s’ performance, which has been astonishing, both operationally and in the stock market. Just five years ago, only 40 per cent of profits were international and the bulk of that came from Europe. Now, nearly a fifth of profits originate in Asia and the Middle East. Just as important as the internationalisation is the way it has been achieved: with a conservative focus on returns, not revenues. While Asia-Middle East profits have increased fourfold since 2007, the restaurant count in the region is up only 13 per cent. And McDonald’s uses its own capital quite conservatively: three-quarters of international stores are franchisee-owned. Contrast this to Yum Brands’ much-heralded expansion in China, where franchisees own only 5 per cent of the restaurants.The same pattern holds in the still-important US, where comparable store sales and profits have grown steadily and the store count has barely budged. McDonald’s keeps its restaurants looking up to date and steadily expands their capacities, leading to (for example) recent success with breakfast and high-margin coffee.It is with good reason, then, that McDonald’s shares have doubled in the past half-decade. Whether the run can continue is another question. The shares are not cheap at 17 times this year’s forecast earnings, and big-cap stocks that pay good dividends (as McDonald’s does) have already had a good run. When the company reported better than expected fourth-quarter growth yesterday, the market shrugged, sending the shares down 2 per cent. But McDonald’s has proved it can generate profitable growth on a truly global basis, even during a weak economy. Surely, that is worth paying a premium for.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
162;YUM;Yum! Brands;2011-12-12T20:08:25Z;Yum Brands: pizza and chicken in China;If China’s economy were to go on a diet, Yum would find itself with a bellyache;The first few bites of fast food are always delicious. Overindulge, though, and the feeling is altogether different. For global companies, the same may be true of exposure to China. If so, Yum Brands, which owns and franchises Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut restaurants, will find out the hard way.At the company’s investor day last week, its management made a compelling case for investing heavily in China. It has more than 4,000 outlets there now but is nowhere near saturation. The management points out that if that figure goes to 9,000 by 2020, there will still be only seven outlets per million people. There are 60 stores for every million Americans now. The economics of each store are impressive: a new store in a smaller Chinese city, according to the company, might cost something more than $500,000 to build and can ultimately bring in $300,000 in cash profits annually.Given these two points, it is clear why the company wants to put its capital to work in China. It built almost 300 company-owned restaurants there in the first nine months of the year, and now owns, rather than franchises, more than 80 per cent of its stores in the country (McDonald’s, notably, is taking the opposite tack, emphasising franchising in China).But how much is too much? Note that at the same time as Yum is ploughing money into China, it is pulling cash out of established markets: for example, it plans to cut company ownership of US KFC outlets from 10 to 5 per cent, and it will franchise all its remaining Pizza Hut outlets in the UK. It has pulled in $119m in cash from refranchising company-owned stores in 2011. The shift in allocation means that Yum, which already generates half its operating income in China, will be even more dependent on the country. If China’s economy goes on a diet, Yum is going to have a bellyache.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
163;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Yum plans to be the McDonald’s of China;;Yum! Brands, the operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, plans to become the McDonald’s of China, blanketing the country’s second and third-tier cities with its fast-food restaurants over the next decade, according to its chief executive.David Novak, Yum’s chief executive, said on Wednesday that Yum plans to more than double its China restaurants to by 2020, when it hopes to have 9,000 across the country. Meanwhile, the company is paring back its ownership of restaurants in developed markets as it accelerates its emerging markets push.“You see, in small-town America, McDonald’s will have a prime location in all the spots,” Mr Novak said at the company’s investor conference. “What you’re going to see 10 years from now is that we’re going to own that. We’re going to have the very best locations.”Yum, which is set to earn about $900m in net income from its China business this year, said it plans to build small restaurants in Chinese rail stations and airports and use its distribution network to expand into second and third tier cities, which tend to be most profitable because labour and rent remain relatively cheap.Already the leading international restaurant company in China, Yum is adapting its strategy there as the cost of doing business rises. Mr Novak said that Yum expects to face 6 per cent inflation for commodity prices in China and believes the cost of labour will rise in the “mid-teens”, potentially narrowing its profit margins next year.Although China remains Yum’s most successful market, the company is trying to replicate that success in India and other parts of Asia with more innovative localised offerings, extended hours and breakfast. Mickey Pant, chief executive of Yum Restaurants International, said the company has been leaving billions of dollars of market share on the table for McDonald’s by allowing KFC to lag behind in the breakfast business.“We will have breakfast in place,” Mr Pant said, noting that customers think of KFC as a place for chicken rather than eggs. “As smart as we think we are, we forgot basic things like telling people we are open for breakfast.”Emerging markets account for 58 per cent of Yum’s operating profits and the company is ramping up its ownership of restaurants in those countries while “refranchising” stores in developed markets.Yum, which recently sold off all of its UK Pizza Hut restaurants to franchisees, said that by 2014 it expects to own 70 per cent of its restaurants in emerging markets and just 30 per cent in developed markets. Currently, it owns 53 per cent of its emerging market restaurants and 47 per cent in developed markets.The Kentucky-based company has seen its US operations struggle. Executives called the performance this year “disappointing” and “terrible”, noting the weak economy and bad publicity, but told investors that a renewed sense of urgency and better relationships with franchises would help.“It’s been a big challenge in the US,” Mr Novak said. “We still have a lot of wood to chop.”

Executives from the Hong Kong-listed hotpot chain discovered on Wednesday that they will have to wait another 60 days for a verdict from China’s Ministry of Commerce on the proposed buy-out by Yum! Brands of Kentucky. Many investors are not hanging around until Christmas Eve: the shares tumbled to an 18 per cent discount to the HK$6.50-a-share offer made six months ago. For the world’s second-largest economy, this is not nearly good enough.It is not that China’s antitrust regime is particularly tough. In the three years since the passage of the first Anti-Monopoly Law (AML), the ministry’s antitrust bureau has reviewed about 300 cases, blocked one (Coca-Cola/Huiyuan Juice) and imposed conditions on seven more – about in line with international norms. But advisers complain that the process is exceptionally hard to read. It can take weeks, if not months, for the ministry to accept submission of a filing, thus beginning Phase I. Apparently routine cases often proceed to the deeper scrutiny of Phase II. All the while, soundings from an unknowable assortment of state agencies are taken under Article 27 of the AML, which allows for consideration of the deal’s effects on “national economic development.”The backdrop to this case – Yum’s very fast growth in China, the iconic nature of the Little Sheep brand – is by the by. What matters more is that the outcome of filings seems to be determined as much by celebrity support as by the rule of law. Diageo discovered as much in June, when, after 15 months of wrangling, it was granted approval to buy 4 per cent of a Sichuan spirits company just as Premier Wen Jiabao met his British counterpart, David Cameron. As year-end approaches, Yum chairman David Novak may want to call in a few favours.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
165;YUM;Yum! Brands;2011-10-07T16:47:38Z;Africa: the next frontier for fast food?;;"The money-spinning potential of Africa’s burgeoning middle class has been likened to a lot of things. But the next China?That’s what Yum! Brands, the inanely-punctuated US owner of the Taco Bell and KFC restaurant chains, seems to think. Having spent the last two decades conquering the Chinese fast food scene, the company now has its sights firmly set on Africa.According to Keith Warren, KFC’s South Africa managing director, the opportunities in Africa – with its one billion plus population, rapid urbanisation and where chicken is the main animal protein consumed – are parallel to those the group has found in China.“We are likening the African business to China,” Warren told Business Report, the South African daily.At the moment, KFC has more than 600 outlets in South Africa and the plan is to increase this to 850 by 2015 and to 1,100 by 2020, according to the report.But KFC doesn’t plan to stop with South Africa – where its 14.4 per cent share of the country’s ZAR17.3bn (US$2.17bn) a year fast-food market, makes it the undisputed leader. (McDonald’s, by contrast has only a 2.2 per cent market share, according to figures from Euromonitor)The chain also harbours fried chicken ambitions for Nigeria – where it plans to have 20 stores by the end of this year; Kenya, where the first store started earlier this summer, will open two more; along with Zambia, Ghana, Angola and Malawi.In all, KFC aims to more than double its revenue on the continent to $2bn.With sales growth in the west in the doldrums, KFC is not the only one waking up to the business opportunities in Africa.According to a  report from the African Development Bank (AfDB), the number of middle-class Africans has tripled over the last 30 years to 313m people, or more than 34 per cent of the continent’s population.Another study published last year by the McKinsey Global Institute reckons that approximately 40 per cent of Africans live in urban areas now and predicts that by 2030, the continent’s top 18 cities could have a combined spending power of $1,300bn.Little surprise then that Unilever has recently decided to turn the continent into one of its eight global operating regions, while the likes of PZ Cussons and Nestlé and brewers such as SAB Miller and Diageo have all been bulking up their operations in Africa.But operating in Africa is not without its challenges. In an industry where convenience and consistency are the main selling points, one of KFC’s biggest obstacles has to be supply chain. That is – securing a steady supply of chickens that meet the company’s specifications.Gavin Bell, the general manager of the KFC in Nairobi, said its supplier had to make more policy and procedural changes in the last year than in the company’s first 20, including ensuring that the chicken was kept cold “from farm to fork” and that supplies could be easily traced in the event of recalls.“Those are tall orders for companies that haven’t based themselves on that,” Bell told the Associated Press. “Those are standard practice in Europe, America, Australia. However in this part of the world we are raising the benchmarks of the supply chain, and the hospitality standards at the same time.”But KFC’s success in China shows the rewards could match the effort – KFC in China now accounts for 30 per cent Yum!’s group sales and Yum’s China operation (which include KFC and Pizza Hut) account for 43 per cent of group operating profits. Africa too could provide for some finger-licking good returns.Related reading:

166;YUM;Yum! Brands;2011-07-31T17:04:32Z;US food groups step up healthy eating drive;;US food and restaurant companies are aggressively stepping up their healthy food initiatives to get ahead of government regulations, but sceptics warn that they could be overreaching at their own expense.McDonald’s, the US fast-food restaurant chain, last week bowed to pressure over its marketing to children, putting its “Happy Meals” on a diet by shrinking the size of its French fries and offering apple slices. That followed a move in early July when 19 US restaurant chains promised to offer a children’s meal with limited calories, fat, salt and sugar.Big food companies have also been forging ahead to be healthier. Ken Powell, chief executive of General Mills, the maker of Cheerios cereal and Progresso soups, said its organic business is now a “growth engine” for the company and that the success of that division is informing its entire product line.“Consumer attitudes are changing,” Mr Powell told the Financial Times.PepsiCo, the drinks and snacks company, has been especially ambitious on this front, aiming to double the revenues it generates from nutritious products by the end of the decade. Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chief executive, in February said, “This is no longer a trend or a fad, this is here to stay”.In spite of these efforts, some argue that food groups risk overreaching by investing in food fads and straying from their strengths.A former chief executive of a top US food company, who now advises other companies, warns about the costs of overreacting to the health push. He said companies risk confusing their research and development departments, which have spent years focused on taste, and that they may be opening opportunities for groups that stick to their less calorie-conscious roots.Steve West, analyst at Sifel Nicolaus, said that healthy options still account for a small percentage of sales at restaurant chains and that companies need to adapt their recipes gradually because flavour preferences are deeply ingrained in their customers. He points to the grilled chicken venture by Yum! Brands’ KFC as an example of the pitfalls of trying to change.“They spent millions of dollars a couple years ago buying ovens for franchises to make grilled chicken to capitalise on the healthier food craze, and it flopped,” Mr West said. “They did not see any sales lift at all.”Last year KFC made a bigger bet on taste with its “Double Down” sandwich, encasing bacon, cheese and sauce between two slabs of fried chicken.Jerry McVety, president of the restaurant consulting firm McVety & Associates, said that some restaurant chains, such as Taco Bell and Hardee’s, have thrived by clinging to core values that are not healthy. He advises restaurant groups that appetite for healthier food is likely here to stay, but that they should be careful about straying too far from what made them successful.“If you change things too much, it can come back to haunt you eventually,” Mr McVety said.
167;YUM;Yum! Brands;2011-07-22T22:30:39Z;Struggling consumers boost McDonald’s;;Struggling consumers are still flocking to McDonald’s, the US fast food restaurant chain, which has benefited from the lingering effects of the economic downturn.McDonald’s shares touched a record high on Friday, after the company said its frozen drinks and breakfast offerings helped its second-quarter earnings exceed Wall Street expectations. With an expanded menu offering, it is stealing market share from competitors such as Starbucks and Yum! Brands and luring consumers away from their breakfast tables with oatmeal and smoothies.Jim Skinner, chief executive, said McDonald’s was succeeding by offering more “relevant” food and beverage choices and because of its move to modernise its restaurants. Drinks sales at McCafe, which Mr Skinner introduced in the US in 2009, increased 29 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter.McDonald’s raised prices in March and May this year to keep up with soaring commodity costs. But the company said that although consumer sentiment remains “volatile” and unemployment is high in the US and across Europe, customers have not shied away or changed their eating habits.“We aren’t seeing any dramatic spike in the usage of our dollar menus,” Peter Bensen, chief financial officer, said in a call with analysts. “We’ll continue to be judicious as we move forward.”Mr Bensen said that because grocery prices are rising faster than restaurant menu prices, McDonald’s has more room to raise prices later this year. He expects commodity prices to “top out” in the third quarter and ease during the last three months of the year.McDonald’s plans to import some of its premium hamburgers that have been popular in Europe to the US, as it looks to fend off competition from increasingly popular “better burger” chains in the US. The company would like to begin exporting its strawberry lemonade beverages, which are popular in the US, but said it is assessing global fruit supplies.Meanwhile, McDonald’s is looking to use its scale to capitalise on weak spots in the economy and to edge out competition. Mr Bensen said McDonald’s had purchased more restaurant sites in 2011 than last year and would likely increase its real estate ownership further next year.John Ivankoe, restaurant analyst at JPMorgan, said in a research note that he was “comforted” by McDonald’s performance and that it had strong momentum going into the second half of the year.Net income at McDonald’s rose 19 per cent to $1.41bn, or $1.35 a share, from $1.23bn, or $1.13, in the same period a year ago. The results sent the company’s shares up 2.3 per cent to close at $88.56 on Friday.Total revenues at McDonald’s rose 16 per cent to $6.9bn.The US was the slowest growing region of the world, with total revenues increasing just 4 per cent. The pace of growth picked up in Europe, where total revenues increased 21 per cent, and in Asia and the Middle East, where they jumped 25 per cent.McDonald’s said it expects global comparable store sales to rise 4-5 per cent in July.

Brands;2011-07-14T22:22:37Z;Wall St stocks fall amid default concerns;;Wall Street stocks closed down after an early equity rally amid concern that US politicians may fail to agree on raising the US debt ceiling, which could lead to a catastrophic default, and as investors reassessed the likelihood of the Federal Reserve’s embarking on “quantitative easing”.In spite of initial efforts to look away from the possibility of Moody’s downgrading the US debt, equities pulled back after modest morning gains. Relatively good economic news and JPMorgan Chase beating earnings estimates initially helped investors gain confidence. JPMorgan Chase, the first big bank to report results, was up 1.84 per cent at $40.35 after announcing that its second-quarter profits rose 13 per cent to $5.4bn or $1.27 a share, in net income.“Bernanke’s comments took away the enthusiasm. The market reacted, as it is very much focused on negotiations in Washington”, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.4 per cent at 12,437.12, after climbing almost 90 points early in the session, when investors were focused on the heavyweight bank’s growth. Financials, one of the worst performing sectors, are under pressure to show that they can increase revenue. Citigroup is due to release earnings on Friday.“But there were some good news in the retail sales and employment fronts, and good numbers from JPMorgan pushed it up a little initially. All in all, this is still a very cautious market looking at debt issues, both in Europe and the US, and the corporate earnings season”, Ms Krosby said.According to the US Commerce Department, retail sales rose 0.1 per cent in June, after dipping 0.1 per cent in May, while weekly jobless claims dropped 22,000 to 405,000, compared to an expected figure of 415,000.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was in negative territory, down 1.2 per cent at 2,762.67 and the benchmark S&P 500 also closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,308.87. All of the S&P sectors lost ground, closing in negative territory.Yet ConocoPhillips was one of the S&P top performers at 1.6 per cent to $75.61, after an early announcement that the company plans to split its refining and production businesses into two different publicly traded companies.“We estimate the value range on a split-up is between $73 and $92 per share. Essentially, we see little downside to owning the stock at current levels. Overall, we estimate we can comfortably get to $80 per share on a break-up value,” said Faisel Khan, analyst with Citi investment research.“It remains to be seen how ConocoPhillips will deal with the downstream, how it will allocate the midstream and chemicals business among the separated company, whether there will be dis-synergies and most importantly how the upstream business will be valued. The upstream valuation is the key component here,” he added.Yum! Brands, reached an all-time high at $57.75 before paring its gains at 1.4 per cent to $56.37. On Wednesday, the US fast food Restaurant Group, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, reported a 10 per cent gain in profits, or $0.65 per share, in the second quarter, beating analysts’ expectations and raising its full-year forecast. According to the company’s chief executive, David Novak, profit was helped by “strong performance in China and other emerging markets”, with sales in China growing more than 18 per cent.“Outlook for consolidated fundamentals are probably coming down slightly, with upside in China not fully offsetting weakness in the US. That said, Yum! is making the case for multiple expansion, which should be more important for the shares,” said Keith Siegner, an analyst with Credit Suisse.Google closed down 1.7 per cent to $528.94, but jumped as earnings results, released after the closing bell, exceeded estimates. The search engine group’s shares rose 12.5 per cent to $595.25 in after-hours trading.After hitting all-time high of $304.80 in early trading in the previous session Netflix, the DVD subscription and streaming video company, tumbled to $286.62, down 4.1 per cent. The company’s move to overhaul its pricing policy aimed at pushing users toward its growing streaming service has received criticisms and alienated some users.The microchip sub-sector was down with Microchip Technology, a chipmaker, down 1.2 per cent at $32.01 after reporting lower sales, and Novellus, a manufacturer of equipment for chipmakers, was also down 1.3 per cent at $31.58.Again, in the spotlight, News Corp tumbled 3.1 per cent at $15.43, following news the FBI opened an investigation into allegations that the media giant also hacked into the phones of September 11 victims. Also on Thursday, Rupert Murdoch and his son James, were summoned to appear before the UK Parliament, as a result of the British newspaper phone-hacking scandal. News Corp pared in the previous session after the company dropped its bid for BSkyB.
169;YUM;Yum! Brands;2011-07-14T01:11:59Z;Chinese help counter US weakness for Yum;;Growing appetite in China for fried chicken and pizza helped Yum! Brands, the owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, boost its second-quarter profits amid slumping demand for fast-food in the US.Operating profits in China grew 25 per cent year on year to $182m, with comparable store sales there up 18 per cent.Yum’s profits in China surpassed those in the US, where operating income dropped by 28 per cent year on year to $132m, with same-store sales falling by 4 per cent. David Novak, Yum’s chief executive, called the company’s China business the “leading growth story in the restaurant industry” and said the company had plans to build on the 4,000 restaurants it already has there.But the US business continues to disappoint. US fast-food restaurants have been under pressure from growing concern about obesity and government pressure to curb advertising of unhealthy foods to children. Yum attributed the weak performance to higher commodity costs and bad publicity surrounding a lawsuit claiming the beef tacos at Taco Bell were mostly made of meat filler.“We anticipated weak second-quarter sales and profits, driven largely by the negative impact of a meritless lawsuit and resulting negative publicity at Taco Bell,” Mr Novak said. “We expect to improve on these very disappointing results by the fourth quarter.”Yum aggressively disputed the taco lawsuit, which was later dropped. The company then took out full-page newspaper ads in the US that read “thank you for suing us” and “would it kill you to say you’re sorry?” to convey to customers that it uses real beef.In an effort to address concerns about its fledgling US business, Yum executives are planning to gather its advertising agencies for a “strategic session” to discuss business opportunities, according to a Yum representative.Earlier this year, Yum said it would look to sell its Long John Silver’s and A&W All-American food restaurants, as it deepens its focus on Asia. It confirmed that strategy in May when it moved to acquire Little Sheep, a Chinese chain of hot pot restaurants, for about $590m.Chinese consumers did their part for Yum in the second quarter. Overall its net income rose 10 per cent from a year ago to $316m, or 67 cents a share. Revenues were up 9 per cent to $2.8bn. The results beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations, and Yum’s shares rose 2.82 per cent to $57.15 in after-hours trading.

Brands;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Energy and materials lead US stocks higher;;Energy and materials led US stocks to gains across the board as US equity indices ended a three-session slide.US stocks initially climbed as traders were cheered by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke discussing future policy options before Congress and saying that the US Federal Reserve was “ready to respond” if a further stimulus was needed to revamp the sluggish US economy. Yet they came off their session highs after a top Fed official opposed Mr Bernanke’s comments saying he was against providing a stimulus even if the economy worsens.Stocks lost further ground after John Boehner, house speaker, said there would be no guarantee that the debt limit would be raised if an agreement was not inked by early August.The benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.31 per cent at 1,317.6 and the Nasdaq Composite was also in positive territory, up 0.54 per cent at 2,796.92.Most of the S&P sectors were up, with the materials sector 0.8 per cent higher with Titanium Metals at the helm, up 7 per cent at $18.9. The energy sector was up 0.7 per cent – spurred on in part by a decline in oil inventories, led by Alpha Natural, the coal producer, up 3.7 per cent at $45.The Dow Jones Industrial average climbed 0.4 per cent to 12,491.61, led by Caterpillar, which was up 1.6 per cent at $108.60.Financials weakened, but JPMorgan Chaseclosed 0.6 per cent up at $39.62, ending a three-session losing streak. However, poised for a lacklustre report of earnings before the bell on Thursday, it may say second-quarter revenue declined 0.8 per cent to $24.9bn according to average estimates by analysts.“The next big thing coming is JPMorgan releasing results, and that will fuel the fire,” said Sam Ginzburg, head of capital markets at First New York Securities.Investment Technology Group, an agency brokerage that serves large institutions, was down 13.73 per cent to $11.80, after the announcement of a large write-off for the second quarter alongside layoffs. As one of the lowest performing sectors, financials are under pressure to show that they can increase revenue within the sluggish US economy.Capital One slid 2.6 per cent to $50.87 despite reporting better than expected quarterly profits. It also said it would raise $2bn through a stock offering to finance the acquisition of ING’s US online bank.“Credit cards seem set for another quarter of beat and raise. Estimates are likely to move higher for Capital One. We continue to recommend Capital One and would note over the past year or so the card improvement cycle has survived several rounds of macro issues including the first round of Europe, the first GDP slowdown, and an oil price shock,” said Brian Foran, an analyst with Nomura.Other financial companies on the S&P 500 will announce earnings this week, including Citigroup on Friday.Marriott, the hotel chain, saw gains of 0.9 per cent at $37.10 while Yum! Brands, the US fast food restaurant group, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, closed up 1.09 per cent at $55.60. Yum reported a 10 per cent gain in profits or $0.65 per share in the second quarter, beating analysts’ expectations. Marriott’s diluted earnings per share totalled $0.37, a 19 per cent increase over the same period last year. Both companies announced results after the closing bell on Wednesday.“Yum! Brands has cash flow, strong, predictable and sustainable earnings. It has global reach with 40 per cent of its profits coming from China, which contributed to great earnings over time,” said Tucker Brown, research principal with SGA.On the media front, Netflix, the DVD subscription and streaming video company, hit an all-time high of $304.80 in early trading, though it pared its gains to $298.70, up 2.6 per cent. The company signed a multi-year deal renewing and broadening its rights to films and television shows from NBC Universal. This Tuesday’s move to overhaul its pricing policy to reflect the relative costs of distributing movies via the net and the post, was imed at pushing users toward its growing streaming service.News Corp was still in focus after dropping its $12.5bn bid to take full control of BSkyB, though it said it would remain as a long-term shareholder. Also on Wednesday, Senator Jay Rockefeller called for an inquiry into the media group , the first indication that the phone-hacking scandal that sparked outrage in the UK could spill over to the US. Its shares closed up 3.8 per cent to $15.93 in New York, paring back some losses after experiencing a 12.1 per cent drop since last week.
171;YUM;Yum! Brands;2011-07-10T07:12:16Z;The role of the subconscious in market behaviour;There are ways to tame damaging unconscious mental processes;"Decisions made below the surface of our consciousness play a crucial but often overlooked role in investor and market behaviour. Rodney Sullivan explores the role of the subconscious in driving investor decision-making, and suggests ways that investors can tame the potentially damaging consequences of unconscious mental processes.How does the subconscious mind impact investors?Decisions we don’t like to make, or ones that are painful, tend to be pushed into our subconscious. When buying a stock, for example, investors enter unwittingly into a relationship with an asset that can either let them down or provide a great thrill. Investors often deal with such conflicting feelings of pleasure and pain by repressing them.Such biases affect all phases of the investment process. Although investors may consider buying a stock, they often (perhaps unknowingly) hope that its price doesn’t go up. But as soon as they buy the stock, these same investors turn optimistic and yearn for price gains. Investors also tend to hold on to losing stocks far longer than they should, paralysed by a hope that the stock will rebound. Over-optimistic fantasies help explain the high frequency of asset bubbles and why investors are irrationally prone to buying “lottery”-type stocks with high volatility and high skewness.What about the role of perception?The “affect heuristic” describes how people unconsciously perceive one product or asset to be superior to another based simply on their emotions or feelings about the asset. Investors can view a company as “good” or “bad” based simply on its name (eg, the positive affect of YUM! Brands) or industry affiliation (eg, tobacco and other “sin” stocks have a negative affect; conversely, socially responsible stocks have a positive affect).The affect bias has an impact on asset pricing. Research shows, for example, that the stocks of the most admired companies ranked by Fortune magazine underperformed low-rated companies.Are conscious decisions superior to unconscious ones?Emotions play an important role in both types of decisions – and neither is necessarily “better” than the other. In fact, it is the interplay between the conscious and unconscious that matters. Consider how investors can benefit by replacing automatic impulses with actions directed by conscious reflection; poor judgment that largely occurs in our unconscious can be replaced by more sensible decisions. The idea is to recognise when emotional impulses are leading us down the path toward poor judgment, and then consciously allow our actions to be governed by more rational thought. This process works especially well for decisions that require logical reasoning.How can investors identify destructive impulses?By promptly recognising when the unconscious is dictating thoughts and actions, investors can identify destructive impulses. If they check their thinking against a list of typical negative investment behaviours, they can actively seek to minimise their impact. Identifying mental cues helps investors create an association between the cue and the behaviour.Such awareness can serve to inform the conscious mind when an automatic mental response has been triggered that might lead to poor or unintended consequences. From there, investors can re-focus their brains to co-ordinate more informed decisions. In this way, investors can reduce irrational mental effects by teaching themselves to think carefully about choices. But those behaviours must first be brought into their consciousness if they want to have any chance of overcoming them.Can unconscious mental processes also be beneficial?We should not attempt to eliminate all emotions from our mental processes. Unconscious mental short-cuts, for example, can sometimes be detrimental but also allow our brains to cope with the overwhelming uncertainty associated with investment decision-making. Even if a decision is not always the best one, often just making a decision can be a good thing (and a better outcome than remaining frozen with indecision).Consider an individual investor who is overwhelmed by the asset allocation decision. The investor could certainly do worse than following the well-known rule of thumb that suggests allocating the equivalent of one’s age to bonds and the remainder to stocks.What are the lessons for fund managers?Affect and other influences taking place in our subconscious can trump our better judgment and even lead to decisions dominated by unconscious criteria. It is important to remember that inherently irrational behaviour can be overcome by teaching ourselves to carefully analyse our choices.Rodney Sullivan is head of publications at CFA Institute and editor of the Financial Analysts Journal"
172;YUM;Yum! Brands;2011-05-23T17:12:10Z;China’s Buffett plays the long game;;Guo Guangchang, chairman and founder of Fosun, China’s largest private conglomerate, wants to be like Warren Buffett.When Mr Guo announced last week that his company had bought a stake in Folli Follie, the Greek luxury goods brand, he quoted the example of Mr Buffett twice in half an hour to make clear his intention to transform Fosun from an industrial conglomerate into a long-term strategic investment company, much like Berkshire Hathaway.“Mr Buffett focuses on investment skills and I always keep one of his quotes in my mind,” he told the Financial Times, in an interview.The Chinese businessman cites an aphorism of Benjamin Graham, Mr Buffett’s mentor, to illustrate his admiration for the legendary US investor: “In the short term, the stock market behaves like a voting machine – but in the long term, it acts like a weighing machine.”“When we’re thinking about investing in a company, we won’t watch its stock’s short-term fluctuation …We feel that a company’s long-term value is the more important factor.”For long term read “at least five years, 10 years or even 20 years,” Mr Guo says.Fosun itself has not been operating for 20 years. Mr Guo, 43, co-founded Fosun in 1992 with three fellow graduates of Shanghai’s leading Fudan University, with $4,000.Last year, China’s authoritative Hurun Rich list named him the mainland’s 43rd-richest person with a personal fortune of $2.6bn.In two decades Fosun has grown into one of the most powerful Chinese companies most Westerners have never heard of. Listed in Hong Kong it has investments in pharmaceuticals and healthcare, property, steel, mining and retail. Last year it had revenues of Rmb44bn ($6.8bn) and a net portfolio value of $6.3bn.This year it formed a $600m private equity fund with Prudential Financial of the US. It has recently retained John Snow, former US Treasury secretary, to advise its board.A former adviser says Fosun provides “the key to open a Chinese door”, helping famous foreign brands to exploit China’s vast government-inspired boost in domestic consumption, and making both companies rich in the process.Mr Guo describes Fosun’s role as a “helper”. The group will leave management of the foreign company to itself. “We respect their right to manage,” he said.Folli Follie, the Greek retail group with 100 stores in mainland China, is a good example, says Mr Guo. Last week he spent €84.5m to buy 9.5 per cent of it.Fosun has also recently built up a stake close to 10 per cent in Club Med, the French leisure group, which aims to make Chinese holidaymakers its second-largest customer base within five years.Mr Guo, modest and bespectacled, made clear that Club Med and Folli Follie are only the tip of the iceberg of Fosun’s outbound investment ambitions.He outlined plans for an extended foreign shopping spree that could involve a wide range of brands and businesses that need Fosun’s help to make money in China.Virtually any foreign company in any industry, listed or unlisted, could be a target, so long as it fits into Fosun’s strategy of “linking China’s growth momentum and the world’s resources to create a strong combination”, he said.Fosun is not only interested in luxury fashion brands, he emphasised. “All areas of Chinese consumption are growing fast, from the high end to the low end.“Low-end food and clothing has big growth potential in China – KFC is a good example of that,” he said, citing Yum Brands’ KFC, China’s leading fast-food restaurant.“We will…focus on areas we are already familiar with – for example, pharmaceuticals, fashion and tourism.”Additional reporting by Shirley Chen
173;YUM;Yum! Brands;2011-05-13T16:29:02Z;Yum makes bid for China’s Little Sheep;;Yum! Brands, the US fast food restaurant group, said on Friday that it has made a bid to acquire Little Sheep, the Chinese chain of hot pot restaurants, in a move deepen its presence in China.Yum, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, signalled its intentions last month with a preliminary proposal to acquire Little Sheep’s outstanding shares. Friday’s offer of HK$6.50, or 84 cents a share, values Little Sheep at about $860m, and represents a 30 per cent premium above its closing share price on April 21.Yum currently owns 27.2 per cent of Little Sheep and would control 93.2 per cent of the company, with its founders retaining 6.8 per cent. Analysts at Baird estimated that Yum would pay $590m to take the majority stake.“We think the purchase of Little Sheep can amplify Yum’s long-term growth potential in China and in other markets,” said David Tarantino, analyst at Baird.Yum already has a strong presence in China, with 4,000 existing restaurants. In its latest quarter, same-store sales there grew by 13 per cent year-on-year and international restaurant sales fuelled its profits amid weak US sales.Yum has about 38,000 restaurants around the world, with its international business accounting for 65 per cent of its profits.“We are confident we can further strengthen Little Sheep’s brand, business model and market position in the industry,” said Sam Su, chief executive of Yum’s China division.Although the Little Sheep acquisition will strengthen Yum in China, it also hopes to use Little Sheep to bring the hot pot concept to other international markets, according to Mr Su.Little Sheep’s revenue last year was Rmb1.93bn, up 22.7 per cent from the previous year. While restaurants account for the majority of revenues, Little Sheep also sells seasonings and speciality meat products.“I believe that the strong capability and expertise Yum possesses in managing world-class brands and growing restaurant networks will significantly further Little Sheep’s development in China and overseas, and should leave us well positioned to develop into an internationally-recognised restaurant chain,” said Zhang Gang, Little Sheep chairman.The chain owned 184 branches at the end of 2010, including a few branches in Canada and the US.Yum took its current stake in Little Sheep in 2009 when it acquired shares from 3i, a UK private equity firm that developed the Chinese chain’s franchise model and re-branded the restaurants. Analysts expected that Yum would eventually seek a bigger investment as it looked to take advantage of the Chinese restaurant market.Little Sheep was founded in 1999 in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, and gained a reputation for its hot pot, a style of dining in which customers cook raw ingredients in a pot of boiling broth that sits on the table. The chain thrived in second- and third-tier cities across China and the company listed in Hong Kong in June 2008.
174;YUM;Yum! Brands;2011-04-27T14:04:51Z;Yum! Brands to acquire China’s Little Sheep;;Yum! Brands, the US restaurant operator, said on Wednesday that it plans to acquire Little Sheep, a Chinese chain of hot pot restaurants, in a move that would deepen its presence in China.Yum, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell and already owns 27.2 per cent of Little Sheep’s stock, said it made a preliminary proposal to acquire the Chinese company’s outstanding shares. Little Sheep’s chairman and founding shareholders would maintain their minority interests.A formal offer will be made once Yum gets approval from regulators for the transaction, the company said.The deal would expand Yum’s footprint in a market where it is looking for continued growth. The company already has nearly 4,000 restaurants in China, where sales helped drive first-quarter profits. Yum’s same-store sales in China jumped by 13 per cent year-on-year during the first quarter, while falling by 1 per cent by the same measure in the US.Yum has about 38,000 restaurants around the world, with its international business accounting for 65 per cent of its profits.“Should any proposed transaction close at a reasonable price, we would view it as a positive for Yum, as it would further solidify Yum’s position as the leading restaurant company in fast-growing China,” Mark Kalinowski, analyst at Janney Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.Yum took its current stake in Little Sheep in 2009 when it acquired shares from 3i, a UK private equity firm that developed the Chinese chain’s franchise model and re-branded the restaurants.

The technology giant reported earnings of $5.99bn in the quarter, or $6.40 a share, sharply ahead of the $5.37 expected by analysts.The results were helped by strong sales in iPhones and Mac computers, but the company said that it was struggling to produce enough of its latest version of the iPad to meet demand. Shares in the company closed up 2.4 per cent to $350.69 on Thursday.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Qualcomm climbed 3 per cent to $56.94 after the world’s leading mobile phone chipmaker by sales reported second-quarter earnings of 86 cents a share, exceeding the 80 cents expected by analysts.The company also raised its 2011 forecasts significantly as it eyed an expansion into tablets, e-readers and home consumer electronics.These bumper results pushed the S&P technology index up 1 per cent, adding to the 2.4 per cent jump the previous session following similarly strong results from Intel and IBM.This led Wall Street higher on Thursday, helping the S&P 500 index close 0.5 per cent higher at 1,337.38 in low volume trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 12,505.84, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,820.16.The S&P 500 and the Dow were both up 1.3 per cent over the week.Sentiment was held back slightly after the Philadelphia Fed announced that its index of regional business activity fell to 18.5 in April, down from 43.4 in March and below the 35 expected. Separately, the number of weekly jobless claims declined, but by less than expected, and the previous week’s figures were revised up.In the industrial sector, General Electric beat expectations with a 48 per cent rise in underlying earnings for the first quarter, driven almost entirely by another strong performance at its GE Capital financial services unit. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by a penny to 15 cents, the third dividend increase in the last year.But investors had been hoping for even more and the stock was down 2.2 per cent to $19.95. The stock had been up 1.8 per cent on the week before the results as sentiment in the industrial sector was higher following strong results from other key players.In the previous session, United Technologies, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, reported forecast-beating earnings while Eaton and Honeywell also reported strong results.Looking to the financial sector, shares in Morgan Stanley added 1.7 per cent to $26.48 after the investment bank also reported forecast-beating quarterly results. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding some items, were 46 cents a share, compared with the 40 cents expected by analysts.While the results beat expectations, in absolute terms they were less impressive. MorganStanley reported a 48 per cent drop in first-quarter profits as its joint brokerage venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group posted a $1.8bn annual loss and revenue from fixed-income trading fell by a third.Earnings results so far for the financial sector have been mixed. Goldman Sachs reported strong results on Tuesday, powered by strong revenues from its investing and lending divisions. But other results from Wells Fargo and Bank of America have been more disappointing, with results weighed down by troubled mortgage operations.Elsewhere on Wall Street, F5 Networks, a cloud computing software maker, was up 7.2 per cent to $106.87 after reporting a 68 per cent boost to second-quarter profit and raising its earnings forecast for the current quarter above analysts’ expectations.Shares in McDonald’s fell 1.9 per cent to $76.91 after the restaurant chain warned that higher food costs could cut into margins, while its earnings came in ahead of analysts’ estimates with an 11 per cent rise in first-quarter profits.Verizon Communications slid 2.3 per cent to $36.91 after its first-quarter profit more than tripled, but its average revenue per user rose by less than analysts had expected.
176;YUM;Yum! Brands;2011-03-28T22:24:24Z;Streetwise strategy for an urban future;Companies should focus on key high-growth cities;"Predictions of rapid economic growth trigger in me the same breathless fear and excitement as news that tickets for a show or sporting event are going on sale and will sell out instantly. How much more stressful these forecasts must be for chief executives, whose destiny, and that of their companies, depends on being near the front of the queue when visions of the future come true.Deciding how to allocate resources to different markets is hard enough already. But what if the market has, quite literally, not yet been built?The McKinsey Global Institute, the consultancy’s research arm, has projected how hundreds of cities may fuel the global economy in 2025. Its “Urban World” report suggests a bigger contribution to growth, the lodestone of corporate strategy, will come from places below the top rank than from megacities like Shanghai, New York and Delhi. What’s more, 230 of those places – “middleweight” cities, poised to expand – don’t even appear in today’s top 600.The report sends an urgent invitation to companies to rethink their country- and continent-specific approach to strategy and look more closely at urban centres and clusters. Farewell, Emea and Brics. Hello, Huambo, Medan and Viña del Mar.There’s a lot of this about. Chirpy urbanists like Richard Florida and Edward Glaeser are criss-crossing the globe with their blueprints of a bright metropolitan tomorrow. But they can’t answer the board-level questions that McKinsey’s report prompts. How many strollers will we sell in Taipei in 2018? How much of our cement and steel will São Paulo need to build the 3.7m additional dwellings it requires between now and 2025? Even McKinsey would acknowledge that its projections are subject to some strong caveats.The only certainty is demographic. The adult inhabitants of the cities of 2025 are already born, so that projection of demand for residential space in São Paulo is sounder than most long-range predictions. But the rate – and direction – of migration to and from cities always varies.Fluctuating exchange rates can play havoc with rankings of relative economic prosperity and growth. In cities as in stocks, past performance is no guarantee of future results: think about once-mighty Detroit’s long 20th century decline. Cities can get too big. Either their populations outstrip local governments’ ability to manage the infrastructure – creating the problems of overcrowding that trouble Mumbai or Mexico City – or ambitious new building programmes outstrip demand, as has happened recently in Dubai.Politics matter more to companies investing in the future of cities than to those taking a loftier national or supranational view of markets. Ineffective or clumsily interventionist mayors can blight a city as surely as pollution or crime. Prof Glaeser, author of Triumph of the City, says: “So much of being an effective real estate entrepreneur has little to do with building housing, or even guessing the right type of demand, but being able to negotiate the maze of land-use regulations. Businessmen need to work with government to get value out of urban areas.”One way companies can position themselves to make the most of these opportunities, and limit the risks, is to place lots of small bets early. Yum! Brands has already established more than 3,200 KFC restaurants in China, with about half of recent openings in smaller cities. Lower labour costs, rent and, at least initially, competition, blunt the risk involved in tapping the potential of growing metropolitan areas.Scale counts in these emerging markets. Alan Jope, Unilever’s chairman for greater China, told the Financial Times that urbanisation – particularly in middleweight cities – would help the consumer products company achieve its global goals.But not every company can spare personnel to get to know the mayor in each of hundreds of fast-growing cities worldwide, or put a team on the ground in every province in China except Tibet, as Yum! has. For the rest, opportunities abound in established markets. New York, London and Tokyo still make the 2025 ranking of the top 25 cities by forecast gross domestic product growth. Six of the 10 cities with the highest annual income will be in mature markets. City seers like John Kasarda (Aerotropolis) or Prof Florida (Who’s Your City?; The Great Reset) are as optimistic about Amsterdam or Nashville as McKinsey is about Chongqing and Wuhan.The urban future may be messy. The views of city visionaries are often contradictory. But if they are even roughly right, corporate strategists should start readjusting their focus to street-level.andrew.hill@ft.com"

Employment fell by 39,000 after a revised gain of 10,000 in August.On average, economists had forecast a rise of 20,000 although there had been a broad range of estimates.The report is watched by some investors as an indicator of what the government’s non-farm payrolls report could show on Friday. Economists had forecast a rise of 75,000 in private payrolls for Friday’s report. “[The figures] reinforce yet again that the recovery is not at this stage where it will be adding private-sector jobs,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial.But she said that the direction of the market could quickly change during the session as traders were watching the direction of the dollar, and considering the potential for another round of quantitative easing.

178;YUM;Yum! Brands;2010-08-24T19:04:47Z;Investors take indirect route into China;The investment community looks for fresh angles for exposure;"With a stimulus-fuelled boom in domestic demand altering the composition of China’s breakneck growth, investors are increasingly looking at fresh angles to buy the dragon.Gaining exposure to China’s growth story can be a tricky prospect – China’s currency is still largely controlled by the state, its bond market is small and suffers from a weak legal structure, and Chinese equities have been a poor indicator of the country’s economic success.The Shanghai Composite index remains the second-worst performing major equity market in the world this year, after Greece, despite gross domestic product growth steaming ahead at 11.3 per cent in the first half of 2010.So it comes as little surprise that the investment community is looking at alternatives to gain China exposure from resources and currencies to debt and non-Chinese equities.A long-time China play has been through commodities and within the commodity basket, copper has been the traditional choice.The red metal is important both for infrastructure development and improving energy efficiency. In recent years it has been a decent proxy for Chinese industrial output, and that looks set to continue.In 2000, China bought 12 per cent of the world’s copper. In 2009 that had risen to 40 per cent, according to research from Macquarie. Similarly, lead is a substance in short supply but in high demand in China, says Kevin Norrish at BarCap. China now buys 43.5 per cent of the world’s supply, and recent efforts to reduce pollution in major cities have forced a number of smelters to close, helping to put pressure on domestic supply.China’s booming market for cars and electric bikes should guarantee strong demand, the key question is how much lead China can supply without the need for major imports.Morgan Stanley’s China commodity pick is coal – China’s growing demand has seen it turn net importer in recent years, while neighbouring producer countries, such as Mongolia, are looking into new projects to exploit that rising trend.In the agricultural sector BarCap favours corn. While China’s rising incomes haven’t seen its population significantly turn to coffee or chocolate – it has seen a rising appetite for meat. As corn is used both for human consumption and animal feed, it is a good proxy for changing dietary habits.“China has for many years been a net exporter of corn, but it is now starting to flip between imports and exports. We believe these are the first steps on a journey that will eventually see China shift to being an importer of corn on a structural basis,” Mr Norrish says.For China followers, commodities have a strong appeal as veteran investor Jim Rogers explains: “[They] are the best way to gain Chinese exposure, because one does not need to worry about central banks, corporate governance, financial statements, etc, and China must buy most commodities.”By contrast, corporate debt in China can pose major challenges for investors with recovery rates following default almost impossible to gauge.“When it comes to creditors’ rights for corporate bonds, China ranks the lowest in Asia,” says Esther Chan, debt portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. “The bankruptcy process for creditors is unproven, and past experience doesn’t give investors much comfort. Countries like Indonesia who have been through prior crises are more creditor-friendly”.Meanwhile, the few, well-established Chinese companies that issue debt are starting to look expensive, say analysts. Parkson, the department store chain, has seen yields drop from over 7 per cent to about 4.5 per cent. And less direct plays, such as bonds issued by Brazilian steelmakers, are starting to lose their China bias as the Brazil’s domestic growth story takes off.Instead, Ms Chan now looks for China exposure through bonds of property companies.“If you are willing to weather the volatility from policymakers’ attempts to slow real estate growth, keep a longer-term horizon and invest only in the top quality issuers of the Chinese real estate sector; the risk return profile of Chinese property bonds is very attractive and provides exposure to the growing wealth of the middle class in China,” Ms Chan says.In the currency markets, the Aussie dollar remains the most favoured China play (see chart). It is well plugged in to the development of China’s domestic economy – Australia provides the raw materials needed for construction and infrastructure, rather than the components used for exports, like nearby South Korea and Taiwan.For equity investors there are still some ways of buying into domestic growth, even in western markets, but investors are looking at individual companies.Recent research from Jonathan Garner of Morgan Stanley into macro-economic shifts in China points to a number of big multinational stocks that look set to benefit from rising wages and changing spending patterns in China.Those are mainly globally established brands, such as Nike, Yum! Brands, Unilever, H&M and L’Oréal, that target middle-income consumers. The potential for these companies is unprecedented – Mr Garner projects that by 2020, there will be more households with a disposable income of over $10,000 in Bric countries than in the US and the eurozone combined, with most of that growth coming from China.The message from the investment community seems to be that, while direct exposure to Chinese growth through the stock market remains tricky, there are still plenty of ways to buy the dragon.This is the fifth article in a series."

However, core retail sales, which exclude petrol, building materials and cars, increased by 0.2 per cent, the first gain since March.There has been a steady decline in bullish sentiment on the sell-side, said John Horcher, director of sell-side sales at First Coverage, a research group that tracks market sentiment. “We are seeing the sell-side get a little more scared of the market as it’s been rising recently. Sentiment is trending downward.”After a choppy morning, the S&P 500 closed flat at 1,095.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also flat, at 10,366.72, while the Nasdaq Composite had risen 0.4 per cent to 2,249.84.Yum Brands, a fast-food chain operator that owns Taco Bell among others, was 1.2 per cent lower at $41 following the release of its second-quarter results after the market’s close on Tuesday.The company said it expected to earn $2.43 per share this year, below the average analyst estimate of $2.48.However, its earnings for the past quarter beat expectations, coming in at 58 cents per share compared with the average estimate of 54 cents.Intel added 1.7 per cent to $21.36 after reporting the best quarter in its history. Its corporate customers increased information technology spending, boosting hopes that businesses are engaged in a long-awaited “refresh” of both hardware and software in the aftermath of the financial crisis.Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices fell 1.1 per cent to $7.44.But the disappointing retail sales data weighed on retailers. Department store chain JC Penney fell 0.9 per cent to $22.99, rival Dillard’s was down 1.3 per cent at $22.11 and Macy’s dropped 0.5 per cent to $18.38.However, a number of thrift stores inched upward. Dollar Tree added 1 per cent to $42.06, Family Dollar Stores was up 1.5 per cent to $37.08 and Dollar General advanced 1.9 per cent to $28.23.Homebuilders were among the day’s laggards as the sector was downgraded from “attractive” to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs, who cited a lack of immediate catalysts to boost the stocks’ performance. A rise in new home sales last month was smaller than the analysts at the brokerage had expected.Lennar Corp led the sector lower as it dropped 4.3 per cent to $14.59. Pulte was down 3 per cent at $8.54, Toll Brothers fell 2.3 per cent to $17.16 and DR Horton dropped 0.9 per cent to $10.34.Annaly Capital Management announced a common stock offering of 60m shares, sending its shares down 4.1 per cent to $17.52. The mortgage real estate investment trust said it expected gross proceeds of $1.1bn from the offering.RadioShack, a consumer electronics goods retailer, was one of the session’s worst performers, as it fell 5.5 per cent to $21.17, on reports that an ongoing “soft” auction for its sale had seen a fall in interest from potential buyers.Northrop Grumman, a global security company, rallied 3.1 per cent to $56.99 after it said it was considering a possible sale or spin-off of its ship unit, in a deal that could be worth as much as $4.5bn.Caterpillar inched down 0.1 per cent to $66.70 even as estimates for its second-quarter and full-year earnings were revised upwards at RBC Capital Markets, citing evidence suggesting better than expected end-markets. The broker sees earnings per share in the quarter of 85 cents, up from its prior estimate of 72 cents. Caterpillar will report its second-quarter earnings on July 22 before the open.JPMorgan Chase lost 0.3 per cent to $40.35 a day before its second-quarter earnings release. Analysts’ average earnings per share estimate is 71 cents per share.Marriott International, due to report earnings on Wednesday after the market’s close, rose 0.9 per cent to $32.16. Analysts on average expect earnings per share of 29 cents from the hotels group.

Brands;2010-07-14T18:57:56Z;Yum Brands;A focus on one number can lead investors down the wrong path;It should be no surprise by now that a ruthless focus on one number can lead investors down the wrong path. On Wednesday Yum Brands’ shares slipped backwards in spite of a decent set of results that met expectations without resorting to cosmetic tricks. The bad news: Chinese same-store sales growth was merely 4 per cent.That metric gets more attention than it deserves because the world’s largest restaurant operator, with more than 37,000 outlets worldwide, is heavily exposed to China. The bright signs of its KFC and Pizza Hut chains are one of the most visible indications of growing consumer appetites, and an early and aggressive push into the country means that Yum’s 3,600 stores there produce almost two-fifths of the group’s operating profit. By 2011, the US, where Credit Suisse calculates Taco Bell is the other highly profitable jewel in Yum’s crown, may be the smallest contributor to profits after China and the international division.However, in China investors might be better off watching return on invested capital, consistently coming in at a mid-30’s percentage level. Sales growth is affected by intentional cannibalisation in some areas, while pent up demand in new regions makes year one comps tough to match. But profitably growing a business in developing markets deserves credit. Rising Chinese wages might be a short-term threat to high levels of profitability in the country, but the improvement to middle-class incomes, not to mention a revaluing renminbi, will also help.Meanwhile, back in the US the group is busy fixing the domestic business by handing poor performing company-owned stores over to franchisees. Given the boost McDonald’s shares received from a domestic turnround, Yum may soon have many appetising numbers for investors to chew on.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

The confrontation represents an escalation of recent industrial action, which until this week had been largely peaceful and concentrated in southern Guangdong province.The unrest suggests that industrial action is proliferating faster than local governments and the sole union allowed by the communist party – the All China Federation of Trade Unions – can resolve them.There is no evidence that workers at different factories are co-ordinating their activities but the success of a strike at the transmission operations of Honda, the Japanese carmaker, has emboldened workers by demonstrating that mass action can yield results.Workers have largely circumvented the official union in recent protests, another concern for Chinese leaders, who are quick to suppress any political organisation outside of the ruling party.Protests by workers are not uncommon in China but they have rarely happened in a concerted fashion in factories operated by multinationals such as Honda and their affiliates.The clashes at KOK International in Kunshan, in eastern Jiangsu province near Shanghai, coincided with renewed action surrounding Honda and its China-based suppliers.The strike, at Foshan Fengfu Autoparts, forced Honda to suspend production at its assembly plants in nearby Guangzhou, Guangdong’s provincial capital. The joint venture supplies exhaust components.A Honda spokesman also confirmed further industrial action at a locks supplier late on Wednesday, but no details were available on its impact.Yum Brands declined to comment on a report by the official Xinhua news agency that 68 KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in Shenyang, in north-east China, had agreed to raise wages 30 per cent to Rmb900 ($130, £90).Workers at Foshan Fengfu, which employs 492, appeared to have been inspired by the strike last week at a Honda transmission plant which ended when the company agreed a 24-33 per cent wage rise.Workers returned to the factory on Wednesday but visitors said production had not resumed.On June 6 about 300 workers at a Taiwanese audio components factory in Shenzhen blocked roads to protest against shift changes. A spokesman for Merry Electronics said the situation was quickly defused. “We had decided at the beginning of the year to raise wages 10 per cent by July 1, but had never announced this to the staff,” Tseng Chin-tang said.

183;YUM;Yum! Brands;2010-05-26T17:02:21Z;Taco Bell to open in the UK;;Yum Brands, the US restaurant group behind KFC and Pizza Hut, is to step up its assault on the UK fast-food market with the launch of the Taco Bell chain in the country next month.Best known for its cheap tacos and burritos, Taco Bell, which is to debut at the Lakeside Shopping at the end of June, is Yum’s most profitable business in the US and is seen by the company to have the most growth potential.Having taken advantage of the recession-related boom in quick and cheap food to expand the number of KFCs and Pizza Huts in the UK over the past year, Yum said it believed the growing demand for non-burger fare among fast-food consumers would help Taco Bell develop a “significant presence” in the country.“This is a major step in our international expansion, and Lakeside is just the start of our plans in this country,” said Nick Dawson, general manager, Taco Bell UK and Europe.This will not be Yum’s first attempt to bring Taco Bell to the UK. The chain last attempted to establish itself in the UK in the late 1980s. It had three outlets in London and one in Birmingham, all of which were closed by the mid-1990s.Nonetheless, Mr Dawson believed that the chain could now be successful given the greater awareness of Mexican food among Britons and the steady growth seen in the £17.5bn ($25.2bn) a year fast-food and takeaway market during the recession.“UK consumers are looking for choice and value for money,” said Mr Dawson. “Taco Bell, whose offerings are priced between 79p and £3, offers both.”According to Yum, the Mexican food market in the UK has grown by 9 per cent in the past two years, with chains such as Wahaca and Tortilla now a fixture in the City.Mr Dawson declined to be drawn on the potential size of Taco Bell’s roll-out in the UK, except to say that the Lakeside store marks the first in a number of openings planned over the coming year.Yum, which recorded $10.8bn in turnover last year, is eyeing international expansion as a key driver of growth as the US market remains stagnant. It opened its first Taco Bell in India earlier this year, and it plans to have at least 1,000 restaurants there by 2015.

The fraud charges concern the packaging and selling of collateralised debt obligations. The bank is charged with not disclosing the role Paulson & Co, a hedge fund, played in a transaction.After the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.6 per cent at 1,192.13, leaving it 0.19 per cent lower during the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1 per cent to 11,018.66, leaving it up 0.2 per cent on the week. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.4 per cent lower at 2,481.26, but up 1.1 per cent for the week.Bank of America fell 5.5 per cent to $18.41 yesterday even as it was reporting better first-quarter earnings than expected.“After the JPMorgan results this week, it’s hard to be a shining star,” said Steve Hagenbuckle, managing partner at New York-based TerraCap Partners.The results were boosted by a strong performance by its investment banking division that is largely made up of the Merrill Lynch business it bought at the height of the financial crisis.“If it wasn’t for Merrill, the figures would look very different,” said Mr Hagenbuckle.Net income was 28 cents per share, compared with consensus analyst estimates of 9 cents per share.JPMorgan was 0.9 per cent lower on the week to $45.55 after reporting earnings per share of 74 cents, more than double the same period last year, and beating expectations of 64 cents per share.Citigroup fell 5.2 per cent to $4.56 but rose 0.2 per cent for the week.

Its US fast-food competitors have also responded to the slow economy with a range of “value” offerings, such as the “Why Pay More?” menu recently launched by Yum Brands’ Taco Bell, and Subway’s “$5 foot-long” sandwiches.Yum, owner of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, warned last week that it faced a “difficult consumer environment” in its current fourth quarter and predicted an 8 per cent fall in comparable US sales.It also highlighted falling demand in China, which accounts for about half of its revenues, with sales in the country expected to decline by 3 per cent.Western fast food restaurants in China have lost business as consumers switch back to eating at cheaper local restaurants, and have been hit by the decline of demand in coastal industrial cities.McDonald’s monthly sales update disappointed investors, and its shares fell more than 1 per cent by lunchtime in New York to $60.75.● Kroger, owner of the largest network of traditional US supermarkets, saw its shares fall over 10 per cent on Tuesday, after reporting disappointing third-quarter results.The retailer cited “persistent deflation, unusually intense competition and the cautious mind-set of customers”, as it cut its full- year earnings guidance to $1.60 to $1.70 per share, from a previous forecast of $1.90 to $2.00.Kroger also announced a $1.05bn writedown on the value of its Ralph’s grocery chain.

created uncertainty on Wall Street on Wednesday, causing the market to stall after its two-day rally.Investors were also bracing themselves ahead of the third-quarter earnings season, due to start officially with results from the aluminium producer Alcoa after the closing bell.Telecoms stocks led the declines in early trading after AT&T reversed its policy on internet voice applications. Bowing to pressure from regulators and consumers, the network provider said late on Tuesday that it would allow inexpensive internet phone calls to be placed through its networks from Apple’s iPhones. AT&T lost 2.1 per cent to $26.18 and concern spread to the rest of the sector. Verizon Communications, the largest US mobile phone company, lost 1.1 per cent to $29.38.Over the previous two sessions, US stocks gained almost 3 per cent on rising commodity prices, deal activity and encouraging data from the US services sector.“From a technical standpoint we’ve had a pretty big run-up, and we’re just consolidating now,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global. He added the market was also in a frozen state as it responded to mixed corporate news. “Companies are containing costs, but there are still pockets of disappointment. There have also been some changes in telecoms, and the market seems to be taking that a little bit adversely.”After a day of choppy trading, the S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,057.58. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.1 per cent at 9,725.58 and the Nasdaq gained 0.3 per cent to 2,110.33.Consumer stocks helped to lift sentiment after a series of companies beat estimates.Costco Wholesale re-ported lower fourth-quarter profit due to weak demand for fuel and non-food items. However, its results still beat Wall Street forecasts and the shares rose 1.9 per cent to $59.Family Dollar Stores also reported fourth-quarter earnings above analyst estimates, but after early gains the shares closed 1 per cent lower at $28.21. The retailer said it had benefited from stocking more food and consumable goods, which had been popular with frugal shoppers.Helen of Troy, which owns personal-care brands Vidal Sassoon and Revlon, posted better-than-expected quarterly results, mainly due to cost cuts. The shares rose 12.5 per cent to $22.50.Yum Brands, owner of fast-food chains KFC and Pizza Hut, reported third-quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat estimates and raised its full-year profit forecast. The group said it had benefited from falling food prices and particularly strong demand in China. However, after early gains, the shares fell 1.4 per cent to $34.37.Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank upgraded Coca-Cola to “buy”, helping to lift its shares 0.9 per cent to $54.81.Wyndham Worldwide, the holiday company that owns about 7,000 hotels, gained 7.4 per cent to $17.47 after Goldman Sachs boosted its rating on the stock to “buy”. Goldman said the company would be likely to benefit from its shift away from the timeshare business toward a fee-for-service structure.Financial stocks led the market higher for most of the day in spite of losses from government-backed mortgage lenders. Freddie Mac lost 1.1 per cent to $1.79 and Fannie Mae was down 2 per cent at $1.48 after reports that they were working on a programme to help independent mortgage banks get access to short-term credit for home loans.Avis Budget Group, the car rental company, weighed on the market, falling 5.9 per cent to $12.50 after it warned of weaker earnings. On Tuesday the group offered $250m in notes along with a warrant transaction, which it said would dilute earnings.Monsanto, the world’s biggest seed company, reported a loss that was not as deep as expected, but revenues continued to slide on weak demand for its herbicide product. The group’s shares lost 1.4 per cent to $74.33.In the technology sector, Ciena announced it was buying Nortel’s Metro Ethernet Networks business for $390m in cash and 10m Ciena shares. Ciena rose 3 per cent to $13.44."

Brands;2009-10-06T22:52:30Z;Pizza Hut sales drop as consumers heat at home;;Pizza Hut, one of the largest US pizza restaurant and home delivery chains, has been hit by a sharp slump in orders as competitors tout the lower cost of their frozen, heat-at-home alternatives.Yum Brands, owner of the Pizza Hut brand, said on Tuesday that comparable sales at its more than 6,000 US franchised and company owned locations had dropped 13 per cent during its third quarter, compared with the same period last year.The poor performance at Pizza Hut contributed to a 6 per cent fall in comparable US sales at Yum Brands’ more than 17,000 US locations, which also include KFC, Taco Bell and other brands.Pizza Hut’s comparable US sales started falling in the first quarter of this year, putting pressure on the company’s overall comparable sales after six previous quarters of growth. Its sales were down 8 per cent in the second quarter on an annual basis.Kraft, the largest US food company, has reported strong growth of its DiGiorno frozen pizza since the start of the consumer slump. Walmart, the largest US retailer, has also been promoting its “take and bake” pizza, which it has claimed could save a family that ordered pizza deliveries once a week about $312 a year.The fate of pizza in the recession has contrasted with the stronger performance of McDonald’s, the largest US hamburger chain, whose sales have been supported by its low-cost, value meals.In spite of the US pizza slump, Yum Brands reported third-quarter earnings that were ahead of Wall Street expectations, and raised its full-year earnings per share guidance from $2.10 to $2.14, citing stronger than expected business in China, and a lower tax rate.Yum Brands earnings rose 18 per cent to $334m, or 69 cents per share. Total revenue fell 2 per cent to $2.78bn.●Pepsi Bottling Group, Pepsi-Cola’s largest US bottler, underlined the changing habits of the US consumer as it reported third-quarter results on Tuesday. It said it was continuing to see more strength in supermarket and discount store sales than in restaurants.PBG, which is in the process of being acquired by PepsiCo, its largest shareholder, reported a 10 per cent increase in earnings to $254m, or diluted earnings per share of $1.14, while revenues fell 5 per cent to $3.6bn.

Its shares rose 2.1 per cent to $50.53.United Technologies gained 1.4 per cent to $61.24 after Goldman raised its price target on the stock.The market retreated slightly by mid-afternoon after the release of the Beige Book by the Federal Reserve, which said that labour markets remained weak and retail sales were flat. But after a late recovery, the S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent to 1,033.37 – the highest level since October.The Nasdaq outperformed the other indices after Ebay, the online auction group, rose 3.9 per cent to $22.68 after an upgrade.The technology-heavy index rose 1.1 per cent to 2,060.39, also reaching its highest level since October, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.5 per cent higher at 9,547.22.Encouraging data on the housing sector initially helped boost sentiment. Mortgage applications were shown to have risen to their highest level since May.But the dollar, which was hovering around its 2009 low against the basket of leading currencies, weighed on sentiment in early trade.Oil prices also showed signs of stalling before resuming their upward trend, briefly bringing the energy sector back into positive territory.But by the end of the day, ExxonMobil fell back 0.2 per cent to $70.50 while Chevron also slipped 0.2 per cent to $70.33.Commodities have helped propel equities higher in recent sessions with gold breaking through the $1,000 level.Health insurers came into focus again ahead of Barack Obama’s address to Congress on Wednesday evening as he was expected to outline his proposed reforms of the healthcare system.After losing more than 4 per cent on Tuesday, Wellpoint clawed back 1.9 per cent to $52.84.The consumer discretionary sector weighed on the market after McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant group, missed August sales expectations.Fast-food chains have benefited in the recession, outperforming many of their upmarket rivals, but the group said high unemployment in the US had hit profitable breakfast and beverage sales. While same-store sales rose 3.5 per cent in Europe, they only crept up 1.7 per cent in the US and fell 0.5 per cent in the company’s restaurants in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa.The group’s shares fell 2 per cent to $55.09.Yum! Brands which owns other fast-food brands such as KFC, fell 1.7 per cent to $33.60 in response.After Kraft’s bid for Cadbury in the week, Hershey added 3.5 per cent to $40.49 following reports that it had hired JPMorgan to advise on its options in a potential counterbid.In the retail sector, Signet Jewelers posted second-quarter earnings above analyst forecasts as it gained market share and cut costs. Shares in the company, which owns Kay in the US and H Samuel in the UK, climbed 10.8 per cent to $27.17.Cost-cutting also helped Talbots, which sells traditional women’s clothing, to curb its losses in the second quarter. After early rises, its shares fell back 2.3 per cent to $6.95.Casey’s General Stores climbed 8.4 per cent to $30.56.

191;YUM;Yum! Brands;2009-08-22T00:53:44Z;Nimble rivals serve to change chain;;Jens Hofma, chief executive of Pizza Hut UK, is the first to admit the brand has gone through its share of rough patches.Having been among the first to arrive on the UK restaurant scene from the US in the early 1970s, the business, best known for its deep-pan pizzas, has watched itself steadily lose market shares to younger and more nimble operators, such as Ask, Prezzo and Pizza Express, during the boom years of the past decade.“If you look at the past five or six years, we have definitely been suffering from increased competition in the casual dining market,” says Mr Hofma, who took over the top job in March.The figures make sobering reading. Between 2003 to 2007, pre-tax profit at Pizza Hut UK plummeted 81 per cent to £6.4m ($10.6m) even as spending in the “informal” eating out market (£15 and under) rose by nearly a quarter to £38.9bn during this period.The problem, as Mr Hofma sees it, was not only the emergence of stiffer competition on the high street. The business, which until 2006 was operated as a joint venture between Whitbread and Yum Brands, had also become complacent.“When you have a fairly average asset with fairly average service, you [could] probably get by in the 1990s,” he says. “But I think the bar has been put much higher now in terms of what the people consider to be a great restaurant experience …and it took us a little while to respond to that because, when you are used to running a certain model and you are making good money with it, there is less of a burning need to change.“Over the past five years, we have really sensed that we really need to up our game a bit,” he adds.Since 2006, when Yum bought out Whitbread’s stake, the business has invested heavily to update its image. Some tens of millions of pounds have already been spent to refit restaurants for a more contemporary appearance while the menu has been expanded to broaden the chain’s appeal beyond lovers of deep-pan pizzas.By his own admission, Mr Hofma, an affable Dutchman who grew up in the Swiss mountain village of Nendaz, is an unlikely candidate to spearhead the revival of a US fast-food chain in the UK.But the 42-year-old, who first cut his teeth at Nestlé, then at McKinsey before joining Yum in 2004, has relished the challenge to rebalance the business, which up until recently had been skewed towards pizza sales in its 400 restaurants.As part of his review, Mr Hofma intends to close 30 high street restaurants and to concentrate on retail park restaurants and to expand the home-delivery business.“We have been focusing very strongly on our restaurant business, sometimes at the expense of the delivery business. We have changed that perspective …considerably in the last six months.”Britons are filling up on fried chicken and takeaway pizza as recession deepens, turning their backs on the fashionable restaurants and gourmet food that boomed as incomes peaked.By stepping up its home delivery business, Mr Hofma hopes Pizza Hut can get a bigger slice.Mr Hofma also intends to boost growth at its restaurants – not by openings – but by products such as the “Tuscani”, a thin-crust rocket and prosciutto pizza that Mr Hofma describes as “a bit more aspirational, a bit more contemporary than the usual [deep-crust] pizza we have” – as well as its pasta and salad menu. “We shouldn’t just be a pizza concept. People come to Pizza Hut because it’s quite a social experience. They come with their families, they come with groups of friends or work colleagues.“You need to make sure you don’t alienate anybody and that there’s something everybody likes.“Without necessarily having a huge range, you want to be sufficiently inclusive so that people who don’t like pizza will still have a choice …You don’t want them to have the veto of the group not coming to Pizza Hut.”
192;YUM;Yum!

The stock fell 12.6 per cent to $5.39.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.3 per cent down at 994.35, on a day when trading in certain shares, including those in Warren Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway, was halted for almost four hours after a computer problem,.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 9.241.45 and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 1.1 per cent to 1,969.73.“After a near-50 per cent rally off the lows this pull back is both normal and expected,” said Jordan Smyth, managing director of Edgemoor Investment Advisors. “It is not necessarily the start of a steep decline.”The falls came in spite of figures showing productivity among non-farm workers in the second quarter rose more than economists had expected while the costs of that labour fell.But experts warned such savings may not inflate profit margins.Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: “Are companies really going to put these cost savings into margins? My conclusion would be that they are going to use them instead as a tool to cut prices.”There was further pessimism from data showing companies cut inventories much more sharply than expected last month, apparently holding out little hope for a bounce in demand.Wall Street was also waiting for the statement from the Federal Reserve, whose Open Market Committee (FOMC) began its two-day meeting on Tuesday to discuss interest rates and the future of quantitative easing.With many on Wall Street predicting little change in policy, investors were waiting to see what tone the committee would strike on the health of the economy.Meanwhile companies sensitive to the US consumer suffered on a second bearish day for cyclicals.Sprint Nextel, the mobile phone operator, lost 4.3 per cent to $3.55 after Piper Jaffray downgraded the stock, warning of continued loss of customers.That came after Sprint announced on Monday night that it would increase a current debt offer to $1.3bn, which would take its debt load to $21bn.Yum Brands, which owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, also saw its shares downgraded, with UBS warning about sluggish sales in the US. The stock fell 3.8 per cent to $35.13.But investors were happier about signs that the battle over Target, the value retailer, may be cooling after Pershing Square, whose manager Bill Ackman lost a proxy contest to elect new directors earlier this year, cut its stake to 4.4 per cent. Target picked up 0.5 per cent to $42.20.The ongoing delays to President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms meant health insurers, which stand to see government subsidies cut under the proposals, were one of the few sectors to show strength.UnitedHealth rose 2.8 per cent to $27.82 while Coventry Health Care climbed 1.6 per cent to $22.52.Shares in Fluor, the engineering company, fell after it announced lower revenues than expected. Even though it made better profits than forecast and maintained its outlook, the stock lost 6.1 per cent to $53.96.
193;YUM;Yum! Brands;2009-07-26T07:25:15Z;Bill Miller claims computers amplify market trends;;"Quant traders dominate markets so much they create as many market inefficiencies as they exploit, according to Legg Mason’s Bill Miller.He has altered his investment process in the past year to take advantage of the impact of computer-based algorithmic trading.“Algo trading tends to amplify trends,” said Mr Miller, who manages over $60bn (£36.5bn, €42bn) and is chairman and chief investment officer of Legg Mason Capital Management.Algorithmic trading now accounts for a quarter of all shares bought or sold by investment managers, according to Rob Iati, a partner at Tabb Group. When the activities of proprietary traders are included, it accounts for nearly three quarters of trading volume on the US equities market.Its impact has created inefficiencies that a flesh and blood investor can exploit. This reverses the premise of such trading, which aims to exploit market inefficiencies
rather than create them.Mr Miller’s main claim to fame is running the Legg Mason Value Trust, which beat the S&P 500 15 years in a row, from 1991 through 2005. In the past three years, however, the value stocks he buys fell out of favour, culminating in a 57 per cent slide in the fund’s value in 2008, far worse than the S&P’s 37 per cent plunge.So far in 2009, Mr Miller has seen a return to form, up nearly 16 per cent, more than 10 percentage points ahead of the S&P 500.While Mr Miller’s investment philosophy is based on identifying stocks “that trade at a discount relative to their underlying business value due to incorrect expectations”, he is prepared to exploit other sources of return.He has incorporated into his investment process the findings of an academic paper* pointing out that stocks on the S&P 500 “52 week high list” are likely to continue to perform well for several months, thanks to trading programmes trying to ride the momentum.“When trends are in place, we typically tend to let it run a bit longer than we would otherwise have done. We’re a little slower to sell and a little slower to buy things than we would have been,” said Mr Miller.The trend he is currently riding is the continuation of 2009’s second quarter rally. While some commentators have dismissively referred to this as “the dash to trash”, Mr Miller prefers the phrase “return to normalcy”.Whatever you call it, he expects it to be over by the turn of the year, at which point he will switch into large cap companies in the consumer staples sector.“At some point going into these top names makes a lot of sense,” he said, citing Coca-Cola and Yum! Brands as examples.The LM Value Trust is not Mr Miller’s only portfolio. For 10 years he has been running the Legg Mason Opportunity Trust, an unconstrained fund investing primarily in US common stocks. The Opportunity Fund, a European version of the strategy, has grown by nearly a third so far this year.“It’s very aggressively positioned for recovery,” said Mr Miller, whose views on the US and global economy are very bullish.“It’s pretty clear the [US] economy is going to put together some pretty solid numbers.”*Huddart, Steven J., Lang, Mark H. and Yetman, Michelle, Volume and Price Patterns Around a Stock’s 52-Week Highs and Lows: Theory and Evidence"

Its shares picked up 4.2 per cent to $17.26.Other chipmakers also felt the benefit with AMD, Intel’s main rival, gaining 8.7 per cent to $3.86.Intel’s strong sales also provided optimism over personal computer sales and PC makers rose accordingly. Hewlett-Packard gained 4.5 per cent to $38.82.The rally gathered pace during the day and an upward revision in theFederal Reserve’s unemployment forecasts failed to knock it off course, as investors took confidence in a simultaneuos upgrade in the growth predictions.“The Intel numbers are enough to fuel the rally in the short term, but eventually the US unemployment rate is going to have an effect on the rest of the world,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 3 per cent up at 932.68, while the Dow rose 3.1 per cent to 8,616.21 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gained 3.5 per cent to 1,862.90.Anu Sharma, managing director of Nasdaq’s Market Intelligence Desk, described trading as a “short squeeze”, with short sellers having to buy back stocks in the worry that they might suffer heavy losses if the market rises further.There was also a warning sign on the stability of the current rally from the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility that usually drops when the market rises. It gained 3.4 per cent to 25.87 on Wednesday, suggesting investors were betting on an imminent drop.Materials stocks were also higher as the prices of metals picked up. Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper and gold, rose 5.7 per cent to $50.91. Its rival Newmont Mining gained 3.4 per cent to $40.45.Energy stocks were higher as the price of oil jumped. Chevron rose 2.5 per cent to $64.57 and Schlumberger climbed 5.3 per cent to $54.56. Investors also bought financial stocks, with banking shares continuing to bask in the afterglow of bumper profits from Goldman Sachs.But it was credit card companies that stood out after Capital One and Discover Financial both said loan losses in June had not been as bad as expected, in spite of the rising unemployment rate. Capital One jumped 11.8 per cent to $25.84 and Discover gained 6.2 per cent to $10.85.Shares in industrial companies also took part in the rally, helped by data showing industrial production had shrunk less than expected and factory output in the New York region had dropped by the smallest amount in over a year.General Electric rose 5.2 per cent to $12.24 and Caterpillar, which manufactures equipment for the industrial sector, put on 6 per cent to $33.84.The airline sector was boosted by AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, which reported a smaller-than-expected loss, which lifted the shares 4.3 per cent to $4.36.The general market optimism was tempered, however, by disappointing profits from Abbott Labs, one of the largest US drugmakers. The company also forecast full-year profits at the lower end of analysts’ expectations and the shares fell 2.6 per cent to $45.28.There were also worrying signs on consumer spending from Yum Brands, which operates the Pizza Hut and KFC fast-food franchises.It reported better earnings than expected but warned the rise in its same-store sales this year would disappoint. The stock lost 5.5 per cent to $34.05.Results from Gannett, which publishes USA Today, were more encouraging. It saw better-than-expected profit, powered by its online businesses.

Brands;2009-07-08T10:57:55Z;US to attend World Expo in Shanghai;;"US representatives are preparing to break ground as soon as next week on the American pavilion for the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, ending months of speculation over whether the globe’s leading power might be a no-show at what is being billed as the largest ever world’s fair.Shanghai, China’s largest city and financial centre, has latched onto the Expo as its chance to establish its global profile as a dazzling metropolis in the same way last year’s Beijing Olympics turned the world’s attention to the nation’s capital.Officially budgeting Rmb28.6bn (US$4.2bn) for the event, Shanghai intends to carve a place in the history books alongside milestone world’s fairs like London’s Great Exhibition in 1851, the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris which produced the Eiffel Tower; and Chicago’s 1893 Colombian Exposition, which introduced the first Ferris Wheel.Chinese officials had become increasingly concerned in recent months that the US, which is barred by law from using government funds to build its pavilion, might miss the party altogether, which would have caused major diplomatic embarrassment to both sides.Expo officials were reported earlier in the year to be looking for ways to help defray the costs of US participation, if corporate sponsorships could not be found because of the global economic slowdown.After personal phone calls from Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, American companies committed some $20m to the project in recent weeks. This, however, is still short of the $61m needed to build and operate the US pavilion.“We’ve had a sea change of good news over the past two months,” said Frank Lavin, chairman of the US pavilion steering committee and a former senior trade official under the Bush administration. He added that the personal intervention of Ms Clinton led fundraising to “pick up dramatically.”The new sponsors include General Electric, PepsiCo, 3M, Dell, Yum! Brands and Cargill.It now looks almost certain that the US will participate, but a source close to the effort said, “Nothing is ever done until it’s done.”Organisers believe a formal participation agreement could be signed with Shanghai Expo as early as this week, with ground-breaking perhaps next week during a visit by Gary Locke, the ethnic Chinese US commerce secretary.The Expo, which will run from May 1 to October 31 next year, is expected to attract 70m visitors, including 3.5m from abroad.The US pavilion would be one of the largest at Expo and would include a section on “the success of the Chinese in America”. The Expo, whose theme is “Better City, Better Life”, will boast national, corporate and other pavilions, some with walls made of soyabean fibre, air conditioning systems run with river water and lights powered by solar panels.Preparations for the event have turned the vast city of 17m people into a building site: several new subway lines are being added to give the city a 400km underground railway network, one of the longest in the world.A new terminal has been built for cruise ships, airports are being renovated, thousands of the city’s often foul public toilets are being cleaned up and Expo is even tackling the local cuisine: Expo food will minimise offal, and ban chicken bones, all in aid of impressing picky foreigners.Expo will make permanent improvements to the physical infrastructure of Shanghai – not to mention making this already western-friendly city easier to navigate by foreigners, by teaching more taxi drivers to speak English and discouraging foreign pet peeves such as spitting in public and queue-jumping.Shanghai plans to add 20,000 hotel rooms by the end of next year – a 34 per cent inflation in the supply of starred hotel rooms – at a time when occupancy rates at five-star hotels have already been savaged by the global financial crisis.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen"
196;YUM;Yum! Brands;2008-01-28T21:10:46Z;Sears ousts CEO;;Investor Eddie Lampert’s plan to divide Sears into five business units has prompted complaints that he, as chairman, is merely rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Mr Lampert’s response? On Monday, he tossed his captain overboard.The retailer’s chief executive, Aylwin Lewis, will step down just two years after Mr Lampert, whose ESL Investments controls nearly half of the company, installed him in that role. Mr Lampert, who tends to ignore retail sector conventions, lured Mr Lewis away from a restaurant company despite his slim retail experience. Sears’ sales and profits have since plunged, its cash pile is shrinking, and its stores are ragged. Slow consumer spending has worsened matters, with customers choosing to shop at better-positioned competitors.Sears’ shares have dropped 44 per cent in the past year, while shares in Mr Lewis’ former employer, Yum! Brands, are up 20 per cent. Mr Lewis, one of several executives to fly out of Sears’ revolving door, may be wishing he had never left his former employer. At this point, Sears’ maladies may be too severe for any one person to fix – especially beneath a chairman whose arms are plunged shoulder-deep in the business.Sears’ shares jumped briefly last week when its new structure was announced. But rather than reflecting views that the plan will work, it might merely have reflected relief that a plan actually exists. Three years after combining Sears and Kmart, Mr Lampert is still testing store concepts. Meanwhile, Sears’ top brands are being eroded. And it might have missed the prime window for selling its real estate, which Morgan Stanley values at $13.6bn before liabilities.Other investors are also knee-deep in Sears, including Perry Corporation and Dune Capital. To those who bought shares based on Mr Lampert’s record, he may be looking more like the Pied Piper than a prophet.

General Electric, 0.6 per cent lower at $41.53, reports earnings on Friday.S&P 500 company earnings are forecast to expand at an average annual rate of 0.8 per cent during the third quarter, according to Thomson Financial.That would mark the slowest quarterly pace since 2002, when first-quarter earnings declined 11.5 per cent. Third- quarter earnings rose 19 per cent in 2006, Thomson said.The write-down of more than $20bn in exposure to credit and mortgage securities by banks has been a key factor in dragging forecast S&P earnings lower.JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are expected to reveal losses of about $3bn on holdings of mortgage securities and leveraged loans when they report third-quarter results this month. JPMorgan was 0.3 per cent weaker at $47.44 while Bank of America shed 0.5 per cent to $52.43.Financials and investment banks were sold on Monday.

Among major sectors, materials, telecoms and industrials led gains.Equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, fell 4.8 per cent on Wednesday after a surge of 15.9 per cent on Tuesday.Financials experienced choppy trading. The sector rallied off its lows before midday only to briefly sink when shares in Sallie Mae, the student lender were halted in trading.Some of members in the group behind the planned $25bn buyout of the finance company, said they may back out of the deal due to proposed legislation regulating student loans. When trading resumed, Sallie closed down 9.8 per cent at $52.15.Late on Wednesday, General Electric and Abbott Laboratories said they were unable to agree on ”final terms and conditions” of GE’s proposed $8.13bn deal to buy Abbott’s primary in-vitro and point-of-care diagnostics units. In after-hours trade, GE was up 0.5 per cent at $38.37, while Abbot had fallen 3.2 per cent to $51.50.

Goldman Sachs fell 0.2 per cent to $216.72.Investors across a range of markets were watching equities for any sign that credit woes were spreading.“The lack of transparency in the credit market has left many emerging market participants focusing on equities as a better clue to risk aversion and risk liquidation,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich.Meanwhile, investors were also concerned that the US economy might face softer consumer spending if high petrol prices and the weak housing sector were to affect sentiment.“As US economic data show a moderation from the second-quarter rebound, that will add to fears that the economy is moving into a sustained downtrend,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Same store sales for June are due on Thursday and Thomson Financial estimates they will rise 1.8 per cent year-over-year, down from a 2.9 per cent rise in May. In June 2006, sales rose 3 per cent.American Eagle Outfitters said June same-store sales rose 8 per cent after the closing bell on Wednesday and its stock was up 6.5 per cent at $27.73 in after-hours trade.The prospect of weaker consumer growth has heightened the importance of the second-quarter earnings that are due over the next few weeks.The S&P’s decline of 1.4 per cent on Tuesday was the worst one-day slide in the index in more than a month and marked an inauspicious start to the second-quarter earnings season.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said it was the worst start to a quarterly reporting period “since the bull market began in October 2002”.They noted, however, that “a negative first day has had no bearing on the performance of the market for the rest of earnings season”.On Wednesday, tech stocks and blue chips rallied. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 2,651.79 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.6 per cent to close at 13,577.87.Alcoa was among the Dow leaders with a rise of 1.9 per cent to $42.43 while Intel, down 1.6 per cent at $24.57, was a laggard.Among other notable bluechip gainers, Honeywell rose 1.6 per cent to $58.74, and Caterpillar gained 1.2 per cent to $82.17.Among stocks in the news yesterday, NYSE Group rose 5.5 per cent to $82.11 after Lehman upgraded the exchange from “market weight” to “overweight”.Alcan rose 4 per cent to $89.60 The aluminium maker that is being stalked by Alcoa, said it had secured a ”white-knight” bidder to stall the hostile $28.7bn - around $76 a share bid - from its rival aluminium producer.Another stock in the news was Liz Claiborne.

The stock was higher in after-hours trade. Yum rallied 4.9 per cent to $34.41 in regular trade after UBS upgraded it from “neutral” to “buy”Dendreon fell 2.6 per cent to $7.94 after the biotechnology company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an informal inquiry into its prostate cancer drug.
199;YUM;Yum! Brands;2007-05-02T20:33:32Z;Wall St rises amid earnings, M&A;;Wall Street rose on Wednesday with earnings reports, better-than-expected factory orders and buy-out activity extending the market’s spring bullish streak.Leading the charge were big companies with international operations, seen by investors as being in a sweet spot as a growing global economy compensates for a slower pace in the US through the conduit of a weaker dollar.One example was MasterCard, whose first-quarter profit soared 70 per cent compared with the same period last year to a record $214.9m. The world’s No.2 credit card provider attributed 2.5 per cent of its rise in revenue to the stronger euro versus the dollar. MasterCard jumped 10 per cent to $127.35, eclipsing its previous 52-week high of $118.07.“Enthusiasm for stocks continues and multinationals are riding the global economy,” said Peter Cardillo, strategist at Avalon Partners. He said stocks were overextended but he was not looking for a hefty correction at this juncture.The bullish mood pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average further into record territory and 25 of the blue chip barometer’s 30 stocks closed higher on Wednesday.The Dow rose 0.6 per cent to 13,211.88, its seventeenth record close this year and set an intraday record high of 13,256.33. The Dow’s gain of 6 per cent since the start of January has outpaced broader US benchmarks.A boost for the Dow was Verizon, up 3.4 at $39.81. The telecom set a new 52-week high of $39.72 as investors cheered evidence of its growing market share at the expense of rivals.The S&P 500 index rose 0.65 per cent to close at 1,495.93 with stocks in the telecommunications, materials and consumer discretionary sectors setting the pace. The Nasdaq Composite rallied 1 per cent to finish at 2,557.84.Investor sentiment faces a test when the April employment report is released on Friday.Analysts say a weak re-port could fan fears that the slowing housing market is weighing on the economy, while evidence of steady labour gains would probably underpin the recent ad-vance in stocks.A stronger-than-forecast factory orders report for March also buoyed stocks, which had already opened higher amid deal activity.The Dolan family made a $22bn bid for the shares in Cablevision that they do not already own, in their latest effort to take the cable operator private. The company said its board had approved the Dolans’ offer of $36.26 a share and the stock rose 8.6 per cent to $35.48.Shares in USG jumped 5.8 per cent to $48.66 as speculation of a buy-out for the maker of building materials mounted.In other deals, Citigroup said it would buy Bisys Group for $1.47bn. The financial services outsourcer rose 2.1 per cent to $11.71.Beckman Coulter raised its offer for Biosite by $5 a share to $90 and stocks in the healthcare company rose 1.6 per cent to $93.75.Investors were also waiting for the next stage of the battle for Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, to unfold.Late on Tuesday, the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones via a dual share structure, rejected a $5bn unsolicited bid from News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch.After soaring 54.7 per cent to $56.20 on Tuesday, shares in Dow Jones fell 0.4 per cent to $56 on Wednesday. Shares in the company rose to their highest level in four years after News Corp launched its hostile $60 a share bid.Shares in News Corp rebounded 2 per cent to $23.46 after falling 4.2 per cent on Tuesday.Although many other newspaper and media shares rose sharply on Tuesday and continued to rise on Wednesday, CreditSights cautioned that prospects for the sector were not linked to the News Corp move.Jake Newman, an analyst at CreditSights, said: “If the value of Dow Jones is based on potential synergies with other News Corp properties, the high valuation cannot be applied to general-interest newspaper properties.”In other earnings news, Time Warner said first-quarter earnings had fallen 18 per cent from the same period last year but the result exceeded analysts’ forecasts.The company raised full-year earnings guidance.

200;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;PR crisis for Yum Brands after rat video;;"Yum Brands, one of the world’s largest fast-food retailers, is facing a fresh public relations crisis after video showing an infestation of rats at one of its restaurants in New York spread across the internet.The embarrassing film comes less than three months after an E.coli outbreak at Taco Bell, the group’s Mexican-themed food chain, left more than 70 people sick and caused a nationwide slump in sales.The pictures show a dozen large rats scurrying around the floor, nibbling on food crumbs and clambering on children’s high chairs in premises shared by Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken in Greenwich Village, a district of Manhattan.The case highlights the danger posed to international brands by the rapid dissemination of damaging images or information about companies via the internet.The video was shot through the restaurant window by a local television crew and passers-by early on Friday before the restaurant opened.By Friday afternoon, the film was among the most clicked items on many high-traffic US news websites and was being shown by television news stations across the country.A joint statement issued by KFC and Taco Bell said: “This is completely unacceptable and is an absolute violation of our high standards.""The restaurant would remain closed until the problem was “completely resolved”, it said.Rodents are a notorious blight on New York life, with some estimates putting the rat population as high as 96m – about 12 rats for every human.The restaurant passed its most recent health inspection several months ago, although the city health department said it issued a warning to the franchise-owner about evidence of rat droppings.A fresh inspection was under way on Friday.The incident could not have happened in a worse location for Taco Bell because its E. coli outbreak in December was also concentrated in New York and the US north-east.The chain, which has nearly 6,000 restaurants across the US, suffered a 5 per cent drop in fourth-quarter comparable sales following the outbreak, which was traced to contaminated lettuce.The slump made only a small dent in Yum’s overall growth, which is increasingly driven by surging growth in China.Yum, which also owns Pizza Hut, increased the size of its Chinese business by a fifth last year, taking its number of restaurants in the country to 2,400.Shares in Yum fell nearly 1 per cent."

This transition often increases volatility because of overreactions to new economic data, as we saw this week. It is going to be a choppy market for the next month.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3 per cent lower on Friday at 12,647.64, down 0.9 per cent on the week. The S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent at 1,451.23, 0.3 per cent lower on the week.Two catalysts for profit-taking were data showing a stronger increase than expected in consumer prices in January and Iran’s refusal to stop uranium enrichment, which boosted oil prices.A court decision in which Microsoft was hit by a $1.52bn patent infringement award also weighed on sentiment on Friday. Shares in the technology group were down 1.7 per cent to close at $28.90 on Friday.Microsoft warned that the case, which was won by Alcatel-Lucent, would have implications for many groups involved in digital music. Shares in Apple and Dell were largely unaffected on Friday.The homebuilding sector slipped back after Toll Brothers reported a sharp fall in profits and offered little encouragement to people looking for a rebound in the housing market. The S&P Homebuilders index, which has been broadly on the up since July, was 4.3 per cent softer on the week.There was more bad news from subprime mortgage lenders.NovaStar saw its stock plummet after it reported losses and said it was reviewing its status as a real estate investment trust because it anticipated little or no taxable income in coming years. Its shares have halved to $8.48 this week.New Century Financial, a big subprime lender, took another battering after analysts at Merrill Lynch warned of the risk of a cash crisis at the company. Its shares were down 20 per cent at $15.52.Fears of wider problems hit other financial groups involved with mortgages. Countrywide stock dropped 2 per cent to $39.33 while shares in Lehman Brothers were 3.7 per cent softer at $79.04 on Friday.By contrast, shares in H&R Block rose 1.9 per cent to $22.85 after the company expressed confidence about selling its subprime mortgage lending unit.Chipmakers made yet another attempt at clawing back some of last year’s losses. The gains were spurred by Analog Devices‘ higher-than-expected profits and upbeat outlook. Its shares rose 12.2 per cent to $36.99 this week.The positive sentiment lifted the Philadelphia Semiconductor index 3.3 per cent to its highest level in three months. The index has fallen 6.9 per cent in the last year.The rally helped the Nasdaq Composite outperform other market measures as it rose 0.75 per cent over the week to 2,515.10.But one technology stock that has performed well of late began to sag. Hewlett-Packard reported another strong set of earnings but analysts questioned whether the group could maintain the pace of growth. Its shares eased 4.6 per cent to $40.82.In deal news, organic food retailer Whole Foods Market said that it had agreed to buy its smaller rival Wild Oats Markets for $565m.The deal helped shares in Whole Foods rise 8.7 per cent to $50.47 this week. Shares in Wild Oats jumped 17.8 per cent to $18.46.Footage on US breakfast television of rats scampering around a Yum! Brands restaurant in New York upset investor appetite for the company’s stock on Friday morning, sending shares in the restaurant group down 0.9 per cent to close at $60.51.
202;YUM;Yum! Brands;2006-11-24T17:29:17Z;Whitney Tilson: Good reasons to lock in your gains and trim your holdings;;Since I began writing this column in late February, I have made 10 stock recommendations – eight longs and two shorts. All are in the money, with an average gain of 31 per cent, led by Lear Corp, the automotive components maker, which has almost doubled since I wrote in late March that its share sell-off had been way overdone.With all of the major stock indices up for the year – and in many cases, hitting multi-year highs – many investors are facing the dilemma of whether to lock in similar gains.There are no simple answers but here are four reasons we generally start to take profits.The first reason is straightforward – when a stock rises to our estimate of intrinsic value. Let us say we buy a stock at $10, thinking it is worth $18-$22, with a midpoint of $20 – a proverbial 50-cent dollar. Assuming no change in intrinsic value, we would likely start trimming the position at $18 and be out by $22. It is critical, however, not to anchor on the original estimate of intrinsic value. If unexpectedly good news is behind the stock reaching $18, for example, our estimate of value might have risen to $24-$28, in which case we likely won’t be selling yet.This is a major reason we still own a large position in McDonald’s, which we bought years ago as low as $12. We originally thought the shares were worth $25 or so but, when the price got there, our estimate of intrinsic value had risen to approximately $35. When it hit $35, we thought it was worth $50-$60, which is why we are still holding at almost $42 today.The second reason we sell is when we find a better investment. That may mean selling an 80-cent dollar to buy a 50-cent dollar, or selling a risky stock to buy an equally cheap safer one. The latter explains why we sold Lear after it had rallied into the high $20s. As I noted in my first column, Lear is in a terrible industry and, if US carmakers encounter further distress, Lear will be hit by a negative impact in ways that are hard to forecast. The stock may well double again, but we cannot rule out the possibility that it could also go bankrupt someday, as have many of its auto supplier peers. We took our profits in Lear and reinvested them in Berkshire Hathaway, which we believe is the safest company in the world and was equally cheap at the time (both stocks are up approximately 30 per cent since we swapped them).Our third reason for selling is if the story on a company materially changes. We agree with Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn when he says: “We never invent new reasons to continue with a position when the original reasons are no longer available.” This situation occurs more frequently in losing stocks, but also happens on occasion with our winners.A few years ago, after making big gains on the stock previously, we got back into shares of EVCI Career Colleges at about $6, thinking their intrinsic value was $10-$12. Then the company announced the most egregious compensation scheme, in which the top two executives would receive annual cash salaries and bonuses equal to 8 per cent of the company’s revenues, plus receive almost 5 per cent of shares outstanding in the form of stock options each year. This shattered two pillars of our investment thesis – the high integrity of management and a competent, independent board – so, after registering our feelings and getting no response, we sold immediately. You will not be surprised to learn that EVCI stock is now under 50 cents.Finally, we sometimes trim stocks to balance our portfolio. The margin of safety on a big winner typically goes down just as the rising price makes it a larger share of the portfolio, so we often take some profits in the position when that happens. We also do this if a particular sector takes up too much of our portfolio. After making great money on McDonald’s, CKE Restaurants, Jack in the Box and Yum Brands in 2003, we cut back because we did not want too much exposure to burger stocks.One final caution – do not fall into the trap of consistently selling your winners and buying more of your losers. While this can be the right thing to do, great investors typically have a gift for finding a few great stocks and having the conviction and courage to let them run. In a recent interview for Value Investor Insight, Akre Capital’s Chuck Akre told us that he first started buying Berkshire Hathaway at about $100 in the mid-1970s. He has made 1,000 times his money – and still holds the stock! Such situations happen rarely in an investment lifetime, so if you think you have found a “compounding machine”, as Akre calls it, think long and hard about ever selling.Whitney Tilson is a money manager who co-edits Value Investor Insight and co-founded the Value Investing Congress.feedback@tilsonfunds.com
203;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Fast-food chain faces trans fat suit;;Yum Brands, operator of KFC, is facing a class-action lawsuit over the chicken fast-food chain’s use of artery-clogging trans fat for frying foods.The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit food and nutrition lobby group, on Tuesday filed suit against Yum Brands in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia, alleging KFC “does not properly warn, disclose, or even tell its customers that they are eating food items prepared with the worst oil available and imaginable”.The US Agriculture Department’s 2005 dietary guidelines suggest eating as little partially hydrogenated oil, or trans fat, as possible. This year the federal government forced food companies to specify on labels the level of trans fat in products.The suit is aimed at forcing KFC to switch from partially hydrogenated oil to a healthier alternative, or post signs in restaurants warning that certain foods contain trans fat, “which promotes heart disease”.According to the complaint, “KFC has deceptively advertised and misrepresented to its customers and consumers, both in its stores and on its website, that . . . KFC food products could be consumed as part of a nutritionally healthy lifestyle”.A KFC spokeswoman called the lawsuit “frivolous” and “completely without merit” and said the company would “vigorously defend” its position.She said KFC provided a variety of menu choices and nutritional information, including trans fat values, on its website and in the restaurants.“We have been reviewing alternative oil options, but there are a number of factors to consider,” she added.The lawsuit follows an announcement last week by Wendy’s International, the third largest burger chain, that it would begin frying french fries and breaded chicken with non-hydrogenated oil in an effort to remove trans fat from its menu.

Brands, Weatherford and Whirlpool.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 6.37 points, or 0.5 per cent, at 1,301.74, while the Nasdaq dipped 3.08 points, or 0.1 per cent to 2,330.30. The Dow Jones also finished the day 0.5 per cent, or 53.07 points, lower at 11,283.25.Data showing an increase in existing home sales in March and a rise in consumer confidence to a four-year peak stoked fears of higher interest rates and depressed the market.Sun Microsystems, the maker of computer servers, closed slightly higher after it announced a change in management after the close on Monday.Scott McNealy, chief executive, said that he would step down in favour of Jonathan Schwartz, company president. Sun soared earlier in the day on Tuesday, but pulled back to close 0.2 per cent higher at $4.99.Yum! Brands reported first quarter earnings of $170m, or 59 cents a share, up from $153m or 50 cents a share in the previous quarter, and ahead of analyst expectations.Yum!, the owner of the Taco Bell and KFC brands, said the bird flu scare did have a minor impact on earnings in China, but that it expects same-store sales there to increase again in the coming year.Yum! raised its profit forecasts for 2006 by 2 cents to $2.81, pushing its shares up 3.5 per cent to $51.34.Shares in Netflix, the online DVD rentals service jumped, gaining 1.4 per cent to $31.68 following its announcement that it had made a quarterly profit.Net income for the first quarter was $4.4m, or 7 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $8.8m the previous year.The announcement by President George W Bush that he would halt deposits to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help lower the price of crude, dragged oil stocks down.But oilfield services company Weatherford was a gainer, after announcing that first-quarter net income more than doubled from $80.6m to $203.3m, pleasantly surprising investors. Weatherford shares were up 4.6 per cent to $52.17.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell on Tuesday, despite announcing a 29 per cent increase in profit compared with the same quarter last year. Analysts expected slightly higher earnings per share than the $2.61 CME delivered and shares closed down 3.7 per cent to $475.25.Leather-goods company Coach, was also hit by investor antipathy after it reported a quarterly profit of $108.9m, a 35 per cent increase compared with the same period last year.Coach’s revenue forecasts for the coming quarter were slightly lower than analysts expected, pulling shares down 6.7 per cent to $32.86.
205;YUM;Yum! Brands;2006-01-30T22:51:56Z;World Cup offers investors a sporting chance;;"It’s a big question for many large companies but most sports fans do not care. Does commercial sponsorship of big sporting events yield any benefits to the corporations who are doing it?Official sponsors of this year’s soccer World Cup in Germany have paid up to €45m each for the privilege of becoming an official partner of the tournament and seeing their names beamed into billions of television sets around the world for a month.Now, thanks to a handful of investment products developed by JPMorgan, some investors in Germany and elsewhere will be at least as interested in the fortunes of the sponsors as in their national team.The investments will allow them to take a shot on whether the corporate sponsors will benefit from their participation.Distribution of the first of these products – a two-year note whose capital investment is guaranteed – begins in banks and savings institutions in Germany next week, and in Austria from February 13.It will allow investors to wager that eight of the 15 official partners of the World Cup will perform better on the stock market than their nearest competitors.The basket of sponsors comprises Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch, McDonald’s, Deutsche Telekom, Fuji Photo Film, Adidas-Salomon, Continental and Yahoo.For investors to get an annual coupon above their guaranteed cash back, those eight companies will have to outperform their competitors who are not World Cup partners: PepsiCo, Heineken, Yum! Brands, Telecom Italia, Eastman Kodak, Nike, Goodyear Tire and Google.Daniel McNeill, a product structurer in the bank’s exotic and hybrids group, said the idea came from JPMorgan’s German marketing team, which wanted a locally themed product that added in World Cup sponsors.Mr McNeill’s team said they thought that a similar product could be sold more broadly to investors across Europe and beyond.JPMorgan has developed at least three other products that allow investors to bet on the Dax index of blue-chip German stocks, on the basis that the tournament will bring the country an economic boost, or on the performance of the eight tournament sponsors.However, in initial market soundings, the outperformance product appeared to be the favourite in Germany.JPMorgan bankers say it benefits from the association with the World Cup. But retail investors have also displayed preferences for shorter-maturity products in recent months and like the outperformance – or “alpha” – feature of the instrument.The products are structured using equity derivatives, from which JPMorgan makes its profit. Distributors are expected to take a commission of up to 1.5 per cent. The notes will be sold in minimum €1,000 denominations, but most retail investors are expected to invest up to €50,000.The coupons are subject to a cap of 12 per cent at the end of the first year and
24 per cent at the end of the second year.Though it has no retail distribution arm, JPMorgan has developed a significant business structuring retail products for the German and Austrian markets. Over the last four years, it has structured and sold about 300 separate products through retail banks there, its bankers say.But it is not the only bank trying to tap into World Cup fever. Other banks are getting in on the act too, with products that, for example, pay out rewards if the German stock market beats the Brazilian market over the course of the tournament, or the year."
206;YUM;Yum! Brands;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
207;YUM;Yum! Brands;2005-07-15T16:49:56Z;Wall St shrugs off hangover of rising oil prices;;For once the markets were not totally in thrall to oil prices during a week that saw a surge of investor optimism after an extended period of worrying that rising energy costs would eat into corporate profits.Instead, the market was energised by better than expected jobs figures and some good earnings results – not least from Apple, which reaped rich rewards from the enduring popularity of its iPod music player system.Owen Fitzpatrick, managing director of Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management, said traders had not been as jittery about oil prices as in previous weeks.“The market seems to be taking it in its stride because it is so weather- related. It goes up when a storm is brewing in the Gulf but when it passes oil falls back off again.” Although the rising oil price helped the energy sector, the week finished with uncertainty hanging over CNOOC’s $18.5bn attempt to takeover Unocal.A crucial board meeting by Unocal executives ended on Thursday night with no public statement about the competing bid from Chevron. During late morning trade yesterday CNOOC’s New York listed shares were down 1.6 per cent on the day at $59.90 – down 3.6 per cent on last Friday’s close.Technology and healthcare stocks performed well during the week.Leading the pack were Advanced Micro Devices and Apple. A record five-fold increase in sales of iPods sent Apple shares soaring, up 7.8 per cent at $41.23 compared to last week.AMD reported better than expected profit as strong sales of personal computers and corporate servers offset losses from flash memory chips for consumer gadgets. AMD shares rose 1.3 per cent during the week to $19.18.The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 3.9 per cent to 459.85 during the week on the back of AMD’s results.Intel was up 4.7 per cent to $19.71 over the week while Texas Instruments, which is to publish its results this month, gained 2.3 per cent to $30.42.Amgen, the biotechnology company, rose above the $70 mark, with a 1.4 per cent gain during the week taking it to $70.10 a share.Mergers and takeovers also helped to bolster the healthcare sector with VNU, the Dutch owner of AC Nielsen, agreeing to buy IMS Health in a $7bn deal.VNU was up 3.7 per cent over the week at $12.47 while IMS was up 5.1 per cent at $27.22.It was also a good week for PepsiCo when the world’s second-largest soft-drinks maker reported better than expected quarterly profits due to strong growth in its international business, taking it to $55.71 – a 4.1 per cent gain since last Friday.“All these good results have reassured the market that growth is not going to fall off a cliff,” said Mr Fitzpatrick.Investors also cheered strong economic reports, including a slight narrowing of the US trade deficit, and government data showing retail sales rose 1.7 per cent in June even as inflation remained under control.Among various bits of data released yesterday the government said producer prices had held steady over the last month and the Federal Reserve announced that industrial production rose 0.9 per cent in June, compared to a 0.3 per cent rise in May.By late morning yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen slightly to 10,626.82 and the broader S&P 500 was down at 1,225.57. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2 per cent to 2,148.76.Over the week the Dow was up 1.7 per cent, the S&P advanced 1.1 per cent, after attaining a four-year high on Thursday, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.7 per cent.Among the stocks to disappoint this week was General Electric. Yesterday General Electric announced profits that only met analysts expectations and warned third-quarter earnings may fall short of some forecasts.By late morning yesterday shares in the company had slipped 1.2 per cent to $35.19.Yum! Brands, the owner of Pizza Hut and KFC, saw its shares fall more than four per cent after it lowered its forecast for the year. Across the week its share price fell 1.6 per cent to $51.03.Shares of DreamWorks Animation SKG also took a tumble after the maker of Shrek said it would post a second-quarter loss. The shares dropped 13.8 per cent to $23.10 over the week.
208;YUM;Yum!

Whit Penski, senior analyst at Bear Stearns, said the company’s “fantastic numbers” were also helped by a “spill-over” effect of iPod fans beginning to buy Apple computers.“While Apple is not exactly a bellwether stock, we think this could be the beginning of a trend for large cap growth assets which are still much cheaper relative to large cap as a whole,” he said.The tech-based Nasdaq Composite index set a 2005 high, gaining 0.4 per cent to 2,152.82 by the close. The S&P 500 index was up 0.3 per cent at 1,226.5 and the Dow Jones industrial average was 0.7 per cent up 10,628.89.Other tech stocks received a lift yesterday. Microsoft gained 1.2 per cent to $25.97, Hewlett-Packard was up 0.8 per cent at $24.62 and IBM rose 1.2 per cent to $82.42. Gatewayslipped, however, by 5.5 per cent to $3.76.Advanced Micro Devicesmanaged to stem its expected profit decline, its share price rise 3.3 per cent to $19.88. Second quarter profits fell 65 per cent as the falling price of its memory chips ate into higher sales of personal computer.The markets also cheered government data showing retail sales up 1.7 per cent in June. The consumer price index was unchanged from May.“The consumer continues to be the cat with nine lives,” said Michael Strauss of the Commonfund. “The fear has been that this is an economy where the consumer has two nails in the coffin, but it’s not so.”In other earnings news, MDC Holdings climbed 1.8 per cent to $87.96 despite continued concerns about a housing bubble. The Denver-based homebuilder said sales had increased by 20 per cent in the second-quarter.Shares in the other major house builders did not echo MDC’s performance, however. KB Home fell 1.6 per cent to $79.42, Pulte Homes dropped 1.7 per cent to $90.75 and Toll Brotherswas down 1.5 per cent to $53.80.Southwest Airlines moved up 3.2 per cent to $14.42 after the carrier announced forecast-beating increases in second quarter profits. The Amex airline index rose 5 per cent to 51.55.Yum!

Shares fell 3.6 per cent to $49.85.The day started well for Google after Lehman Brothers raised its price target for the search engine company to $350 from $275. It retreated in the afternoon, but closed up 0.7 per cent at $300.89.
209;YUM;Yum! Brands;2005-07-13T17:45:35Z;Harley Davidson is leader of the pack;;The markets were little changed on Wednesday as investors digested a variety of mixed economic and corporate news.Wall Street was bolstered by some unexpectedly good news about the US trade deficit, which narrowed in May to $55.3bn. Although energy supply data showed stocks of crude falling because of storm disruption to oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, crude futures actually fell 61 cents to $60.01 for August delivery. A fall in oil is generally considered to be a positive development as high energy prices can erode corporate profits.Although the earnings season was not quite in full swing, there were good figures from a variety of companies. Harley Davidson led the pack with a 1.4 per cent rise in its share price to $50.38 on the back of better than expected results.By the close, the S&P 500 had crept up at 1,223.29, while the Nasdaq Composite was also slightly up at 2,144.11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 10,557.39.Edward Hemmelgarn, chief investment officer at Shaker Investments, said the markets flatness disguised an essentially positive momentum.“Keep in mind that the market has been moving rather strongly in July, and markets do not just go straight up without pausing for a day or so. It will continue to rise because analysts have once again underestimated earnings growth, and supply is falling in the market as companies buy back shares.”Among the most eagerly expected earnings news of the week will be Yum! Brands, the group behind KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, which was expected to report after the bell yesterday. Elsewhere in the sector, California Pizza Kitchen and Buffalo Wild Wings enjoyed a good day after they raised their earnings outlooks for the second quarter. Pizza Kitchen rose 15.4 per cent to $31.94 and Buffalo Wild Wings added 10.2 per cent, climbing to $33.14.Also moving were shares of Resources Connection, a provider of professional, legal, accounting and other staff, which added to gains in Tuesday’s after-hours session after it posted earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. The stock was up 20.1 percent at $29.35.There was some disappointing news from the drugmaker Abbott Laboratories, which dropped 4.2 per cent $47.65 after the company said third-quarter profit would be below expectations.IBM helped to bolster the Dow after an analyst at Sanford Bernstein raised the company’s performance rating. IBM rose 1.8 per cent to $81.45.Procter & Gamble and Gilletteboth gained ground on the news that the shareholders of the two consumer products giants had agreed to P&G’s proposed $52.5bn acquisition of Gillette. P&G moved 1.2 per cent higher to $54.58 while Gillette was 1.2 per cent higher at $52.30.
210;YUM;Yum!

The S&P 500 rose 2 per cent to 1,159.95, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5 per cent to 1,962.41.A steep drop in jobless claims, falling oil prices, and an upbeat manufacturing report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve also gave Wall Street a boost.Gains strengthened throughout the day in spite of a warning from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chief, that rising deficits could cause the US economy to stagnate.In spite of the day’s gains, US indices were still down substantially from monthly highs.Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services, said that, with bulls and bears locked in an increasingly volatile tug-of-war over investor sentiment, the market’s short-term fortunes may hinge on whether the indices can break through critical upward resistance points today. “If they fail here and this rally doesn’t succeed, it’s going to become more apparent that the bears are correct.”Motorolasurprised analysts with a 13.6 per cent increase in quarterly earnings. The mobile handset maker also raised its second-quarter guidance. Shares in the company rose 6.7 per cent to $15.93Transport finished higher after UPS, the express shipping company, reported higher first-quarter profits and forecast stronger growth this year. UPS shares rose 4.9 per cent to $70.56Yum Brands, owner of the KFC and Taco Bell fast-food chains, fell 4.3 per cent in spite of higher earnings amid concerns about food safety in China. McDonald’s fell 0.3 per cent to $29.85.Elsewhere, Anheuser-Busch, the brewer, jumped 6.5 per cent to $48.04 amid reports that Warren Buffett, the billionaire fund manager, had bought an undisclosed stake in the company.Archipelago Holdings, the electronic trading group, surged 60 per cent to $29.96 a day after it agreed to merge with the New York Stock Exchange to form a new for-profit company.Mergers and acquisitions were in focus as Time Warner and Comcast, the cable groups, agreed to buy Adelphia, a bankrupt rival, for $17.6bn. Time Warner shares rose 3.5 per cent to $17.53. Comcast shares rose 2.4 per cent to $32.25.Google, the world’s biggest search engine company, rose 3.1 per cent to $204.22 ahead of its quarterly results, revealed after the close.Qualcomm, the chipmaker, rose 4.5 per cent to $34.71 after an analyst upgrade.

211;YUM;Yum! Brands;2005-03-09T22:31:58Z;Wall Street slides on inflation fears;;"Wall Street closed firmly lower on Wednesday after a spike in bond yields sparked a flight from equities.The leading US indices fell amid inflation fears, fuelled in part by the rising price of oil, which continued its march toward the $55 mark.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 10,805.25, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent to 1,207.21, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 2,061.29.Upbeat economic news and a record season for corporate earnings have been overshadowed by lingering doubts about the state of the US economy in recent sessions.A sharp sell-off in bonds underlined concerns that rising oil prices could prompt a more aggressive programme of interest rate rises from the US Federal Reserve. Many expect the Fed’s anti-inflation efforts to lead to a slowdown in corporate earnings growth later this year.Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said concerns over rising oil prices were overblown. He noted that oil prices had more than doubled since the S&P 500 reached its nadir in October 2002. The S&P has gained more than 56 per cent over the same period.“We have an economy that is still great,” said Mr Goldman. “However, it’s at its fourth year of expansion. We can’t rock and roll day in and day out.”Interest rate-sensitive stocks such as real estate groups and utilities took the brunt of investors’ ire. Prologis, the real estate investment trust, fell 4 per cent to $38.77. Con Edison, the utility company, fell 1.8 per cent to $41.71.Semiconductors also fell, in spite of an upbeat sales update from Xilinx.The world’s biggest maker of programmable computer chips raised its quarterly sales targets and said it was making progress clearing a backlog of inventory, but shares slipped 0.6 per cent to $31.27.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, rose 0.2 per cent to $24.84, however, as investors staked out positions ahead of a mid-quarter earnings update tomorrow.McDonald’s fell sharply after a downgrade by Credit Suisse First Boston. The company, which issued a disappointing sales update on Tuesday, lost 2.8 per cent to $32.53 and was the biggest loser on the Dow.Other fast food groups
also suffered. Yum! Brands, which owns the KFC and Taco Bell restaurant chains, fell 1.6 per cent to $50.23. Wendys, a rival, fell 2 per cent to close at $38.90.Shares in the International Securities Exchange, the New York-based options exchange, jumped 69 per cent to $30.40 on their first day of trading following
the group’s initial public offering.Energy companies also suffered in spite of rising oil prices.ExxonMobil fell 3.7 per cent even as it said it expected this year’s capital spending to surpass the record spending levels of 2004.Chemicals were mostly higher, but Kerr McGee slipped 2.2 per cent to $79.73 after it said it would sell its chemicals unit and buy back $1bn in shares. Dow Chemical rose 0.8 per cent to $55.99, while rivalMonsanto rose 0.4 per cent to $61.50."

Cimarex shares fell 10.3 per cent to $36.06.Many investors view the oil and gas sector as ripe for further consolidation following a run-up in energy prices in 2004 that left many producers with healthy balance sheets and big cash piles.The S&P 500 energy index, which tracks 29 oil and gas stocks, has almost doubled in value since January 2002.An analyst at AG Edwards said: ""The majors got out of North America years ago, and now it's been the smaller companies that have begun developing resources that have once again become attractive.""Fast food companies brushed off a decision by a US appeals court to reinstate an obesity-related lawsuit against McDonald's.Shares in McDonald's, the world's biggest fast food chain, rose 0.2 per cent to $31.99. Yum! Brands, which operates the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC chains, rose 0.3 per cent to $45.73.Shares in both groups have more than doubled since March 2003, in spite of mounting concerns about fast food's alleged contribution to America's growing obesity problem.Semiconductors led gainers on the S&P 500 for a second successive day after results at Texas Instruments earned upgrades from Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank.
