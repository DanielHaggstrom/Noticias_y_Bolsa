0;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-10-18T04:00:58Z;Vaping backlash threatens to slam brakes on F1 sponsorship ;Scrutiny of e-cigarettes casts cloud over deals between Big Tobacco and motorsports ;Once among the largest backers of Formula One, the world’s biggest tobacco companies are again conducting huge sponsorship deals with leading racing teams in an effort to promote new “vaping” products around the world. But a growing regulatory backlash in key markets against e-cigarettes threatens to block marketing efforts targeted at millions of motorsports fans. For decades, tobacco companies were the biggest sponsors of F1 and by the mid-nineties almost every team featured a cigarette brand on their cars. F1 drivers — from James Hunt to Michael Schumacher — have worn the logo of Marlboro cigarettes across their overalls*. Brands such as John Player Special, Rothmans and Benson & Hedges also regularly featured on cars over the years. That ended when the FIA, the world governing body for motor racing, voted to ban sponsorship from cigarette makers in 2006.However a pivot by Big Tobacco towards developing alternatives to their traditional products has created fresh opportunities. British American Tobacco signed a sponsorship deal with UK-based F1 team McLaren to promote its so-called “reduced risk” smoking products earlier this year, following a similar partnership between Italy’s Ferrari team and New York-based PMI. But during races in seven countries including Australia, Canada and France, the F1 teams were forced to remove marketing logos related to their vaping sponsorships in order to comply with local tobacco advertising laws. A threatened crackdown against vaping in the United States undermines one of the key reasons why BAT is sponsoring McLaren. As well as promoting its products on the McLaren F1 car during the US Grand Prix in Texas next month, BAT is using the logo of its “Vuse” e-cigarettes on the livery of McLaren’s cars in the Indycar racing series, one of the most watched sporting events in the country. “You’ll find the overlap between the F1 calendar and our business is pretty profound,” said Kingsley Wheaton, chief marketing officer at BAT, when explaining the purpose of the company’s reasons to sponsor McLaren. He added that the “US foothold” was another key motivation. The regulatory crackdown on vaping around the world threatens a potential revenue stream for F1 teams that have struggled to attract sponsorship deals in recent years. BAT is paying around £20m a year for its deal with McLaren, according to a person familiar with its terms. PMI has not revealed the value of its agreement with Ferrari, but it is merely the latest commercial link between two groups that have been closely tied in the past. PMI’s former chairman, Louis Camilleri, was appointed chief executive of Ferrari following the death of Sergio Marchionne in July 2018. As cigarette volumes have declined in the west, tobacco companies have bolstered their efforts to develop new ways to deliver nicotine. David O’Reilly, director of scientific research at BAT, said that 90 per cent of the company’s research budget was now spent on cigarette alternatives, which amounts to more than £3bn. PMI has said that it has invested $6bn into developing new products. However, the discovery of at least 450 cases of lung disease associated with e-cigarettes across 33 US states prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend avoiding e-cigarettes altogether. In September, President Donald Trump announced that he would consider banning flavoured vaping products. “You can use F1 as a barometer for effective tobacco control,” said Phil Chamberlain, a partner at the Bloomberg-funded initiative Stopping Tobacco Organizations and Products. “It will be interesting to see how the [US] crackdown has an effect . . . Money talks in sports. It will be about how much [the sports teams] are able to resist the offer from tobacco companies,” he added. Different advertising regulations for e-cigarettes across the globe mean that Big Tobacco cannot obviously advertise specific products on the cars in many countries. PMI’s “Mission Winnow” logo, the branding it uses for its relationship with Ferrari, was removed from the team’s cars in Australia after it was deemed too close to the logo for Marlboro cigarettes. PMI said that “regrettably, we know that some may have preconceived ideas about us and have expressed reservations about what they feel are our true intentions”. However, Formula One also provides a venue at which the companies can entertain policymakers and corporate guests, as well as invite social media influencers to be seen with e-cigarette products. “Sports events work quite well for them,” said Mr Chamberlain. “[Formula One] is fast, it’s sexy, it’s all about winning and those are messages with which they are trying to associate.” Mr Wheaton said BAT’s sponsorship deal with McLaren was aimed solely at promoting vaping products, rather than being a backdoor to promote traditional cigarettes. “[It was] only for the marketing and communication of our next-generation products,” he said. “They are nothing to do with our combustible portfolio, and never the twain shall meet.”*This article has been corrected: James Hunt did not drive for Ferrari.Hunt hid his Rothmans so as not to offend sponsors / From Dave Munro, Wirral, UK
1;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-09-26T04:00:33Z;Tobacco burns: a $200bn merger collapses and a CEO is ousted;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.One scoop to start: WeWork is in talks with SoftBank to renegotiate a $1.5bn capital injection the Japanese telecoms-to-technology group has agreed to plough into the property company next year, according to multiple people briefed on the matter. The FT’s Eric Platt and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson have the full story here. It has been a rough week for chief executives at two of America’s most talked about and richly valued private companies. Just one day after WeWork’s board gave chief executive Adam Neumann his marching orders, Juul Labs boss Kevin Burns announced his resignation after coming under fire from regulators following a spike in vaping-related deaths. Taking over from Burns is KC Crosthwaite, the chief growth officer at Altria, which owns a 35 per cent stake in Juul. It may come as a surprise but the personnel change was actually a move by Altria to rescue an attempted $200bn reunion with Philip Morris International. That transaction, which DD has been bearish about from the start, hung in the balance as regulators took aim at the burgeoning e-cigarette industry. By installing an Altria executive to lead Juul, the company wanted to show that it could handle the backlash. Welp, that didn’t work. The regulatory crackdown on e-cigarettes prompted PMI to call off talks with Altria, which would’ve brought the domestic and international makers of Marlboro back together. You can’t escape the irony of it all. It was Juul and the vision of a smoke-free future that prompted the pursuit of the mammoth deal. PMI was going to use cash flows from its traditional cigarette business to help fund an e-cigarette expansion that would secure an advantage over rivals. Whether you smoked cigarettes or alternatives you were going to buy them from PMI/Altria.But once burnt, twice shy. It looks like PMI doesn’t want to go back to where cigarette makers were a decade ago, dealing with years of painful litigation and pending regulation. History is repeating itself in the e-cigarette industry. And we hate to say it, but DD called it when the deal was first announced at the end of August. Signs of a bigger blowback were already hanging in the air. San Francisco by then had banned the sale of e-cigarettes and vaping-linked lung illnesses were rising daily. Juul tried to offer more concessions by saying it would suspend all its broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the US and refrain from lobbying the Trump administration on its moves to scale up regulation.PMI shareholders breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday and the stock jumped more than 5 per cent. The FT’s Lex said PMI was right to walk away. The company’s own heated e-cigarette, IQOS, received US marketing approval earlier this year and should gain from the vaping crackdown. For Altria, things are a little more complicated. Just hours before Thomas Cook finally declared itself bust, the UK travel group still hadn’t given up hope that last-ditch meetings would find the extra £200m demanded by its banks.Half a million holidaymakers were relying on the company to bring them back home.But by the time that chief executive Peter Fankhauser emerged blinking through the loading bay at City law firm Latham & Watkins on Sunday night, he knew that it was all over, prompting the biggest ever peacetime repatriation. The government refused to offer the company a £250m lifeline, ending hopes of bringing its lenders and largest shareholder, China’s Fosun, behind a carefully constructed £1.1bn restructuring deal.If the end appears rapid, rest assured the 178-year-old company was facing turbulence for many years. Successive managements and an ill-fated 2007 merger with UK holiday company MyTravel, which brought with it a tour operator and airline, left the travel group vulnerable. Thomas Cook was still writing down a final £1.1bn goodwill from MyTravel in May this year. At the same time customers started moving online and away from the concept of a packaged holiday for more adventurous pursuits. Thomas Cook was left with a strategic crisis and a financial black hole as debts mounted beyond £1.9bn. Customers are still wondering who’s to blame for the company’s collapse?Is it the fault of the banks for demanding the extra £200m equity headroom? Or did management act too slowly while they happily pocketed millions in wages as the ship was sinking? Perhaps the blame lies with the bondholders, who were threatening to veto the deal unless they got a payout on their credit default swaps? What about the UK government for not supporting a British business? The sting in the tail: just days later the German government gave its domestic Thomas Cook business a €400m lifeline, twice what it would’ve taken to save the entire group.Or can we blame the advisers, racking up big fees while failing to find the restructuring solution? And should PwC and EY face accountability for not taking action over the company’s accounts? As one company insider said: no one can walk away from this collapse with their heads held high.Go deeper with the FT’s Dan Thomas and Alice Hancock here.

With all the hoo-ha around high-profile IPOs this year — good and bad — you’d be forgiven for thinking that stock exchanges around the world are jam-packed. In fact, there are fewer companies listing shares on public stock markets this year as trade tensions between the US and China and slowing economic growth keep companies private for longer. This year 845 companies have floated globally, 25 per cent fewer than during the same period in 2018 and the lowest level in three years, according to data from Dealogic.The FT’s Richard Henderson has the stats for the three largest financial regions.Antonio Gatti, a senior private equity banker at Goldman Sachs, is joining Italian private equity firm Investindustrial as a managing principal.

2;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-09-25T16:15:16Z;PMI/Altria: the vape escape ;Souring taste of Juul cuts appetite for deal ;Philip Morris International has seen the future - and it is not in vaping. Not in the US, anyway.The company has ended merger talks with Altria, from which it split 11 years ago. A deal would have created a tobacco heavyweight with a market worth of more than $200bn.Juul, the hip vape startup, appears responsible for the breakdown of the takeover talks it had prompted. With cost savings modest and world sales of coffin nails falling, a merger was predicated on a joint push into “reduced-risk products”.Altria’s $13bn bet on Juul looked promising. The purchase of a 35 per cent stake last December gave it immediate exposure to a fast-growing company with more than 70 per cent of the US e-cigarette market.Since then, the outlook for Juul has soured. Citing growing public alarm over the rise of teen vaping, the Trump administration earlier this month said it planned to ban all flavoured e-cigarettes. These products make up more than 80 per cent of Juul’s sales. Several important international markets that Juul had been eyeing — including India — have already banned e-cigarettes. A last-ditch attempt on Wednesday by Altria to salvage the talks by ousting Juul chief executive Kevin Burns and replacing him with an Altria veteran was not enough.PMI is right to walk away. It was doing just fine without Altria. Excluding currency headwinds, sales and profits were up during the last quarter. Its gross margins have consistently been higher than Altria’s. It carries less debt, with net borrowings to adjusted ebitda at 2.1 times, compared to Altria’s 2.6 times. Its own heated e-cigarette, IQOS, received US marketing approval earlier this year. IQOS should gain from the vaping crackdown.Before the news of a potential tie-up, PMI shares traded at 15 times forward earnings, against 11 times for Altria. The gap should widen.For Altria, the short-term outlook is fraught. Juul once made it feel cool, like a vaper at a teenage party. The near-$13bn investment now looks overvalued and ill-timed. A writedown seems inevitable.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Click here to sign up.
3;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-09-25T13:30:22Z;E-cigarette crackdown prompts shake-up in tobacco sector;Juul ousts CEO and suspends US ads as Philip Morris International and Altria end $200bn merger talks;The regulatory crackdown on e-cigarettes has prompted Philip Morris International to call off talks about a $200bn merger with Altria and sparked a shake-up at vaping company Juul, which sacked its chief executive and suspended US advertising.Juul Labs, in which Altria took a 35 per cent stake in December 2018 for $12.8bn, announced on Tuesday an abrupt change of leadership and alterations to its marketing and lobbying policies. A person familiar with the situation said PMI decided to walk away after it became apparent the US government crackdown on vaping could have a negative impact given Altria’s stake in Juul.André Calantzopoulos, PMI’s chief executive, said the two companies had decided to focus on the US launch of Iqos, PMI’s heated tobacco product, which, the companies noted, had been authorised by the US Food and Drug Administration following a “rigorous science-based review” and was not an e-vapour product.Speaking to the Financial Times on the sidelines of a tobacco conference in Washington soon after the collapse of the deal was announced, Howard Willard, Altria’s chief executive, said his company was “always evaluating opportunities. These discussions with PMI just reflected that. Ultimately we’ve ceased negotiations and we’ll move on.”Juul said Kevin Burns had decided to step down as chief executive. KC Crosthwaite, Altria’s chief growth officer, will replace him. The company added it would suspend all its broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the US and refrain from lobbying the Trump administration on its moves to tighten regulation in the wake of an outbreak of vaping-related lung illnesses tied to several deaths. The changes at Juul were intended to reassure PMI that Altria was in control of Juul and would have guided the start-up through the regulatory backlash, said a person informed about the negotiations.PMI had been informed in advance of the moves, and the selection of an executive with greater tobacco industry experience coming from Altria was appreciated, the person added. Up until late last week the two sides were determined to go ahead with a deal. Over the weekend, however, the board of PMI determined that the risks outweighed the benefits of a merger, said people close to the companies. Both people said that PMI is likely to pursue a deal with Altria at a later stage once the regulatory environment settles.Mr Willard told the FT that Juul had “taken a number of leadership actions — they’ve done more than any of the other vapour companies — but it’s still not enough”.A PMI-Altria combination was pitched as a way for the companies to spread their bets on the future of nicotine consumption, uniting the largest brand in the declining US cigarette market with Juul, which has seized a 70 per cent share of US e-cigarette sales, and the nascent Iqos.But the deal ran into immediate hostility from both companies’ investors. PMI shareholders expressed concern about taking on exposure to the declining, litigation-wracked US cigarette market. Altria shareholders questioned the logic of a deal that would have offered no control premium.In early trade on Wednesday in New York, shares in PMI jumped 6 per cent, but Altria’s were down more than 1 per cent.“Obviously the timing of the merger wasn’t right given escalating [negative] regulatory headlines, but we still see the merits of this combination and wouldn’t be surprised if talks resume at some point in the future when the environment is better,” said Wells Fargo strategist Bonnie Herzog.The collapse of the talks will also negatively impact the independent investment banks advising them, who will be missing out on significant fees. Lazard was the lead adviser to PMI, while Perella Weinberg Partners and Goldman Sachs were the financial advisers of Altria. 
4;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-08-30T17:08:49Z;Altria/PMI: the resilience of Big Tobacco;The lasting value of the two Marlboro makers has surprised and dismayed public health advocates;"An industry with a lethally addictive product offers billions of dollars to cap the liabilities that threaten its biggest companies: news this week that Purdue Pharma had offered up to $12bn to resolve claims relating to its role in America’s opioid crisis had analysts, investors and lawyers flashing back to the landmark settlement Big Tobacco struck with US states a generation earlier.Yet at the same time came news that two of the world’s largest tobacco companies are in talks about one of the largest mergers in history, which could dictate the future of a product which kills an estimated 8m of its 1.1bn global users each year, according to the World Health Organisation.The $200bn deal under discussion would reunite Altria with Philip Morris International, the overseas operation it spun off in 2008, in part to shelter shareholders from the legal storm clouds that hung over the US tobacco industry even after its $206bn-plus settlement of 1998.The fact that the two makers of Marlboro cigarettes remain so highly valued, and have proposed reuniting, speaks to a resilience that has surprised and dismayed public health advocates. “Like anyone who worked on the litigation 20 years ago I find it heartbreaking that the industry has continued to thrive,” says Doug Blanke, executive director of the Public Health Law Center, who worked on Minnesota’s cases against tobacco companies in the 1990s. But the deal also reflects the profound disruption tobacco companies are facing, as the decline in cigarette consumption accelerates and a format war rages between technologies vying to give smokers ostensibly less harmful means of delivering nicotine. What has brought PMI and Altria together again, analysts say, is the prospect of using the financial muscle and market power their legacy business has given them to gain a decisive advantage in that battle — even if it means killing the product the “Marlboro man” made famous in the process. Financially, Big Tobacco has been more stable than investors dared to hope in 2008, when the two companies split apart. PMI’s exposure to emerging markets has allowed its revenues to grow by 15 per cent since then, while Altria’s US revenues have increased by 1 per cent. Even in the US, the market investors once wanted shelter from, cigarettes have never been more profitable, says Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog — the result of their ability to get addicted customers to pay more. Although some funds refuse to touch the industry, the fact that PMI and Altria both convert 80 per cent or more of that profit into dividends has lured other investors who are desperate for yield: last year UK fund managers at Allianz swapped the oil stocks in their portfolio for tobacco companies. These robust financial headlines mask more troubling trends for the industry, however. In 2000, the WHO estimates, almost 27 per cent of the world’s adult population smoked: that figure has dropped below 20 per cent, with notable falls in major markets including Brazil, Russia and the UK.The US has seen one of the biggest declines, from 23.3 per cent in 2000 to just 14 per cent in 2017. For a decade, this shrinking pool of smokers has left the industry dependent on price increases to keep revenues growing. But with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimating that each 10 per cent increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes reduces consumption by 3-5 per cent, analysts now believe the escalating cost of smoking is accelerating its decline. In July Altria said it expected cigarette volumes to fall by 5-6 per cent this year, rather than the 3.5-5 per cent decline it foresaw six months earlier. As tobacco analyst Erik Bloomquist puts it: “This wonderful cash-generating business looks to be more in danger than it ever has been.” In the past two years another force has added to the pressure on cigarette demand: the number of smokers switching to alternatives. Cigarette manufacturers have experimented with what they call reduced risk products for decades: RJ Reynolds spent $350m to develop a heated tobacco device in the 1980s, only to withdraw it when consumers recoiled at the smell of what even its chief executive reputedly dubbed “a turd with a tip”. None were successful until 2003, when the electronic cigarette was developed by Chinese pharmacist Hon Lik, who sold the patent to Imperial Tobacco for $75m in 2013.Despite the billions of dollars cigarette companies invested in new technologies, it took a start-up to popularise e-cigarettes. Founded in 2015, Juul Labs has seized more than 70 per cent of the US vaping market, a market that is growing fast: the US now has 14m adult vapers alongside its 39m adult smokers, Wells Fargo estimates. The speed of these changes has forced cigarette makers to respond. Last year, Altria invested $13bn in Juul for a 35 per cent stake, pledging to use its sway with retailers to promote Juul’s products.The tobacco group’s efforts to diversify have also seen it spend $1.8bn on a 45 per cent stake in Cronos, a Canadian cannabis company, and $372m for a majority stake in Burger Söhne, the Swiss manufacturer of On, an oral nicotine brand. PMI has set out a more aggressive vision of a “smoke-free” future, investing more than $6bn in a heated tobacco device called Iqos, which it hopes will one day replace cigarettes. Impressed with the early response to Iqos, particularly in Japan, Altria struck a deal to license the product in the US, where it plans to start testing the market with a trial in Atlanta next month. That agreement may now be overtaken by the merger plan. Analysts who support the deal say it would let PMI capture the full value of Iqos in the US, while giving Juul the same promotional push overseas that Altria has promised for the US market.Recombining the two Marlboro makers would not only give them united control of the world’s biggest cigarette brand; they would also own the industry’s leading heated tobacco product and a stake in its largest e-cigarette company, potentially allowing them to win regardless of which technology consumers favour. Yet those arguments have not convinced investors who saw the case for Altria and PMI being apart. Shares in both companies have fallen at the prospect of a deal that would give Altria’s shareholders no takeover premium and expose PMI’s investors to the US market, which many of them wished to avoid. “There is a strong possibility the deal will fail,” Adam Spielman, an analyst at Citi, told clients: “By having two companies listed, investors can choose the balance of pros and cons they want. By merging the two, management would be forcing investors to take the weighted average.” But while tobacco investors once worried most about America’s lawyers, their biggest concern now is its regulators. “While US litigation risk was sufficient to break these companies apart back in 2008, US regulatory risk is on the same plane, in our view,” Stifel analyst Christopher Growe said this week. The US tobacco industry is facing both the biggest regulatory threat to cigarettes since the 1990s, and deep uncertainty about how regulators will treat the new products it is counting on for growth. In the past year the US Food and Drug Administration has proposed banning menthol cigarettes, which account for about a third of US sales, and said it could place more graphic health warnings on cigarette packets. After a National Youth Tobacco Survey last year shocked regulators with the finding that more than one in five high school students admitted to vaping — up 78 per cent on the previous year — the industry is also bracing for a clampdown on e-cigarettes. The FDA has announced restrictions on many of the flavoured products that it suspects have tempted a generation of children. By May 2020, it intends to require lengthy applications before any vaping product can come to market. Juul has taken several steps to convince regulators it is serious about keeping its products out of young hands, but the FDA’s demands could be “a tremendous issue” for the company, Mr Bloomquist says. “If I’m an investor, why do I want to buy into a business where the theoretical upside is coming from another business which has an existential threat to it?”There have been few long-term studies on vaping, but there is escalating concern in the scientific community about its impact on health.Last week, the CDC said it was investigating the first death linked to an “outbreak of severe lung disease” among e-cigarette users. On Friday it issued a health advisory after receiving reports of 215 possible cases in 25 states.A separate report that the Federal Trade Commission was investigating Juul’s marketing practices contributed to the slide in Altria’s shares this week. Mr Blanke hesitates to speculate about whether these new risks could come close to the legal liability cigarettes once faced.But he sees the products on which PMI and Altria are staking their future becoming the next battleground for public health advocates.“We can count millions of lives saved,” he says about the decades of campaigning against cigarettes, but on his more pessimistic days he wonders: “Will it be another 70 years to get rid of e-cigarettes and then another 70 years to get rid of heated tobacco?”"
5;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-08-28T20:48:02Z;Investor doubts put $200bn Philip Morris-Altria merger at risk;Ambitions to combine the companies behind the Marlboro brand raise concerns on Wall Street;Talks about a $200bn merger between Altria and Philip Morris International have run into scepticism among investors, threatening to undermine the plan to reunite the US and international tobacco giants behind the Marlboro brand.“So far we haven’t spoken to one [PMI] shareholder who supports it,” analysts at Citigroup noted on Wednesday. “We are unconvinced of the benefits of combining,” they added.Bonnie Herzog, a Wells Fargo strategist who supports the deal, said she had fielded “a mountain of calls” from investors in both companies who were “frustrated with the potential deal mechanics”.A “merger of equals” structured as a nil-premium offer from PMI could amount to a “takeunder” of Altria, she noted.Investors wiped $13bn off the combined market value of Altria and PMI on Tuesday after the talks were disclosed. On Wednesday both companies recovered some of their losses but remained below the level at which they started the week, with Altria closing up 1.3 per cent at $45.85 and PMI ending New York trading 3.6 per cent higher at $74.32.“PMI has a premium rating because of their investments, technology and strategy to lead the industry transition away from combustible tobacco,” said a portfolio manager at one large asset manager which owns shares in PMI. “A merger with Altria would dilute this strategy significantly and comes with few synergies.”More than a decade after US litigation and regulation prompted the former Philip Morris to split in two, these risks were PMI investors’ biggest worries about the plan to recombine, according to analysts and people familiar with investor feedback to the companies.A deal would require approval from both sets of shareholders. Although both companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, PMI sells Marlboro and other brands outside the country while Altria operates in the US market.“I’m surprised Philip Morris would want to do this deal,” said an analyst at another large asset manager with a stake in PMI. “Not having a US presence sets them apart from other tobacco players and there was no sense that they wanted US exposure. This runs counter to what we thought they wanted to do.”Ms Herzog agreed that PMI investors feared higher exposure to the US, where cigarette consumption is falling faster and regulators pose unpredictable risks both to Altria’s core, cash-generative cigarette business and to the new products on which the industry’s growth depends.Pamela Kaufman, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said she saw “limited strategic rationale” for the mooted merger because of the challenges of the US cigarette market and risks of tighter regulation.“With Philip Morris boasting that its goal is to have a ‘smoke-free world,’ increasing its combustibles exposure seems contrary to its strategy,” she added.The nicotine industry has changed dramatically in recent years, as cigarette sales shrink and consumers shift to e-cigarettes and new heated-tobacco products.One sticking point is Altria’s 35 per cent stake in Juul, the popular ecigarette company. As part of the US group’s agreement with Juul last year, which valued the young company at about $38bn, Altria agreed not to distribute any other e-vapour products.PMI owns Iqos, a cigarette-like device that heats, rather than burns, tobacco and had signed a licensing agreement for Altria to launch it in the US next month. Iqos is marketed as an alternative to cigarettes but it is unclear whether Juul would consider use a deal to seek to renegotiate the terms of its agreement with Altria.On Tuesday PMI revealed it was discussing an all-stock merger with Altria but “no assurance” could be made that an agreement would ultimately be clinched. According to one person briefed on the potential deal structure, PMI shareholders are likely to own between 57 per cent and 59 per cent of the combined group. Altria stockholders would hold the remainder.PMI shares suffered their largest one-day drop in 16 months on Tuesday, declining 7.8 per cent to $71.70. The slide was so intense at one point during the trading day that a US securities rule restricting short sales of PMI stock went into effect.The two companies are investing in e-cigarettes despite intense opposition from regulators in Washington, which have warned that teenage vaping has become an “epidemic”. According to one federally funded study last year, one in five high school seniors said they had vaped nicotine in the previous month.“While US litigation risk was sufficient to break these companies apart back in 2008, US regulatory risk is on the same plane, in our view,” analysts at Stifel said.
6;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-08-27T20:42:14Z;Philip Morris in talks with Altria to create $200bn tobacco group;Move to recombine comes a decade after companies split into US and international arms;Philip Morris International is in talks to merge with Altria in a deal that would reunite the global and domestic US makers of Marlboro and create the world’s largest tobacco group with a market value of nearly $200bn.PMI said on Tuesday it was considering an all-share combination that would put it back together with Altria, 11 years after they were separated to shield PMI from a slowing US cigarette market as well as the threat of regulation and litigation.However, investors gave the prospect of a deal a frosty reception, sending shares in both companies lower.A successful deal would create a vast business which last year reported combined sales of nearly $50bn and net income of $15.3bn.“There can be no assurance that any agreement or transaction will result from these discussions,” PMI said.A person close to the discussions said that the nil-premium deal under consideration would see PMI shareholders own between 57 and 59 per cent of the combined group, while Altria would hold the remainder.The acquisition of Altria by PMI would rank as the sixth largest takeover ever, according to data provider Refinitiv.Shares in Altria initially climbed as much as 11.3 per cent before turning negative and closing down 4.0 per cent on the day at $45.25. That set its market value at $85bn and the company has $27bn of net debt.PMI fell 7.8 per cent to $71.70, taking its market value to $112bn. It has $26.5bn of net debt.Two years ago, their main rival British American Tobacco completed a deal to buy Reynolds American for $49.4bn. At the time, analysts expected PMI to recombine with Altria, given that fears over US litigation of cigarette groups had dissipated.Tobacco groups are racing to increase their presence in electronic cigarettes and heated-tobacco technology as sales of traditional tobacco products decline. Altria agreed last year to take a 35 per cent stake in ecigarette group Juul Labs for $13bn.Uniting the two companies would also allow PMI to capture the full value of its Iqos heated-tobacco technology, which Altria is preparing to launch under licence in the US, according to Bonnie Herzog at Wells Fargo. Altria’s strong US free cash flow would also allow PMI to “catapult the growth” of Iqos around the world, she said.The two companies are investing in e-cigarettes despite intense opposition from regulators in Washington, which have warned that teenage vaping has become an “epidemic”. According to one federally funded study last year, one in five high school seniors said they had vaped nicotine in the previous month.“While US litigation risk was sufficient to break these companies apart back in 2008, US regulatory risk is on the same plane, in our view,” analysts at Stifel said.The two companies have taken different approaches to the fast-growing cannabis market. PMI believes that marijuana remains too risky to invest in despite the number of countries that have legalised its medical and recreational consumption, while Altria has taken a 45 per cent stake in the Canadian cannabis group Cronos for C$2.4bn.Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson in New York
7;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-08-27T18:52:38Z;Philip Morris and Altria gamble on post-cigarette future;Tobacco companies face challenge in convincing investors of merits of $200bn deal;When the world’s largest tobacco company announced in 2007 that it planned to break in two, the rationale was that its US and international operations faced fundamentally different dynamics. The split of Altria and Philip Morris International, which took effect in 2008, would free a faster-growing international division to pursue the emerging markets consumers who were trading up to premium brands such as Marlboro from the US operation whose growth had been hobbled by years of litigation and was staring at an inexorable decline in the number of smokers. That the two companies are exploring a merger little more than a decade later speaks to profound changes in their marketplaces, technologies and attitudes towards their core product. The biggest of these is what Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog described as a “global arms race for reduced risk products”. After decades of fruitless and sometimes halfhearted investments by tobacco companies, two alternative technologies are showing signs of persuading cigarette smokers to switch to something less harmful. Altria and PMI have a substantial interest in both of them. I expect the existing incumbents of Imperial, BAT and Japan Tobacco will need to revisit their playbooks for M&A and value creationIn the past decade, PMI has invested $6bn — more than any other tobacco company — to develop a product that heats tobacco for a cigarette-like experience that exposes smokers to fewer harmful chemicals than burning the leaf does. Iqos, its third attempt at creating such a product in 20 years, has performed well in Japan and other Asian markets, converting more than 7m smokers. But its biggest test awaits: Altria had planned to begin testing Iqos in Atlanta next month, with a view to rolling out sales across the US. That arrangement would have seen Altria license the technology from PMI. But under the common ownership the merger talks are aiming for, PMI would have access to the full economic benefits if Iqos took off among the 40m adult smokers in the US, Ms Herzog noted.Altria has made its own $13bn bet on an alternative to cigarettes. The US company took a 35 per cent stake late last year in Juul, putting a $38bn valuation on the fast-growing company that has seized more than 70 per cent of the US ecigarette market and has an explicit mission of ending cigarette smoking. The deal gave Altria exposure to the most successful of the “vaping” start-ups, having failed with its own ecigarette investments. The appeal for Juul was the prospect of Altria using its vast marketing and distribution power to promote the Juul brand from Marlboro packets to retailers’ shelves. This promise was “transformational” to Juul’s mission, according to Dan Thomson, managing director of Juul’s UK arm: “We’ve got the biggest manufacturer of cigarettes in America to hasten their own decline, or hasten the decline of their existing cigarette business,” he said.A combination of Altria with PMI could give Juul a similar boost in international markets and provide the new tobacco company with an unrivalled slate of alternative products, effectively spreading its bets about the future of smoking. Bernstein Research analysts cautioned that non-compete clauses could restrain any plan for PMI to promote Juul internationally, but Robert Waldschmidt, a strategist at Liberum, said that bringing together the leading ecigarette business with the leading heat-not-burn brand would make the combined company a dangerous competitor for tobacco rivals.“I expect the existing incumbents of Imperial, BAT and Japan Tobacco will need to revisit their playbooks for M&A and value creation,” he said. Tobacco executives now say such alternatives can be as profitable as cigarettes after a period of high marketing investment to establish the new brands. That realisation has encouraged companies including PMI and Altria to see their strategy as trying to take market share away from cigarette rivals without such products. The litigation concerns that hung over the Altria/PMI split more than a decade ago have also ebbed. It is 21 years since the then Philip Morris and its rivals agreed to the largest civil litigation settlement in US history, guaranteeing $206bn in payments to 46 states over the next quarter-century. But the industry has continued to produce prodigious returns to shareholders.However, the fact that shares in Altria and PMI were under pressure after the companies disclosed the talks on Tuesday underlines the task they face in convincing shareholders that a deal is the best way to address the disruption the industry faces.One of the biggest hurdles in the path of a successful PMI-Altria recombination is the uncertainty about how regulators will treat the new products on which the industry’s growth depends. In April, the US Food and Drug Administration authorised Altria to start selling PMI’s Iqos heated tobacco system in the US, but analysts are concerned that the regulator could clamp down on the ecigarette market, after warning of an “epidemic” of youth vaping. Ryan Tomkins, an analyst at Jefferies, said that the biggest threat to the deal was the FDA, which has focused its efforts to curtail vaping on Juul in particular due to its popularity among teenagers and is investigating reports tying seizures to vaping use. Mr Tomkins added that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey of youth tobacco use in the US was due out any day, “the results for which could be dangerous for Juul”.Since their split, PMI and Altria have also diverged in other ways. Altria, led by Howard Willard, last year took agreed to take a C$2.4bn stake in the Canadian cannabis company Cronos, but PMI chief executive André Calantzopoulos has said he still sees too many risks in a market where international regulators have found no consensus.More profoundly, the two companies have differed in their commitment to killing off their main product. PMI talks about “building a future on smoke-free products”. Altria has framed its stance more cautiously, emphasising smokers’ “consumer choice” alongside its commitment to innovation and harm reduction.Stifel analyst Christopher Growe said a merger would boost PMI’s earnings and extract $400m in savings, but Altria’s higher regulatory burden and slowing growth would reduce the multiple at which PMI’s shares trade.That concern drove PMI’s shares down almost 11 per cent from Friday’s close by Tuesday lunchtime in New York, pointing to the potential that investors’ concern could yet prove the biggest obstacle to the deal.If it does happen, however, it could be just be a prelude to another split, Mr Growe speculated: “Perhaps this merger would allow the combined company to create two separate businesses — one focused on cigarettes and generating strong free cash flow and one focused on growth with new, innovative products such as Iqos and Altria’s stake in Juul.”Additional reporting by James Fontanella-Khan in New York

9;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-08-27T17:06:37Z;Philip Morris/Altria: smokin’;The case for re-unification lies in the push for tobacco alternatives;Smokers bond by huddling together against the cold and discussing how to quit. It is the same with tobacco companies such as Philip Morris International and Altria, corporate pariahs in a health-conscious world. On Tuesday, the groups said they were in talks to create a tobacco giant with a market value of more than $210bn. The merger proposal has merits for both sides.The case for re-unification — little more than ten years after the two companies separated — lies in the push for tobacco alternatives. Pooling resources to develop and market new products make sense.Philip Morris is known for its heat-not-burn product Iqos. These cigarette-like devices produce fewer harmful chemicals than cigarette smoke. They have have sold well in some markets, such as Japan. Meanwhile, Marlboro cigarette maker Altria owns a 35 per cent stake in vaping start-up Juul, bought for $12.8bn in December. In June it also acquired a majority stake in a Swiss maker of nicotine pouches. By joining forces, the combined company could benefit from marketing the full range of products globally.Altria spun off its international wing, bearing the name Philip Morris, more than a decade ago, partly as a response to shares trading at a discount to the sum of the company’s parts. That gambit was a damp squib. The two companies have a market value of nearly $220bn, more than a third higher than at the announcement of the split back in 2007. But that is less than the combined growth in operating earnings over the same period.Even so, re-combining carries risks to Philip Morris’s valuation, which might explain why its share price fell on Tuesday. Since the 2008 split, PMI has outperformed, benefiting from its international growth potential. The valuation gap may also have been widened by Altria's purchase of Juul, whose popularity with young people heightens regulatory risks.At the end of 2016 the two traded at a similar price to forward earnings multiple of around 14 times. By the middle of this month, before rumours of a merger, Philip Morris traded at a multiple half again as high. While regulatory risk and lower growth potential have depressed Altria's valuation, they have also created a buying opportunity. For Philip Morris, rewards and risks are stacked more evenly than they are for smokers.
10;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-07-25T04:15:27Z;Tobacco campaign group looks to name and shame;Michael Bloomberg-backed initiative launches online database of companies promoting tobacco;"An online platform naming companies that help to promote the tobacco industry is the latest effort from a $20m initiative funded by the US billionaire Michael Bloomberg to counter tobacco industry tactics.The online database, launched on Thursday, was compiled by Stopping Tobacco Organisations and Products, the first globally co-ordinated tobacco industry campaign group. It lists companies, think tanks and other organisations that Stop believes promote the tobacco industry without necessarily acknowledging their links to the sector, according to the researchers.“Tobacco companies are so untrustworthy that they need other organisations to carry their messages to policymakers and consumers,” said Anna Gilmore, director of the Tobacco Control Research Group at the University of Bath, which has partnered with Stop. “This new database exposes these relationships so that governments and advocates don’t get tricked into believing those messages are credible.”Tobacco companies are trying to shift towards alternative products such as e-cigarettes as the number of smokers decline in the west. But campaigners have accused them of being contradictory in their messages because the vast majority of their profits still come from tobacco sales.Data from Nielsen, the research company, shows that in the UK the number of cigarettes sold in the year to July 13 fell by 2.3bn compared with the same period the year before. In the US, Nielsen said that cigarette volumes fell 9.8 per cent in the four weeks to July 13.We cannot stand by as the industry misleads the public in an effort to get more people hooked on its productsStop was launched last year with $20m of funding from Mr Bloomberg, who has put almost $1bn towards efforts against tobacco smoking since 2007. In a statement, Mr Bloomberg said that the watchdog would hold the industry accountable.“We cannot stand by as the industry misleads the public in an effort to get more people hooked on its products,” he said.Philip Morris said that it worked with think-tanks around the world and that it required its partners to be transparent about their links with the company.“Unfortunately, there are some NGOs that don’t want to talk about better solutions for adult smokers; instead, they want to shut down any open dialogue on this critical social issue,” it said.The launch of the Stop database comes in the same week that British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International’s parent companies were named as defendants in a public health case in Brazil, the biggest market for tobacco products in Latin America.It follows a landmark case in Canada in March, in which the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld a 2015 decision to award C$15.6bn ($11.7bn) in damages against subsidiaries of BAT and Philip Morris as well as Japan Tobacco to compensate smokers for health problems.In its latest annual report, Philip Morris said that “damages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada, Israel and Nigeria, range into the billions of US dollars”.BAT said that it was aware of the lawsuit filed in Brazil and that it would be “vigorously defended by BAT as and when it is formally served with proceedings”."
11;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-07-18T17:28:50Z;Marlboro maker bets $100m more on alternative cigarettes;Philip Morris tries to convert smokers to heating instead of burning tobacco;Philip Morris International, the company behind Marlboro, is to spend another $100m this year developing its alternative to traditional cigarettes as a global marketing drive intensifies to convert smokers to a new generation of products.Martin King, chief financial officer, said on Thursday that extra funds would be deployed to accelerate innovation of the company’s IQOS product — a cigarette-like device that heats, rather than burns, tobacco.The plans, which come ahead of an imminent launch of IQOS in the US, are the latest sign of big tobacco ramping up investment to safeguard the industry’s future.Rival manufacturers are fighting over a share of the market for alternatives as health-conscious consumers reject traditional cigarettes at an accelerating rate. They include vaping company Juul, in which US tobacco group Altria struck a deal to take a 35 per cent stake last December for $13bn.Quarterly results on Thursday from PMI, which makes Marlboro outside the US, underlined how the company is becoming increasingly reliant on IQOS.Shares were up more than 7 per cent by late morning in New York, giving it a market capitalisation of $135bn, as better than anticipated volumes prompted executives to raise their full-year financial guidance.The company shipped 184bn cigarettes to retailers globally in the second quarter, a decline of 3.6 per cent from a year ago. There were falls in all regions apart from south and south-east Asia.In contrast to the falling demand for traditional cigarettes, PMI shipped 15bn heat sticks globally for its “heat-not-burn” devices, a year-on-year rise of 37 per cent.The $100m additional investment in IQOS is an increase of one-third from PMI’s previous plans. “We’ve got to continue with our innovation pipeline,” Mr King said, adding that competition for reduced risk products was “intensifying”.The company will use some of the funds to accelerate the rollout of IQOS in new markets, particularly in more cities in Russia and the EU where the product has only a limited presence.Regulators are concerned that some of the new products — particularly flavoured e-cigarettes that appeal to teenagers — could get a new generation hooked on nicotine, although they also recognise they have the potential to reduce health risks substantially for existing smokers.This year regulators gave PMI the go-ahead to sell its heated tobacco devices in the US. They will be marketed and distributed in the US by Altria, from which PMI was spun out more than a decade ago, and be rolled out initially in Atlanta, Georgia.PMI said that as a result of the stronger than expected second quarter it now expected adjusted earnings per share to rise at least 9 per cent this year, an increase of 1 percentage point.Quarterly revenues across the group were little changed from a year ago at $7.7bn, but rose 9 per cent on a like-for-like basis, a metric that assumes currencies were constant. Net earnings increased 5.5 per cent to $2.3bn, equivalent to $1.49 per share.
12;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-06-19T18:05:24Z;Big Tobacco seeks to recast with tech-focused workforce;As companies look to vaping and heated devices they are having to work hard to recruit talent;Few of the children at Ashton Gate Primary in Bristol will know that their school was once the headquarters of a global tobacco company.Imperial Tobacco moved from the premises to a purpose-built £18m office that brought all of its office staff together under one roof. The glass-fronted building, which has won a number of architectural awards, is just one outward sign of how the tobacco industry is reshaping itself.As cigarette sales decline in the west, Big Tobacco has swung its focus from traditional leaf and paper products to vaping and heated tobacco devices that, with the need for aftercare, refills and digital marketing, are more akin to consumer electronics than cigarettes.“We’ve gone from a long and established, over 100-year history in tobacco to delivering innovative technology based products,” said Simon Cleverly, head of corporate affairs at British American Tobacco, which this month relaunched its BAT Science website under the auspices of a freshly hired digital content manager.At BAT so-called reduced-risk products accounted for just £883m of total revenues of £24.5bn in 2018, but it says that most of its £258m research spending in 2018 was focused on reduced-risk products. Philip Morris International, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, has poured $6bn into such devices since 2008 with most going towards its heated tobacco product IQOS, while Imperial spent $7.1bn acquiring the vaping brand Blu (along with a handful of other tobacco assets) from RJ Reynolds-Lorillard in 2014.To support the switch, Big Tobacco is having to recast its workforce. The industry needs an army of electrical engineers, scientists and digital marketers but is struggling to attract talent as it competes with far less tainted sectors.[Reaching out] was not in the DNA of the company. Not like Facebook and Google, who are always on the move attracting people“It’s about being seen as an attractive place to work in a highly competitive environment,” said Art Valkenburg, global head of digital at Fontem Ventures, Imperial Tobacco’s internal vaping unit set up in 2012. Based in Amsterdam, it has to compete with the likes of Booking.com, Netflix and Uber for hires.Mr Valkenburg, who joined Imperial from Nespresso and has never smoked, added that being differentiated from the Imperial brand does help: “The fact that we are by name slightly separate helps with getting conversations started for sure.”A former Imperial employee said this was part of the thinking behind establishing Fontem.“If you were really cynical about it, and you should be, you would say vapes are products targeted at smokers and non-smokers. And non-smokers would associate a product made by a tobacco company with cigarettes,” he said. Tobacco groups on the whole say that e-cigarettes are aimed at existing smokers.Charles Bendotti, senior vice-president people and culture at PMI, said that holding initial conversations with prospective job candidates has been a key change in how the company recruits new hires.“Like Procter & Gamble and GE in the US, [PMI] grew up from within,” he said. “[Reaching out] was not in the DNA of the company. Not like Facebook and Google, who are always on the move attracting people.”This is one of the biggest obstacles tobacco companies face, according to Ben Frost, a consultant at US recruitment specialist Korn Ferry: “A big challenge is to create the dynamic and engaging ‘we’re a tech business’ feeling without alienating and disengaging all the people in the legacy business who, from a financial perspective, are keeping the lights on.”Cigarette sales may be in decline in the west, but they are still increasing elsewhere. In its 2018 annual report, PMI estimated that volume sales the Middle East and Africa, and South and south-east Asia grew 0.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively.BAT increased revenues in its Americas and Sub Saharan Africa region by 5.6 per cent to £4.5bn in 2018 at constant currencies. The region also represented the greatest profit growth last year — up 6.5 per cent to £1.5bn.These are sales that tobacco companies are fighting hard to keep. Last month, BAT filed a petition at the Supreme Court in Uganda against the country’s Tobacco Control Act, with regulations common in the west such as a ban on smoking in public places, but it was thrown out.Given such efforts, health campaigners are sceptical that tobacco groups are mutating into tech companies that care about their customers’ wellbeing.Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids said claims by “Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco to be concerned with health are just another public relations stunt aimed at repairing their image”.Mr Bendotti insists this is not the case: “We made a clear statement years ago that there will be an end to the conventional cigarette . . . one day I hope and the sooner the better, our factories will only produce smoke-alternative products.”But, as the former Imperial employee points out, tobacco companies have yet to turn a profit in vaping and in the meantime rely on traditional cigarette sales to pay the salaries needed to attract tech talent. “They’re trying to live up to the expectations of the tech people who join,” he said, “but you can’t get away from the fact that they flog fags.”This article has been amended to correct Charles Bendotti’s job titleAre you interested in the latest company news?

13;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-05-01T16:15:30Z;PMI/heated tobacco: burning question;Group eyes big market but relaxation of health warnings will be tough to secure;What is more important: helping smokers or hating us? That is the elevator pitch of tobacco boss André Calantzopoulos. He implores governments not to block the advance of smoke-free products. On Tuesday, his company — Philip Morris International — scored a win when US regulators approved its heated tobacco devices.The IQOS (pronounced eye-koss) gadgets, which will be marketed in the US by Altria, are cigarette-like devices that heat rather than burn, tobacco. The result is a vapour that tastes like tobacco but has fewer harmful chemicals than cigarette smoke.Rising hopes of approval helped lift PMI’s shares nearly 30 per cent this year, though not enough to make up for a 37 per cent fall last year. But the FDA has yet to allow IQOS to be marketed as safer than traditional cigarettes. The products produce fewer toxins than traditional cigarettes but there are still worries about health risks. Some campaigners liken it to jumping from the 10th floor of a tall building, rather than the 50th.Another question is whether heated tobacco can compete against e-cigarettes that vaporise nicotine-containing liquid or salts. In some countries US upstart Juul has made vaping trendy. Heated tobacco devices are typically more expensive and, unlike vaping, unlikely to appeal to non-smokers. PMI warned on profits last July after disappointing sales. PMI also faces competition. BAT has ambitions to build its global heated tobacco share from 10 per cent to 25-35 per cent by 2024.But heated tobacco has made strong advances in markets like Japan, where vaping is restricted. PMI sees a big potential market. Cigarette alternatives are currently just 5 per cent of the nicotine market outside the US and China. It wants two-fifths of its revenues from smoke-free products by 2025. US approval of IQOS creates a first-mover advantage. A relaxation of health warnings will be harder to secure. But if regulators were so minded, it would deliver another hit.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

14;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-04-09T11:37:09Z;Philip Morris shifts focus to ‘smoke free’ nicotine products;Flagship IQOS e-cigarette brand not yet approved in US and researchers have questioned its benefits;Philip Morris International, one of the world’s biggest tobacco companies, has said it wants to focus on “smoke free” nicotine products while acknowledging this will cannibalise sales of conventional cigarettes.But while the US-based group touts the decision as a historic switch that will reduce consumer risks, its flagship IQOS e-cigarette brand has not yet been approved in the US and experts maintain Philip Morris has yet to satisfy them on health issues.Jacek Olczak, Philip Morris’s chief operating officer, said the company’s strategy of becoming “smoke-free” could happen “much faster” than planned. “You know that the problem is cannibalising, or can put a lot of risk on the existing business, but you still think it is the right thing to do,” he said.Philip Morris has taken a big gamble on IQOS, directing almost all of its research and marketing budgets at the product. It aims for so-called “reduced-risk” products to account for 30 per cent of its shipment volumes by 2025, up from just over five per cent last year. In its annual report, it said that 92 per cent of its $383m research and development expense went on the new devices.On Monday, it launched a publicity campaign, “Year of UnSmoke”, to draw attention to its efforts to phase out cigarettes in favour of other products.However, scientists have cast serious doubt over the health claims for IQOS. Dr Stanton Glantz, a tobacco specialist at the University of California San Francisco, said that he and his team had gone through the “several thousand” pages of Philip Morris’s submission to the US Food and Drug Administration for IQOS.“The most fundamental observation about IQOS is that if you take [Philip Morris’s] data, it doesn’t support their claims that IQOS is better than cigarettes,” he said.The IQOS device works by heating up tobacco to a lower level than conventional cigarettes. Traditional tobacco products when lit reach temperatures of about 600C. IQOS heats the tobacco to 350C which, according to Philip Morris’s website, means “the levels of harmful chemicals are significantly reduced compared to cigarette smoke”.However, Dr Glantz said research shows that heated tobacco products still release ultrafine particles that transmit nicotine into the lungs.He also pointed out that his team had found that, of 24 medical tests of metrics such as blood pressure and lung function undertaken by Philip Morris on IQOS users, none showed a detectable difference between IQOS and normal cigarettes.Other researchers have said there may be higher liver toxicity in IQOS users and the same deterioration in users’ arteries as for smokers.Philip Morris has rejected the findings of the UCSF researchers. “The totality of the evidence across our aerosol chemistry, non-clinical and clinical studies, clearly demonstrates that switching completely to IQOS presents less risk of harm than continuing to smoke cigarettes,” said Dr Moira Gilchrist, the company’s vice-president of scientific communications.She said no solid particles were delivered to a user’s lungs, and she disputed the claims about liver damage and cardiovascular disease.The product has not yet received FDA approval.Mr Olczak, who has used IQOS since the prototype came out in 2012, said the company’s science “has to be impeccable”. The product is already selling well in Japan, where nicotine vaping liquid is banned.In its fourth-quarter results for 2018, Philip Morris said shipments of its heated tobacco products were up 14.2 per cent to 41.4bn units. Cigarette shipment volumes were down 2.8 per cent to 740.3bn units.Analysts at UBS said in a report published last month that “the most important catalyst for investor perception [of heated tobacco products] will be the launch of IQOS in the US”, which they said they expected in the second half of this year.This story has been changed to reflect the fact that IQOS does not stand for “I Quit Ordinary Smoking”

Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco have made submissions to an Australian parliamentary inquiry that is considering whether ecigarettes should be legalised.Vaping companies have provided seed funding for a doctor-led charity leading the fight to legalise ecigarettes, and last week PMI sent its top marketing executive to Sydney to promote its transition towards smoke-free vaping products. “Right now, smokers don’t have the ability choose non-burn [vaping] products, which we know are 90 to 95 per cent better [for you],” Marian Salzman, PMI’s senior vice-president of global communications, told the Financial Times. “Others are making a decision about your health if you are a smoker.” Ms Salzman rejected health officials’ concerns that vaping would entice new recruits to smoking and said that PMI’s IQOS ecigarette product was not sold to non-smokers at its retail outlets. She called government bans on ecigarettes “morally reprehensible” because they removed a tool smokers could use to successfully quit the traditional cigarettes habit.Australia, Turkey and Mexico are the only three OECD countries that have not legalised ecigarettes containing nicotine. A repeal of Australia’s ban would be a victory for the big tobacco groups in a country with the world’s toughest anti-tobacco laws. The lobbying campaign comes amid a global debate over industry claims that vaping is better for people’s health than smoking, given an absence of long-term studies.PMI, the world’s biggest tobacco company by sales, has said it wants sales of smoke-free products to comprise almost 40 per cent of total revenue by 2025, versus 13 per cent in 2017. It now directs about 80 per cent of its research-and-development spending and almost half of its commercial spending, which includes marketing, towards its smoke-free products. Ms Salzman, formerly chief executive of Havas PR North America, was recruited by PMI to rehabilitate the company’s reputation, which has been tarnished over decades as it targeted young consumers and sought to downplay the risks of smoking.Her decision to join a tobacco company surprised many in the public relations industry, not least because her father died of lung cancer. But she said her father knew cigarettes were bad for him and that it was his choice to smoke.“My father continued smoking after he had 40 per cent of his lungs removed and lived for another eight years, and he’d be constantly sneaking outside with a pipe or cigarettes. So I can’t blame tobacco for that.” Ms Salzman said critics should not “just scream us down” when PMI advocated for the repeal of the ban on ecigarettes, as the company tries to transition to ecigarettes and away from tobacco.Greg Hunt, Australia’s health minister, told the FT he supported the existing ban. But pressure from backbench MPs who have been lobbied by tobacco groups has prompted the government to commission an independent study on ecigarettes.Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration classifies nicotine as a dangerous poison that cannot be sold without a specific permit, and no tobacco company has submitted a vaping product for assessment by the agency.Health advocates say vaping is part of a distraction programme by the tobacco industry, which continues to market and sell cigarettes that are known to kill more than 480,000 people a year in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.They say the vaping industry is following the tobacco companies’ play book, targeting young people with flavoured ecigarettes, and funding their own health studies and advocacy groups.PMI recently inked a $5m content deal with the youth-focused Vice Media, while in Australia two vaping companies provided seed funding for the doctor-led pro-vaping advocacy group, the Australian Tobacco Harm Reduction Association.“Given their [the tobacco industry’s] long history of lies and deceit, why should anyone accept what they now claim?” said Mike Daube, professor of health at Australia’s Curtin University and an anti-smoking advocate.
16;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-03-21T12:31:40Z;Marlboro maker teams up with Vice for vaping push;Philip Morris strikes £5m sponsored content deal to promote ecigarettes;Tobacco giant Philip Morris International has teamed up with youth-focused Vice Media to promote vaping, in a move that has alarmed health campaigners.Vice has agreed a deal with PMI to produce sponsored content endorsing ecigarettes, according to two people with direct knowledge of the arrangement. One said the deal would cost the tobacco group £5m and that the campaign was due to start in April.The push comes amid a global regulatory clampdown on cigarette advertising, following decades of tobacco companies underplaying the risks of smoking and past industry practices of targeting younger consumers in an attempt to hook them at an early age.Like other tobacco groups, the seller of Marlboro cigarettes outside the US has shifted focus to non-combustible nicotine products as traditional smoking wanes. PMI, the biggest cigarette company in the world by sales, said in an investor presentation last month that it expected “reduced-risk” products, such as its flagship IQOS device, to account for roughly 40 per cent of total revenues by 2025, up from just under 14 per cent, or $4.1bn, last year.Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the PMI-Vice vaping campaign could be an early harbinger of more youth-focused marketing to come, particularly with the recent UK launch of the fashionable device made by US start-up Juul.“We haven’t seen the intensity of marketing that the US has had yet,” he said.According to Vice, its audience is 18- to 34-year-olds but it is known to attract many younger consumers too. It has been struggling in recent months as advertising revenues have dried up. In February, it announced that it would be cutting 250 staff as part of a “strategic restructure”.A Vice business previously worked with PMI in 2016, when its Edition Worldwide agency created “white label” videos for the company.The latest PMI initiative will be produced by a team of journalists recruited to work for a new online platform.George Butterworth, senior policy manager at Cancer Research UK, said that big tobacco companies were finding ways to market ecigarettes that exploited possibilities under EU law. “[They] use a host of PR tactics, including celebrity endorsement, to market these products, which increases the risk of the content being seen by children,” he saidUK law, which comes under the EU directive, states that any marketing of ecigarettes “must not be likely to appeal particularly to people under 18, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture”.The Department of Health and Social Care said it would take any “unlawful promotion of tobacco and other nicotine-inhaling products very seriously and expect any organisation found to be flouting the rules to be investigated”.According to a recruitment message sent via LinkedIn, the new Vice platform on which the campaign is expected to run will cover the broad theme of “change” and “tackle some of the biggest issues facing the world in areas such as health, environment, energy and technology among many others”.PMI declined to commentVice said it was launching “an editorially independent media platform” which would tackle some of society’s biggest issues, from fossil fuels to the overuse of plastic. It said the first project would be “a global mission to quit cigarettes”, funded by PMI. It said that new site would not promote ecigarettes or tobacco products.Cancer Research UK said it had been approached to take part but declined due to the tobacco industry link.A journalist at the Financial Times was approached by headhunters for the project but was asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement before hearing more about the role.The PMI campaign is set to launch just as regulators in the US crack down on the sale of vaping products to young people. Last week, the US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb published draft guidance to curb the “epidemic” use of ecigarettes among teenagers.By contrast, UK authorities do not believe youth vaping is such a problem. A House of Commons report published last year said that regular vaping among secondary school children was less than 1 per cent. Data published by the Office for National Statistics found that more than half of 16- to 24-year-olds had tried ecigarettes, with roughly 7 per cent being current users.This article has been revised since its original publication to include a statement from Vice (which had originally declined to comment) that the project will run on an editorially independent media platform, and that it denies the new site will promote ecigarettes or tobacco products.
17;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-03-04T15:18:17Z;Philip Morris trims earnings guidance on Canadian court ruling;;Philip Morris International cut its full-year earnings guidance as it prepares to pay damages stemming from two landmark Canadian smoking and health class action lawsuits.The cigarette maker’s Rothmans, Benson & Hedges (RBH) subsidiary, alongside British American Tobacco’s Imperial Tobacco Canada and Japan Tobacco division JTI-Macdonald, lost an appeal in Quebec on March 1 and are now on the hook for C$15.6bn ($11.7bn) to compensate smokers for health problems.PMI, which is not a party to the cases, said it will incur a pre-tax charge of about $195m, or $142m after tax, in the first quarter of 2019. As such, the company downgraded its full-year 2019 forecast for diluted earnings to “at least” $5.28 a share, down from at least $5.37, which it affirmed as recently as February 20.Excluding this 9 cent impact from the class action damages, as well as a previously flagged 14 cent hit related to currency, forecast adjusted diluted earnings held steady at $5.51.The decision by PMI, the biggest cigarette company in the world by sales and owner of the Marlboro brand, differs from British American Tobacco. Ahead of the ruling, BAT used its quarterly results to play down the impact from the court case, but said on Friday it was “extremely disappointed” with the court’s decision but at the time made no adjustments to its earnings forecasts.PMI said in its statement on Monday RBH “will seek leave to appeal this judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada”. Imperial Tobacco and JTI-Macdonald both said they would review the court’s decision and consider their options, with the former saying they fully intend to appeal against the decision to the Supreme Court.The class action suits, known as the Blais and Létourneau cases, were the first in Canada in which damages have been ordered against the industry to compensate smokers for health problems. In 2015 a trial court in Montreal ruled in favour of the plaintiffs and found the estimated damages totalled about C$15.6bn including interest.The industry appealed the ruling, but a Quebec court on March 1 largely upheld the total amount of compensation, including the trial court’s order to deposit a proportion of damages, about C$1.1bn, into trust accounts within 60 days. RBH’s share of that deposit is C$257m, but had previously deposited C$226m in escrow.PMI shares were about ⅓ of 1 per cent higher in morning trade, but had been down as much as 0.2 per cent. In pre-market trade, shares turned negative after the company revealed its revised guidance.
18;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2019-01-22T05:00:45Z;Philip Morris keeps powder dry on cannabis;Tobacco group wary of large investment amid differing regulatory policies worldwide;The head of Philip Morris International has said the cannabis market remains too risky for it to follow rival cigarette maker Altria by making a significant investment in the nascent sector.André Calantzopoulos, chief executive, stressed that there was a paucity of scientific data on the long-term impact of cannabis. Because international regulators were adopting different approaches to the drug, there could be logistical and reputational risks, he said.“We need better scientific understanding of [cannabis],” he told the Financial Times on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. “We need to remember that we are operating in an international environment with different [policy] approaches.” His comments came at a time when a host of consumer goods companies are diving into the cannabis sector, which is dominated by Canadian groups. Last year, Altria agreed to take a 45 per cent stake in Cronos for C$2.4bn ($1.86bn), Corona beer maker Constellation Brands has pumped about $4bn into Canopy Growth, and the world’s largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, has teamed with Tilray to research cannabis-infused drinks.We don’t want to normalise nicotine use but we want to replace the delivery methodBy contrast, Coca-Cola, which had studied whether to invest in cannabis, has decided to eschew the pot business. Muhtar Kent, outgoing chairman of Coca-Cola, told the FT last month that “the jury is still out” on the health risks of cannabis. “We’re in non-alcoholic beverages and we’re not interested in putting anything other than good things into our beverages,” he said. A legalisation wave has given a quarter of the US population access to recreational marijuana — and two-thirds access to medical marijuana — creating a $10bn industry. With states such as New York and New Jersey considering whether to legalise the drug — and countries such as Canada having recently introduced legalisation — pressure is rising for consumer goods companies to devise a marijuana strategy. Mr Calantzopoulos said, however, that his main focus was to persuade global regulators to drop their opposition to the marketing and promotion of smokeless, non-combustible nicotine products, such as the IQOS product made by Philip Morris, or those of rival Juul, a vaping company that is part-owned by Altria. Philip Morris’s chief said a key reason why he was attending WEF — after years of absence — was to convince regulators and non-governmental groups that smokeless nicotine products are a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and should be promoted as a replacement. “We don’t want to normalise nicotine use but we want to replace the delivery method,” said Mr Calantzopoulos. Regulators around the world have taken different approaches to smokeless nicotine products. Although some countries have adopted a lenient stance — such as Japan, where the smokeless market accounts for almost a quarter of all nicotine use — others have been tougher. In the US, Scott Gottlieb, head of the Food and Drug Administration, has threatened to crack down on what he has labelled “epidemic” levels of underage vaping amid the rapid uptake of Juul smokeless products.Mr Calantzopoulos said he was open to acquisitions and deals with industry partners to develop the smokeless market and other new products. “We are looking at a combination of acquisitions and internal development now — it’s all to develop technology,” he said. He ruled out a merger with Altria, even though the two groups have a licensing agreement in the US. “We do not envisage a merger,” he said, noting the hype over Juul. “I do not think that Juul has any technology advantage [compared with IQOS]. What they have done is a lot of marketing and branding.”
19;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2018-10-10T04:01:11Z;Nicotine is a healthier habit than tobacco;Regulators are in danger of doing more harm than good by curbing ecigarettes;"Inventing a product that is wildly popular is not usually a setback for a technology company. But that is the difficulty facing Juul Labs, the San Francisco start-up behind the best-selling US ecigarette.Juul is the Nespresso of vaping — a sleek device that works with a collection of flavoured pods, including mango and cucumber, to deliver an intense hit of nicotine in a cloud of vapour. It mimics so well the pleasure of smoking that “Juuling” has become a craze among teenagers and taken 72 per cent of the US ecigarette market. The company, which was founded three years ago, is now valued at $16bn.Juul Labs is in trouble with the US Food and Drug Administration, which does not want to get fooled by the industry again. Tobacco companies hid the harmful effects of smoking for decades and the FDA is under intense pressure not to let ecigarette use turn into a similar scandal. It has threatened to curb adults’ freedom to vape if companies such as Juul cannot keep ecigarettes away from under-18s.The FDA should chill out and take a lesson from the more relaxed attitudes to vaping in countries such as Germany and the UK. Tobacco causes cancer, lung problems and heart disease, killing 480,000 Americans a year, and nicotine is the addictive alkaloid in tobacco. But these two facts do not prove that nicotine is a dangerous drug that needs to be treated as an equal menace.Worse than a category error, this would be stupid. Getting a nicotine habit is a waste of money, and puffing from what looks like a USB drive may lead others to question your sanity. But it is nothing like as dangerous as smoking — the best estimates are that ecigarettes convey about 0.5 per cent of the cancer risk and 5 per cent of the overall health risk of cigarettes.Health campaigners ought to welcome vaping, rather than confusing smokers with grim warnings that make it sound as if ecigarettes are not much better than the real thing. The reason why shares of tobacco companies such as Philip Morris International, the world’s largest, have fallen sharply is that smokers in developed economies are increasingly giving up, partly thanks to the arrival of satisfying substitutes.Teenagers really should not vape, since there is some medical evidence that nicotine affects their brain development (although the same can be said of caffeine, and Nespresso pods do not carry health warnings). But the risk is not so high that it justifies encouraging adults to keep smoking in order to cut off the supply of Juuls and other vaping devices to school students.Although Juul Labs has become public enemy number one in the US vaping crackdown, I admire how it has shaken up the industry. “We are not concerned about Juul,” André Calantzopoulos, chief executive of Philip Morris, declared at its annual investor day. He sounded concerned, though.Like other tech disrupters, Juul Labs had the advantage of starting from scratch and not being bound by tradition. Tobacco companies offer ecigarettes but they often resemble fountain pens with glowing ends; Juul Labs rejected the idea of imitating a cigarette and produced a sleeker object.Tobacco companies are also investing in devices that heat tobacco leaves to produce nicotine rather than burning them, which is as close as you can get to smoking without lighting up. Philip Morris’s IQOS heated tobacco brand has done well in Japan, taking 16 per cent of the market, but it feels more like imitation than innovation.It has been harder to gain regulators’ approval for the devices than for ecigarettes that do not contain tobacco. Philip Morris is trying to get the FDA to approve IQOS for sale in the US and is suing the South Korean government over a regulatory finding that it produces harmful substances.The company is probably right that heated devices are preferable to traditional cigarettes — it says its own tests show that IQOS is far less toxic, although independent research is needed. But a break with the tobacco-infused past, as represented by Juul and other ecigarettes, is simpler and clearer.Juul has its own work to do. It has been careless in letting Juuling take hold in schools, which is partly due to the product itself, not merely the sales and marketing practices on which the FDA has pounced. Selling vaping pods in sweet flavours is a temptation to teenagers and flavours are banned in countries such as Finland, as well as in US cities including San Francisco.But underage use does not justify prohibition of vaping any more than other pleasures that are proscribed for teenagers but enjoyed by adults. Even if the Juul craze carries on, it would only become a serious hazard if vapers progressed to smoking. That danger in the UK has “not materialised to any significant degree”, a parliamentary committee concluded in July.Regulators should resist the instinct to hoist the precautionary principle above that of harm reduction. A smoker who instead becomes a vaper will be healthier, and even a non-smoker who turns to ecigarettes is not risking his or her life. Tobacco has been one of the greatest health hazards of modern times. Nicotine is not.john.gapper@ft.com"
20;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2018-10-01T12:47:29Z;Tobacco chief likens nicotine abolitionists to condom opponents;Philip Morris’s Calantzopoulos says argument has parallels with safe sex debate;"Policymakers should embrace lower-risk alternatives to traditional cigarettes to promote public health, with hostility to the products akin to campaigns against condoms, according to the maker of Marlboro.André Calantzopoulos, chief executive of Philip Morris International, the world’s biggest tobacco company by market capitalisation, said the debate about the devices had parallels with calls for abstinence to prevent the spread of HIV.“If you argue that these products should not be authorised because they have unintended consequences, then essentially the only option people have is either to quit — and we know many don’t — or to continue smoking cigarettes,” he told the Financial Times.“Sometimes I think we have the same debate we had for HIV. Should people be protected or not? Should we allow condoms or not? Some people are arguing that no, abstinence is the only way to do it. That goes a little bit, in my view, against human nature.”Mr Calantzopoulos’ comments come at an important time for tobacco companies, whose main offering is in steep decline in the west. Products such as electronic cigarettes promise to safeguard the industry’s longer-term future, but campaigners claim they could get a new generation hooked. Regulatory approval is patchy globally.Any debate should take the interests of the people who smoke, not ideology, into considerationThe PMI chief was speaking days before his company announced it was filing a lawsuit against the South Korean government, demanding the disclosure of information on test results of harmful substances found in electronic cigarettes. The country’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said in June that five cancer-causing substances were found in heated tobacco products.PMI, whose cigarette brands include Marlboro and Parliament, has found success with its “heat-not-burn” product, called IQOS, in some markets, particularly Japan. It wants policymakers elsewhere to give it the green light. Regulators in the US are weighing up whether to do so.The company in July posted net revenue of $7.7bn for the second quarter, up 11.7 per cent year on year — but it said it expected to sell 44bn to 45bn heated devices this year, against analysts’ expectations of 51.5bn. PMI’s share price is down by almost a third over the past year as investors have baulked at slowing sales of the devices.Ecigarettes turn a nicotine-laced liquid into vapour, but IQOS works differently. It contains a small electric heater, which warms a stick of tobacco to a temperature beneath its burning point. PMI says its clinical trials show that users are exposed to at least 90 per cent fewer toxins than traditional smokers, although it acknowledges IQOS is not risk-free.Mr Calantzopoulos said he expected approval “any day” to be able to sell the products in the US, although it would take longer to get approval to market them as safer than cigarettes.“In some places you can communicate in a reasonable way with people who smoke; in others it’s much more difficult,” he said. “There’s a difference between Italy and Japan for example.” In the former, he added, the company was “very limited” in what it could say about the products.While he acknowledged the tobacco industry had an “undeniable” problem with credibility, Mr Calantzopoulos added: “I don’t ask people to believe it. I ask people to see what we’re doing. The science is very transparent.“Any debate should take the interests of the people who smoke, not ideology, into consideration.”As well as delivering the nicotine hit, the IQOS tastes like tobacco, although Mr Calantzopoulos acknowledged it could never be quite as good to a smoker as a traditional cigarette. Between puffs on his device, the chief executive who smoked cigarettes for about 35 years, also said young people were not interested in IQOS “in particular, because it contains tobacco”.Policymakers globally are debating whether the health benefits of lower-risk products outweigh the danger that they might tempt a new generation of consumers to try nicotine.In the US, officials in September laid down plans to crack down on the ecigarette industry, warning that teenage vaping had reached “epidemic” proportions. Flavoured versions of the product are blamed for getting young people addicted.While Mr Calantzopoulos said the way some ecigarette “liquids are described and marketed” was a “concern”, he warned that campaigns to curb sales to teenagers could backfire. “You’ve been a teenager yourself — every time they tell you ‘don’t do this’, what were we doing? We were doing it . . . It makes it even more desirable for teenagers to have the product.”Neither of his teenage children smoke. “My point to them has always been, you should not smoke. But if one day they do, I would say use these products rather than cigarettes.”"
21;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2018-10-01T09:39:41Z;Philip Morris sues Seoul over ecigarette information disclosure;Lawsuit comes amid concern sales could be hit in important Asia market;Philip Morris International has filed a lawsuit against the South Korean government, demanding the disclosure of detailed information on Seoul’s recent test results of harmful substances found in electronic cigarettes.The lawsuit against the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety follows its announcement in June that five cancer-causing substances were found in heated tobacco products, with the level of tar detected in some of them far exceeding that of conventional cigarettes. The ministry tested heated tobacco devices including PMI’s IQOS, British American Tobacco’s Glo, and Lil, made by leading South Korean cigarette maker KT&G Corp. The unusual lawsuit against the South Korean regulator underlines PMI’s concern that sales of ecigarettes in one of its key markets in Asia could take a hit, right as it is struggling to convince older and more conservative smokers to make the switch. Seeking to rebut the ministry’s findings, PMI said its alternative tobacco product had lower levels of harmful substances than conventional ones, and that tar was a concept specific to cigarette smoke and should not apply to its smoke-free product. “Because of the ministry’s announcement, smokers and their relatives are confused over using alternative tobacco products that are less harmful than conventional ones,” the company said in a statement on Monday. PMI filed the case with the Seoul Administrative Court after it said it was denied relevant information on the ministry’s test results, including the experimental data and the method of analysis, even though South Korean law requires key health information to be shared with the public. “This lawsuit is part of our effort to clear such confusion and misunderstanding by disclosing the ministry’s information transparently according to the law,” said Brian Kim, the company’s vice-president. The ministry declined to comment on the lawsuit.The company behind the Marlboro brand has been betting on smokeless devices for growth as health-conscious consumers increasingly abandon traditional cigarettes. PMI touts its IQOS product by highlighting that the tobacco is heated rather than burnt, thus reducing the levels of harmful chemicals while maintaining a flavourful nicotine-containing vapour. The cigarette-like device, which heats disposable tobacco-packed sticks, has quickly gained popularity among young smokers in South Korea. PMI has sold 1.9m units as of May this year, after launching IQOS in the country in May 2017, with about 1m South Korean smokers estimated to have switched to the smokeless product. The global market for heated tobacco devices was estimated at $6.3bn last year, with analysts projecting an average annual growth rate of more than 20 per cent for the next five years. IQOS had 7.3 per cent of South Korea’s tobacco market in the first three months of this year.
22;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Tobacco stocks fall after Jefferies revises outlook;;Tobacco giants, Philip Morris and Altria Group were trading lower after Jefferies downgraded the stocks and predicted slower adoption of “reduced risk” tobacco products than previously forecasted. The move also weighed on their rivals.Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett, revised down projections for so-called reduced risk tobacco products, to 41 per cent of market share globally, compared with previous predictions of 61 per cent in the US and 51 per cent overseas.Mr Bennet also downgraded Philip Morris and Altria to “hold”, while reaffirming British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands as a “buy”, as the tobacco industry contends with a shift in consumer preferences away from traditional cigarettes in favour of “vaping”.Philip Morris shares were down 3 per cent, just after noon in New York on Friday, while Altria was down 1.5 per cent. UK-listed Imperial Brands was down 1.5 per cent and British American Tobacco was down 3.4 per cent after the close of markets in London.Mr Bennett said he previously believed that “heated” products would appeal to the majority of smokers, but now sees a slower adoption of heated products, pointing to consumer preference for vapour.BAT has the first-mover advantage in the US vapour market, Mr Bennet wrote in the report, and noted that Imperial Brands is also well positioned for vapour share.Philip Morris, on the other hand, faces longer term pressure on total tobacco volume due to consumer preferences for vapour, Mr Bennett said, adding the company has seen significant share loss in the Japanese market.Altria Group also faces share pressures, and is at a disadvantage in the vapour market, due to available formats and concerns around a delay on approval of IQOS, a tobacco heating system, Mr Bennet wrote.Jefferies predicts vapour making up 54 per cent of initial launch markets in the US by 2026, and 62 per cent outside of the US by that date. That’s up from Jefferies previous predictions of 40 per cent and 36 per cent. That prediction is supportive of British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands, but bad news for Philip Morris, Mr Bennet wrote.All of these companies compete with Juul, the San Francisco-based vaping start-up, which has grown in popularity, but is currently under scrutiny by regulators.
23;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Philip Morris battles to maintain growth of IQOS ecigarette;Tobacco group lowers global guidance amid troubles in key Japanese market;Philip Morris International’s bet on a smoke-free future has hit a snag. The world’s biggest listed tobacco company sharply lowered full-year earnings guidance on Thursday as efforts to win customers for its smokeless devices struggled to gain traction.The Marlboro maker said it expected diluted earnings for 2018 to come in at $5.02 to $5.12 a share, down from the $5.25-$5.40 range it forecast three months ago. The company’s shares fell 6 per cent in morning trading.Investors had been looking for improvements in sales of IQOS, PMI’s heated tobacco device, in the key Japanese market after the company’s report of slowing sales in the first quarter prompted shares to crash by their most in a decade in April.But the tobacco giant said on Thursday that marketing to promote a new line of cheaper devices in the Asian country would not begin to pay off until 2019. It now expects to sell 44bn-45bn heated devices this year against analysts’ expectations of 51.5bn.“We are implementing the right marketing and product measures to reinvigorate growth in Japan, which is undoubtedly well below our initial expectations this year,” said chief executive André Calantzopoulos.“These initiatives . . . will position PMI well for a strong overall performance in 2019. Our revised 2018 EPS guidance reflects this decision.”As health-conscious consumers reject traditional cigarettes, big tobacco has turned to ecigarettes, vaping and substitute devices in search of growth.PMI has touted its IQOS (pronounced eye-koss) products, arguing that they are less harmful than traditional cigarettes.The cigarette-like device, which heats disposable tobacco-packed sticks, was launched in Japan two years ago and enjoyed initial success thanks to a quick take up among younger smokers. But the excitement has waned as the company struggled to convince older and more conservative smokers to make the switch.IQOS is also facing increased competition for market share in the heated tobacco category. Japan Tobacco in June cut the price of its Ploom TECH device by 25 per cent, making it less than half the price of IQOS units, even after PMI lowered their price by about 30 per cent.In a recent note, analysts at UBS said the key factors for respondents who were not attracted by IQOS “was the inconveniences of charging it and the higher price compared to main competitors”.The sales slowdown was underscored by PMI’s second quarter figures. While the number of heated tobacco units sold was up more than 73 per cent for the June quarter from a year ago, it was down from the blistering pace recorded in the previous quarters. This comes as cigarette shipments continue to fall, dropping 1.5 per cent year on year.Net revenue still rose 11.7 per cent to $7.7bn — topping expectations of $7.56bn thanks to price increases. Net income came in at $2.19bn, up from the $1.78bn from a year ago and ahead of the $1.92bn forecast.

Canada has legalised marijuana for recreational use, clearing the way for millions of adults to smoke or grow the drug openly. Other nations may follow. Investing will not be as simple as buying stocks exposed to hemp farming.Cannabis shares are getting sky high, all the same. Canopy Growth, Canada’s biggest pot stock by market value, has scaled new heights. The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF, which tracks North American weed stocks, is up nearly a third from mid-April lows.The problem for investors seeking a hit is that most publicly traded cannabis companies are small. Some are downright speculative. The industry kingpins are little more alluring, given eye-watering valuations.Ganja grower Canopy is up 75 per cent since early April, boasting a market worth of nearly C$9bn ($6.7bn). This despite a net loss of C$7.5m on a paltry C$39.9m in sales last year.Shortsellers have taken notice. IHS Markit says $2.5bn in cannabis stocks are being shorted, quadruple the figure a year ago. Big Tobacco may be a cheaper, and safer, way in for those untroubled by the ethical issues of peddling a powerful psychoactive.None of the big cigarette companies plans to sell cannabis just yet. But there have been some suggestive moves. Imperial Brands appointed a cannabis company chairman to its board last year. Marlboro maker Philip Morris International invested in Syqe Medical, an Israeli firm that makes a cannabis inhaler, two years ago.In addition to manufacturing and marketing expertise, Big Tobacco wields a huge distribution network. Companies have deep pockets and could easily gain a foothold in the sector through acquisitions.The potential for consumer goods groups has not been lost on brewer Constellation Brands.

25;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2018-05-18T13:37:38Z;FT Health: Transfat ban could save 500,000 lives a year;Paul Farmer of Mind, Ebola fears, food as medicine;"Click here to receive FT Health every Friday by email.On the menu of “easy wins” to tackle unnecessary and premature death, eliminating transfats are a prominent and low-cost item. The World Health Organization’s call this week for governments to introduce a ban on the industrially-produced fats could save 500,000 lives a year globally from cardio-vascular disease.“Transfats have a long shelf life and are solid at room temperature, but they are also solid in your coronary arteries and reduce the life expectancy of humans,” says Thomas Frieden, who oversaw a ban in New York when he was the city’s health commissioner.Resolve to Save Lives, the initiative he leads at the non-profit Vital Strategies, will help provide advice and funding to guide the growing number of governments seeking to introduce bans. While manufacturers and caterers need a period to cut stocks and find new supplies, his experience is that the costs are low and consumers do not notice the difference.There has been some moaning from industry and debate about how to precisely define a “ban”. A public consultation is now open. Yet he argues from his time in New York when the ban was imposed in 2006: “This is an issue on which industry didn’t want to fight us. It didn’t want to go to the court of public opinion and argue for the right to keep a poison you didn’t even know was in your food.”We talked to Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, the mental health charity, to mark mental health awareness week.Is society making progress in tackling mental health?We know there are certain groups who are increasingly affected, including in the UK younger women, older men and almost certainly children and young adults. There is a growing recognition that it’s a major issue and there’s a greater willingness to talk about individuals’ experiences. But we are still in the foothills of real change. What is driving mental health conditions?We don’t know enough about the causes, but some of the plausible theories include the impact of social media; the growing pressures of a changing society; and difficulties in creating better connections between groups within our communities.What are the solutions?It’s about offering prevention with a place people can ask for advice; a place to treat where they can get access and feel confident to go; and a place to recover so they can then come back into work and society. There are at least three things that help with prevention: doing physical activity; having a place to think such as through mindfulness, art or music; and someone to talk to.Returns on investment For every $1 invested in tackling non-communicable diseases in poorer countries there is a return of at least $7 in increased employment, productivity and longer lives, according to a WHO analysis.

26;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2018-05-02T04:00:43Z;Scepticism over ‘value’ comeback despite energy surge;Investment strategy gains are over-reliant on one sector, reflecting little broader shift;Energy shares were the top US market performers over the past month but the move has not been enough to renew faith that “value” investing is on the way back.The S&P 500 value index nudged ahead of its “growth” investing counterpart during April, with gains of 0.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively.But analysts were nonetheless reluctant to declare a shift in market dominance between the two diverse styles of investing — the gains in April were not supported by other key sectors considered to be classic value plays.Value investors look for companies trading at a discount to their future cash flows or break-up value while growth investing entails buying companies that offer the hope of above-average growth but often trade with a larger price tag.“Value is working but not because of any macro investor preference for cheap stocks,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek. “Rather, it comes down to sentiment about energy stocks and the near-term direction of oil prices.”The energy sector gained more than 9 per cent in April to lead the S&P 500. Energy companies account for 12 per cent of the S&P 500 Value index, only second to financials at 25 per cent.Investors embraced the shares of energy companies with Andeavor (being bought by Marathon Petroleum), Newfield Exploration, Valero Energy, Occidental Petroleum and Pioneer Natural Resources among the top performers in the S&P 500 in April.“At the same time I had the energy story, I had industrials falling and financials were flat,” said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank.“Given the size of financials within the value groups, it is financials that have to move to have a sustained rotation from growth to value,” he added.Financial shares fell 0.5 per cent in April and industrials lost 2.9 per cent. Tech eked out a 0.03 per cent rise.Consumer staples, which make up 11 per cent of the value index, were the worst performers in April, dragged down by losses at stocks of Philip Morris, Kraft Heinz and Procter & Gamble.Value beat growth in March as well, and six out of the past 12 months based on S&P 500 indices, but remains a long-term laggard in performance to growth.“Value in a broad sense has been underperforming for over a decade,” said Tim Edwards, managing director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “It is not supposed to guarantee returns in the short term but people have begun to question how much patience do you need.”Sharp gains for the shares of high-growth technology companies, particularly a handful of large groups known as the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet) have helped to propel growth investing styles in recent years.But tech shares have stumbled this year on concerns about privacy and heightened regulation.Tech accounts for 41 per cent of the S&P 500 growth index, while energy is also in the index but accounts for just 0.3 per cent.
27;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2018-04-20T01:05:26Z;Philip Morris International: light my fire;US tobacco group has a problem with older smokers;"Philip Morris International is struggling to persuade people to stop smoking cigarettes. During quarterly results on Thursday, the tobacco giant highlighted the “more conservative adult smoker” as the problem. In Japan, the over-50s are still setting fire to cancer-causing sticks like there is no tomorrow.This has taken Philip Morris by surprise. Its shares fell as much as 18 per cent, their worst decline since it split from Altria in 2008. British American Tobacco and Altria fell in sympathy. Yet Martin King, chief financial officer of Philip Morris, is not quitting. “It just doesn’t make sense” to think they will keep smoking cigarettes, he reassured investors.This is a strange world. In Fahrenheit 451, the firefighters set fire to things. In 2018, cigarette companies battle to get rid of cigarettes and investors punish them when they fail.There is method to the madness. Philip Morris is no longer simply a peddler of Marlboros outside the US (Altria handles the US market). It now has several “reduced-risk products” that typically heat rather than burn tobacco, aiming for a lower chance of user death. Japan is the test bed for IQOS, an electronic product. After a positive start, sales growth plateaued. Heated tobacco units in the country fell from 13.1bn in the fourth quarter to 6.2bn in the first.Philip Morris must try harder to convince older smokers to switch. It has 68 per cent share of the heated tobacco category in Japan. Overall, net revenues grew at 8.3 per cent in the quarter. After the sell-off it has a dividend yield of 5 per cent.There must, though, be a nagging doubt. Cigarettes, it turns out, are quite addictive. And younger people are failing to pick up the habit at all — high-tech or otherwise. Philip Morris’s overall cigarette units fell 5 per cent in the quarter; newer products failed to offset the decline. The nicotine withdrawal is on."
28;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2018-04-19T20:58:40Z;Philip Morris warning damps tobacco shares;Stock down 16% as results raise alarm over ecigarette and vaping strategy;Investors stubbed out shares in the world’s largest tobacco companies on Thursday after Philip Morris International warned that alternative devices may take more time to be embraced by consumers turning away from cigarettes. Philip Morris, the biggest listed tobacco company, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, fell 15.6 per cent, the worst day for its shares since becoming a public company in 2008, wiping $24.5bn from its market valuation. British American Tobacco slipped 5.4 per cent and Altria shares dropped 6.0 per cent. As more health-conscious consumers abandon traditional cigarettes, Big Tobacco has turned to ecigarettes, vaping and substitute devices in search of growth. However, Thursday’s results raised alarm bells over the strategy after a weak showing in markets such as Japan — which had been among Philip Morris’s most promising prospects.Japan has emerged as a battleground between tobacco companies that have used technology to develop alternatives to conventional cigarettes which the companies say are less harmful.The new generation come in two main varieties — ecigarettes which turn a nicotine-laced fluid into a vapour, and “heat not burn” devices that turn tobacco into a vapour, but do not burn it. Ecigarettes are banned in Japan but not the latter.Investors soured on tobacco stocks despite Philip Morris saying shipments of heated tobacco units more than doubled from a year ago but were down from the December quarter. In East Asia and Australia, which makes up three-fourths of Philip Morris’s heated tobacco volumes, the company shipped 7.3bn units, which was nearly 4bn shy of forecasts by analysts at Cowen & Company. Cowen said the result “seems to reflect a maturation in consumption in Japan”.André Calantzopoulos, chief executive of Philip Morris, admitted sales of its heated devices in Japan grew “less-rapidly than initially projected”. “We are now reaching more conservative adult smoker segments that may require, at least at first, slightly more time for adoption,” he said. Morgan Stanley said the comment “marks a noteworthy shift in tone” while Citi analysts said that as recently as [February] management was sounding extremely bullish. “Now we hear demand growth is slowing in Japan . . . this is much more important than the cut in the tax rate guidance.”However, Bonnie Herzog at Wells Fargo said it is just “entering a more mature phase” and this “doesn’t detract from its strong growth prospects globally”.Philip Morris has touted a “smoke-free future” with its so-called IQOS devices. However, the company is still awaiting a decision from the US Food and Drug Administration after the regulator in January rejected its claim that IQOS tobacco heating devices were less risky than cigarettes.Philip Morris’s cigarette shipments fell 5.3 per cent in the quarter. Revenues rose 13.7 per cent from a year ago to $6.9bn, shy of analyst expectations for $7.03bn, while net earnings fell to $1 a share, topping estimates for 90 cents.
29;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Philip Morris loses 16% in value in worst day since 2008;Disappointing sales as new devices fail to offset decline in cigarette smoking;Philip Morris shares were getting smoked on Thursday after the company behind Marlboro reported disappointing revenues as growth in its heated tobacco devices slowed and cigarette demand continued to decline.Shares in the company fell as much as 16.3 per cent to $84.86 and were headed for the worst single day performance since 2008. The fall wiped about $26bn from the company’s market valuation.Investors soured on the stock despite a guidance boost after Philip Morris said shipments of heated tobacco units, which the company has been betting on for growth, more than doubled from a year ago but were down from the December quarter, while cigarette shipments fell 5.3 per cent in the first quarter from a year ago. Combined shipments of cigarettes and its heated tobacco units fell 2.3 per cent year-on-year.“The investment case revolves around IQOS, and as recently as CAGNY (Feb. 21) management was sounding extremely bullish,” analysts at Citi said. “Now we hear demand growth is slowing in Japan, and 1Q mkt share in Japan (15.8%) and Korea (7.3%) was weaker than January (16.3% and 7.6%). For us this is much more important than the cut in the tax rate guidance.”At a time when health conscious consumers are abandoning traditional cigarettes, ‘Big Tobacco’ has turned to ecigarettes and vaping in search of growth. Philip Morris has touted its so-called IQOS devices, arguing that they heat tobacco rather than burn it, reducing the levels of harmful chemicals while maintaining a flavourful nicotine-containing vapour.Revenues rose 13.7 per cent from a year ago to $6.9bn, shy of analyst expectations for $7.03bn, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.Philip Morris noted “less-rapid-than-initially-projected growth in sales of devices to consumers in Japan” as the company tries to tap more conservative consumers that are slower to adopt its newer products and said cigarette demand weakened in Saudi Arabia amid higher taxes.“We expect the stock to be pressured this morning given the HeatStick volume miss in Japan, which we believe reflects IQOS entering a more mature phase of growth but which doesn’t detract from its strong growth prospects globally,” said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo.Net earnings fell to $1.56bn or $1 a share in the three months ended in March, compared with $1.59bn or $1.02 a share in the year ago period. That topped analysts’ estimates for 90 cents a share.Looking ahead, the company lifted its full-year earnings per share guidance to between $5.25 to $5.40 a share reflecting a lower full year tax rate of about 26 per cent and a more favourable exchange rate. Adjusting for that the company expects earnings of $4.72 a share.Philip Morris shares are down nearly 19 per cent year-to-date.
30;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2018-03-16T12:55:36Z;Big tobacco keeps tabs on growth of vaping;UK is second biggest ecigarette market but not everyone is convinced growth can last;Sweet smelling “vape” shops that sell electronic cigarettes and vapers puffing out clouds of fragrant white smoke have become common sights on UK high streets. As traditional cigarette smoking has become less fashionable and vaping more popular, big tobacco has muscled in on this once-niche scene.The number of smokers in the UK has been falling since 1974 and it is now the world’s second biggest vape market after the US. At the last count, there were about 8m smokers of regular cigarettes in the UK, but there were also 3m vapers, up from 700,000 in 2012.Tobacco companies have taken note. They started buying ecigarette companies more than a decade ago and now own the five top brands, according to research compiled for The Grocer trade magazine.At Philip Morris International, owner of brands such as Marlboro, ecigarette sales grew nearly 400 per cent between 2016 and 2017, to account for 5 per cent of total sales. Meanwhile, Nicandro Durante, chief executive of British American Tobacco, which owns brands including Lucky Strike, said earlier this year that sales of BAT’s “alternative” cigarette products are expected to grow to more than £5bn by 2022.As the number of cigarette smokers declines, analysts say, success in the ecigarette market is vital. But some have questioned whether this market really has the potential that the industry sees.After an initial surge, the rate of growth in UK vaping numbers is slowing: data from public health charity Action on Smoking and Health reports only 100,000 new vapers in 2017 compared with 800,000 in 2014, and the total number of UK ecigarette users has plateaued since 2016.Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, also asks if the prevalence of vape shops on UK high streets is genuine evidence of a boom, or “part of the death of the high street narrative”, with shops benefiting from rising vacancies that have pushed down rents.BAT and PMI point to two explanations for the vaping slowdown: first, public perception of ecigarettes is worsening. Compared with two years earlier, last year fewer people perceived them as significantly less harmful to health than smoking.Second, customers want new products, they say. Current products are “reaching their limits in terms of performance”, said David O’Reilly, BAT’s scientific and research and development director.Peter Nixon, UK managing director of PMI, said: “Everybody you speak to will have tried vaping now, and it’s not for everyone.”As such, product development is high on their agenda. “Heat not burn” cigarettes — which look similar to conventional cigarettes but warm rather than burn tobacco — have become popular in Japan but are still new to the UK, and could be a “game changer” said Mr Nixon.PMI has spent $4.5bn on research into “reduced risk products” since 2008.Perhaps more importantly for the industry, evidence so far suggests ecigarettes do not act as a “gateway” that leads to smoking, and those who have never smoked make up only about 3 per cent of UK ecigarette users.According to ASH, the most common reasons given for using ecigarettes are to cut down on or quit smoking.“In the very long term, it’s not a sustainable future if you’re not going to attract any new people in,” said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of ASH.Crucially, the number of young people taking up smoking is also declining.Smoking is “almost entirely an addiction of childhood”, said Ms Arnott, ”if you don’t get addicted then, you probably won’t.”The regular use of ecigarettes among children is rare and largely among current or former smokers, said ASH.Although people used to experiment with cigarettes, “the new wave of puritanism in the UK doesn’t seem to play that way”, said Steve Clayton, head of equity funds at investment management company Hargreaves Lansdown.“That does raise a long term issue,” he said, but “where we are today doesn’t necessarily say much about where we’ll be in five years’ time”.In the short to medium term, both BAT and PMI say they are confident the business is sustainable. With more than 1bn smokers worldwide, the majority of whom do not use ecigarettes, there is plenty of scope for growth, said Mr O’Reilly.“We’re trying to help the current generation of smokers,” he said. “I’m not concerning myself with 100 years’ time.”This article has been updated to state that PMI has spent $4.5bn on research into “reduced risk products” since 2008.
31;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2018-03-09T05:11:33Z;Saving the world’s watercolours one byte at a time;Iranian-born entrepreneur, Javad Marandi, is on a mission to digitise the world’s watercolours as part of conserving global history;"The world is awash with watercolours. As the British Empire expanded in the 19th century, the English planted their easels across the lands on which the sun would never set. Flora, fauna, landscapes — the watercolours depict an age gone by, stretching from Kuala Lumpur to Kingston-upon-Thames, from Islamabad to Ipswich.Many have been lost or, left to museums, have lingered in dusty backrooms. But for Javad Marandi, an Iranian-born entrepreneur, to leave the works to decay would be to erase a form of social history.“They were before photography,” he says. “They weren’t so much a form of art as a form of recording everything from flora and fauna to the landscapes. They were a very good documentation of how the world was and unfortunately, because of their very nature, they tend to deteriorate in quality as time goes by.”In attempt to preserve the works, this year Marandi — perhaps best known in the UK for his half-share in the Soho Group restaurant business as well as owning members’ club and hotel Soho Farm House in Oxfordshire — is funding The Watercolour World, a foundation dedicated to digitising watercolours across the globe. “Imagine having hundreds of thousands of images online for people who want to find out about Naples in the 1920s — they can see how history changes,” says Marandi, who is chipping in £400,000 a year.The project is the very definition of a Sisyphean task, given the millions of watercolours in existence, but Marandi is undaunted by the scale of the venture. “We’re starting with geographical locations, with Great Britain first,” he explains. “Then wherever we have connections and can gain access to the collections around the world.”Access has been boosted by the patronage of Prince Charles, a keen watercolourist himself, and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. “Once you have [their] patronage, the museums and organisations take you much more seriously [and] are much more willing to help and co-operate.”It is an intriguing venture for Marandi, whose property interests include the Sofitel hotel in Brussels and co-ownership of a CenterParc holiday park in Moselle, France. Yet his family’s history has been punctuated by periods of upheaval. In 1920, his grandfather, Alimorad, left the then Soviet republic of Azerbaijan as the Bolshevik revolution swept across the region. Then, almost 60 years later, in the wake of the Islamic revolution in Iran, Marandi — aged 11 — and his immediate family exchanged relative luxury in Tehran for a small flat in Notting Hill, west London.“It was very difficult; when I came to England couldn’t speak a word of English,” Marandi says. “We had never planned to live abroad, as this was a country with 2,500 years of history and it had always been a monarchy. Who would have thought that the monarchy would turn into some sort of . . . well, whatever the current government is.”I wonder then, playing armchair psychiatrist, if these experiences, both personal and those that have affected three generations of his family, have left him with a need for permanence, the need to ensure that these documents of the past are preserved in a way that his own history was not? “You never want it to be repeated ever again,” Marandi says. “So as much as possible, you try to stabilise your life. All we aim for in life is stability and the stability we want to give to our children.“It makes you a lot more risk averse,” he adds.The paintings weren’t so much a form of art as a form of recordingSure, I agree, but he certainly took many risks in establishing his career early on: how does that square with his position now?“Obviously at some point you have to take some risks in order to move forward,” he says, “but always consolidating. Everything is not on the line all the time — you become a lot more conservative. Obviously, at the beginning, you have nothing to lose, so you can pretty much risk everything.”We had first met late last year in the splendour of 5 Hertford Street, a private members’ club in London’s Mayfair. He had arrived with his friend Darius Sanai, a fellow Iranian exile in London, now editor-in-chief at magazine publisher Condé Nast, and immediately commandeered the table. We had shared similar experiences a few years apart in the Caucuses and, as the wine flowed, we swapped stories of living and working in what were, at times, very difficult conditions.Marandi’s story almost began in Turkey. He had applied for a finance job at Coca-Cola — “lied, you mean”, he laughs. “I was interviewed by 11 people in Vienna, but none of them spoke Turkish [a prerequisite for the job]. I speak Azeri, which while it shares certain roots with Turkish, is not the same language. But I thought if I get the job I’ll learn it in a month.”His ploy ended in his final interview with Muhtar Kent, the Turkish-American businessman who went on to become chief executive and chairman of Coca-Cola. Kent told him he was not going to offer him the position but, impressed by Marandi’s chutzpah, sent him instead to central Asia and the Caucasus. It was 1992 and Marandi was 24. He remained with Coca-Cola for two years, buzzing round Uzbekistan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, before being headhunted by tobacco group Philip Morris International.Those were turbulent times for the newly independent state of Azerbaijan, and after five years Marandi moved to form his own logistics business, distributing cigarettes and other consumer goods across the region.Today, he is known as an investor and property developer in the UK and continental Europe, with a house in London’s Eaton Square shared with his wife and three children. Interestingly, it is also stuffed with modern art — hyper-contemporary works that Marandi is gleefully happy to scorn, to the despair of his wife, Narmina.“She finds it very upsetting when I go into this spiel about value — the true value of this modern art. But I just don’t understand it; I think it’s a bubble. I don’t understand why certain paintings are worth tens of millions of pounds and all it is is three spots and some cuts on a canvas.”If he had his choice, Marandi jokes, there would be posters on the walls. “I would probably buy some of the Old Masters and I know that doesn’t sound right, but they are very much undervalued and supply is limited,” he says. “[Andy] Warhol was making 90 paintings a day — he was a like a factory — and some of the paintings were done by his friends. So I can’t for the life of me understand why one of those 90 made in a day is now worth millions.”This makes his decision to launch The Watercolour World all the more intriguing. Preserving watercolours is not about ensuring the art is saved for the next generation but about “recording history that we’re losing”, he says. “Historic events, scientific facts or the changes to the environment — this information, this visual information, we are losing and it’s a shame.“While we’re very excited about hip and cool and trendy stuff, instead with relatively little money we are preserving our history.”"
32;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Philip Morris, Altria hit by FDA advisory panel ruling on IQOS devices;Shares stabilise after an initial 5% stumble;Shares of Philip Morris International and Altria Group took a hit after a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel rejected Philip Morris’s proposed claim that its IQOS tobacco heating devices present less of a health risk than the traditional version.The findings of the independent panel could feed into a two-day FDA meeting due to conclude on Thursday, which could have wide-reaching implications for tobacco companies and public health writ large.Philip Morris contends its IQOS device, which heats tobacco rather than burning it, reduces most of the health concerns surrounding traditional cigarettes. Accordingly, the company has been seeking FDA approval in an attempt to market them as a safer alternative to cigarettes.The panel said on Thursday that Philip Morris had not shown that reductions in exposure to harmful chemicals are reasonably likely to translate into a measurable and substantial reduction in morbidity or mortality, Reuters reported. But the panel did support the company’s proposed claim its IQOS devices reduce exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals for those smokers who completely switch over from traditional products.The FDA may or may not follow the advisory panel’s finding.That mixed bag of rulings initially saw Philip Morris shares tumble as much as 6.9 per cent before stabilising 2.5 per cent lower at $107.86. Altria – which operates in the US through its Philip Morris USA subsidiary, the maker of Marlboro – was down 1.7 per cent at $70.38 after earlier falling as much as 5.5 per cent.FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb last year flagged the government agency would reconsider its tobacco policies, noting the role that “less harmful” tobacco products could play in reducing the death toll from cigarettes, and attempt to push smokers toward such alternatives.

Pan Ocean has been placed under observation to see if it should be banned for the same reasons. Atal, a Polish property developer, was also excluded due to human rights risks.The Norwegian fund has excluded more than 100 companies – including big names such as WalMart, Boeing, Philip Morris and Rio Tinto – for a variety of reasons as it aims to be seen as an ethical investor.Most of the exclusions are due to Norway’s parliament banning companies that produce certain things such as coal, parts for nuclear weapons, and tobacco. Some relate to individual corporate behaviour such as causing environmental damage.The exclusions led to sharp criticism from Orde Kittrie, a law professor at Arizona State University. He wrote in an article in the Wall Street Journal that the bans on the likes of Boeing, Honeywell, and Lockheed Martin related only to their involvement in producing nuclear weapons for the US – and that Norway, as a member of Nato, relied on that for its defence.He added:Rather than praise Norway, [US president Donald] Trump should be holding it accountable for how it chooses to spend – or not spend – the vast fortune it received from geography’s lottery. As a Nato member whose defence is subsidised by the US, Norway should not be investing in enemy governments [such as Iran] while undermining allies and American defence contractors.
34;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
35;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-12-08T16:42:55Z;Tony Garrett, tobacco industry leader, 1918-2017;The chairman of Imperial who pioneered the group’s sponsorship of sports and arts;In early June 1977, as Britain was preparing to celebrate the Queen’s Silver Jubilee, the chairman of Imperial Tobacco launched Operation Berkshire. Tony Garrett, who has died at the age of 99, hosted a secret summit of the world’s largest tobacco companies to formulate a defensive strategy against the anti-smoking campaigns that were persuading governments to restrict cigarette sales and advertising. The aim of the meeting, held under “tight security” at Imperial’s Shockerwick House near Bath, was “to develop a smoking and health strategy which would include an . . . agreement that no concessions beyond a certain point would be voluntarily made by members”, according to an internal memo by Hugh Cullman, president of Philip Morris. “Tony Garrett seemed to be most concerned that companies and countries would be picked off one by one.” That security was broken in 2000 when the British Medical Journal published a detailed paper about “the international tobacco companies’ conspiracy”, based on confidential documents filed by the industry in response to litigation by the US government. The BMJ authors concluded that the legacy of Operation Berkshire was a spurious “smoking and health controversy” that “greatly retarded tobacco control measures throughout the world”.Opponents of Big Tobacco see Berkshire as a key moment in the industry’s sustained fightback against government restrictions. For example, the Whitecoat Project in the 1990s attempted to create controversy about the health effects of second-hand smoke.Richard Anthony Garrett was born in July 1918, the son of a bank manager, and grew up in the Bristol area, joining Imperial Tobacco as a junior in 1936 at its Wills plant in the city. Apart from distinguished wartime service as an Army officer — including the D-Day landings in Normandy — he stayed with the company until his retirement in 1979. An outstanding feature of his leadership was Imperial’s pioneering sponsorship of events in sports and arts, which emerged as regulations were squeezing tobacco companies out of conventional advertising. Britain banned cigarette ads on television in 1965. Garrett — an enthusiastic sportsman who played rugby, cricket and golf — saw sponsorship as an attractive alternative route to promote tobacco products. He started with the John Player subsidiary, where he was chairman, before taking charge of Imperial Tobacco as a whole. Soon the brand’s logos were attached to the John Player Special cricket league, JPS Rugby League Cup and JPS Classic golf competition. Garrett was also a classical music lover — and led Imperial into extensive sponsorship of opera, ballet, orchestras and record production.His view of the evidence that smoking seriously damages health seems to have been ambivalent. He insisted in 1975: “A very great deal of top management time throughout the tobacco industry is devoted to the highly complex problems of smoking and health and to seeking a solution to them.” Personally he was a light smoker of Embassy cigarettes and occasional cigars. Garrett described himself in an interview with World Tobacco as “a gregarious sort of individual, noisy and extrovert”.Unfortunately Imperial’s most visible move to reduce the harm caused by tobacco failed under controversial circumstances. The company spent about £15m to develop New Smoking Materials, made from cellulose, which were blended with tobacco to produce a new range of safer cigarettes. Their launch in 1977 was a disaster, and Imperial quickly closed the NSM operation, burning the unsold cigarettes. Garrett put some of the blame on the government, for failing to promote the venture, which it had encouraged during earlier stages of research and development. He was particularly angry when the Health Education Council said switching to NSM cigarettes was like jumping out of a building “from the 36th floor rather than the 39th floor”. After retirement, he served as vice-chairman of the television company HTV and as a trustee of charities including the Glyndebourne Arts Trust and the Royal Opera House. His biggest charitable achievement was as president of the National Association of Boys’ Clubs, for which he raised £1m during the 1980s and was made a CBE. He married Marie Dalglish in 1946. After her death in 2000 the radio journalist Nancy Wise became his second wife. She survives him, as well as three children from his first marriage, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.clive.cookson@ft.com
36;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Marlboro maker Philip Morris slides after guidance cut, missed earnings;;Smokers are stubbing out their cigarette habits and that is proving to be bad news for Philip Morris International.The world’s largest publicly-listed tobacco company saw more than $7bn wiped off its market value in early trading on Thursday after it reported a 10th straight quarter of cigarette volume decline and cut its full year earnings outlook for a second time this year.PMI, which sells brands such as Marlboro and Parliament outside the US, said it now expects full-year diluted earnings per share to come in at between $4.75 to $4.80. That’s down from the $4.78 to $4.93 range it forecast in July and compares to the $4.84 to $4.99 guidance it gave six months ago.The weaker outlook comes as PMI continued to grapple with falling cigarette volumes in its third quarter. For the three months to end of September, shipments of traditional cigarettes fell 4.1 per cent to 198.5bn units, with all four of its regional geographic units posting declines. Volume of its flagship Malboro brand, which accounts for more than a third of group total, was down 6.1 per cent during the quarter.While the company has traditionally been able to offset this volume drop by raising cigarette prices, this strategy might been reaching its limits, with cigarette sales value dropping 3.6 per cent year-on-year to $6.5bn in the third quarter.Overall group revenue excluding excise taxes was up 7 per centat $7.5bn – below Wall Street estimates for $7.7bn – thanks to sales increases in new tobacco technology products (or so called “reduced risk products”). The small but growing unit saw sales jump to $947m, up from the $212m recorded in the prior year period.Net income eked out a 1.7 per cent increase to $1.97bn, or $1.27 per diluted share. That’s short of the $2.16bn and $1.384 per share the market was looking for.Shares in the $167bn company fell as much as 4.3 per cent before steadying to trade 3.7 per cent lower at $108.38.
37;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-09-19T04:01:54Z;Big tobacco sends out smoke-free signal;US crackdown adds urgency to improving meagre sales of alternatives to cigarettes;Can big tobacco quit smoking? After years of cigarette makers trumpeting their progress in building “reduced risk” alternatives, the US Food and Drug Administration’s July announcement that it aims to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes has injected urgency to the quest.So much so that Debra Crew, chief executive of Reynolds American, the second-largest American tobacco company, compares the challenge to the US space mission of the 1960s. “If we can put a man on the moon, we can deliver tobacco to people with less risk than smoking,” Ms Crew told her peers at an industry conference last week. Hours earlier, Philip Morris, maker of Marlboros, promised to spend $1bn to wean people off cigarettes. To the big tobacco executives gathered at the annual conference in New York, the message was clear.The FDA’s initiative could be the largest effort to curb smoking since 1965, when president Lyndon Johnson signed legislation requiring cigarettes to be labelled with health warnings. The news was perhaps deepest felt at London-listed British American Tobacco, the world’s largest tobacco group, which had just acquired Reynolds American for $49bn, buying its way back into the $130bn US market after a decade absence. The deal closed just three days before the FDA announcement, making the US its largest market. If they try to reduce nicotine levels to a very low amount . . . I think they’ll encounter a stiff wind in the face through the courtsKingsley Wheaton, BAT’s director of “next generation” products, says he was “not surprised” by the FDA’s announcement, which swiftly wiped about $10bn from BAT’s market value. “Was I surprised that it came at 3pm on a Friday afternoon?Maybe. But I wasn’t particularly surprised with the content,” he said in an interview, calling the market moves an “overreaction”. BAT, along with rivals such as Philip Morris, is in a race to offset shrinking cigarette sales with a new generation of products. These alternatives come in two main categories: ecigarettes, which turn a nicotine-laced fluid into a vapour, and “heat not burn” devices that turn tobacco into a vapour, but do not burn it. Tobacco companies have poured billions into development and marketing of these new products, with some success. Philip Morris in its most recent quarter reported that its IQOS “smokeless cigarette”, which heats tobacco in a handheld device, had sold enough to offset a 25 per cent drop in conventional cigarette sales in Japan. The company says it has invested $3bn since 2008 on smoke-free products, which it hopes will account for more than 30 per cent of production by 2025. “They have been trying to hedge their bets and cultivate new markets to save their business,” says Marc Scheineson, who worked on tobacco regulation as an associate commissioner for the FDA, and is now a partner at law firm Alston & Bird.But tobacco companies still derive the majority of sales from traditional cigarettes. Only 9 per cent of Philip Morris’s $6.9bn of revenues in the second quarter came from “reduced risk products”, and much of that came just from Japan. BAT has in the past six years spent $1.5bn on next gen products, yet it still declines to give revenue figures for them. Mr Wheaton says new products such as ecigarettes have a “public perception” problem, particularly in the US. A third of Americans last year said ecigarettes were just as bad as tobacco cigarettes, and 60 per cent said ecigarettes should be regulated as much as tobacco cigarettes. “We’ve seen perception [of vapour and heating products] in the US dwindle,” he says, blaming “sensational headlines” and bad marketing. “There are a lot of commercial questions still. Next gen products need to be profitable. This is not just an altruistic journey.”The FDA has not specified how much it aims to trim the nicotine levels from cigarettes, and is currently soliciting comments on what to do. The industry is expected to put up a lobbying fight, and perhaps launch litigation. “If they try to reduce nicotine levels to a very low amount . . . I think they’ll encounter a stiff wind in the face through the courts,” says Mr Scheineson. Mr Wheaton says it’s “quite possible” to trim US nicotine levels “a little bit”, noting that about half of cigarettes sold to Americans have 12mg of tar and 1.2mg of nicotine, while European cigarettes are capped at 10mg of tar and 1mg of nicotine.Still, “it’s not the nicotine that’s bad for you,” he argues, warning of a “large rise in illicit trade” as an unintended consequence of cutting nicotine.The public health debate over whether less nicotine will yield a reduction in smoking has been at a “complete and total stalemate” for decades, said Mitch Zeller, an FDA director, this week.There is also a question of whether investors can be convinced that American smokers will finally make the switch. In the past 20 years tobacco stocks have “significantly and consistently outperformed the broader market” despite a string of class action lawsuits and regulatory threats, said analysts at RBC. “But this time could be different.” This latest regulatory shock may not provide the same kind of lucrative buying opportunity as in the past, they said. Investors appear to agree. Eight weeks after the FDA unveiled its plans, the stock prices of the largest tobacco companies have not recovered. BAT had dropped about 11 per cent to 4,741p a share at the end of last week, while Philip Morris is down 2 per cent and Altria has lost 16 per cent.

39;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-09-13T03:05:43Z;Philip Morris pledges $1bn to stub out tobacco smoking;Cigarette group to fund research institute aimed at eliminating use around the globe;Philip Morris International has pledged up to $1bn over the next 12 years to an arm’s-length foundation that will fund scientific research designed to eliminate the use of smoked tobacco around the globe.The Swiss-based group, one of the largest cigarette producers, last week agreed to fund the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World as a US charitable organisation, with the stated aim of making grants on “how to best achieve a smoke-free world and advance the field of tobacco harm reduction”.It has appointed as head of the foundation Derek Yach, a former senior executive at the World Health Organisation (WHO) who led the development of its Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, an agreement between governments that helped impose advertising restrictions, tougher anti-smoking laws and higher taxes on cigarettes.The move will spark scepticism at a time when recent investigations have highlighted continued efforts to sell tobacco in developing countries, as well as lobbying to silence industry opponents and fight restrictions imposed by governments.A number of organisations have banned funding from tobacco companies or to researchers funded by the industry.Professor Linda Bauld of Sterling University, and Cancer Research UK’s prevention expert, said: “I’m very cautious. Amongst the transnational companies, PMI has been the most positive about harm reduction but it’s not going to happen quickly and it’s focused in the developed world. I’d prefer research completely independent from industry.”André Calantzopoulos, chief executive of PMI, told the Financial Times: “Our efforts are squarely focused on ultimately replacing cigarettes with smoke-free products, by offering the millions of men and women who continue to smoke a better alternative. We are standing at the cusp of a true revolution and look forward to the foundation’s objective review of our efforts and efforts of others.”In its latest sustainability report, published on Tuesday, the company acknowledged that cigarette smoking by 1.1bn people “causes serious disease” and said its objective was to stop selling cigarettes “as soon as possible”. It said it had invested $3bn since 2008 on smoke free products, and hoped that they would account for more than 30 per cent of its output volume by 2025.Mr Yach stressed that the foundation would be governed by independent trustees, legally independent of commercial influence and focused on shifting towards smoke-free tobacco as a way to reduce harm to smokers. He had previously helped develop WHO campaigns against obesity before joining Pepsi in efforts to reduce the salt and sugar in its products.He told the Financial Times: “I fully understand at a personal level I’m going to have to earn the trust of my colleagues. My motivation remains the potential in lives saved, which could not be bigger in any other area.”The foundation was formally registered as a tax-exempt foundation in Delaware last week, and its statutes say it will fund studies on the impact of reduced-risk products on health outcomes, scrutiny of activities of the industry and alternatives for farmers facing reduced demand for leaf tobacco.This article has been amended to clarify that PMI agreed to fund the foundation but did not register it.
40;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-08-02T13:56:26Z;Japan Tobacco loses ground to rivals in next-generation vaping;Group concedes BAT and Philip Morris have upper hand in heat-not-burn market;Japan Tobacco admitted on Wednesday that it has fallen behind international rivals in a battle to dominate the potential $10bn domestic Japanese market for next-generation vaping devices. JT, the world’s fourth-largest tobacco group by sales, has been struggling against a background of declining smoker numbers in Japan and an 8 per cent year-on-year drop in the company’s domestic operating profits in the first half of 2017. The company said it expected to sell 93bn cigarettes in Japan this year, down 12.4 per cent from 2016 and 3bn fewer than previously forecast in January as smokers switch to vaping.JT has lost ground to Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco after delays and supply bottlenecks with Ploom Tech, its belated entry into the Japanese market for devices that heat and vaporise tobacco rather than burn it. Restrictions on the use of liquid-based ecigarettes mean that Japan has become a prime global test market for the major tobacco groups to experiment with the so-called heat-not-burn (HNB) technology. It’s a pity we fell behind when [Philip Morris’s] IQOS and [BATs] Glo appearedThe ferocity of competition in the HNB category in Japan, say analysts, could be replicated in the US as regulators plan changes that would force nicotine in cigarettes to be reduced to a non-addictive level.“If the shift in demand accelerates from conventional cigarettes . . . to heat-not-burn tobacco vaporisers, the US might become a new source of demand for JT,” said Mizuho analyst Hiroshi Saji. JT’s loss of initiative in the Japanese HNB showdown is particularly acute in Tokyo, where-white collar salarymen have proved to be eager adopters of Philip Morris’s IQOS smoking system and where, frustratingly for JT, failure to meet early demand for the Ploom left the company settling orders by lottery. “It’s a pity we fell behind when IQOS and [BAT’s] Glo appeared,” said executive vice-president Hideki Miyazaki at an earnings briefing.JT now has considerable ground to cover as it attempts to replicate in vaping the huge domestic market share it has traditionally enjoyed in cigarettes.Philip Morris, which sells its IQOS nationwide in Japan and has sold at least 3m units since launch, has more than a year’s head-start in a market that analysts estimate could account for 25 per cent of Japan’s ¥4tn ($36bn) overall tobacco market by 2020.The company said earlier this year that the IQOS had already snatched a 12 per cent share of Tokyo’s cigarette market. Despite its lateness to the party, say analysts, JT’s Ploom could be a formidable opponent.“To date . . . IQOS has been the sole winner in Japan’s market for tobacco vaporisers,” said Nomura analyst Satoshi Fujiwara, “but we expect a major shake-up in the competitive environment.”JT’s Ploom, which requires tobacco leaves to be ground into a fine powder and sold in small plastic capsules, was initially released only in the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka and first appeared in Tokyo in June. Sales coverage will not extend to the whole of the metropolitan sprawl until the end of this year, and other cities, such as Osaka, will not see any until at least 2018. BAT, meanwhile, introduced its Glo device to Tokyo in early July via 8,000 outlets around the city. By the end of the year it will have pushed into Osaka and Miyagi prefecture.About eight months after introducing the Glo to the northern city of Sendai, says BAT, an estimated 25 per cent of traditional cigarette smokers had started using some form of tobacco-heating device.
41;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-07-31T10:33:55Z;Tobacco: smoke signals;Nicotine regulation may never happen, while ecigarette news is positive;"The Trump administration is making little legislative headway. But it can at least slash regulations with gusto. Surprising, then, that a government that has rolled back rules on power plant emissions should propose new ones on personal lung pollution.Shares in Altria have fallen 9 per cent and British American Tobacco by 7 per cent since the Food and Drug Administration said it aimed to reduce nicotine in cigarettes to lessen their addictive properties, while supporting new safer alternatives.The sell-off was not universal, however. Philip Morris International shares, after a brief dip in sympathy with the sector, ended up in positive territory on Friday. PMI, which sells Marlboro internationally after its spin-off from Altria in 2008, has an advantage; the Switzerland-based company can dodge the rules thanks to its focus outside the US. BAT, however, paid $49bn in January for the remaining stake in Reynolds American, maker of Newports and Camel.Yet the US is not such a hostile place for Big Tobacco. Altria’s sell-off, which went as far as 19 per cent at one stage on Friday, looks exaggerated. Even as the number of smokers in the US has continued to fall, industry revenues have risen thanks to higher prices. Last year volume sales fell 2 per cent to 263.4bn cigarettes, while the value rose 1 per cent to $94.4bn, according to Euromonitor International. BAT’s bet is still good. Of course the industry remains vulnerable to government intervention. But there is a long way to go before any new restrictions are implemented. The permissive attitude to ecigarettes, the other side of the proposal, is more likely to stick. All should benefit — but none more so than PMI, which possesses one of the most promising ecigarettes. Even before Friday, Wells Fargo estimated it would be enough to reverse declining revenues and more than double earnings growth. Rather than bask in its remoteness from the US, it can seize the moment."
42;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-07-30T16:21:19Z;Big Tobacco told to read FDA smoke signals on ecigarettes;US regulator aims to cut nicotine in cigarettes while encouraging vaping alternatives;For decades, tobacco groups have puffed along steadily, churning out their deadly product to smokers and delivering handsome dividends to shareholders. In recent years, however, they have been disrupted by new ways of getting a nicotine hit, such as ecigarettes. Some have embraced it, while others have been more cautious — but now US regulators have told all of them to sit up and take notice. The Food and Drug Administration fired a shot across the bows of the industry on Friday, signalling a potentially more permissive approach to those developing less harmful ways to take nicotine, while also warning Big Tobacco that it could be forced to strip its cigarettes of that same addictive substance.“We must recognise the potential for innovation to lead to less harmful products” said Scott Gottlieb, FDA commissioner, in a lengthy speech on the future of tobacco control. “We need to envision a world where cigarettes lose their addictive potential.” Although he did not say nicotine was harmless, he added: “The bigger problem is the delivery mechanism — how the nicotine gets delivered.”Following the FDA announcement, shares in British American Tobacco fell 7 per cent and Altria lost 10 per cent, wiping about $25bn from the combined market value of the two companies, which are the two biggest in the US.Cutting nicotine levels could in theory lead to a sharp fall in smoking, as suggested by a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2015. However, analysts say many questions remain. “What if people just smoked more to compensate for lower levels of nicotine?” said Vivien Azer, analyst at Cowen & Company. The tobacco companies, no strangers to legal battles, are likely to fight back with a “vigorous defence,” during the comment period, and perhaps even litigation, she said. “There are still a lot of unknowns . . . investor concern is not misplaced if the strictest reading of this announcement proves accurate.”“Never underestimate the lobbying power of the mighty tobacco industry,” said Mike van Dulken from Accendo Markets, adding that “the fine print suggests balancing regulation of existing products with encouraging innovation for future, less harmful options”. The FDA is concerned because smoking is the “leading preventable cause” of death in the US, responsible for one in five of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Smoking rates have fallen from 21 per cent of US adults in 2005 to 15 per cent in 2015, with higher than average levels among poor, disabled and less-educated Americans.Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the UK antismoking charity Action on Smoking and Health, said it was “far too soon” from a public health perspective to force tobacco manufacturers to sell only low-nicotine cigarettes today, since it would merely encourage a big expansion of the illegal market in cigarettes. “But if it’s a warning to the industry that this is coming down the tracks, that’s a different matter, because that’s a very effective nudge to business that they’ve got to get out of the old market and into the new,” she said.Such a shift could “significantly improve long-term profit growth and sector valuations”, said Owen Bennett, analyst at Jefferies. Tobacco companies trade at a discount to other consumer companies because of their “terminal growth rates”, he said, referring to the steady decline in the numbers of cigarettes sold as smokers quit. The FDA’s comments could help to remove some of the stigma around nicotine, and so could lead to the companies gaining non-smokers as customers, he said.The new generation of cigarette products come in two main varieties — ecigarettes which turn a nicotine-laced fluid into a vapour, and “heat not burn” devices that turn tobacco into a vapour, but do not burn it. The most outspoken of the tobacco companies has been Philip Morris International, which has talked about a “smoke-free future”, while its rival British American Tobacco has merely said that “consumers will decide” whether they want conventional cigarettes or the new alternatives.The essential briefing for decision makers on global healthOn Friday, Altria and BAT both welcomed the FDA’s acknowledgment of a continuum of risk. “Success will require transformative, innovative products and changing the conversation about tobacco harm reduction,” said BAT, while Altria warned it would be “fully engaged throughout this process”.The shift towards new products was particularly visible in PMI’s quarterly results earlier this month, which showed that its IQOS “heated tobacco” product had taken off in Japan. The number of conventional cigarettes PMI sold in Japan fell 25 per cent in a year, but the decline was more than offset by a rise in sales of tobacco for IQOS.Globally, Mr Bennett said PMI was “best placed” in the long run to take advantage of the shift to vapour products while BAT was also in a good position. Imperial Brands was restricted by its lack of heated-tobacco products, while Altria was “in a tricky spot”. He said it would find it difficult to keep as large a market share in the new categories as it does in the old, as it licenses its heated-tobacco product from PMI.

The move would affect approximately 3,300 jobs, it said.The announcement came as Starbucks came in shy of analysts’ targets for comparable-store sales growth, a key industry metric, for the quarter ending July 2.Global comparable sales increased just 4 per cent versus the 4.8 per cent expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Comparable sales growth in the Americas, Starbucks’ biggest market, rose 5 per cent.It underscored concerns about Starbucks’ sales growth, even as it looks to inject some momentum by expanding its global footprint beyond its home country.On Thursday, Starbucks announced that it had paid $1.3bn to buy out the remaining 50 per cent that it did not own of its East China venture — its largest single acquisition — which will give it full ownership of 1,300 stores in its fastest-growing market outside of the US.“Starbucks leveraged food and beverage innovation, an elevated in-store experience and personalised digital connections to our customers to deliver another quarter of record financial and operating performance, despite the softness impacting our principal sectors overall,” said Kevin Johnson, who replaced Starbucks co-founder Howard Schultz as chief executive in December.Philip Morris International, which sells the brands outside the US, fell 7.5 per cent before bouncing back to end the day 0.3 per cent up at $118.51 in New York.The FDA announced a regulatory plan to stub out tobacco related disease, including lowering the amount of nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels.“Although the announcement’s timing was unexpected this morning, we’ve long believed the FDA taking a more comprehensive approach toward nicotine was a natural next step,” said Bonnie Herzog at Wells Fargo Securities.“Overall, while viewed as a ‘negative’ for cigarette manufacturers, we believe this could prove to be an opportunity over the long term for reduced-risk products.”The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.1 per cent at 2,472, the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged up 0.2 per cent to 21,830 while the Nasdaq Composite moved 0.1 per cent lower to 6,374.
44;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-07-28T14:36:40Z;Tobacco shares fall as FDA eyes cutting nicotine in cigarettes;;Shares of tobacco companies tumbled on Friday as US regulators announced that they intend to “begin a public dialogue” about lowering nicotine levels in cigarettes to non-addictive levels, in an effort to stamp out tobacco-related diseases and deaths.Shares of Altria fell nearly 7 per cent, while Philip Morris International shares were down 3.8 per cent. Shares of British American Tobacco — which recently completed a $49.4bn deal to take over Reynolds American — registered a 3.3 per cent decline.The sudden fall came after the US Food and Drug Administration said that it would start soliciting input on exploring the pros and cons of cutting back nicotine in cigarettes in an effort to deter addiction.FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said:Envisioning a world where cigarettes would no longer create or sustain addiction, and where adults who still need or want nicotine could get it from alternative and less harmful sources, needs to be the cornerstone of our efforts – and we believe it’s vital that we pursue this common ground.
45;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-07-20T17:49:28Z;Philip Morris shifts sales to new tobacco products;A fall in cigarettes is being offset with a switch to ‘heat not burn’ sticks;Philip Morris International’s cigarette sales in Japan have fallen by a quarter in a year as smokers switched to “heat not burn” sticks, making it one of the starkest examples of the shift to supposedly safer tobacco products.In second-quarter results on Thursday, Philip Morris missed profit forecasts given falling demand for traditional cigarettes. Net income dipped 0.4 per cent to $1.78bn, or $1.14 a share, missing Wall Street forecasts of a rise to $1.9bn, or $1.22 a share. Shares dropped on the news.Second-quarter results showed a 4 per cent rise in revenue to $6.9bn, or 7 per cent at constant currencies, with falling cigarette sales partially offset by “reduced risk” products and price rises.Shipments of traditional cigarettes fell more than 7 per cent, following an 11.5 per cent decline in the first quarter of 2017, while shipments of alternative “heated units” rose to 6.4bn from 1.2bn in the same quarter last year.During the quarter, almost 9 per cent of Philip Morris’s worldwide revenues came from “reduced risk products”, compared with 1.8 per cent a year earlier, with much of this shift occurring in Japan.The biggest listed tobacco company, which makes Marlboro and L&M cigarettes, said on Thursday that cigarette volumes in Japan fell 25 per cent to 8.3bn in the second quarter of 2017 compared with a year earlier.Sales of the Marlboro-branded tobacco sticks that smokers insert into Philip Morris’s iQos device rose more than five times to 5.7bn units. That means that sales of the tobacco sticks more than outweighed the fall in cigarette sales — the combined figure rose 15 per cent to 14bn units.Japan has emerged as a key battleground between major tobacco companies that have developed technology as an alternative to conventional cigarettes that still tastes like one, but which the companies say is less harmful. Ecigarettes, which heat a nicotine-laced fluid into a vapour, are banned in Japan.Last month, Peter Nixon, Philip Morris’s UK chief, said that “products like iQos are the absolute game changer” because smokers who tried it were much more likely to switch, compared with ecigarettes. “One day we want to stop selling cigarettes,” he said.Philip Morris’s iQos device avoids burning tobacco, which it says is what produces the harmful substances that eventually kill many smokers. Instead it heats the tobacco to a temperature high enough to produce a nicotine-laced vapour that tastes like tobacco, but not high enough to burn it.
46;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-07-20T14:35:06Z;Philip Morris cuts guidance, shares get smoked;;Shares in cigarette giant Philip Morris International are getting smoked on Thursday.The world’s largest publicly listed tobacco company saw more than $6bn wiped off its market value at one point this morning after it reported a ninth straight quarter of cigarette volume decline and cut its earnings guidance for the year.PMI, which sells brands such as Marlboro and Parliament overseas, said it now expects full-year diluted earnings per share to come in at between $4.78 to $4.93, down from the $4.84 to $4.99 range it was forecasting just three months ago. The company, which reports in dollars but earns nearly all its revenue from outside the US, cited a bigger-than-expected “unfavorable currency impact” as the reason behind the downgrade.Foreign exchange headwinds will impact 2017 earnings by 14 cents per share — a 75 per cent increase from the 8 cents it had previously predicted, the company said.The currency woes come as PMI continues to grapple with falling cigarette volume during the second quarter. For the three months to end of June, cigarette shipment volume fell 7.5 per cent to 193.5bn units — marking its ninth consecutive quarter of decline — as an ever growing number of smokers continue to kick their cigarette habit.While it has traditionally been able to offset this volume drop by raising cigarette prices, investors have been increasingly questioning the limits of this strategy. This was underscored by the fact that the value of total cigarette sales actually fell 3.4 per cent to $6.3bn during the quarter.Overall group revenue managed to eke out a 4 per cent gain to $6.9bn – below Wall Street estimates for $7.1bn – thanks to sales increases in new tobacco technology products (or so called “reduced risk products”). The small but growing unit saw sales jump from $123m to $615m during the quarter.“To date, more than 2.9 million adult consumers have already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS,” said chief executive André Calantzopoulos, referring to the company’s flagship smokeless cigarette that has been described as a hybrid between analogs and electronic cigarettes.Net income dipped 0.4 per cent to $1.78bn, or $1.14 a share, also missing Wall Street forecasts of a rise to $1.9bn, or $1.22 a share.Shares in Swiss-based, US-listed PMI fell as much as 3.3 per cent in early trading before trimming those losses to trade 2.5 per cent down to $118.58. The stock, which offers a rich dividend, remains up nearly 30 per cent for the year. It hit a record a high of $123.55 last month and despite today’s sell-off still boasts a market cap of more than $187bn.
47;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Court orders Philip Morris to pay Australian government’s legal fees;;"An international court has ordered Philip Morris to pay substantial legal fees to the Australian government following the tobacco giant’s failed legal battle against plain packaging laws.
The ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which is based in Singapore, follows its landmark judgement in December 2015, which found Philip Morris’s challenge to the public health initiative amounted to “an abuse of rights”. This case was one of a series of legal challenges lodged by the tobacco industry to laws introduced in Australia, the UK and elsewhere which replace branded advertisements on packs with graphic health warnings.Philip Morris had challenged Australia’s claim for costs on the basis that it did not lose the entire case and that Canberra’s claim was unreasonable for “a legal team that consisted primarily with public servants”.The company argued Canada and the US had never claimed more than US$4.5m and Us$3m respectively in costs and fees.The court rejected these arguments and ordered Philip Morris to reimburse the federal government for an undisclosed percentage of the legal fees.Australia’s Fairfax Media reported the legal costs could be worth up to A$50m.Philip Morris was not immediately available for comment."
48;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-06-19T12:28:37Z;Philip Morris to build smoke-free tobacco product in Dresden;;Philip Morris International is dreaming of a smoke-free future.The world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company said it will invest $320m and create 500 jobs to build an 80,000 square meter manufacturing plant in Dresden, Germany, which it promises will be high-tech and smoke-free.The site, which will break ground later this year, will produce HEETS, or HeetSticks — the tobacco product used with the heating device IQOS.“Unlike cigarettes, IQOS does not burn tobacco. Instead it heats it to temperatures below combustion to generate a tobacco vapour that is satisfying to adult smokers,” the company explains.Philip Morris, which is behind the Marlboro brand, has spent $3bn over more than a decade to create IQOS. A pilot programme for selling it in three German cities last year went better than expected, prompting a nationwide roll-out and a need for more of the tobacco product.Dresden is the capital of Saxony, the easternmost province of Germany that fell behind the Iron Curtain and which is now trying to regain its reputation as a site of innovation and engineering excellence. The big German carmakers have made Saxony their home for major investments in electric cars.“I am particularly proud that PMI has decided to produce its most innovative consumable in Dresden, which will become a hub for the transformation of the tobacco industry and society at large,” said Stanislaw Tillich, prime minister of the state.
49;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-04-20T14:07:52Z;Philip Morris shares get smoked after earnings miss;;Philip Morris International, the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, saw more than $6.5bn sliced off its market value on Thursday after it delivered first quarter sales and earnings that missed analyst expectations.Shares in the Swiss-based but US-listed company fell as much as 4.4 per cent in early trading before recovering slightly to trade 3.7 per cent lower as investors question whether the group’s traditional go-to strategy of raising cigarette prices to offset volume decline has run its course.The number of smokers stubbing out their cigarettes habits has been steadily growing over the past decade and the trend was underscored by the 11.5 per cent slump in cigarette shipment volume PMI recorded during the first quarter.This along with headwinds from a strong dollar prompted net revenues, excluding excise taxes, to fall 0.3 per cent to $6.06bn during the period, confounding expectations for a rise to $6.47bn.Excluding sales gains generated by new tobacco technology products (or so called “reduced risk products”), the drop in revenue excluding excise tax generated by traditional cigarette products is even steeper at 6.6 per cent.Net income was up 3.9 per cent at $1.59bn. But on an adjusted basis, diluted earnings of 98 cents a share were estimates for $1.02.“Our results were in line with our previously communicated expectation of a relatively weak first quarter, due to lower cigarette volume — primarily related to low-price brands in specific markets where the impact on our profitability was limited — and certain timing factors,” said chief executive André Calantzopoulos.The sales and earnings miss overshadowed the move by PMI to raise its full year guidance. The company is now forecasting diluted earnings per share to come in at between $4.84 to $4.99 for 2017, up from the $4.70 to $4.85 range it had previously predicted, thanks to a one off tax benefit.PMI sells brands such as Marlboro and Parliament overseas. Despite Thursday’s losses, shares in the company are still up more than 12 per cent over the past 12 months amid renewed investor appetite for stocks that offer steady dividend streams.
50;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-02-16T05:01:48Z;Israel has high hopes for its nascent medical marijuana sector;Nation known for its tech start-ups is tapping a new field for growth;Israel has built world-class businesses in cyber security, agricultural technology and big data analysis. Now it has global ambitions in medical marijuana.Last week an Israeli government committee took the first step towards advancing legislation that would allow the export of medical marijuana products. Officials hope it will encourage new investment and innovation in the field and boost its agricultural sector.There are a number of Israeli companies aiming to tap this niche but growing industry. They range from farming groups, taking advantage of Israel’s sunny climate and relaxed regulatory environment for cultivating cannabis for medical use, to companies such as Syqe Medical.Start-up Syqe has developed a handheld inhaler, equipped with a disposable cartridge that dispenses marijuana in precise doses, down to the milligram.Israel’s Teva Pharmaceuticals, the world’s biggest maker of generic drugs, recently signed an agreement with Syqe to distribute its product in Israel. Philip Morris, the tobacco group, invested $20m in the company in early 2016 and is studying its technology as one way to reduce the danger caused to smokers of traditional tobacco products when they combust.Syqe’s inhaler has been in use for more than 18 months at Haifa’s Ramban hospital, where patients have been taking it for pain relief.“We’ve developed the world’s first meter-dose system for cannabis,” says Perry Davidson, Syqe’s chief executive. The company says it has identified the “therapeutic window” between psychoactivity — the feeling of being high — and pain relief.The medical marijuana sector is relatively new and prone to hype. It contends with concerns on how to measure doses and varying regulations around the world on how cannabis can be cultivated, tested and dispensed.Nonetheless, it is recording some early successes in testing on a widening range of ailments.Britain’s GW Pharma, a maker of marijuana-based medicines, has developed a cannabis-based multiple sclerosis treatment, Sativex, which is approved for use in more than 29 countries. It recently announced that its drug Epidiolex had succeeded in reducing epileptic seizures in its first significant clinical trial.Israel’s head start in the field, like many of its other new industries, had a basis in academic research. Raphael Mechoulam, a chemist at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, was a pioneer in isolating cannabinoids, the group of active compounds present in cannabis.According to iCAN (Israel Cannabis), a private research and investment group that sponsors an annual conference on medical marijuana, Israel has about 50 companies operating in the field.“We are a significant player in the cannabis space,” says Saul Kaye, iCAN’s founder and chief executive.Israel’s rightwing government is promoting the sector, as it has other new technology industries, as a way of creating jobs and spurring investment.The Jewish state allows producers of medical marijuana to conduct clinical trials, in contrast with the US, where testing medical cannabis on humans is forbidden.“I think that Israel enjoys both the agricultural knowledge that is needed in order to grow marijuana, and the biotech knowledge that can improve the needed medical marijuana specifications,” says Yoav Kisch, an MP with Benjamin Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party who sponsored the bill. “This could be a very strong, good business for the Israeli agriculture industry, which has many difficulties today.”Another Israeli medical company, Breath of Life Pharma, known as BOL Pharma, has developed a range of ways to deliver cannabis, including tablets that dissolve under the tongue and inhalers. This year the company is conducting or planning more than a dozen phase-two clinical trials of the drug to treat conditions ranging from Tourette’s syndrome and autism to Parkinson’s and chronic liver disease.It is also building a factory in Jerusalem to purify and separate cannabinoids that it plans to open up to European and other companies that wish to conduct clinical trials.“This is ‘high’ high tech,” says Tamir Gedo, BOL Pharma’s chief executive.Drug companies say it is still too early to say whether medical marijuana will take off in earnest. One concern is that it is difficult to calibrate dosage because strength varies from batch to batch, and the use of substances such as pesticides make it difficult to produce regulated pharmaceuticals.Kalytera, another Israeli company, is seeking to circumvent the concerns by producing a synthetic drug that it is testing on patients suffering from graft versus host disease, which afflicts some people who undergo bone marrow transplants.“You have total control over all the aspects of the synthesis, so you know every patient will get a dose that’s understood — and a limitless supply,” says Andrew Salzman, the company’s chief executive.
51;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2017-01-10T05:38:06Z;Big Tobacco’s technology battle heats up;Groups look to a future more closely aligned to Silicon Valley than Marlboro Country;In 1847, Philip Morris, “tobacconist and importer of fine seegars”, opened a small shop on London’s Bond Street. On nearby Wardour Street, nearly 170 years later, the store that bears his name is selling something quite different.A “tech guru” guides customers around the gadgets on display, while a colleague offers others a tutorial of the company’s latest product. “This is not a cigarette,” he says, producing a stick, about half the size of a regular cigarette and poking it into a pen-shaped contraption. “It’s not a vaping device either,” he adds, before taking a puff.Tobacco companies have spent billions in recent years in search of the industry’s holy grail — a cigarette that causes less harm, but which has the look and feel of the real thing. In its iQos “smokeless cigarette”, which heats tobacco in a small, handheld device to about 300C, Philip Morris International, thinks it may have found the answer.It might not have cracked the code just yet — “It’s like smoking a hot cross bun,” says one smoker who tried iQos — but analysts say PMI is winning the race to produce heat-not-burn products. And they say the category is “a key catalyst” for consolidation in the tobacco industry, describing it is one of the driving forces behind British American Tobacco’s $47bn offer for rival Reynolds. According to reports, the deal is stalling over the valuation of the technology.Owen Bennett, analyst at Jefferies, says that alongside Reynolds’ US cigarette business, “the added incentive for BAT is access to Reynolds’ Revo V2 heat not burn technology”. In a recent note to clients he said the technology “will be important to keep pace with Philip Morris in the race for global vapour share”.Indeed, André Calantzopoulos, chief executive of PMI, says he is preparing for the day when his company, the maker of Marlboro which had revenues of $26bn last year, will stop selling traditional cigarettes. But transforming the structure and mindset of a business that has remained virtually unchanged for decades is not easy.“Many people have asked the question, why disrupt our business?” says Mr Calantzopoulos. The tobacco industry is moving from a time-tested model — selling easy to make, addictive products and increasing revenues through incremental price rises — to something far less certain.“We are having to work more like a consumer electronics business,” says Kingsley Wheaton, head of next-generation products at BAT. “This has meant we have hired talent from other consumer goods, electronics and pharmaceutical companies.”In addition to new staff, tobacco groups are moving from a straightforward manufacturing process to one heavily reliant on expensive research and development. PMI has invested $3bn-plus on its “reduced risk products” to date, and BAT more than £500m.“If you have a product, and you can offer a better product to consumers, you have to do it,” says Mr Calantzopoulos. “It also makes business sense. Both short and long term, I believe there will be a lesser tax burden on this product.” He predicts that reduced risk products will add “$700m-$1.2bn to the company’s bottom line” by 2020.The “gurus”, customer service desks and the personalisation options and accessories soon to be launched for the iQos all hint at a future more closely aligned to Silicon Valley than Marlboro Country. The iQos slogan — “This changes everything” — lifted from Apple, is another indication of the company’s inspiration for its approach.And just like a tech company, Mr Calantzopoulos is well aware that competition may come from unexpected sources. “I don’t think we’ll be inventing everything,” he says. “There will be a lot of creativity and innovation coming from start-ups.” He adds that the company runs a scouting programme to spot promising technology in fledgling businesses, and has an investment fund to take positions in these groups.PMI has further inventions of its own planned, including a device that is lit like a normal cigarette, but which again heats rather than burns the tobacco. A carbon tip on the end of the cigarette is ignited, and this warms the tobacco.While ecigarettes make up a tiny percentage of tobacco sales, the signs are promising.Research for Public Health England into ecigarettes shows vaping products are 95 per cent safer than traditional cigarettes, while according to PMI products like iQos release up to 95 per cent fewer chemicals than conventional cigarettes.Yet, Big Tobacco faces an uphill battle to convince consumers that this time, it means it when it claims its products are safe, or at least carry a reduced risk. Tobacco groups have paid out hundreds of billions of dollars to settle claims they misled the public about the dangers of smoking.Mr Calantzopoulos is unfazed. “There is a deficit of trust in the tobacco industry,” he acknowledges. “I’m not asking you to believe me — I’m asking you to verify the data.”Its huge investment into research and product testing are proof that Big Tobacco has moved on from the lies of yesteryear, according to PMI. “I cannot change the past,” says Mr Calantzopoulos. “But I can do something about the future.”
52;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2016-10-18T11:39:50Z;PMI ekes out revenue growth amid higher cigarette prices;;Tobacco giant Philip Morris International on Tuesday reported a small uptick in revenue for the third quarter of 2016, as higher cigarette prices helped offset weaker sales volume and took some of the sting out of the strong US dollar.The New York-based company, which was spun off from Altria in 2008 and sells well-known cigarette brands like Marlboro outside the US, saw net income for the three months to end of September edged down 0.2 per cent to $1.93bn, or $1.25 per diluted share compared to the same quarter in 2015.Excluding unfavorable currency pressures, it said adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 4 cents, or 3.2 per cent. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had projected earnings of $1.23 per share.Cigarette shipment volume continued to slide as consumers become ever more health conscious or move towards electronic cigarettes, and ended the third quarter down 5.4 per cent.However, this was offset by stronger pricing. Net revenue excluding excise taxes was up 0.8 per cent from last year to $7bn in the third quarter, just managing to top the expected $6.97bn.The company maintained its full-year earnings forecast of $4.53-$4.58 a share, versus $4.42 in 2015, and chief executive André Calantzopoulos said he was “confident” it would meet that goal in spite of the “temporary volume weakness this quarter.” He said the company also is encouraged by strong growth in its reduced-risk category of products, including its HeatSticks – which heat rather than burn tobacco – which reached a 3.5 per cent market share in Japan last quarter.It’s been a rather tough year for PMI, which has seen its global cigarette shipment volume fall 4 per cent during the first nine months of the year, and net revenues, excluding excise taxes, fall 3.4 per cent to $19.7bn. Without pressure from currency headwinds, net revenues minus excise taxes are up 2.5 per cent during the first nine months of 2016, the company said. The company’s stock was flat during pre-market trading at $95.51.
53;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2016-09-29T06:45:02Z;Imperial pinched by new tobacco rules, but still ‘on track’;;Imperial Brands, the UK’s second-largest tobacco company by revenues, has been squeezed by new regulation of tobacco packaging, including plain packets in the UK and new EU rules requiring larger health warnings and banning flavoured cigarettes.Imperial, whose brands include Winston, Gauloises and Golden Virginia, said in a trading update:The benefit from price increases has been offset by a combination of adverse mix, particularly in the UK, EU Tobacco Products Directive investment and the conclusion of distribution for Philip Morris International in the UK and Morocco.Imperial received a blow in May when the London High Court rejected an appeal launched by tobacco companies against plain cigarette packaging in the UK.Some of the world’s largest tobacco companies had opposed the move, including Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International.The EU delivered another black eye in May with its “Tobacco Products Directive Update”, requiring larger health warnings, banning flavoured cigarettes such as menthol, and delivering a slew of strict new rules, for example:Cigarette packs must have a cuboid shape to ensure visibility of the combined health warnings. Slim packs and other irregular shaped packs will no longer be allowed. Packs containing less than 20 cigarettes are also banned. Packs of 10, which are particularly appealing to young age groups with limited spending power, will therefore, disappear from the marketImperial said today that “the full year trend for total tobacco volumes is broadly in line with the first half”, during which it fell 3.1 per cent.But it insisted it is “on track to meet full year expectations at both constant currency and reported exchange rates”, adding:We have delivered strong growth in reported tobacco net revenue for the year driven by the US acquisition and the benefit of currency translationIt also highlighted a 4-5 per cent boost to full year earnings from currency moves as a positive.The company pointed to disruption in Iraq and Syria as a drag on growth both during the last quarter of 2015 and during the first half of 2016.

The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund put Duke on its list of more than 110 companies that it will not buy shares in, which includes Airbus, Boeing, Philip Morris, Rio Tinto and Wal Mart. The oil fund backed a recommendation from Norway’s council of ethics — an independent body that reviews corporate behaviour — that Duke had “repeatedly discharged harmful substances from a large number of ash basins at coal-fired power plants in North Carolina”. The Norwegian fund is one of the most influential investors in the world, owning on average 1.3 per cent of every listed company globally, and its decisions on which businesses to exclude are often followed by other shareholders. The fund owned a 0.62 per cent stake in Duke — worth $304m — at the end of last year but sold all its shares before announcing the utility’s exclusion from its investment universe, as it typically does. Duke had been lobbying the fund to avoid being banned under Norway’s attempts to exclude any company deriving more than 30 per cent of its business from coal, according to local press reports from the US. But the council of ethics instead centred in on the ash basins.It said in April it was recommending the fund exclude Duke Energy and three subsidiaries “due to the unacceptable risk of these companies being responsible for severe environmental damage”.“For many years, these companies have among other things repeatedly discharged environmentally harmful substances from a large number of ash basins at coal-fired power plants in North Carolina,” it added.Several court rulings have ordered Duke and the subsidiaries to remove or seal the ash basins, but the measures would not be completely carried out for 10 to 15 years, said the council.Norway’s oil fund was among the first state-backed investors to name publicly the companies it was excluding.It started more than a decade ago, focusing initially on the makers of arms such as anti-personnel landmines, cluster munitions and nuclear weapons.The oil fund added tobacco producers in 2009 and coal companies this year. Duke said: “It is unfortunate that [the oil fund] did not consider Duke Energy’s proactive actions to enhance our environmental stewardship and close ash basins across our jurisdictions.”
55;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2016-09-07T13:11:59Z;Norway oil fund excludes Duke Energy over environmental fears;;Another company bites the dust at Norway’s gargantuan $900bn oil fund.The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday that it would exclude Duke Energy, the US utility, and three subsidiaries from its portfolios due to the risk of severe environmental damage, writes Richard Milne, Nordic Correspondent.Duke had already been lobbying the oil fund to avoid being banned due to its coal-fired power plants, according to local press reports.Instead, the Norwegian fund backed a recommendation from the country’s council of ethics – an independent body that reviews corporate behaviour – that Duke had “repeatedly discharged environmentally harmful substances from a large number of ash basins at coal-fired power plants in North Carolina”.The council added that, despite several court decisions ordering Duke and its subsidiaries to remove or seal the ash basins, the measures would not be completely implemented for 10-15 years.The oil fund owned 0.62 per cent of Duke at the end of last year, equivalent to $304m. It typically sells its stake before announcing the exclusion decision.Duke joins more than 110 companies that are excluded from the oil fund’s portfolios including producers of tobacco and nuclear weapons as well as companies deriving more than 30 per cent of their business from coal. The companies include Airbus, Boeing, Philip Morris, Rio Tinto and Wal Mart.Duke did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
56;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2016-07-08T21:49:58Z;Uruguay defeats Philip Morris test case lawsuit;Tobacco group was suing tinySouth American country for its strict regulations on smoking;Uruguay has won a landmark lawsuit against Philip Morris International, which was suing the South American country for its strict regulations on smoking in what was seen as a test case for the tobacco industry.Friday’s decision sets an important precedent for other countries considering implementing similar legislation, with anti-tobacco campaigners accusing Philip Morris of using litigation to scare others from following Uruguay’s example. “The attempts of the tobacco companies have been roundly rejected,” said Uruguay’s President Tabaré Vázquez, an oncologist who has made the fight against tobacco one of his flagship policies. “It is not acceptable to prioritise commercial considerations over the fundamental right to health and life,” he added in a televised address to the nation. In its lawsuit at the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which marked the first time a tobacco group had taken on a country in an international court, Philip Morris argued that Uruguay had violated terms of a bilateral investment treaty with Switzerland, where it has its headquarters in Lausanne. The world’s biggest tobacco company — whose annual revenues of more than $80bn across 180 countries far exceed Uruguay’s gross domestic product of closer to $50bn — claimed that a 2009 anti-tobacco law damaged its intellectual property rights and hit sales. Philip Morris — which has lost lawsuits in Norway, Australia and the UK — opposed the Uruguayan anti-tobacco law’s requirements that graphic health warnings cover 80 per cent of both sides of cigarette packets, and that brands have a single image, thereby prohibiting sub-brands such as Marlboro Red or Marlboro Gold. That forced Philip Morris to withdraw seven of its 12 brands from shops in Uruguay. “We’ve never questioned Uruguay’s authority to protect public health,” said Marc Firestone, general counsel at Philip Morris, who clarified that the company had been complying with the regulations at issue in the case for the past seven years. “The arbitration concerned an important, but unusual, set of facts that called for clarification under international law, which the parties have now received,” he added. This case will help embolden more nations to take actions that will save livesSome observers have remarked on the apparent irony that in 2013 Uruguay legalised marijuana, which is due to start being sold in pharmacies this month, while at the same time it is clamping down on tobacco. But others say that Uruguay’s trailblazing efforts to regulate marijuana and tobacco are consistent, arguing that both industries are insufficiently controlled. “This is a major victory for the people of Uruguay — and it shows countries everywhere that they can stand up to tobacco companies and win,” said former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who provided Uruguay’s lawsuit with financial support. “No country should ever be intimidated by the threat of a tobacco company lawsuit, and this case will help embolden more nations to take actions that will save lives,” he added. According to health ministry figures, the number of Uruguayans who smoke had fallen to 22 per cent of the population by 2014, from 35 per cent in 2005. The number of young smokers fell to 8 per cent in 2014, from 23 per cent in 2006, when Uruguay became the first country in the region to ban smoking in enclosed public spaces.

But these deals do not have to be renewed until at least 2022.14mCigarettes belonging to PMI were seized in 2014 — 85% lower than in 2006The number of cigarettes seized under the scheme has dwindled in recent years. In 2014, only 14m cigarettes belonging to PMI were seized — an amount that would fit into two shipping containers. This was 85 per cent lower than 2006.Luk Joossens, a tobacco control expert at the Association of European Cancer Leagues, welcomed the decision. “It was not worth working with industry,” he said. “There is always suspicion from other countries because the EU collaborates with industries.”PMI, along with others in the industry, launched an unsuccessful legal challenge in the EU’s highest court against the new rules on tobacco, which require strict tracing requirements of tobacco sales and ban certain types of cigarettes.There is always suspicion from other countries because the EU collaborates with industriesBart Staes, a Belgian MEP who had argued against the renewal, said: “With Philip Morris and others having taken an unsuccessful legal challenge against the recently-agreed EU tobacco rules, it would have been inappropriate to conclude a parallel new bilateral agreement with the industry in this context.”PMI, which had indicated that it wanted the arrangement to continue, said: “What matters most for us is that the supply chain control measures contained within it will remain an integral part of how we do business in the EU and around the world. With or without the agreement, our commitment to fight illegal trade around the world remains intact and stronger than ever.”
58;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2016-05-20T21:03:32Z;Court stubs out fight against plain packaging for cigarettes;Cigarette companies forced to use dull olive packs with all branding banned;"It is more than 50 years since Marlboro Man disappeared from British television screens, and 13 since he vanished from billboards and newspapers. But Friday brought the final blow.After a last-ditch high court challenge failed, all cigarettes manufactured for sale in the UK must now be boxed in a dull olive packet with large graphics warning of the dangers of smoking.The muddy hue of the box is the least appealing colour that researchers could find and was copied from Australia, which already has plain packaging.In addition to banning all branding, the law also forbids “lipstick” packs and other innovative ways of opening the box. The name of the brand and type of cigarette must be printed in the same, small white font. From a distance, it will be impossible to tell the packs apart.This poses a problem for big tobacco companies and small independent retailers alike. Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International, who brought the challenge, all argue that they are being deprived of their intellectual property without compensation.They also fear a hit to profits as customers turn to cheaper brands. “A lot of the premium of a pack is in the brand,” said Martin Deboo, consumer goods analyst at Jefferies. “If a pack of cigarettes is only distinguished by taste or price, people may downtrade, and in a market like the UK, with fixed taxes per pack, that risks shrinking the profit pool.”The Department of Health itself acknowledged in its final impact assessment that “standardised packaging reduces the ability of tobacco manufacturing firms to sustain sales of higher-priced products relying on brand characteristics”.Retailers of tobacco, such as supermarkets and convenience stores, are also worried. Downtrading will cost UK retailers £90m over the next 10 years, according to the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, with a further £500,000 loss coming from increased waiting times and slower sales as shopkeepers try to locate the cigarettes, no longer able to distinguish a Camel from a Silk Cut purely by pack design.“Of course it will hit sales,” says Kamal Patel, owner of News Studio, a convenience store in Borough, London. “At the moment, it takes me about five seconds at most to serve someone a packet of cigarettes. Once plain packets arrive, that will be nearer 30, and people at the back of the queue will start getting restless and leave.“The tobacco companies will be fine — they’ve got a massive market in Africa where there are no laws against packaging, and here they’ve got huge margins on eliquids. But no one cares about the retailers.”Shopkeepers have 12 months to sell off all remaining stock but, as of this week, all new cigarettes produced must be boxed in the plain packaging. The standardised packets are set to arrive in stores over the coming months; from May 2017, retailers will not be allowed to sell tobacco in the old branded packets.The tobacco companies will be fine — they’ve got a massive market in Africa where there are no laws against packaging, and here they’ve got huge margins on eliquids. But no one cares about the retailersThe court ruling comes as big tobacco companies battle swaths of new regulation designed to curb smoking rates. This month, a new EU law that will ban the sales of packs of 10 cigarettes and outlaw flavourings such as menthol was upheld.Another law that bans the advertising of ecigarettes and limits the size of the liquid tanks in the devices was also upheld, targeting a revenue stream that tobacco companies are banking on.Before this week, Australia was the only country to have introduced plain packaging. It claims that it is having the desired effect, with a “statistically significant” fall in smoking prevalence of 0.55 percentage points since being introduced. Big tobacco groups counter that the decline is in line with a general downward trend.But while tobacco companies and retailers bemoan the decision, it has been celebrated by health campaigners. “The tobacco industry put up every excuse to stop the introduction of plain packaging,” said Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation. “But not one was more powerful than the fact their glitzy packaging lures children to smoke an addictive product that kills half of its long-term users.”Eight types of Gauloises cigarettes are on offer for sale at Le Derby, a 1960s-era bar in Paris’s business district.An entire wall of the brown-and-orange bar, with its chrome light fittings, is dedicated to smoking, with seven types of John Player Special, a collection of Fine 120s, Pall Mall, Peter Stuyvesant and Rothmans.The counter, according to the staff, sells between €5,000 and €6,000 in cigarettes a day. No one is impressed by the plain packets that are being introduced in France, as well as the UK.“The neutral packaging will definitely affect sales,” said one employee, who asked not to be named, as he attended to a steady trickle of afternoon trade. “It is a terrible idea.”Marisol Touraine, the French health minister, says that the packets will counter an alarming rise in youth smoking, with a quarter of 15-year-olds now regular smokers, according to the National Committee against Smoking.The health ministry estimates that about 13m of France’s 66m population smokes every day. Smoking is also the number one cause of death, claiming 73,000 lives a year.But Jason Bitor, a 25-year-old student in central Paris, believes the cosmetic changes will have little impact on smoking habits. “What is important is the nicotine,” he said, holding up a smouldering cigarette, admiring it for a moment and then exhaling clouds of smoke.Elisa Bulbulyan, who was also enjoying an afternoon smoke, agreed. She is unfazed by the prospect of the harrowing pictures on the packet, which have long been a feature of cigarette packaging in France. “We have seen it all before,” she said.Le Derby sells coffee, beer, Zippo lighters and lottery tickets to a clientele comprised mainly of construction and service workers. There is even a postcard stand in the corner with outdated pictures of the Arc de Triomphe.But people come mainly for cigarettes. Daniel Schuhmacher, a retired upholsterer, has come for 1637, a French pipe tobacco whose brown packaging boasts tabac 100%. “I buy it because I think it is less dangerous,” he said.Mr Schuhmacher, who smoked cigarettes for 40 years and said he thinks about giving up with each new day, believes people will soon ignore the new, neutral packaging. “It will not make any difference at all,” he said.Mr Bitor agreed. “It is a sociable thing to do and it is cool,” he says. Then he smiles for a moment and adds: “It is also very French.” Adam Thomson in Paris"

They argued that the “drab” new cigarette packaging would eliminate the attractiveness of their brands and that consumer brand loyalty would be diminished.They also told the High Court in a hearing last year that the ban would be ineffective in cutting smoking rates.Mr Justice Green rejected all the arguments put forward by the companies. He noted there was a “significant moral angle” to the new regulations, “which is about saving children from a lifetime of addiction and children and adults from premature death and related suffering and disease”.The judge said that in the UK 600 children each day are encouraged into smoking and are future customers of the tobacco companies, placing a “vast financial burden on the state in medical and care costs”.Deborah Arnott, chief executive of antismoking group Action on Smoking and Health, welcomed the ruling.“This landmark judgment is a crushing defeat for the tobacco industry and fully justifies the government’s determination to go ahead with the introduction of standardised packaging,” she said. “Millions of pounds have been spent on some of the country’s most expensive lawyers in the hope of blocking the policy.”Japan Tobacco said it planned to appeal against the decision, adding that some industries must now fear that their branding is under threat from political opportunism.Daniel Sciamma, UK managing director of Japan Tobacco, said: “We will continue to challenge the legality of plain packaging. The fact remains that our branding has been eradicated and we maintain that this is unlawful.”Imperial, the biggest seller by volume of cigarettes in the UK, said legal action was a “last resort” but that the companies had been “left with no option than to defend our intellectual property rights in court”.Philip Morris argued that plain packaging had not reduced smoking levels in Australia, the only country to adopt the policy, while Japan Tobacco also said the industry should not be deprived of its brand property. BAT told the court that it was not properly consulted before the vote in parliament on the new laws.Tobacco companies have said that since the introduction of plain packaging in Australia smoking has increased among young people and prompted smokers to buy cheaper cigarettes instead of quitting altogether.A challenge against plain packaging in Australia failed because tobacco groups could not prove the government had benefited from their intellectual property loss. But under UK law, companies were not required to prove that the government benefited from the policy, just that property rights had been removed.The tobacco companies used EU legislation including the Human Rights Act and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights to help argue their case.James Eadie QC, representing the government, told the court that the companies’ tobacco products “are the only legal consumer products in the world that cause half of their long-term users to die prematurely”.But he added that the regulations were lawful and that standardised packaging was “highly likely to reduce both uptake and prevalence of smoking, and thus will have a positive impact on public health”.The government argued that trademarks are being controlled, not removed altogether.

However Mr Justice Green wholly rejected their legal challenge on Thursday, saying the new government rules were “suitable and appropriate”.Handing down his ruling, he added the companies had no right to compensation as they engaged in activities “which impose vast cost on the state” in terms of public healthcare.MPs voted last year to ban logos from cigarette packs after a review last year concluded it was “highly likely that standardised packaging would serve to reduce the rate of children taking up smoking and implausible that it would increase the consumption of tobacco.”The new rules are due to change tobacco packaging on Friday and mean cigarettes can only be sold in plain green or dark brown packets. From this date all tobacco products manufactured for sale in the UK must comply with the new laws although there is a one year transitional period for the sell-through of old stock.JTI said it intends to appeal the rejection of the appeal, claiming:Plain packaging will not have the claimed effect on smoking rates. This has now been proven in Australia where smoking rates have not been positively impacted by plain packaging and the black market has grown.In addition this decision sets a dangerous precedent for intellectual property rights and investment. Other consumer goods industries must now worry that their branding is under threat from political opportunism, rather than examining the evidence.Daniel Sciamma, UK managing director at JTI, said:We will continue to challenge the legality of plain packaging. The fact remains that our branding has been eradicated and we maintain that this is unlawful.

That was the last year cigarette brands were allowed to sponsor sports events. Since then, total returns from British American Tobacco shares have beaten the FTSE All-Share index by more than 400 per cent.Rewind to February 2003, when tobacco advertising was banned, and the outperformance is even starker. Granted, they were oversold to start with, but net profit growth at BAT has averaged 17 per cent a year too. It seems investors need not fear the next war on tobacco: plain packaging.In late 2012, Australia became the first country to force cigarette makers to replace branding with images of diseased lungs and gangrenous feet. Since then, volumes are little changed, but consumers have switched to cheaper brands. It is hard to attribute this all to packaging, though — tax hikes, a slower economy and a price war helped.France, the UK and Ireland will introduce plain packaging on May 20. (subject to a UK legal appeal). None is material to BAT’s profits; Imperial Brands, Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris are slightly more exposed.Stricter regulation and higher taxes will eventually spread to developing markets, which generate much of tobacco companies’ growth. But until then, this efficient and highly consolidated industry will continue to crank out the cash. Its recent outperformance may have been more muted, but it has not ended.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
62;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2016-05-03T10:24:26Z;Euro bond issuers scramble to market;;European credit markets have returned from the long weekend with plenty of new offers for investors as the market for euro-denominated corporate bonds continues a hot streak brought on by the announcement that the European Central Bank would begin buying the securities.German car maker Daimler, French telecoms company Orange and American cigarette maker Philip Morris are all selling euro-denominated bonds today, writes capital markets correspondent Gavin Jackson.Demand for new bonds has been strong since the ECB announced in March that it would extend its bond buying programme to include euro-denominated investment grade corporate bonds.The low rates on offer have tempted companies into the market. Daimler is selling three bonds with maturities of four, seven and 12 years. Orange is flogging a benchmark issue — normally above €500bn in size — with a nine-year maturity while Philip Morris is in the market with €500m of debt that comes due in 20 years.The corporate bond buying programme has also led investors to more often choose longer dated deals — like the Philip Morris 20-year bond — as debt with a bigger time to maturity usually carries a higher interest rate and often investors have fixed yield target they need to hit.In April, the ECB said that bonds with a maturity of up to 30 years would be included in its bond buying programme.Usually, debt bankers add a slightly higher yield to new bonds as a sweetener to persuade investors to choose them over debt available in the ‘secondary’ markets. But at the moment new deals are being sold with a very low premium compared to outstanding bonds given the high demand, according to one European investor.
63;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2016-04-26T16:37:56Z;Indian Marlboro-maker falls amid government plan to ban FDI;Shares in licensed manufacturer Godfrey Phillips fall 17% while ITC adds 2%;Shares in India’s licensed producer of Marlboro-branded cigarettes fell 17 per cent on Tuesday on news of a government plan to ban all foreign direct investment and licensing of foreign brands in the tobacco sector.India passed a law allowing 100 per cent foreign ownership of tobacco manufacturing operations in 1998, only to reverse course and ban foreign investment in such assets in 2010. Yet “technology collaboration” — which included the production of foreign-branded cigarettes under licence by local companies — was allowed to continue.The commerce and industry ministry is considering banning such activity too, according to local media reports after the market closed on Monday, which was confirmed to the Financial Times by a government official with knowledge of the plans. It is a move that would contrast with broader efforts by the Narendra Modi administration to woo overseas investors.News of the proposal prompted a 17.3 per cent drop in the share price of Godfrey Phillips, which manufactures Marlboro-branded cigarettes under licence from Philip Morris International.In contrast, shares in the domestic market leader ITC — whose brands account for four out of every five cigarettes sold in India, according to Euromonitor — rose 2 per cent, as investors bet that it would benefit at the expense of foreign brands.Local media cited informal government guidance that the proposal was part of a broader government plan to cut tobacco consumption in India.But such an explanation did not make sense, said Sameer Deshmukh, an analyst at Reliance Securities, arguing that the move was likely to increase sales of illegally produced and imported cigarettes. These already account for about 20 per cent of the Indian cigarette market, according to Nomura.India was the world’s sixth-biggest cigarette market by volume in 2014, with 96bn sticks sold, according to Euromonitor. Yet cigarettes account for only 5 per cent of the country’s tobacco market by volume — 20 per cent of consumption is through beedis, traditional hand-rolled cigarettes, while the remainder is consumed as chewing tobacco and other smokeless forms.To protest antismoking measures, Indian cigarette companies are . . . shutting their factories?The push to restrict investment in tobacco would clash with liberalisation in other sectors, such as defence, insurance and retail, where the government has permitted greater foreign direct investment.Mr Deshmukh said it was impossible to be sure of the government’s motives for considering the FDI ban in the tobacco sector. But he noted that the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India holds a significant stake in ITC, amounting to 14.4 per cent at the end of last year according to S&P Capital IQ.The biggest investor in ITC, however, is British American Tobacco, which held roughly 30 per cent at the end of last year through various vehicles. In the 1990s BAT tried to secure a majority stake in ITC but was unsuccessful after it was strongly resisted by ITC management. The official with knowledge of the government plans did not indicate whether BAT’s investment would be affected.Philip Morris owned 25.1 per cent of Godfrey Phillips at the end of last year, and reportedly has a 50.1 per cent stake in a joint venture established by the two companies for marketing purposes. There has been much speculation in Indian media recently that the US company was poised to expand these investments.Additional reporting Jyotsna Singh

If you have no concerns about anything but your returns, you have to invest in tobacco stocks.“Tobacco divestment has been an abject failure and did not accomplish anything — only a handful of institutions divested. There is nothing on the horizon that suggests there will be an increase in divestment.”Wilshire Associates, the consultancy that carried out the tobacco analysis for Calpers, said it has conducted similar impact assessments for a handful of institutional investors. It declined to comment on whether any clients were considering moving back into tobacco.When contacted by FTfm, the vast majority of investors with tobacco exclusion policies said they had no intention of returning to the sector, despite missing out on performance gains.Over the past 10 years, the MSCI World Tobacco index has returned 11.29 per cent, compared with a 2.13 per cent return for the MSCI World index.Calstrs, the $178bn US public pension fund, estimated it has underperformed standard indices by 1.53 per cent after divesting from tobacco in 2010 and firearms in 2013.“Calstrs has no plans to revisit its divestment decision with regards to tobacco,” a spokesperson for the scheme said.PFZW, one of Europe’s largest pension schemes, with $185bn of assets, similarly dropped tobacco producers in 2013.A spokesperson for the fund, which provides pensions for Dutch healthcare and welfare workers, said: “Despite missed returns, [we] firmly believe [our] participants don’t want to reinvest in this sector. PFZW is not reconsidering this divestment decision.“The PFZW board took into account that Dutch healthcare workers were confronted with medical problems related to tobacco consumption and did not want to see their pension money invested in tobacco production. [There] were [also] issues around child labour in the tobacco sector.”New Zealand’s $20bn sovereign wealth fund, which pulled out of tobacco in 2007, declined to comment on how much it had lost as a result of this policy, but said it would not change.Anne-Maree O’Connor, responsible investment manager at the fund, said: “The exclusion of tobacco stocks is in line with the investment requirements of our mandate, which is to maximise returns without undue risk.”
65;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2016-04-13T18:21:47Z;Tobacco companies biggest S&P 500 decliners;;Shares in tobacco companies are getting smoked on Wednesday as the consumer staples sector took a hit and concerns mounted over potentially tighter regulations for the industry.Reynolds American, the tobacco company behind brands like Newport and Camel, was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500, with shares falling 4.5 per cent to $48.92.Meanwhile, shares in rival Altria Group, the company behind John Middleton, fell 4 per cent to $61.18. And shares in Philip Morris declined 1.7 per cent to $99.95.Concerns about so-called deeming regulations weighed on the shares. This regulation, which could come into effect by mid-2016, could see e-cigarettes, hookah tobacco, cigars and nicotine gels classified as tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration subjecting them to tighter regulatory scrutiny and making it more expensive for companies to market them.Traditional tobacco companies made an aggressive push into products like e-cigarettes in an attempt to diversify, as consumers have opted for healthier lifestyles, choosing to give up smoking cigarettes.A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last year showed that 10 per cent of US adults now ‘vape’, compared with 2.6 per cent according to a US government estimate in 2013.Chris Growe, an analyst at Stifel, said earlier this week:We have been anxiously awaiting the announcement of the Deeming Regulations for the better part of the past three years and the FDA seems prepared, finally, to release those regulations further regulating the E-vapor market. We believe this will have an adverse effect on the growth of the category in 2017 and going forward although the exact regulations are unknown at this time and we will assess their impact once they are formally announced.“We believe this is partially due to weakness across consumer staples, though a Bloomberg article on pending deeming regulations, does seem to be weighing on sentiment,” said Vivien Azer, an analyst at Cowen & Co. She added that the concerns are “overblown”. The S&P 500 consumer staples sector was down 1 per cent for the day.The S&P 500 tobacco industry index, which includes just Reynolds America, Phillip Morris and Altria Group, has posted seven consecutive years of annual gains.The index has been up more than 27 per cent since the start of 2015, compared with a less than 1 per cent gain for the benchmark S&P 500.
66;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2016-04-03T08:51:26Z;India’s ITC smoulders over cigarette packet requirement;India’s top cigarette maker shuts factories rather than print larger health warnings;India’s largest cigarette manufacturer has shut down its factories in the face of a government order to increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packets.“ITC has been compelled to shut its cigarette factories with effect from April 1 2016, until clarity emerges in the current uncertain state of the rules on health warning,” said the tobacco-focused conglomerate in a notice to the Indian stock exchange on Saturday.ITC, which is part-owned by British American Tobacco, represents four-fifths of the Indian cigarette market and cigarettes make up 80 per cent of its profit. BAT in turn relies on ITC for about 7 per cent of group earnings, based on estimates by Jefferies.The cigarette group has been joined in the factory closures by rivals Godfrey Phillips, which is a partner of Philip Morris of the US, and VST Industries, according to the Tobacco Institute of India, an industry lobby group.TII said in a statement: “Owing to the ambiguity on the policy related to the revision of graphic health warnings on tobacco product packs, the members are unable to continue manufacturing cigarettes from April 1 2016.”ITC, Godfrey Phillips and VST could not immediately be reached for comment on Sunday.India wants cigarette manufacturers to increase the size of the health warnings from 20 per cent of a pack’s surface to 85 per cent. That would bring it into line with neighbouring and nearby countries including Nepal, Pakistan and Thailand, which already have warnings of a similarly large size, according to the World Health Organisation. Debate over the size of health warnings on cigarette packets has been simmering for months as the tobacco lobby wrestles with the government over the future of the $10bn market.New Delhi has sought to increase pressure on the industry with antismoking warnings prominent in the media and fresh taxes consistently applied. Nearly 1m people die annually in India from tobacco-related diseases, according to official figures.The WHO noted in March that “large and prominent health warnings have shown to be a cost-effective means of increasing public awareness of the health effects of tobacco use and in reducing tobacco consumption”.While the tobacco companies insist there is still legal confusion over the new rules — a parliamentary committee last month recommended limiting the increase in the size of the health warning to protect farmers’ interests — the government is taking a hard line.“We want to clarify that there is no ambiguity. This is a bogey raised by the tobacco industry. The case is crystal clear,” said the Indian Health Ministry, according to the Press Trust of India.Analysts suggested the change in packaging norms would weigh on volume growth over the long term, with pressure from illicit cigarette sales also limiting the room for price increases.According to Euromonitor, total illicit cigarette sales in India in 2015 are estimated to have reached almost 20 per cent of overall volume.“Euromonitor now estimates that India is the fourth-largest market for illegal cigarettes in the world,” wrote Nomura’s Manish Jain and Natasha Prakash in a recent note to clients.

Vice Media’s blend of edgy content and no-holds barred journalism has won it a growing audience of young fans, while hefty investments from the likes of 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney have propelled its valuation past $4bn.Vice makes most of its money by licensing its programming but it also generates revenue from the marketing campaigns it creates for brands through its network of advertising agencies.One of its newest clients might come as a surprise, given the nature of the product it sells and the fact that it is barred from advertising in most western countries. It is Philip Morris International, the cigarette maker and owner of the Marlboro brand.The deal between PMI and a London agency owned by Vice, is for “white label” video content which the agency produces and PMI can use as it wishes.The content produced by Edition Worldwide is “nightlife” focused. It does not carry the Vice brand and will not appear on any Vice channels or in any Vice editorial product. None of it will appear in the UK or US, where most forms of tobacco advertising is banned.Regardless of the rights and wrongs of helping a tobacco company sell cigarettes, the relationship raises interesting questions.Cigarette makers have tailored their marketing strategies in recent years in the face of overwhelming political and social opposition. The EU banned in 2003 all tobacco advertising in print media, radio, internet and event sponsorship, such as Formula One races (tobacco advertising on television was first stopped in 1989). Similar restrictions apply in the US.The bans have compelled cigarette makers to divert money that was once used in print ads and sports sponsorships to other areas, such as point-of-sale marketing and giveaways and other promotion at big events. They are also increasingly focusing on countries where regulations restricting advertising are less strict, such as markets in Asia and Latin America.This is where Vice’s agency and its filmmaking expertise comes in. The company is by no means alone in working for a cigarette maker. WPP, the world’s largest advertising group, counts British American Tobacco among its clients. Leo Burnett, part of Publicis, has worked for Altria, the parent company for Philip Morris USA.Ad agencies used to talk up their tobacco clients: in the Mad Men era of the 1960s, winning a big tobacco account could transform an agency’s standing and prospects. These days trumpeting such clients is taboo. “In some cases it would be hard to find people prepared to work on a tobacco account,” one senior ad executive says.And yet it is still legal to make and sell cigarettes which means money will inevitably be spent on marketing. According to the most recent figures from the US Federal Trade Commission, spending on cigarette advertising and promotion by the largest manufacturers in the US rose from $8.37bn in 2011 to $9.17bn in 2012. New potential clients have also entered the market: the six largest ecigarette companies more than doubled their marketing spending to $59.3m in 2013 from 2012, according to a 2014 report from Dick Durbin, an Illinois senator.It is unclear what PMI will do with the video content it gets from Vice’s agency. The group operates age-protected websites, with users having to register using identification, such as a driving licence, before they gain access. Perhaps the video content will appear behind that wall — or maybe it will be made available in countries where tobacco advertising restrictions are more lax. Wherever it goes, PMI clearly believes advertising is important. On its corporate website it says it “strongly” believes “that the ability for manufacturers to market their products to adult smokers is fundamental to vigorous competition”.Still, it faces big challenges. It gets harder to sell cigarettes every year and while new markets and the digital era may hold promise there is still a stigma attached to tobacco advertising — and an overwhelming public health interest in banning it. Whether Vice’s content aids its marketing efforts or not, the Marlboro Man rode off into the sunset long ago.matthew.garrahan@ft.com

Operating profits fell from SKr992m to SKr908m. Analysts were looking for operating profits of around SKr950m.Ebitda margins for snus and snuff fell from 43.6 per cent to 41.4 per cent. Sales rose 5 per cent from SKr3.5bn to SKr3.7bn, with increased cigar shipments offsetting the slower snus sales growth.The company, whose stated goal is a world without cigarettes, scrapped a joint venture with Philip Morris International last July.It is seeking regulatory approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to be able to market its Swedish-style wet snuff in the US as less harmful than cigarettes.
69;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;BAT: the long drag;Tobacco companies are lukewarm about ecigarettes, with good reason;"Selling the disease and the cure could be a nice business model. British American Tobacco may just get there. BAT’s e-Voke product has been granted a licence by a UK medical regulator, designating it a treatment for nicotine addiction and stoking a debate about ecigarette regulation.There is a parallel commercial debate: how much attention should big tobacco companies pay to “vaping”? At the moment, they pay relatively little. BAT’s next-generation products division is so small its revenues and profits are not disclosed.Big tobacco prefers to concentrate on the time-honoured strategies: consolidation, lobbying against regulation and taxation in developed markets, and pushing brands in faster-growing and less-regulated jurisdictions. Will this be regarded in retrospect this as a huge strategic mistake, like Kodak’s failure to embrace the digital technology it invented and which destroyed it?No. The tobacco companies are right to bide their time. The ecigarette market could be worth $50bn by 2030, Euromonitor forecasts — the current cigarette market weighs in at $450bn.There are also various economically unappealing aspects of vaping. For now, the market is largely confined to smokers trying to quit; regulation of ecigarettes is still evolving and mixed messages about their safety may be restricting take-up. Vaping is a “razors and blades” business model requiring upfront investment in hardware, whereas ordinary cigarettes are cheap to produce, resulting in operating margins of 37 per cent at BAT. It does not tend to deliver the instant hit that smokers crave.Finally the “open tank” systems used in many ecigarettes do little for branding — there is not yet a Nespresso for nicotine.Should the market grow despite all this, though, tobacco groups’ strong balance sheets will allow them to snap up vaping start-ups. The only risk is that they wait too long.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
70;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2015-12-23T15:49:03Z;European court paves the way for plain cigarette packaging;The advocate general’s opinion is not binding but is usually upheld by the ECJ;The EU’s highest court has opened the path to the introduction of plain cigarette packaging laws across the continent, striking a significant blow against tobacco companies.In an opinion delivered on Wednesday, Juliane Kokott, the European Court of Justice’s advocate general, dismissed a legal challenge from the tobacco industry against EU plans to increase health warnings, ban menthol cigarettes and regulate ecigarettes.The industry hoped that a ruling in its favour would block attempts by the UK, France and Ireland to introduce so-called “plain packaging”, when branded cigarette packs are replaced with dark brown or green boxes without pictures or design features.The advocate general’s opinion is not binding but is usually upheld by the ECJ. It will come as a further setback to tobacco companies, which are facing declining smoking rates and greater regulation across the developed world.The French parliament last week voted to introduce plain packaging just a day before the Australian high court defeated a challenge from Philip Morris International against branding restrictions.PMI, British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco have also challenged the UK government’s plain packaging rules, which will come into effect from May 2017. A decision is expected in the new year.“While we are still analysing the [advocate general’s] opinion, we are obviously disappointed with its conclusions,” BAT said. “We have always maintained that the Tobacco Products Directive represents an unlawful and disproportionate incursion into the autonomy of the [EU] member states.”When it launched its challenge, PMI said the EU directive would “disrupt the balance . . . between the union and the member states” by allowing nations to introduce rules above those in the directive that says cigarette packs have to be 65 per cent covered with health warnings.“Rather than respecting such basic principles as genuine harmonisation and free movement, the [TPD] inexplicably encourages a patchwork of regulations,” it added on Wednesday.But Ms Kokott said individual countries can introduce full plain packaging. “Since the directive specifies only a basic design, it also still leaves scope for additional national packaging standards, for example in respect of the colouring of surfaces not reserved for warnings,” she said.Deborah Arnott, chief executive of antismoking group Ash, says if the opinion is upheld by the ECJ it would strengthen antismoking advocates across the developed world.“The advocate general’s opinion that standardised packaging of cigarettes is legal in Europe, one of the world’s big trading blocks, sets the scene for it to go global,” she said.On Wednesday Ms Kokott also said separate challenges against the directive’s ban on menthol cigarettes and regulation of ecigarettes should be dismissed.Pillbox, an ecigarette manufacturer, said the regulation of ecigarettes under tobacco legislation is disproportionate. Ms Kokott said ecigarette rules will be “moderate” compared with tobacco regulations.She also said menthol cigarettes should be banned under the TPD, despite a challenge from Poland where flavoured products are popular. Ms Kokott said “none of the arguments invoked by Poland and supported by Romania . . . is well founded”.
71;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:00+0000;Australia wins legal battle over plain cigarette packs;International court declines to hear case brough by Philip Morris;Big tobacco has lost a legal case against Australia’s ban on branded cigarette packets, marking a significant setback for the industry’s global battle against so called “plain packaging” laws.The Permanent Court of Arbitration on Friday declined on jurisdictional grounds to allow a case by Philip Morris against Australia to proceed, in effect ending a challenge based on claims by the tobacco giant that Canberra is violating intellectual property laws. Philip Morris Asia Limited took the case under a bilateral trade agreement between Australia and Hong Kong, arguing the sweeping ban on trademarks breached foreign investment protections.The court, which is based in Singapore, did not publish its ruling but in a statement the Australian government welcomed the judgment, which has been issued to both parties.Fiona Nash, minister for rural health, said: “Plain packaging is a legitimate public health measure which is consistent with Australia’s international legal obligations.”Philip Morris said the outcome of the case did not validate plain packaging in Australia or anywhere else.Marc Firestone, international senior vice-president and general counsel, said: “It is regrettable that the outcome hinged entirely on a procedural issue that Australia chose to advocate instead of confronting head-on the merits of whether plain packaging is legal or even works”.Australia became the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging legislation in 2011 in a bid to curb smoking, particularly among young people. Since the measure was introduced tobacco consumption has fallen and the UK and Ireland have both announced plans to follow suit. In December tobacco companies issued legal action against the UK government, which plans to introduce its new packaging regime in May. Canberra has already defeated legal challenges from tobacco companies in Australian courts. It still faces a challenge over plain packaging at the World Trade Organization, which is hearing complaints made by Indonesia, Dominican Republic, Honduras and Cuba, which claim it violates WTO agreements by creating an unnecessary barrier to trade and impeding the use of trademarks.Whether forcing tobacco companies to sell cigarettes in drab brown-green colour with prominent health warnings and graphic images, typically of smoking related diseases, has reducing smoking in Australia is hotly contested by antismoking activists and the tobacco industry.The most comprehensive survey of smoking since the packaging laws were introduced was published in July by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, a government body.It found daily smoking rates fell at their fastest pace for two decades between 2010 and December 1 2013, when one in eight Australians said they lit up at least once a day.The survey found young people were taking up the habit later, with the average starting age rising to 15.9 years, up from 14.2 in 2010. The average number of cigarettes smoked per week also fell, from 111 in 2010 to 96 in 2013.The tobacco industry says the AIHW study does not prove plain packaging is working because it includes only a year’s worth of data from when the law changed.Smoking has been falling in Australia for more than two decades. Recent tobacco tax rises are also likely to have had an impact, making a causal link between plain packaging and smoking reductions more difficult to prove.
72;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Tobacco groups challenge plain-pack rules;From next May, cigarette makers to be banned from using branding;Four of the world’s largest tobacco groups have begun a high-profile legal challenge against the government on the legality of new packaging rules.The new rules, which come into force next May, will ban companies from using any logos or branding on packets of tobacco products.The four tobacco companies claim that the new rules are contrary to EU and UK law and will deprive them of their intellectual property and business goodwill without compensation.Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International have brought the judicial review challenge against the government.Philip Morris claimed that it had “invested significant resources developing a strong portfolio of trade marks to distinguish its products from those of its competitors”.“In a single stroke, the regulations deprive PMI of the very substance and purpose of that property without providing any compensation for its value,” the written arguments for the company claim.The government is arguing that the new “standardised packaging” rules are lawful.The companies will have to use packs with dark brown or green boxes without pictures or designs.James Eadie QC, representing the government, said the tobacco products made by the companies “are the only legal consumer products in the world that cause half of their long-term users to die prematurely”.He noted that the tobacco companies had argued that the regulations “will not be effective in achieving their public health objectives” and “will not achieve a reduction in tobacco consumption”.But he claimed that the regulations were lawful and that standardised packaging “is highly likely to reduce both uptake and prevalence of smoking, and thus will have a positive impact on public health”.The government is arguing that trademarks are being controlled, not removed altogether.The case, which is scheduled to last all week, continues.
73;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Tobacco giants launch UK plain packaging challenge;Four groups working will together to fight ban on branded packs;Four of the world’s largest tobacco companies will on Thursday mount a court challenge over UK government plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes.British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International are working together to fight the ban on branded cigarette packs, which is due to come into force next year.They will tell the High Court that the ban infringes property rights and will be ineffective in reducing smoking levels.Imperial, which sells the most cigarettes in the UK, said legal action was a “last resort” but tobacco companies “have been left with no option than to defend our intellectual property rights in court”.MPs voted in March to ban logos from cigarette packs after a review last year concluded it was “highly likely that standardised packaging would serve to reduce the rate of children taking up smoking and implausible that it would increase the consumption of tobacco”.Under the new rules, cigarette companies have until May 2017 to replace packs with dark brown or green boxes without pictures or design features aside from health warnings and a brand name in a regular type face.But the industry will have a week to argue its case in front of Justice Green.Imperial will say EU law requires trademark rules to be consistent in the union, which the UK government will counter with evidence that tobacco legislation protects the rights of member states to go above EU rules on tobacco control.PMI will argue that plain packaging has not reduced smoking levels in Australia, the only country to adopt the policy, while JTI will say the industry should not be deprived of its brand property. BAT will make an independent case that it was not adequately consulted by the government before the vote.However, in the past the UK government has been criticised for its close relations to the industry after it emerged that 38 MPs received £60,000 in gifts from tobacco companies since packet changes were suggested in 2010.Tobacco companies argue plain packaging in Australia has increased the smoking levels among young people and caused smokers to buy cheaper cigarettes instead of quitting altogether.“We believe that the UK government made a serious error of judgment by failing to properly take into account the Australian government’s own data, which shows that plain packaging is not achieving its public health objectives,” BAT said.But the Department of Health said: “Smoking is catastrophic for your health and kills over 100,000 people every year in the UK, with the burden of disease falling most heavily on poorer communities.“The tobacco industry has a history of challenging in the courts policies that aim to reduce smoking …we intend to defend this important public health policy robustly.”A challenge against plain packaging in Australia failed because tobacco companies could not prove the government had benefited from their intellectual property loss. But under UK law, companies are not required to prove that the government benefited from the policy, just that property rights have been removed.The government will argue that trademarks are being controlled, not removed altogether.A preliminary judgment on a separate legal challenge by PMI and BAT against European tobacco legislation — the EU tobacco products directive — will be given on December 23.James Bushnell, an analyst at BNP Paribas, said smoking rates were declining by 3 or 4 per cent in the UK so the industry was less worried about volumes than so-called “downtrading”, where people buy a cheaper product because they are no longer drawn by more premium branding.He estimated the UK government could be forced to pay the industry hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation if plain packaging is found to be illegal.A decision is expected early next year.

Dependent on more trials, the sales opportunity could be as big as $2.5bn to $3bn, which would lift AstraZeneca’s longer-term profit by 10 per cent, it said.AstraZeneca rose 4 per cent to £42.58 in a resilient wider market. The FTSE 100 gained 0.5 per cent, or 28.1 points to 6,146.38, even though Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris weighed on travel-related stocks.Burberry lost 1.2 per cent to £12.53. Exane analyst Luca Solca said Paris was “the second-largest luxury city in the world” and travellers accounted for more than 40 per cent of luxury spend.InterContinental Hotels faded 1.9 per cent to £24.61, with the shares showing no response to the $12bn merger of Marriott and Starwood Hotels.“Whether InterContinental ever undertook talks with either Marriott or Starwood is perhaps now moot,” said Morgan Stanley. “Nevertheless, we think the proposed fundamental reshaping of the industry raises scope for InterContinental to reconsider its recent decision not to explore consolidation opportunities.”Imperial Tobacco rose 3.9 per cent to £35.89, a record high. Traders noted stronger demand than usual for Imperial’s December call options at £36 a share, which refreshed longstanding bid speculation.Monday’s preferred theory was that British American Tobacco, up 1 per cent to £37.41, and a partner might make a cash-and-share break-up offer for Imperial. The managements of Imperial and Philip Morris International were scheduled to attend a Morgan Stanley conference in New York beginning on Tuesday.Among the miners Glencore slid 3.8 per cent to 89.5p after results late on Friday from Katanga Mining, its majority-owned copper subsidiary. Lossmaking Katanga burnt through $293m in the third quarter, taking its free cash flow loss to $847m in the first nine months.Most of Katanga’s debt was provided by Glencore and any loan default could trigger a subsidiary rights issue, said JPMorgan Cazenove. Katanga’s troubles “reinforce the urgency” of Glencore’s $10bn net debt-reduction plan, it said.Book publisher Quarto edged 0.7 per cent lower at 217.5p on word that Christopher Mills, the activist investor, and Wellcome Trust had sold their 30 per cent stake. Westhouse Securities was said to have sold the shares to institutions at 215p apiece.
75;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Japan Tobacco buys Iranian cigarette maker to boost dominance;Deal aims to solidify market leader position as economy is expected to open up to western brands;Japan Tobacco International has bought an Iranian cigarette maker in an attempt to reinforce its position as the market leader in a country which hopes to open up to western companies once international sanctions over its nuclear programme are removed.The company said JTI Pars, its Iranian subsidiary, had recently acquired the privately owned Arian Tobacco Industry (ATI) for an undisclosed amount.“A growing number of major companies from various countries are now investing or reinvesting in Iran,” JTI said. “Our Iranian subsidiary just finalised the acquisition, so clearly this is very recent but we are confident that it will enhance our business in Iran from next year onwards.A person with knowledge of the country’s tobacco market said the purchase was likely a response to expectations that Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, was expected to enter the market.“This acquisition will double JTI’s market share and helps to maintain its competitive advantage — thanks to JTI Pars’ presence in Iran since 2002 — before Marlboro steps into this market,” the person said.The other foreign tobacco companies operating in Iran are British American Tobacco, through its subsidiary BAT Pars, and KT&G of Korea.Iran is a tough environment for international tobacco companies. The industry is not permitted to market cigarettes through advertising and heavy taxes translate into higher prices on tobacco products.Porous borders mean smuggling is also prevalent. About 40 per cent of cigarettes smoked in the country enter the market illegally, according to Iran’s ministry of industry, mine and trade.The major brands produced at the JTI Pars factory in the northern Gilan province are Winston, Magna and Monte Carlo.The ATI acquisition means more production will take place in Zanjan, about 300km north-west of Tehran, said people familiar with the deal. The companies jointly employ about 1,000 people.“ATI has some strong brands in the growing value segment, the largest in volume, and a state-of-the-art local production facility, very similar to JTI standards,” JTI said.Asked how sanctions have affected its business, the company added: “We have always believed in Iran’s economic future and look forward to consolidating our presence, even more so with the business climate improving.”

News this week that Tullow’s lenders had left its credit facilities unchanged in a six-monthly review has helped peers including Nostrum, which has been drawing down debt to build a gas treatment facility with the aim of doubling production by 2018.Rio Tinto rose 1 per cent to £22.42 after the head of its diamonds and minerals said at the London investor meeting that key commodities were close to the bottom of the cycle.

The minimum free-float on the Hong Kong exchange, for example, is 25 per cent.Analysts say publicly listed companies in Indonesia have traditionally had a limited portion of shares traded on the stock market due to a combination of favourable tax regulations and the domination of family owners.Philip Morris’ sale this week will be watched closely as a measure of investor appetite.Sampoerna, which sells clove cigarettes and distributes Marlboro cigarettes in Indonesia, is planning to sell shares at Rp65,000 to Rp77,000 each, against a closing price of Rp75,000 on Tuesday.

And it’s going to be this way for every group that presses charges against a country where it wants to earn money.”The dispute is the latest in a series of stand-offs since Mr Orban’s government came to power in 2010 and imposed a rash of unconventional taxes and charges targeting foreign-owned media, telecoms, utilities and banks, as part of an effort to reduce the fiscal deficit and avoid another International Monetary Fund bailout.The measures resulted in several EU investigations and Mr Orban has said he expects disputes with Brussels to intensify over the next three years. But his supporters pointed to Hungary’s stellar economic growth — which measured 3.6 per cent last year — and the country’s declining debt levels as a vindication of his so-called Orbanomics policies.In the latest cases, Brussels said it was not disputing Budapest’s right to introduce taxes, but rather the steeply increasing rates that apply to larger, predominantly foreign companies, such as Philip Morris International, Imperial Tobacco and Spar. It has also issued an injunction to prevent the government from collecting the taxes.The commission said Hungary had provided no objective reason to discriminate between companies based on turnover. Brussels said in a statement it supported attempts to reduce tobacco consumption but it “had doubts that the effects of tobacco products on public health increase progressively with the turnover of companies selling them.”In June, Budapest backed down in a dispute with Bertelsmann-owned broadcaster RTL Klub, which EU authorities found had been subject to a discriminatory 50 per cent higher tax on advertising revenue. No other media outlets paid tax at the higher rate.Imperial Tobacco Hungary said the new charges were “clearly discriminatory” and pledged to continue with legal challenges against unfair treatment.“The government can impose taxes whenever they want, but if they are discriminatory, we will fight them,” a spokesperson said.Brussels is also examining the government’s decision this year to grant an exclusive licence for wholesale tobacco distribution to British American Tobacco, in partnership with local supplier Continental Tobacco Group.One person familiar with the dispute said tobacco groups were also challenging the decision to grant the licence.The Hungarian government rejected on procedural grounds an alternative offer for distribution rights from the local arms of tobacco companies PMI, Imperial and JTI worth up to Ft6bn ($21m), compared with the Ft600m agreed with BAT and CTG.Erik Bloomquist, an analyst at Berenberg, said: “It was puzzling to see what appears to be a substantially higher offer rejected by a government keen to raise revenue.”Mr Orban’s critics say the disputes are further evidence that Hungary’s growth potential is being diminished by an unpredictable regulatory environment and punishing sector taxes that deter foreign investors.The government has this year pledged to reduce Europe’s highest banking taxes in a bid to boost lending and attract investment. But last week’s statement casts doubt on its commitment to a stable and level playing field for foreign investors, according to analysts.
79;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2015-06-02T11:55:30Z;Canadian court orders tobacco groups to pay C$15.6bn to smokers;BAT to challenge class-action ruling that is the largest damages payment in country’s history;A Canadian court has ordered three tobacco companies to pay C$15.6bn ($12.5bn) to two groups of smokers, in what is the largest damages award in Canada’s history.The ruling, which affects subsidiaries of British American Tobacco, Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International, follows a 10-year legal battle and demonstrates the continuing legal risks faced by tobacco companies.About 1m smokers are part of the class-action lawsuit, which claims that tobacco companies failed to warn them properly about the risks of smoking.The first group suffered lung, throat and laryngeal cancer, while the other was made up of smokers addicted to nicotine.BAT said that the judgment, which affects its subsidiary Imperial Tobacco Canada, “ignores the reality that both adult consumers and governments have known about the risks associated with smoking for decades”.In a statement on Tuesday, BAT said there were “strong legal grounds” to appeal against the judgment and to challenge the court’s “provisional execution order”, which requires an immediate C$1.131bn payout in the event of an appeal.“No payments will be made until the request to stay the provisional execution order has been heard and a judgment made,” BAT said.The industry has been the target of a series of lawsuits over many years from smokers who have claimed that tobacco companies historically downplayed the risks of smoking.Last year, Reynolds American, in which BAT holds a 42 per cent stake, was ordered to pay $23.6bn by a Florida court to the widow of a man who died of smoking-related illnesses. Reynolds appealed against the judgment.C$10.4bnAmount BAT’s subsidiary, Imperial Tobacco Canada, is liable for out of the C$15.6bn (US$12.48bn) payoutIn 2000, another Florida court ordered the US tobacco industry to pay $145bn to smokers, an award that was later dismissed by the state supreme court.BAT shares fell 2.1 per cent to £35.17 by lunchtime trading in London.Erik Bloomquist, an analyst at Berenberg, said that the ruling looked “ripe for reversal”.“People are trying to price it in but I think we’ll see that clawed back over the next couple of days as people think about the history of US class action lawsuits and the relative lack of impact they’ve had,” he said.Imperial Tobacco Canada is liable for C$10.4bn of the C$15.6bn payout.PMI-owned Benson & Hedges Inc, JTI-Macdonald Corp, owned by JTI, and Rothmans have also said that they will appeal.All three companies have been ordered to deposit a C$1.1bn portion of the damages into a trust account within 60 days.Claims from smokers have not been the only legal issues burdening tobacco companies, which have historically had interests in a broad range of industries.Last year, BAT paid $575m to settle a long-running dispute over asbestos and dividend claims in a case relating to a subsidiary.
80;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2015-04-19T16:40:42Z;Dollar’s rise casts shadow on US earnings;Driver of equity market rests on how multinationals weather currency headwinds;A surging dollar is expected to hit some of the largest US multinationals this week, as more than a fifth of S&P 500 companies report results for a quarter marked by a 9 per cent jump in their domestic currency.Blue-chip behemoths such as IBM, General Motors, United Technologies, Coca-Cola and McDonald’s are among those set to release earnings by Friday.With the S&P up only 1.1 per cent this year, investors are concerned that several companies could emulate General Electric and Philip Morris, which each said last week that the dollar reduced their revenues by nearly $1bn in the first quarter. GE said currency swings hit profits by $120m, and Philip Morris reported a $585m hit to “operating companies income”.Fears of a new Greek crisis are resurfacing and US economic data has disappointed of late, but corporate earnings are likely to be a key driving force for US equities this year, said Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at Blackrock.“For 2015, it will come down to earnings and whether companies can overcome a higher dollar,” he said.Earnings reports so far have validated recent concerns over falling energy prices and a rising dollar that have led to the largest downgrade of earnings estimates since the financial crisis.FactSet expects first-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 to decline 4 per cent and revenues to drop 3 per cent. But it expects both earnings and revenues to be down 10 per cent for companies that generate less than half their sales in the US.Between the end of October and mid-March, the dollar index – which measures the greenback against a basket of its peers – climbed 15 per cent.The euro suffered its biggest quarterly decline against the dollar since it was created in 1999, and many strategists hastily brought forward their target date for the dollar reaching parity with its transatlantic partner, although that expectation has been tempered by poor US economic data.Currency swings are affecting a wide range of multinationals. Delta, the US airline, plans to suspend service to Moscow later this year because of the slide in the Russian rouble, and Tiffany & Co, the venerable diamond retailer, expects tourist traffic in the US to remain under pressure.Executives at Apple, which reports quarterly figures next Monday, have already warned that sales growth in the three months to the end of March would have been more than $2bn higher if currencies were held constant.Technology companies are acutely exposed to the dollar’s strength, as the sector generates more of its revenues abroad than any other, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Morgan Stanley analysts said the impact of foreign currency rates are “the largest headwind for March quarter earnings” for the tech industry, forecasting a 1 per cent reduction in company guidance.A mitigating factor for dollar-related pain for companies is that expectations have already been largely reset since the dollar began its sharp appreciation.“Earnings expectations for the first quarter reflect most of the negative forces facing the S&P 500, and we do not expect material downside to estimates,” said Jonathan Glionna, a strategist with Barclays. “Estimates have already been cut by the most since the first quarter of 2009 [and] negative pre-announcements are at a 10-year high.”
81;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2015-03-18T18:18:01Z;Bloomberg and Gates launch fund to fight Big Tobacco;Billionaires help poorer nations defend anti-smoking laws;Billionaires Mike Bloomberg and Bill Gates have launched an anti-smoking legal fund designed to help lower-income countries defend their tobacco-control laws against lawsuits by cigarette companies.The fund will raise the pressure on the tobacco industry, which has seen tough anti-smoking regulation spread from mature markets in places like western Europe to fast-growing developing countries seen as key sources of growth.In response, tobacco companies have used trade agreements as a way to challenge national laws on smoking. Philip Morris International, the world’s largest seller of cigarettes outside of China, is suing Uruguay over claims that its tobacco-control measures violated a trade agreement with Switzerland, where PMI is based.The claim, which marked the first time a tobacco company sued a country in an international court, concerns a law passed in 2009 that requires health warnings to cover 80 per cent of tobacco packaging and banning different variants of the same brands, like Marlboro Red and Marlboro Gold.Mr Bloomberg said the tobacco industry was using costly legal battles to “intimidate” lower-income countries.“This is not about trade. No one is a stronger supporter of capitalism and trade than I am,” he said. “This is about sovereignty and whether a country has the right to set its own public-health policies.”He and Mr Gates have committed $4m to initiate the fund, which will be administered by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a US charity.It will offer countries assistance in drafting anti-smoking laws, create a network of trade-litigation lawyers, and provide financial support for states facing legal action.Mr Bloomberg said the relatively small financial investment was “just a start” and pointed to the $600m that Bloomberg Philanthropies, his charitable giving vehicle, had spent on anti-smoking work since 2007.Trade laws have also been used to challenge Australia’s plain-packaging legislation, which was passed in 2012. A subsidiary of PMI is suing Australia over claims that the law violated a trade agreement between the country and Hong Kong.Tobacco companies have vowed to sue Ireland and the UK, which also passed plain packaging laws this month.Mr Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said that while wealthy countries like Australia could afford to defend their laws, “smaller, developing countries don’t have the same resources”.Anti-smoking regulation has spread across the world as countries have implemented the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, a treaty that came into force in 2005 and has now been ratified by 180 governments.Smoking rates have fallen in a majority of countries, helped by tax rises on cigarettes. Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of men smoking fell in 72 per cent of countries and in 88 per cent of countries for women, according to recent study published in The Lancet.Despite the decline in smoking, tobacco industry profits have continued to rise as tax hikes on cigarettes are typically accompanied by an additional price increase added by the company.
82;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2015-02-05T17:45:14Z;Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris hit by falling sales;Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris hit by factory closure costs and adverse currency exchange rates;Two of the world’s largest tobacco companies have suffered a fall in profits as the cost of closing factories and unfavourable currency exchange rates weighed on their full-year results.Japan Tobacco, which sells the Camel and Winston brands through its international arm, said on Thursday that group profits fell 12.2 per cent to Y395.7bn for the year to the end of December 2014.However, the company announced a share buyback plan worth Y100bn as it reported an 8.8 per cent rise in adjusted operating profit to Y447bn from Japan Tobacco International.“Our international tobacco business delivered another set of impressive financial results and continues to be the profit growth engine of the JT Group,” said Mitsuomi Koizumi, JT chief executive.Philip Morris International, the world’s largest tobacco company by volume outside of China, said its full-year profits fell 12.6 per cent to $7.5bn and warned that “extreme currency volatility” meant it did not plan any share buybacks this year.“We remain steadfast in our aim to return around 100 per cent of our free cash flow to our shareholders,” said Andre Calantzopoulos, chief executive of PMI.“However, given the recent extreme currency volatility, we are focused on managing our cash flow prudently and on maintaining our financial flexibility for business development opportunities.”Reported earnings per share fell 9.5 per cent to $4.76.Both companies have been restructuring their operations in the wake of falling global consumption. Japan Tobacco is closing its Gallaher plant in Northern Ireland, while PMI has halted production at plants in Australia and the Netherlands.Erik Bloomquist, analyst at Berenberg, said Japan Tobacco’s share buyback programme would reassure investors about its commitment to returning cash. The company has been long pressed to return cash to shareholders by The Children’s Investment Master Fund, run by Chris Hohn.“When investors look at various tobacco companies, JT’s commitment to competitive shareholder returns has been questioned. The buyback should alleviate much of that concern,” said Mr Bloomquist.Cigarette volumes fell at both companies, driven by a market decline in Russia, the world’s second-largest market, and Japan, which have introduced tax increases on cigarettes.Volumes fell 4.7 per cent to 398bn units at Japan Tobacco International and 3.6 per cent to 122.4bn in its domestic business. PMI’s volumes fell 2.8 per cent to 856bn units.This article has been amended to reflect the fact that PMI has halted production at plants in Australia and the Netherlands, not Northern Ireland
83;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2015-02-03T17:33:50Z;Petitioners’ fears over EU-US trade deal well-grounded;In the past decade large, mostly American, companies have claimed rights under ISDS;"More than 1m people in Europe have signed petitions against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. In Britain, a YouGov poll showed that those who thought the plan would be bad for Britain outnumbered those who thought it would be beneficial by three to one. YouGov did not go on to ask: “Do you have the faintest idea what the previous question was about?” (To be fair, one-third of those questioned had the sense to say they did not know.)TTIP, currently being negotiated between America and the EU, is an ambitious attempt to create a north Atlantic free trade area. With no tariffs and harmonised regulation, businesses could compete (and products could move freely) from California to Croatia. My instinct is to approve. But the protesters might have a point.Serious bargaining incorporates an element of bluff, and too much transparency can prove an obstacle to necessary compromises. Some degree of privacy is indispensable. But Brussels and Washington, where most of the negotiations are being conducted, are the lobbying capitals of the world — places where large corporations spend lavishly in the finest restaurants. In the absence of a more open process it is very difficult to refute the general allegation that the TTIP agenda is driven by big business interests; or specific claims that Europe might — for example — find itself moving towards a US-style patent system, which is increasingly a licence to litigate rather than a spur to innovation.The problem is aggravated by Europe’s “democratic deficit”, which undermines confidence that agreements will be the product of the legitimate legislative scrutiny of the kind that happens in at least some national parliaments. The European Commission, recognising that reticence is a problem, has recently published draft texts of its position in a number of contentious areas.But the principal focus of popular concern is the potential inclusion in the deal of provisions for what is drily called “ investor-state dispute settlement”. From the 1980s, this process became a standard element of trade deals between the US and less developed countries, and was adopted in other bilateral agreements between developed and emerging economies. ISDS requires that, when investors claim their property has been expropriated by signatory states, the dispute must be adjudicated in an international forum. Poor countries often lacked independent judicial systems and were in urgent need of investment from abroad. This submission to international arbitration was a way to protect local populations as well as foreign investors from short-sighted policies and corrupt leaders.Similar provisions soon found their way into agreements between developed nations. ISDS was incorporated into the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement, although it is hard to argue that the Canadian legal system is inadequate for the protection of foreign investors. In the past decade some large — predominantly American — companies have aggressively claimed rights under ISDS. Tobacco company Philip Morris , for example, has used bilateral investment agreements between Hong Kong and Australia to claim that restrictions on tobacco promotion represent deprival of its property.Protesters say that ISDS might be used to attack Britain’s National Health Service, and indeed a case on public provision of healthcare was brought against Canada in 2008. Even if that and similar claims lack merit, the mere threat of litigation can have a chilling effect on policy — the Australian litigation has led New Zealand to defer anti-tobacco measures. It would be much easier to sell TTIP to a sceptical European public if ISDS were no longer part of it.johnkay@johnkay.com——————————————-Letters in response to this column:TTIP: harmonisation of regulation is years away / From Charlotte FouldsDitching investor-state dispute settlement may come at quite a cost / From John DanilovichSMEs in particular need protection from the whims of politicians / From Simon Walker"
84;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
85;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Britain’s bold move on plain cigarette packaging;UK is right to ban all promotional graphics in the sale of tobacco;David Cameron has been accused in recent months of presiding over a “zombie government” because his ministers are submitting little, if any, serious legislation between now and the May general election. But yesterday, the prime minister’s coalition made an unexpected announcement that rather undermines that charge. It unveiled plans to pass legislation before polling day that will enforce plain packaging on all cigarettes , requiring they be sold in boxes decorated in an off-putting shade of olive green that bans all trademarks and logos except the simple brand name. This law — likely to be passed by MPs in a free vote — will be the most significant step in years to boost public health in Britain. It is welcome.The need to crack down on tobacco promotion for medical reasons is now well established across the world. Smoking remains the single biggest cause of preventable death in most societies — and the UK, like other states, has responded accordingly. Over the past decade, Britain has seen a ban on smoking in public spaces, the outlawing of tobacco advertising and moves to restrict the display of cigarettes in shops.Thanks to such measures, the number of adult smokers in Britain has fallen from 45 per cent of the population in 1974 to about 20 per cent. But challenges remain. The figure for UK smokers has remained stuck at about the same level for the past seven years. Those giving up have tended to be the more health-conscious middle class. There is a particular concern about the take-up of cigarettes among young people, with more than 200,000 under 16s starting to smoke each year.For the tobacco companies, the introduction of standardised packaging in Britain — banning, for example, laminated print effects and foil decorations — would come as no surprise. Australia imposed such a measure in 2012. However, the UK move would still be a blow. The manufacturers have invested hugely in branding over the years and the new UK laws would remove what is known as “the last remaining billboard” for tobacco. Once that has gone, the ability of retailers to maintain particular brands at premium prices will be diminished.Needless to say, the government’s announcement has met with resistance. Some on the right, in particular Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence party, argue this is an intrusion into consumer choice. The manufacturers, for their part, say that all their marketing activity, including packaging, is aimed solely at enticing existing smokers to switch brands. As a senior executive at British American Tobacco recently argued, his company has 8.2 per cent of the share of the UK market, leaving more than 90 per cent for it to “shoot for.” This, he said, was “quite enough” to keep it busy.This argument is misleading. The goal of government policy should be to diminish the demand for tobacco by every reasonable means short of prohibition. It should therefore eliminate branded cigarette packages, which are a pure marketing ploy. Vulnerable non-smokers, especially children and adolescents, are not immune to the effects of attractive packaging whenever they are presented with it.The tobacco manufacturers are unlikely to put up with this proposal without a fight– and a legal challenge to a bill passed by parliament is almost inevitable. But the government is right to seek to pass this measure before Britain goes to the polls. If this is all that MPs achieve between now and the election, it will outweigh any cynicism about this being a “zombie” parliament.——————————————-Letter in response to this editorial:There is no such thing as an ‘off-putting’ colour / From David Hockney
86;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2015-01-22T15:22:39Z;Australia’s drab packets discourage new smokers;Data suggest drab brown-green packs with branding barely visible and health warnings are working;There has been even less glamour to smoking in Australia since it became the first country to introduce plain packaging in December 2012.Newsagents stock cigarettes in cabinets out of sight of customers. There is no brand advertising on display.Instead, all packs are a drab brown-green colour with prominent health warnings and graphic images, typically of smoking related diseases. Brand names are in small lettering — barely visible without close inspection.Whether the plain packaging has reducing smoking in Australia is a hotly contested question between anti-smoking activists and the tobacco industry.The most comprehensive survey of smoking since the packaging laws were introduced was published in July by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare- a government body.It found daily smoking rates fell at their fastest pace for two decades between 2010 and December 1, 2013, when one in eight Australians said they lit up at least once a day.The survey found young people were delaying taking up the habit, with the average age rising to 15.9 years, up from 14.2 in 2010. The average number of cigarettes smoked per week also fell, from 111 in 2010 to 96 in 2013.These findings appear to back up those from an earlier study published in the British Medical Journal in 2013. It found smokers who bought plain packs were more likely than branded pack smokers to perceive their cigarettes as low quality and to have thoughts about quitting. The tobacco industry says the AIHW study does not prove plain packaging is working because it includes only a year’s worth of data from when the law changed.Smoking has also been falling in Australia for more than two decades. Recent tobacco tax rises are also likely to have had an impact, making a direct causal link between plain packaging and smoking reductions more difficult to prove.The big three tobacco companies in Australia, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris, say their sales in the country increased by 59m cigarettes in 2013, the first rise for five years. They warn of a rise in tobacco smuggling while industry insiders say the real impact of plain packaging is that consumers are likely to switch to cheaper brands. But if plain packaging is not a threat to the profits of tobacco companies, antismoking campaigners ask why they oppose it so vociferously.The scale of industry opposition is clear from the many law cases it has pursued in Australia — and lost — and which it is still fighting at the World Trade Organisation. Any country that follows Australia’s example can expect a similar onslaught.

Instability in Russia has forced companies to raise prices, suspend sales and even cease trading in the country altogether.Drinks companies are the most exposed non-financial businesses, according to Citi, with Russia accounting for more than 30 per cent of sales at Carlsberg and 22 per cent at Coca-Cola Hellenic, the world’s second-largest bottler of Coca-Cola.Carlsberg, which has said it does not plan to pull out of Russia, has previously indicated that a one rouble swing against the euro could have a DKr100m (£10m) effect on forecast operating profits.The collapse in value of the rouble in December could therefore hit Carlsberg’s full-year results by as much as a third, according to Andrew Holland, drinks analyst at Société Générale.But daily swings in the currency have made it difficult to predict the final impact, he added.Mr Holland said he would not be changing his forecasts for the company, which has issued two profit warnings this year, until there was greater stability in the Russian currency.The falling value of the rouble has a twofold effect on companies operating in Russia. Sales numbers are hit when they are translated into other currencies and the cost of buying goods from outside the country also rises due to the relative weakness of the rouble.Danone, the French food and drinks company, is Russia’s largest dairy producer and relies on the country for 11 per cent of its sales. The company suggested the impact on its costs due to the rouble rout would be minimised as it trades in Russia “very much at a local level with local brands”.Retailers have raised prices in an effort to protect their margins. Ikea suspended sales of some products on its website last week after customers rushed to buy goods before price rises.The Swedish flat-pack furniture company resumed all sales on Saturday, but Apple, which ceased all trading on its Russian website on Wednesday, is yet to restart sales.Russia has been a source of difficulty for many international retailers operating there. New Look, the British fashion retailer, pulled out of the country in November, closing 20 franchised stores, while Mothercare, Marks and Spencer and Asos have all counted the cost of instability in the country in statements this year.“Pretty much every company with international aspirations has been looking at Russia. But it’s not the attractive market it once was. These are medium-term issues that aren’t going to be resolved quickly,” said Freddie George, retail analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. He said retail companies were likely to delay plans for expansion in the country as a result of the latest turmoil.Luxury brands too have been hit and are likely to reduce or freeze capital expenditure in Russia, according to Luca Solca, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. Russia accounts for roughly 4 per cent of the international personal luxury market.Spending by Russian tourists abroad has been weakening throughout 2014, but until recently domestic spending had remained strong, according to Mr Solca.“Spend in Russia has held up very well — at least up until this week, when luxury players have started to adjust Russian prices up materially,” he said.Tobacco companies too are expecting to suffer from the falling rouble. Russia is the second-largest tobacco market in the world after China and according to Citi accounts for double-digit percentage sales of Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris International.While tobacco groups are accustomed to operating in unstable countries, the weak rouble will affect sales, according to Chris Wickham, tobacco analyst at Oriel Securities.“What you can’t avoid is currency. If you move into challenging currency conditions you have to translate that,” he said.
88;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2014-12-11T16:38:53Z;Strong dollar hits US corporate profits;Euro weakness had the biggest impact, followed by yen and rouble;A strengthening dollar is proving a costly headache to companies across the US and Europe.The rising greenback shaved $8bn off North American and European third-quarter sales, with more than 275 companies warning of negative foreign exchange impacts in the period, data from currency consultancy FiREapps shows.The dollar, which climbed nearly 8 per cent against the euro and yen in the quarter to September 30, has proved an added hitch for companies dependent on foreign sales, particularly as economic growth in Europe and Asia disappoints.“The top and bottom line are heavily impacted by foreign exchange,” said Wolfgang Koester, chief executive of FiREapps. “This problem of currency exposure is not just 220 currency pairs — the dollar between each country, etc — but rather to a much higher power as companies move currencies between different countries.”The total currency effect on revenues increased 196 per cent from a quarter earlier, the report found, as FX volatility rose. FiREapps, which analysed the earnings calls of 1,200 publicly traded companies with at least 15 per cent of revenues derived from a foreign market, says that trend will probably continue.US companies that quantified the foreign exchange impact on profits said earnings were on average reduced by 3 cents a share due to currency swings.Diverging monetary policy in Europe and the US has driven a wedge between one of the most active currency pairs, with strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecasting the euro to weaken by another 10 cents against the dollar by the end of 2016.“Fundamental issues including the rollback of stimulus in the US and eventually rising US interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe, devaluation in Japan, falling oil prices and geopolitical turmoil will continue to drive turbulence in the currency markets well into 2015,” Mr Koester says.More than two-fifths of S&P 500 sales were generated abroad in 2013, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices shows, presenting a challenge to a vast majority of the index’s constituents.The euro was most often mentioned as a culprit in the 846 US corporate earnings calls analysed by FiREapps, followed, in order, by the yen, rouble, Brazilian real and Venezuelan bolívar.Executives with Hewlett-Packard, Campbell Soup and Salesforce warned recently that currency headwinds would weigh on results, while Philip Morris International chief executive André Calantzopoulos said his company had “been hammered by currency this year to a much higher degree than we possibly could have anticipated”.General Motors called the rouble “a headwind for us, no question”, with the Turkish lira and UK pound also key to the company’s European results.“The rouble has a big impact and then you have to see how much are we able to price against it. But then of course you see a corresponding volume impact,” Michael Lohscheller, chief financial officer of GM’s Opel Group, said last week at a conference.Strategists on Wall Street note a stronger dollar and weaker pricing power could curtail profit gains, with S&P 500 year-on-year earnings growth expectations currently sitting at 9.3 per cent. That, in turn, could hit stock performance.“Given the unanimous global optimism on US financial and macro leadership which follows massive US outperformance, US EPS disappointment would be very damaging for risk appetite,” said Michael Hartnett, a strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
89;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Cigarettes: smoke ’em if you got ’em;An indoor smoking ban in Beijing would send a bad signal;"Smokers in the developed world are out in the cold. Regulators have moved smoking from bars into streets; advertising has moved from screens to, at best, still pictures. Two years ago, Australia introduced “plain” packaging – adorned with such gruesome warnings that the adjective hardly fits.Yet the stocks have done well. Since late 2008, the top five names in the sector have returned between 144 per cent (Imperial) and 347 per cent (Altria). Most tobacco companies have beaten the 130 per cent return of the MSCI World index. Such resilience may be ending.This week China, home to 300m smokers and accounting for a third of the world’s tobacco use, according to Euromonitor, announced a ban in Beijing’s indoor public spaces, to commence in June. The Chinese market is dominated by state-owned enterprises and counterfeit goods, so the direct impact on multinationals will be small. But the message is clear. Growth will become harder to find, even in the emerging world.Last year, tougher regulations hit developed-market volumes and even pricing – often hidden behind tax rises – is softening a bit. So far this year, both Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris International have seen sales declines accelerate in previously reliable markets such as eastern Europe.Forecasts are faltering: expected earnings per share have fallen about one-tenth as the year has progressed. Typical is Philip Morris, with 70 per cent of sales in emerging markets. Since its 2008 spin-off from US-focused parent Altria, the company has achieved annual earnings per share growth of one-tenth. This year, growth will fall 6 per cent. Japan Tobacco and British American have a similar tale of woe. And yet the stocks are not cheap, on mid-teens multiples of 2015 EPS.These companies generate lots of cash. Their dividends look safe. But weaker profits could cut into share buybacks. These have long been a key reason to invest in Philip Morris shares. British American had been ramping up buybacks, until its recent investment in Reynolds American.

90;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2014-11-03T18:36:23Z;Tobacco groups win right to challenge EU health rules;;Tobacco companies have won the right to challenge EU rules requiring health warnings on cigarette packaging and banning menthol cigarettes.The EU passed rules in April that tightened controls on the sale of tobacco in Europe, an important but declining market for tobacco companies.British American Tobacco, Philip Morris International and Imperial Tobacco were among those who challenged the rules in June. On Monday the High Court in London allowed the case to proceed to the European Court of Justice, the EU’s highest court.The EU’s Tobacco Products Directive includes a ban on cigarettes and tobacco with “characterising flavours” and also requires that health warnings should cover 65 per cent of tobacco packaging. The rules are set to come into force in the first half of 2016, giving EU member states two years to bring legislation into line.BAT, the British tobacco company that makes Lucky Strike cigarettes, said the new rules would help to fuel illicit trade in tobacco and that people in the EU were already aware of the dangers of smoking.“Measures, such as the menthol ban, will simply fuel the black market for illicit tobacco creating profits for the criminals that run it,” said Will Hill, BAT spokesperson.PMI said the EU’s rules raised questions about consumer choice, the free movement of goods and competition.“There is no disagreement that tobacco products should be strictly regulated, but measures must honour the EU treaties,” said Marc Firestone, PMI senior vice-president.Antismoking charity Ash said the rules had been approved democratically by the EU as a whole and that the tobacco industry was trying to “derail” the legislation.“We trust the European Court of Justice will dismiss the industry’s spurious arguments against these important measures which will provide a high level of health protection to our population,” said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash.Critics claim that international arbitration has morphed into a weapon that multinationals wield to threaten and influenceFurther readingSmoking in Europe is in long-term decline but tobacco companies are trying to ensure it is a slow and managed fall. A combination of regulation, greater awareness about the risks of smoking, and poor economic growth has made it more difficult to sell cigarettes in Europe.BAT’s latest results showed a small drop in global tobacco volumes, primarily driven by large decreases in the Americas and western Europe.“Tighter regulation and growing awareness of the effects of smoking on health mean fewer consumers are taking up the habit,” Lola Cavanilles, analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.Moody’s recently cut its estimates for operating profit growth in the European tobacco industry to 2.5 – 3.5 per cent, down from 4.5 – 5.5 per cent forecast in late 2013.The battle over tobacco regulation in the EU is part of a global trend towards stronger restrictions on the sale of cigarettes. France has said it will restrict ecigarettes and introduce plain packaging.Australia introduced plain packaging in 2012 and smoking rates have since fallen at their fastest pace in two decades, according to recent survey data, though the survey was criticised by tobacco companies.Last month the World Health Organisation strengthened its global tobacco control treaty at a meeting in Moscow. It added guidelines for annual increases in tobacco taxes to ensure they are kept in line with inflation and income growth.
91;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2014-10-22T17:43:19Z;BAT reports decline in tobacco volumes as smokers kick the habit;Rival cigarettes groups battle for market share amid price rises and falls;British American Tobacco, whose brands include Dunhill and Lucky Strike, reported a decline in tobacco volumes, as smokers continued to cut back and rivals battled for market share.Total tobacco volume worldwide fell 1 per cent in the nine months to September 30. The drop was driven primarily by falls in the Americas and Western Europe, which tend to have tighter restrictions on tobacco than in emerging economies.In Australia the company increased the price of its cigarettes in September following a rise in taxes that month. Two weeks later it reversed the price rise after rival Philip Morris International decided not to follow suit, undercutting BAT, which accounts for about 60 per cent of the market.BAT faced similar “competitive pricing activity” in Malaysia, the company said in Wednesday’s interim statement.“In the markets this year there’s been a few skirmishes,” said James Bushnell, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.A strong pound hit BAT’s results, with reported revenue down 9.6 per cent in the nine-month period. Stripping out the effect of currency movements, revenue grew 2.4 per cent, which missed consensus expectations of a 3.2 per cent rise.The share price initially dropped 4.7 per cent, the largest fall for BAT since 2011. It later recovered to close at £33.75, down 2.6 per cent.

Signatories of the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which provides global guidelines on antismoking policies, are obliged to “protect” legislation from the tobacco industry’s lobbying.The WHO has taken the step of sending delegates attending the conference a warning letter about the ITIC meeting, reminding attendees about their obligations not to let the tobacco industry influence anti-tobacco policy.Deborah Arnott, chief executive of antismoking charity ASH, said: “Of course the ITIC is arguing against the WHO tobacco tax guidelines – it’s funded by the big tobacco multinationals. The WHO has quite rightly warned governments to stay away from this industry front group.”British American Tobacco, Philip Morris International, Japan Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco are sponsors of the ITIC and have representatives on its board of directors, along with other large multinationals.Daniel Witt, president of ITIC, defended the meeting. “ITIC serves as a neutral forum for discussions on tax and investment policy – a place where governments can go for technically sound, objective, and field-tested advice.”He added: “It is our understanding that this briefing is fully compliant with the [the WHO’s] FCTC.”The private meeting, which is being held in a luxury hotel in Moscow, will be “closed to media and industry representatives”. It is being run in conjunction with the Eurasian Economic Commission, the newly formed customs union between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.The invitation states: “The purpose of the briefing will be to assemble Ministry of Finance and Tax Administration representatives ahead of the WHO meeting to review international practices on tobacco excise taxation.”The tobacco industry argues that it should have a say when it comes to tax issues. However, the WHO will debate measures aimed at ensuring tax policies are “protected” from the industry at the conference, which starts in Moscow on 13 October.Antismoking advocates argue that increased excise duties are one of the most effective ways of reducing cigarette consumption. But higher taxes on cigarettes can lead to increased profitability at large tobacco companies, which can raise their prices beneath any duty increases.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:ITIC advances fact-based tax and economic reform / From James C Miller III
93;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2014-07-17T01:36:04Z;Australia smoking rates tumble after plain packaging shift;;Smoking rates in Australia fell at their fastest pace in more than two decades, following the introduction of the world’s first law forcing cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging.The daily smoking rate fell 15 per cent between 2010 and December 1 2013, when one in eight Australians said they lit up at least once a day, according to the most comprehensive survey undertaken since the new rules came into force.The survey showed that young people are delaying taking up smoking, with the average age that people consume their first full cigarette rising to 15.9 years, up from 14.2 years in 2010. The average number of cigarettes smoked per week also fell, from 111 in 2010 to 96 in 2013.Anti-tobacco activists said the findings of the National Drugs Strategy Household Survey, which is the largest and longest running study on cigarette use in Australia, could encourage other countries to introduce similar laws.“Australia’s dramatic results should spur action by other countries considering plain packaging, including the UK, Ireland and New Zealand,” said Matthew Myers, president of the US-based Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.Australia, which introduced plain packaging in December 2012, is at the centre of a global debate over whether laws removing all corporate branding and adding graphic health warnings can reduce smoking. Tobacco companies claim the rules do not work and say they infringe their intellectual property rights.Canberra faces a legal challenge from tobacco industry at the Permanent Court of Arbitration – an international investment tribunal – over plain packaging. Several tobacco-producing countries are separately taking legal action at the World Trade Organisation.Assessing the effectiveness of the plain packaging regulations has proved difficult so far as reliable and timely data have been scarce. This has led to competing assertions by anti-tobacco campaigners and cigarette companies.The big three tobacco companies in Australia – British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris – said last month their combined sales in the country increased by 59m cigarettes or equivalent in 2013, the first rise in five years, following the introduction of plain packaging.This was challenged by anti-tobacco advocates and economists, who said sales statistics collected by Australia’s national statistics agency showed a drop in consumption.Anti-tobacco advocates seized on the new more comprehensive survey data published on Thursday as evidence that plain packaging is working to reduce smoking rates.“They are the best results on smoking that I have seen. The decline in smoking is really dramatic and exceptionally encouraging – even speeding up,” said Mike Daube, a health policy professor and president of the Australian Council on Smoking and Health.Simon Chapman, a professor in public health at the University of Sydney, told the Sydney Morning Herald that plain packaging was almost “like finding a vaccine that works very well against lung cancer”.Imperial Tobacco told ABC radio that the survey showed there was no departure from the existing trends in relation to declines in smoking prevalence.The National Drugs Strategy Household Survey is commissioned by the government and has been conducted every two to three years since 1985. The 2013 survey collected data from almost 24,000 people across Australia between July 31 and December 1 2013.——————————————-Letters in response to this report:It is wrong to suggest plain packaging has worked / From Mr Daniel TorrasDon’t trust lobbies on smoking data / From Dr Eoin O’Malley
94;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2014-07-15T16:01:32Z;Imperial Tobacco powers ahead in ecigarette market;;Imperial Tobacco’s acquisition of Blu from Lorillard has catapulted the Bristol-based group ahead of the other big four tobacco companies in the ecigarette market.While global rivals British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris International have all now entered the ecigarette market, Blu is the largest ecigarette brand in the world.Blu accounts for nearly half of all ecigarette sales in the US, which is itself the largest market for ecigarettes, with annual sales of $1.7bn.Reynolds American’s willingness to sell Blu left analysts perplexed. “We were surprised to see the Blu divesture,” said Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo.“Divesting Blu was a business decision,” said Reynolds chief executive Susan Cameron. “It was important to Imperial.”But Imperial’s chief executive Alison Cooper played down the role of Blu in the deal. “The real value today is in those cigarette brands that we have acquired,” Ms Cooper said.Imperial had been cautious about ecigarettes, especially compared with London-listed British American Tobacco, which entered the market a year before Imperial.Deal will boost US presence of Imperial Tobacco, which will triple its market share with the purchase of the Kool, Salem, Winston, Maverick cigarette and Blu ecigarette brandsLorillard, which owned Blu, was one of nine ecigarette manufacturers being sued by Imperial Tobacco subsidiary Fontem Ventures over alleged intellectual property infringements. Ms Cooper said that the lawsuit played no role in the acquisition.Ms Cameron said that Reynolds’ own ecigarette brand, called Vuse, could hold its own. “We have such confidence in Vuse’s game-changing technology,” Ms Cameron said. Reynolds is planning an aggressive roll-out of Vuse across the US, after launching a test in Colorado last year.While ecigarettes dominate the headlines, the market is still tiny compared with the overall tobacco market. Global tobacco sales were more than $700bn last year, according to Euromonitor. By comparison, global ecigarette sales were $3bn – against BAT’s £2.7bn dividend.
95;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2014-06-29T16:00:08Z;Philip Morris: debt addiction;Cigarette maker’s financial model is admirable, but increasing indebtedness must change;The year 2014 is proving to be “truly atypical” for Philip Morris International, its boss says. This means, in short, that the company’s performance will be neither as strong as it has been in the past, nor as strong as he expects it to be in the future. The company’s recently released target is for earnings per share (excluding the hits from currency and plant closures) to grow by 6 to 8 per cent this year.Over the past five years, Philip Morris’ EPS grew more than 10 per cent annually, on average, despite flat sales volumes. Price increases give the top line a bump of about 5 per cent each year. Operating leverage and cost control provide another point or two of growth. And then stock buybacks kick EPS into the double digits. Meanwhile, over half of earnings are paid out as dividends, giving investors a fat yield. Nice model, smooth results and a stock that has outperformed over time.The growth and the dividend, backed by the stability of selling an addictive product, has the shares – even after a dip last week – trading at 16 times forward earnings, above its historical average. Is this peaky, given that the company is having a wobbly year? Hard to say, when the whole market is trading at highs.There is a worry, though. The model has depended on borrowing. Since the end of 2008, the company has spent $56bn on its own shares and dividends, and generated $43bn of free cash flow. The gap shows up as a $14bn increase in net debt. The company’s ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation is a middling 2, but rising fast. The chief financial officer has said that, to keep its credit rating, Philip Morris “will have to bring our cash outflow in line with our inflow”. That will mean reducing either buybacks or dividends – these cost $2.7bn more than the company brought in last year. If the stock did not react to this change, that would be very atypical indeed.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
96;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Plain packaging and currency swings weigh on Philip Morris;;"Philip Morris International, the world’s largest tobacco company by market share, blamed currency swings, the introduction of plain packaging in Australia and the rise of illicit tobacco in the Philippines for a drop in its projected earnings.The Marlboro-maker, which makes and distributes the brand outside the US, cited a “complex and truly atypical year” for the fact that its adjusted earnings per share growth for 2014 will be at the lower end of its 6 to 8 per cent guidance.Chief executive André Calantzopoulos blamed the introduction of plain packaging in Australia for some of the performance, with smokers buying cheaper cigarettes rather than PMI’s premium brands, such as Marlboro.“With plain packaging, adult smokers do not quit more or smoke less,” said Mr Calantzopoulos. “They do, however, appear to down-trade much more readily to lower price, lower margin brands and illicit products.”PMI has been at the forefront of the industry’s fight against plain packaging, launching a challenge against the law under Australia’s trade treaty with Hong Kong.The chief executive added that PMI will “engage in a dialogue” with regulators in other countries that are set to introduce plain packaging, including the UK and Ireland.But Mr Calantzopoulos warned that PMI will “pursue other alternatives to ensure protection of our intellectual property”. Rival tobacco groups, such as British American Tobacco, have already hinted at legal action if the UK follows Australia and introduces plain packaging.Australia was not the only Asian market that PMI struggled in, with the Philippines also proving troublesome. In the Philippines, PMI said that it was damaged by the market being flooded with non-duty-paid cigarettes by domestic rivals.“This continues to prevent us from being able to operate on a level playing field,” said Matteo Pellegrini, president of PMI’s Asian division.PMI took its First Direct step into the e-cigarette business in the UK, by buying Nicocigs, which makes Nicolites. The tobacco group had previously agreed an
e-cigarette distribution deal with Altria Group, the US tobacco group from which PMI was spun out in 2008.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo, said: “We believe PMI’s solid execution will continue despite challenging conditions and we are encouraged by PMI’s investments in e­vapor as we believe it will be a game changer for the global tobacco industry.”Elsewhere in the sector, Imperial Tobacco completed the pricing for the forthcoming float of Logista, its logistics business. The price range of €12.50 to €15.50 will give Logista a market capitalisation of up to €1.9bn.Shares in PMI fell 2.6 per cent to $86.54 in New York trading."

The data will provide fresh ammunition to campaigners in countries such as the UK, which is considering similar rules.Figures published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday show households consumed A$3.4bn (US$3.2bn) in tobacco and cigarettes in the three months to the end of March 2014, almost A$1bn lower than a decade earlier.“Plain packaging was always a long-term measure, aimed especially at children, so the positive indicators around sales are especially encouraging,” said Mike Daube, a health policy professor and president of the Australian Council on Smoking and Health.However, the tobacco industry disputed the interpretation of the government statistics, saying its own data suggest cigarette sales rose in Australia last year for the first time in five years.Big tobacco is fighting a global lobbying campaign to counter the spread of plain packaging laws. It lost a high-profile legal case in Australia in which it had argued the laws violated tobacco companies’ trademark rights and restricted free trade.Canberra is facing legal challenges at the World Trade Organisation from several tobacco-producing states.They arrived in three black sport utility vehicles and spent an hour searching Vincent van Heerden’s home, filling three rubbish bags before leaving.“The whole process was pretty invasive and surreal,” says Mr van Heerden.The raid by health department officials in Western Australia was conducted because he had set up Heavenly Vapours, a business selling electronic cigarettes.E-cigarettes containing nicotine are illegal in Australia, which has among the toughest anti-tobacco laws in the world.Assessing the effectiveness of the plain packaging regulations is difficult as reliable and timely data are scarce. No comprehensive surveys on smoking rates have been completed since the ABS found 16.3 per cent of Australian adults smoked daily in 2011-2012, down from 22.4 per cent a decade earlier. Last year a study of 500 smokers commissioned by the Cancer Society of Victoria found plain packaging reduced the appeal of smoking and increased smokers’ thoughts about quitting.The new ABS estimates show the volume of cigarettes and tobacco consumed by households, a measure that removes pricing impacts from the data. The trend measure fell to its lowest level since 1959 in the three months to the end of March.The big three tobacco companies in Australia – British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris – played down the ABS figures, saying their combined sales had increased by 59m cigarettes or equivalent in 2013, the first rise in five years.BAT said the ABS figures also showed a rise in consumption in the year after the introduction of plain packaging. It said the drop recorded in the first quarter of 2014 followed a 12.5 per cent rise in excise duty introduced in December 2013, which may have influenced the figures.“Plain packs and excise has seen smokers look for cheaper products, and instead of quitting they’re saving money,” said Mr McIntyre.This week BAT began selling a A$13 pack of 25 cigarettes, saying the introduction of plain packaging was forcing companies to compete on price. A high-end pack sells for up to A$25 in Australia.Big tobacco also claims smuggling is increasing, citing a KPMG report, which it financed, that found illegal consumption of tobacco in Australia increased to 13.9 per cent in 2013, up from 11.8 per cent a year earlier.Australia’s customs service does not support the claim, noting in its annual report for 2012-13 that the “threat posed by tobacco smuggling remained relatively stable during the year”.Most experts say the full impact of plain packaging is likely to take years to become clear. But Mr Daube said the best indicator that the law was working was the sheer desperation of the tobacco industry in its relentless campaign against the measure.“Tobacco companies have been lying for 50 years,” he said. “Why would they stop now?”

During shifts as long as 12 hours, these workers – some as young as seven – are exposed to nicotine, pesticides and extreme heat.These are not dispatches from Malawi or Kazakhstan, but a Human Rights Watch report on the US, where the world’s biggest tobacco companies, including British American Tobacco, Philip Morris International, Japan Tobacco and Altria, buy some of their leaves.The report highlights an area of reputational risk for an industry that is already spending billions of dollars a year complying with a patchwork of national and international regulations.Specific numbers are not tracked, but hundreds of thousands of children are believed to work on US farms growing all kinds of crops, from tomatoes and berries to cotton and tobacco. HRW interviewed 141 children between the ages of seven and 17 working on tobacco farms in four US states.Young agricultural workers face higher rates of death and injury than their peers, and tobacco carries added risk from nicotine. But there is little consensus on industry-wide child labour policies.India, Brazil and Russia have banned anyone under 18 from working with tobacco, but in the US, children as young as 12, and sometimes younger, can work on farms.While the report did not directly connect any companies to the farms involved, it describes “common practice” in tobacco cultivation, said co-author Jane Buchanan. “The burden falls on [the companies] to say that this isn’t happening on their farms.”Child labour is not a new concern for the industry, but approaches vary widely. Some companies, including BAT and Imperial, follow International Labour Organization conventions, which set the minimum age to work at 15 and prohibit children from hazardous work. Others, including Lorillard and Reynolds American, require suppliers to follow national laws.The burden falls on [the companies] to say that this isn’t happening on their farmsUS law allows children as young as 12 to do unlimited farm work outside of school with parental permission. There are no age limits for children working on their families’ farms. Outside of agriculture, children cannot work until they are 14 and those under 16 can only do certain jobs with limited hours.In 2011 the Obama administration proposed updates to the 1970s-era labour law, including limiting the kinds of work kids can do on farms. But those changes were scrapped after opposition from the agriculture industry.“The laws in the US are substandard,” said Dan Viederman, chief executive of Verité, a non-profit watchdog that works with Philip Morris International. “The age is lower and there are really no meaningful limits on what children can do.”The gap between US and international standards mean that companies’ policies in the US can be more lax than the rules they follow in other countries.Altria, which owns Marlboro in the US, “defers” to government regulators to define hazardous work because “we’re not experts in farm labour”, said spokesman Jeff Caldwell.Altria requires growers to assign hazardous tasks only to workers over age 18. Mr Caldwell said the company recently assessed all its contracted farms and found a “very very high” level of compliance.Human Rights Watch cited Philip Morris International, which sells Marlboro, L & M and Parliament outside the US, with creating “the most detailed and protective set of policies and procedures” on child labour.Following a 2010 HRW investigation into child labour at PMI’s suppliers in Kazakhstan, the company created a labour policy for all its growers. It sets the minimum age to work at 15 and spells out hazardous work that children under 18 cannot perform, including handling pesticides and fertilisers, harvesting plants, using sharp tools and working long hours.The laws in the US are substandard. The age is lower and there are really no meaningful limits on what children can do“In the US we are maintaining standards that are stricter than US laws both in terms of age and of hazardous activities,” said Miguel Coleta, PMI’s director of external labour policies. The company spent $30m last year to improve labour conditions at its suppliers. Since 2012, PMI has ended contracts with about 20 US growers who did not want to abide by its policies.PMI, Altria, Reynolds and Japan Tobacco are part of a group working with government, growers and labour representatives on work practices. Following a presentation by Human Rights Watch in April, the group has formed a committee on child labour.HRW said it would like to see the industry go further. The watchdog is calling on the US government to apply labour laws to agriculture and prohibit children under 18 from working with tobacco, and for companies to apply the same restrictions.“As a practical matter there is no way for children under 18 to work safely on US tobacco farms when they have direct contact with tobacco plants of any size or dried tobacco leaves, even if wearing protective equipment,” the report concluded.Mr Coleta said PMI would support some efforts to strengthen US law, but would stop short of a full ban.“We would welcome any regulatory change in the US that would meet international standards and the standards that we’re pushing,” he said. But, he added, “we don’t think this is something that we can do alone.”shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
99;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2014-05-09T21:59:44Z;Uruguay’s smoking laws draw tobacco fire;;While Uruguay has been celebrated by liberals around the world for its bold steps to regulate cannabis, with new rules taking effect this week, its similarly pioneering attempts to control smoking of another, legal plant – tobacco – has earned it powerful enemies.Tobacco company Philip Morris is suing the tiny South American country for $25m at the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), marking the first time a tobacco group has taken on a country in an international court.Known as “the Switzerland of South America”, Uruguay’s reputation as one of the best places to invest in the region is also at stake, with Philip Morris presenting its arguments at the ICSID in March that the nation has violated terms of a bilateral investment treaty with the real Switzerland, where it has its headquarters in Lausanne.The world’s biggest tobacco company – whose annual revenues of $77bn across 180 countries far exceed Uruguay’s gross domestic product of about $50bn – claims that a 2009 anti-tobacco law damages its intellectual property rights and has hit sales, in what is being seen as a test case for the tobacco industry.President José “Pepe” Mujica is due to seek support from US President Barack Obama in the legal dispute at their meeting on May 12 in Washington, when the former guerrilla who spent years in solitary confinement will also discuss whether Uruguay will receive prisoners from Guantánamo Bay.“It is ironic that on the one hand Uruguay is making it easier to smoke marijuana, while at the same time it is clamping down on tobacco,” said one industry insider.But John Walsh, a drugs policy expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, says Uruguay’s trailblazing efforts to regulate marijuana and tobacco industries are consistent. “With tobacco they are bringing to heel a legal industry that is accustomed to operating with scant control, while with marijuana they are taking an industry out from the shadows and putting it under better control,” he said.Nevertheless, there have been contrasting reactions in the international community and the UN in particular, with the World Health Organisation and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg praising Uruguay’s campaign against tobacco. It became the first country to ban multiple sub-brands of cigarettes in 2010, having already been the first in the region to ban smoking in enclosed public spaces in 2006.On the one hand Uruguay is making it easier to smoke marijuana, while at the same time it is clamping down on tobaccoBut when Uruguay was first to legalise the process from the planting to the smoking of pot last December, the International Narcotics Control Board criticised its “pirate attitude” for going against its conventions on drugs, despite winning praise elsewhere for seeking alternatives to a “war on drugs” that is increasingly seen by Latin American leaders to have failed.Philip Morris, which has also filed lawsuits against regulations in Australia and Thailand, opposes the Uruguayan anti-tobacco law’s requirements that graphic health warnings cover 80 per cent of both sides of cigarette packets, and that brands have a single image, thereby prohibiting sub-brands such as Marlboro Red or Marlboro Gold.“At the bottom of all this is a desire to control everything,” said Daniel Radío, an independent lawmaker and former doctor. Although he favours cannabis legalisation in theory, he is critical of the intrusive and prohibitive nature of Uruguay’s system, which he calls “anti-liberal”. He points to requirements to register in order to buy cannabis at state-controlled pharmacies, or in the case of tobacco, “making people feel guilty about smoking cigarettes”.Philip Morris has not expressed interest in producing marijuana cigarettes in Uruguay, although it represents a pioneer market along with countries that permit the use of medicinal marijuana like Canada, Israel and the US.The legalisation of marijuana in the states of Colorado and Washington is creating a regulated pot industry, with cannabis-focused private equity funds sprouting up that hope to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to tap into an industry projected to reach sales of $2.6bn this year – that compares to just $30m-$40m in Uruguay.The government of Uruguay will take applications for up to six licences from companies to grow the drug commercially, with military oversight and protection, for sale in state-controlled pharmacies. It is expected to be available by the end of the year for about $1 per gram, mirroring the price on the black market which is largely supplied by low-grade illegal produce from Paraguay.Indeed, Paraguay’s President Horacio Cartes, who owns the nation’s largest cigarette manufacturer, opposes legalising cannabis in his country, which is believed to be the second-biggest producer of illegal marijuana in the world after Mexico. He once claimed: “I have seen former high school classmates suffer and die because of the effects of marijuana.”Philip Morris is suing Uruguay for $25m, not $2bn as reported in an earlier version of this story
100;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2014-04-25T17:12:52Z;Hamish Maxwell, consumer marketing executive, 1926-2014;The former chief of Philip Morris who used the tobacco group’s cash hoard to buy food businesses;When Philip Morris directors gathered in 1983 to choose their next chief executive, it was not at their new Manhattan headquarters but in the Swiss city of Lausanne. Fittingly so, because what was on their minds was the need to diversify the Marlboro maker away from an already slowing US cigarette market.So it was appropriate too that Hamish Maxwell, the man they chose, was a non-American who had risen through the growing international side of the business. The soft-spoken Liverpudlian had made his name at the company through marketing prowess and his role in buying into Rothmans, pipping the rival RJ Reynolds to a deal with Anton Rupert, that brand’s South African owner.By the time he landed the top job, Philip Morris had non-tobacco interests including beer (Miller) and soft drinks (7UP). But Maxwell, who has died aged 87, set about deploying the group’s cash hoard in the food business. Into the fold came names such as General Foods and Kraft in the US and, from Switzerland, Jacobs Suchard.It was a splurge totalling more than $22bn – of which the unsolicited bid Maxwell launched for Kraft was both the biggest and the most contentious. Sir Martin Sorrell, whose WPP advertising empire he went on to serve as non-executive chairman for five years, says Maxwell remained a devotee of hostile takeovers. “He thought they were more disciplined” compared with deals in which a suitor out to pacify might more easily overpay.“He understood the politics of the chairman-CEO relationship,” adds Sir Martin. “If he had a strong view on anything he would ‘take me out to the woodshed’,” imparting his thoughts privately “with no attempt to grandstand”.It was a humility born in part from a need no longer to prove anything – during his tenure Philip Morris had briefly become the biggest company on the planet by market value – but also perhaps the rapidity with which his successors there unwound his legacy.In an increasingly antismoking west, the food and drinks operations were becoming tainted by their association with big tobacco. Maxwell’s decision to sell 7UP presaged the shedding of the rest of the group once his seven-year term ended. Renamed Altria, Philip Morris is again a “pure” US cigarette manufacturer, though still with an interest in what is now SABMiller.Maxwell, whose own early division was spun off as the Lausanne-based Philip Morris International, was reconciled to the outcome. In Ashes to Ashes, a 1996 account by Richard Kluger of “America’s Hundred-Year Cigarette War”, he is quoted as saying: “I had no strong sense that the company structure had to be forever.” Nor indeed did cigarettes: the chief executive of the tobacco market leader gave up the habit once confronted with heart bypass surgery.While Maxwell’s deal-studded career brought high drama, that “was certainly behind the scenes” and the family was unaware of much of it, says his daughter Graham Russell, who survives him along with her sister Robin and their paternal aunt Hilary. His death came barely a year after that of his wife Georgene, known as Gee Gee, whom he met in an early job at Thomas Cook in New York.At home Maxwell unwound by listening to opera and Broadway show tunes, displaying little trace of the “high level of constructive dissatisfaction” that colleagues depicted. Neither did he admit to being troubled by the nature of his industry. “I have no feelings of guilt, no trouble sleeping at night,” he told Fortune magazine during his tenure. “There was a time when people thought drinking was much worse a sin than smoking. Both can be abused, but each gives pleasure and has social value.’’Born on August 24 1926 into a tobacco importing dynasty with roots in Scotland and northwest England, Hamish William Hyslop Maxwell had his schooling north of the border at Glenalmond while his father Alexander was put in charge of the UK’s second world war rationing of a product that around half the adult population then smoked. Before settling in the US he served in the Royal Air Force and went to Cambridge university.At Philip Morris he became one of its furthest-flung managers, overseeing the Asia-Pacific region from Melbourne, before a US executive career during which the Maxwells shunned the allure of Manhattan for a home in Brooklyn Heights. In recent years they settled in Florida’s Palm Beach but he remained a keen patron of the avant-garde Brooklyn Academy of Music.As Sir Martin puts it, steely determination ensured Maxwell’s business success but by also being “very much a gentleman . . . he was the best chairman WPP ever had”.
101;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2014-04-14T09:41:52Z;South Korea’s health insurer sues tobacco companies;;By Song Jung-a in SeoulSouth Korea’s state-run health insurer has filed a lawsuit against three tobacco companies including Philip Morrisand British American Tobacco, seeking Won53.7bn ($52m) in damages amid ballooning healthcare costs for smoking-related diseases.The National Health Insurance Service said on Monday it was suing the local units of the two global cigarette makers as well as domestic market leader KT&G, a former state-run tobacco monopoly, in Seoul Central District Court. The NHIS estimates its annual healthcare costs linked to smoking at more than Won1.7tn.This is the first lawsuit against tobacco companies by a state agency among 37 countries in the western Pacific, according to the World Health Organisation’s Western Pacific Regional Office.Ahn Sun-young, the state health insurer’s lawyer, told a news conference that the initial damages sought were calculated based on its payments between 2003 and 2012 for patients with three cancer types associated with smoking, and said the compensation the NHIS is seeking could increase.Analysts were sceptical of NHIS’s chances of success given previous court rulings on similar cases. “There has not been any successful case so far, and it will take years until they reach a final verdict,” said Chung Hye-seung, analyst at HMC Securities. “It is also difficult to prove the causal relationship between smoking and disease.”Ms Chung added: “We don’t expect any big impact on the companies because the amount of damages is relatively small”.South Koreans are among the heaviest smokers in the world with 44.3 per cent of males aged above 15 being smokers, the second highest after Greece among 34 members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2009.Critics have blamed cheap tobacco and the government’s reluctance to more actively warn smokers of its dangers. A pack of cigarettes costs Won2,500 ($2.4) in South Korea, the lowest among the 22 OECD members surveyed by the EU in 2012.Philip Morris and BAT combined account for about a third of South Korea’s $9.3bn tobacco market while KT&G, which was privatised in 2002, controls about 60 per cent of the market.The lawsuit comes after South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled last week in favour of KT&G and the government on a separate case filed by lung cancer patients who claimed they were not fully informed of the dangers of smoking.Philip Morris said the NHIS lawsuit was an “unfair and unreasonable move” because South Korean consumers already shouldered a share of the healthcare costs by paying tax on cigarette purchases.In a statement, KT&G said it would respond to the lawsuit based on how it had dealt with previous lawsuits. BAT declined to comment.Shares in KT&G closed unchanged at Won82,400 in Seoul on Monday.
102;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2014-03-27T20:29:21Z;Official warns EU-US trade deal at risk over investor cases;;Negotiations to create a transatlantic free trade zone risk collapsing if the EU has to drop a provision giving investors the right to seek compensation before special arbitration panels, Europe’s top trade official has warned.The warning on Thursday from Karel De Gucht, the EU’s trade commissioner, highlighted how, even as US President Barack Obama toured Europe this week touting the potential benefits of a transatlantic trade deal, the pact itself is facing an uphill struggle.Business groups argue the an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, which has long been a feature of bilateral investment treaties, is needed to give foreign investors the security they need to deploy capital.But fears that multinational corporations may exploit loopholes in these provisions to circumvent national regulations has produced a backlash in Europe against including them in a EU-US trade deal. In a high-profile case, tobacco group Philip Morris International’s challenged Australia’s plain packaging law for cigarettes via an investment treaty with Hong Kong.Mr De Gucht suspended negotiations over the investment chapter of the mooted Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership in January because of this opposition. On Thursday he launched special public consultations aimed at convincing the European public that the arbitration provision is needed.However, Mr De Gucht said the negotiations to create what would be the world’s biggest free trade zone would be at risk if an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism was not part of the proposed deal.“I doubt it,” he responded when asked if the pact could be concluded without the investor-state dispute provision. “It could very well be that you wouldn’t have an agreement any more.”Both the EU and the US argue that they want to close loopholes that now exist in bilateral investment treaties. Mr De Gucht said the EU was eager to have arbitration hearings heard in public and to preclude challenges to health and safety regulations and other government legislation. The Philip Morris case against Australia would not be possible under the system the EU envisions, he said.But Mr De Gucht is facing scepticism among EU member states over the need for any such provision.In a letter to the European trade commissioner, Germany’s economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, this week questioned the need for such special arbitration panels for foreign investors. France’s trade minister, Nicole Bricq, has also expressed doubts about the measure.There is also a growing backlash elsewhere in the world over investor-state dispute panels. Indonesia has said it will annul more than 60 bilateral investment treaties it has signed because of concerns over a surge in investor-state cases.Faced with its own increasingly vocal opposition, the US on Thursday released an extensive defence of the need for investor-state provisions in its trade agreements, saying they ensured the “same basic legal protections” provided in the US to both American and foreign investors.“Investment protections are intended to prevent discrimination, repudiation of contracts and expropriation of property without due process of law and appropriate compensation,” the office of the US trade representative (USTR) wrote in a blog. “Not all governments protect basic rights at the same level as the US”.The USTR also took on critics of the investment chapters in the EU-US deal and the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership who say the provisions would curb governments’ ability to implement financial, environmental or health regulations.“Some have even suggested that a company could sue a government just on the grounds that the company isn’t earning as much profit as it wants. Those assertions are false,” the USTR said.For its part, the US noted that it had only been sued 17 times under any investment agreement and never lost a case. Between 2009 and 2012, the US undertook a sweeping review of its model for bilateral investment treaties, including the dispute settlement provisions.US business groups see investment provisions as essential to the free trade agreements, and would likely to sorely disappointed if they were dropped or watered down. But doing so would help dampen much of the criticism of the agreements from labour, environmental and other liberal activists who oppose Mr Obama’s trade agenda.
103;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2014-03-14T21:00:06Z;Transatlantic trade talks hit German snag;;Germany has introduced a stumbling block to landmark EU-US trade negotiations by insisting that any pact must exclude a contentious dispute settlement provision.The “investor-state dispute settlement” mechanism, or ISDS, would allow private investors to sue governments if they felt local laws threatened their investments. Public opposition to its inclusion has grown in both Europe and the US since the launch last year of negotiations over a transatlantic trade area.Earlier this year, the European Commission suspended negotiations over the ISDS clause to allow for a 90-day public consultation exercise, expected to be launched within days.That move was intended to help defuse some of the opposition and explain why an arbitration mechanism was needed. But opposition to ISDS has only grown since then.Now, in the biggest blow yet to those seeking its inclusion in the deal, Berlin has decided that it will push for the exclusion of the ISDS provisions in the deal.A spokesman for the economy ministry in Berlin said on Friday that the government had relayed its position to officials in Brussels, where negotiators have ended a week of talks over the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).Earlier in the week, Brigitte Zypries, a junior economy minister, told the German parliament that Berlin was determined to exclude arbitration rights from the TTIP deal.“From the perspective of the [German] federal government, US investors in the EU have sufficient legal protection in the national courts,” she told parliament.The German position pits Berlin against the commission, the US and business groups. All of them argue that the transatlantic deal is an opportunity to update arbitration rights that already feature in existing bilateral investment treaties and are often open to abuse.Such ISDS provisions have been a feature of investment treaties since the late 1950s, when the first was included in a bilateral agreement between Germany and Pakistan. But their use by companies as an avenue to seek compensation for government decisions has grown in recent years.In some cases, they have been used to combat perceived gross injustices against specific investors. Repsol, the Spanish oil company, was able to seek compensation from Argentina under an investment treaty after its local operations were seized by the government in Buenos Aires.They have also been used to challenge broader government policy or regulatory decisions, however. Vattenfall, the Swedish energy company, is currently seeking compensation from Germany for Berlin’s decision to phase out nuclear power following the Fukushima disaster in Japan. In another well-publicised case, Philip Morris International is seeking compensation from Australia for lost income because of the introduction there of plain-packaging laws for tobacco products.The German position may still be open to some negotiation – particularly if both the EU and the US agree to allow arbitration only in extreme cases. Berlin’s final stand may also depend on the European consultation process.But Berlin’s move is a sign of the complicated political context the transatlantic deal faces in Europe.Nicole Bricq, France’s trade minister, has raised concerns before over the ISDS provision. Germany has until now backed its inclusion in the new pact. But Berlin has also been confronted with growing public scepticism in recent months over the transatlantic deal as a whole, and the ISDS provision in particular.At a press conference to mark the close of the fourth round of negotiations on Friday, Dan Mullaney, the leading US negotiator, declined to comment on the German decision.Ignacio Garcia Bercero, the EU’s chief negotiator, also refused to comment on it. But he pointed out that the EU’s original mandate to negotiate specifically included an ISDS provision and had been approved by member states, including Germany.“We are working on the basis of the mandate that has been given to us,” said Mr Garcia Bercero.The provision is opposed by consumer groups and environmentalists on both sides of the Atlantic. They argue that the very threat of litigation could challenge everything from food safety standards to a ban on fracking now in place in France. They also argue that the court systems in both the US and EU are mature enough not to be a concern to foreign investors.Business groups argue, however, that including proper safeguards for investors in a new pact is crucial to help encourage the flow of investment across the Atlantic.“If you want to attract investors, you need to have all of the positive signals on your side,” said Hendrik Bourgeois, vice-president of European affairs for GE, the US industrial group, and chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce to the EU.Business groups and trade negotiators on both sides also argue that including the provision is vital as a precedent for other deals. Both the EU and the US have launched investment discussions with China, and the EU is expected to begin talks on an investment treaty with Myanmar next week. Including investor protection provisions in those deals would be more difficult if they were excluded from the EU-US agreement, negotiators and lobbyists say.The US conducted public consultations on the subject in 2009, leading to the agreement with Congress of a model investment treaty that includes robust investor-protection provisions.The European Commission hopes its consultations will do the same. But some now fear that the EU’s consultations may feed the opposition.“It is important to us that this [EU] public consultation is not a referendum on ISDS. It is important that [ISDS] is included in the agreement,” said Luisa Santos, director of the international relations department of the BusinessEurope lobby group. “Excluding it is not the answer.”——————————————-Letters in response to this article:Investorstate dispute settlement is undemocratic / From Mr Paul de ClerckTrade agreements will enable undue corporate interference / From Ms Yuanqiong Hu
104;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;EU and US pressed to drop dispute-settlement rule from trade deal;;Faced with an increasingly vocal opposition to a landmark EU-US trade agreement, a growing number of backers of the deal are starting to ask a simple question: might the future of transatlantic trade be better served if one of its most controversial provisions was simply dropped?Almost nine months after negotiations opened with great hope and fanfare, opponents of the mooted Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, are rallying against a plan that would allow private investors to use the pact to sue governments if they felt local laws threatened their investment.Environmentalists worry that it would allow big US oil companies to challenge France’s anti-fracking laws and other environmental regulations, while consumer groups fret that it would open the EU’s sacrosanct ban on genetically modified organisms to a challenge from American agribusiness.The concerns in Europe over the inclusion of an “investor-state dispute settlement”, or ISDS, mechanism grew so loud earlier this year that Karel De Gucht, the EU’s trade commissioner, announced he would suspend negotiations on the relevant text to hold public consultations.But in recent weeks, as both sides have been preparing for Monday’s resumption of negotiations in Brussels, the opposition has spread beyond the traditional sceptics.In a paper released last week, Daniel Ikenson, director of the trade programme at the conservative Cato Institute, argued that the investor protection measure had become too toxic. And that in order to defuse the growing opposition, negotiators should simply drop what seemed like a superfluous provision.“ISDS is not even essential to the task of freeing trade. So why burden the effort by carrying needless baggage?” Mr Ikenson wrote in his paper, which called for the US to drop ISDS provisions from its push for a 12-country Pacific Rim deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as well.Dropping ISDS would “assuage thoughtful critics of the trade agenda, who do not oppose trade, but who believe trade agreements should be more modest and balanced”, he wrote. “Meanwhile, what now appears to be an angry mob protesting trade generally will be thinned out, exposing the unsubstantiated arguments of the professional protectionists who benefit by impeding Americans’ freedom to trade.”Mr Ikenson is not alone. In a recent debate in the British parliament a number of MPs raised their own concerns over the inclusion of ISDS even as they offered their backing for the broader push for freer trade across the Atlantic.July 2013: Talks between the EU and US on a free trade deal started this week in a bid to bolster growth and cement closer ties between the two economies. Joshua Chaffin looks at the five stumbling blocks to successful negotiation“Why do we need these tribunals for a country where the rule of law is adhered to, more or less across the board?” asked Zac Goldsmith, a backbench MP from Prime Minister David Cameron’s ruling Conservative party.ISDS mechanisms have been a feature of trade and investment treaties around the world since the 1950s and were originally intended to help protect investors from government expropriation or rogue judgments in countries with weak judicial systems.The provisions have been largely uncontroversial for most of their history. But in recent years their use has soared as a way for companies to challenge national regulations.According to Mr Ikenson, between 1959 and 2002 there were less than 100 known ISDS claims lodged worldwide. But between 2003 and 2012 investors lodged more than 400 such cases. In 2012 alone a record 58 cases were filed worldwide, he points out.In many instances, critics charge, the cases amount to a cynical ploy to get around local regulations. The example they cite most often is the continuing challenge by Philip Morris International of Australia’s plain packaging rules for cigarettes via an investment treaty with Hong Kong.Both the EU and the US remain eager to have the investor-state provision included in the TTIP agreement. And so too are business groups.This is something that is almost non-controversial between the European Commission and the US government and the business lobbies want it. But they don’t need itTrade officials contend that ISDS panels actually tend to issue commonsense rulings and that rogue cases rarely succeed. Moreover, the EU-US negotiations, European officials argue, present a rare opportunity to close loopholes and raise the bar to prevent frivolous cases.As with many things in the EU-US negotiations, trade officials also argue it is an opportunity to set an ambitious example for other agreements.“We cannot go on and negotiate an investor protection agreement with India, which clearly has big problems right now, if we don’t have a precedent from somewhere else,” says Alex Stubb, the Finnish trade minister.Mr Ikenson, however, says those arguments miss the point. Trade negotiators have in recent years underestimated the depth of popular opposition to trade deals and they are miscalculating again, he says.The current stand-off in the US Congress, where the Democratic party’s leadership is blocking the granting of so-called fast-track negotiating authority to the Obama administration, is driven in part by scepticism over ISDS, he points out. In Europe the scepticism is equally strong.“This is something that is almost non-controversial between the European Commission and the US government and the business lobbies want it,” he says. “But they don’t need it.”And, he adds: “If the trade agenda is shut down [by the opposition], which I suspect there is a very good chance of happening for [President Barack Obama], then the business community is going to have to prioritise what it needs.”——————————————-Letter in response to this article:Balanced debate on investment protection is due / From Mr Andrew Wilson
105;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2013-11-14T07:18:12Z;Regulators take aim at high-margin tobacco products;;The life of a smoker is not a happy one. Thanks to increased regulation, smokers are banished outdoors, reminded in large type that they are killing themselves and forced to pay through the nose for the privilege.By contrast, the life of a tobacco company is rather good. The $756bn tobacco industry has boomed even as regulators across the globe have heavily increased duty and introduced a host of tactics aimed at curtailing consumption – ranging from public smoking bans to graphic warnings and plain packaging.“The environment is getting tougher from a regulatory point of view,” admits Gareth Cooper, head of regulation at British American Tobacco, the world’s second-largest tobacco company by market share. “But the industry has more than survived. It’s incredibly profitable and successful.”Increasingly, however, regulators are going after the high-margin, fast-growing premium products that have spurred profit growth among big tobacco companies and made the industry’s already fat margins even larger.This is a global trend. The European Parliament recently passed a directive that will ban flavourings in cigarettes from 2022. Chile and Brazil have already done so. In the US, a ban on menthol cigarettes – which are gaining market share – is mooted. Even Russia – where about 40 per cent of people smoke – introduced a public smoking ban this year.Until recently, regulation for the tobacco industry was a case of “heads we win, tails you lose”. Margins are highest in heavily regulated markets, with high levels of duty.“That is because of the excise – it gives more price leverage,” says Alison Cooper, chief executive of Imperial Tobacco, the world’s fourth-largest tobacco company by market share.Tobacco companies can put up prices at the same time as duty increases, meaning they can raise their margins without incurring the wrath of smokers. Imperial’s operating margin in the UK has jumped from 49 per cent in 1996 to 68 per cent last year thanks to price rises and cost cutting.This applies across the industry. BAT expects its margins to improve by between 50 and 100 basis points each year. The operating margin of Philip Morris International, which sells Marlboro outside the US, has risen from 42 per cent in 2006 to 47 per cent today.The gains have been achieved thanks to cost cutting, price rises and premiumisation: adding flavours to cigarettes, selling them in new forms – such as “slim” cigarettes – or designing fancy packaging.“Premium cigarettes are the main cash-generation engine of the industry,” says Shane MacGuill, a tobacco analyst at Euromonitor, the research group.The growing popularity of e-cigarettes has left regulators in a pickle.E-cigarettes have come a long way since the nattily named “Electro Fag” first appeared on the market almost a decade ago.E-cigarette sales are now $2bn globally – a figure that will jump 50 per cent again in 2013, according to Canaccord. In the US, consumption of e-cigarettes could overtake conventional tobacco within a decade, says Wells Fargo.Read moreGoing after the industry’s cash cow has led to industry claims that this bout of regulation is aimed at curtailing their profits, rather than curtailing smoking.“They want to make it difficult for the industry, to increase its costs, regardless of whether that is the most effective public health measure,” says BAT’s Mr Cooper. BAT already employs 450 people in its regulatory affairs team.Tobacco companies have fiercely fought the latest glut of regulation. After decades of aggressive litigation from the 1950s onwards, the industry changed strategy and adopted a more stoic legal position in the late 1990s, broadly avoiding litigation.This lull has come to an end, says Mr MacGuill.“The tobacco industry is flexing its muscles. The reason we’re seeing this is because tobacco companies know that these measures are the ones that will hit consumption and their bottom line.”BAT was vociferous in its opposition to plain packaging legislation in Australia. In the UK, Japan Tobacco International led the fight against plain packaging – at times with too much zeal. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that some of JTI’s anti-plain packaging adverts were misleading.In a world of plain packs, no flavourings and no advertising, the spectre of commodification looms. “The more tools of differentiation are limited, the more it leads to reduced price premium, which is the road to commodification,” says Martin Deboo, analyst at Investec.With no other levers to pull, tobacco companies could turn to price cuts to gain an edge. But if this happens, volumes could rise to compensate for loss of margin.Indonesia, where about two-thirds of adult men smoke, is one of the world’s largest and least regulated tobacco marketsPlain packaging has not had an effect on BAT and Imperial’s volumes in Australia since it was introduced last year. But this has not stopped both companies complaining loudly about its potential introduction elsewhere.Some companies are feeling the squeeze more than others. Last month Japan Tobacco, the country’s biggest cigarette maker, announced it would shutter production at nearly half its domestic factories within the next three years in response to tax increases, tighter regulations and growing health consciousness.In the US, restrictions or a ban on menthols would be particularly damaging to Lorillard, whose Newport brand – the US’s leading mint-flavoured cigarette – drove 88 per cent of total sales in 2012.But for most companies in the sector, even in a stricter regulatory environment, cigarettes remain extremely profitable. BAT’s Mr Cooper is clear that tobacco companies will not be going anywhere just yet. “We’re not going to disappear off the face of the earth.”Additional reporting by Jennifer Thompson in Tokyo
106;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2013-11-04T16:34:33Z;Debt sale rush ahead of holiday season;;Sales of investment-grade debt this week may surpass the $25bn mark as global corporations attempt to raise this year’s final batch of funds at low borrowing rates, ahead of the forthcoming holiday season, analysts said.Agribusiness giant Monsanto, Philip Morris International, transportation company Ryder System and Latam Airlines, Latin America’s airline carrier, led the charge among corporate borrowers, announcing a flurry of new debt deals on Monday.The rush of new sales is coming as the bulk of the third-quarter earnings season is now complete, and as companies try to squeeze in as many debt sales as possible ahead of the usual capital markets shutdown towards the end of the month around Thanksgiving.Corporate borrowers and bond investors are also banking on the Federal Reserve maintaining its policy of easy money into next year. A recovery in risk appetite among fixed income investors has helped pull bond yields lower since the central bank surprised markets by not starting to taper its monthly bond buying in September.At last week’s policy meeting the Fed kept its options open for a taper that could be announced at its December meeting, but the consensus in the bond market is that any such move has been pushed into next year.“Risk appetite has been rekindled by the Fed’s not-taper decision, with issuers taking advantage of declining yields and investors putting money to work,” said Edward Marrinan, credit strategist at RBS Securities.“We expect that the pace of debt issuance will remain elevated during November in the run-up to Thanksgiving.”The combination of low borrowing costs and strong demand for higher-yielding alternatives to top-tier government bonds has pushed corporate debt sales in the US to record levels.Global corporations took advantage of the sweet spot and have sold $954bn worth of high-grade bonds so far this year, compared with $893bn in the same period of 2012, according to Dealogic.“Corporate borrowers and debt underwriters have been traditionally opportunistic,” said Adrian Miller, director of fixed income strategy at GMP Securities. “Meaning they take every ‘opportunity’ to issue the most amount of bonds at the lowest possible cost, when liquidity in the market is high.”Mr Miller said as long as investors’ appetite for alternatives to lower-yielding government bonds remained intact, the pace of corporate debt offerings would “remain high”.Average yields on US investment-grade corporate bonds stood at 3.19 per cent on Monday, while those on US Treasuries were at 1.26 per cent, according to Barclays indices.
107;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2013-08-15T16:34:59Z;Tobacco – volume and value;Sector gets used to dealing with stricter regulation;"Like smoke from Frank Sinatra’s cigarette the global tobacco sector has climbed 40 per cent over the past two years. That is half as much again as the MSCI world index – hardly what investors might have expected given ever tighter regulation. Yet tobacco companies, especially those geared towards emerging markets, continue to perform well and regulation does not yet spell the end for the industry.Consider Imperial Tobacco. With two-thirds of operating profits coming from developed markets it is hugely exposed to the challenges facing tobacco groups. In its nine-month trading update on Thursday, the company reported volumes that were down by 7 per cent. But sales only fell 3 per cent. Price increases in Europe helped to offset declining demand. Higher taxes and regulation are not hurting revenues to the same extent as volumes.A good example of this is the UK, one of the most heavily regulated and taxed tobacco markets. From 1996 to last year Imperial’s cigarette volumes dropped from 31bn to 19bn. Revenues after duty, however, have increased by 50 per cent to almost £1bn, notes Goldman Sachs. Profits have grown even faster; Imperial’s UK operating margin of 67 per cent is now the highest in the industry.Still, even harsher regulation may limit pricing power in the future. Australia started enforcing plain cigarette packaging last December. If consumers cannot differentiate between brands, they may focus instead on price. So far, reports on the impact of this regulation have been mixed – and Australia remains an exception. Tobacco companies are scrambling for other sources of growth nevertheless. Both British American Tobacco and Imperial have been investing in electronic cigarettes, for example. It is thought that 1m of the UK’s 10m smokers are now inhaling them.Overall, the emerging world still has the best prospects. That favours BAT, Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris. Tobacco prices in these markets remain well below those in mature countries, which means big potential whatever risks lie ahead.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
108;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2013-08-12T19:07:32Z;Cigarette price rises in UK due to companies as much as tax;;"Smokers fuming about the rising cost of cigarettes should blame big tobacco companies as well as recent excise duty increases, according to researchers at the University of Bath.Between 2006 and 2009, about half of the total price increases on cigarettes were due to tobacco companies raising their prices, not increases in duty, according to its research.The report comes as the tobacco industry goes to great lengths to argue that the increased cost of cigarettes has led to higher levels of imitation or smuggled cigarettes.Amanda Sandford, research manager at Action on Smoking and Health, said: “This analysis makes it clear that the companies have been hiking their own prices as fast as they can. Clearly, they are not as worried about the effect of price rises on illicit trade as they want the public to think.”Research from tobacco companies such as JTI, which make Benson & Hedges, and Philip Morris International, which sell Marlboro outside the US, have attempted to link higher prices with increased smuggling.While the proportion of illicit tobacco smoked in the UK has increased, according to tobacco industry funded research, the total amount of non-duty paid tobacco is falling, figures from HMRC show.The government has raised duty on tobacco products consistently even as it cuts duty on other products, such as beer.The excise duty on tobacco products raised £9.5bn between 2011 and 2012, according to the Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association. This is up from £8.1bn in 2007, despite the number of cigarettes smoked in the UK falling.Paul Williams, head of corporate affairs at JTI, said: “ASH is proving yet again that there is little point in letting facts get in the way of a story; 85 per cent of every legal cigarette pack is tax and that encourages criminals to trade in the UK.”The study comes after a similar survey in Ireland revealed that price rises from tobacco companies accounted for 36 per cent of increased cigarette costs."
109;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2013-07-23T17:58:19Z;Crosby moves to end tobacco lobbying dispute;;Lynton Crosby has denied having “any conversation” over plain cigarette packaging with David Cameron as the prime minister’s election adviser sought to end speculation that he had lobbied on the issue.Mr Crosby, whose lobbying firm advises tobacco company Philip Morris, said in a statement on Tuesday that any suggestion he had used his position as an adviser to the Conservative party improperly was “simply false”. The government abandoned plans to introduce plain cigarette packaging two weeks ago.The election strategist made his statement just hours before Sir Jeremy Heywood rejected Ed Miliband’s call for an inquiry into the issue, after the cabinet secretary said there would be “no purpose” in holding one.“[Crosby’s] role, as I understand it, is to advise the Conservative party and any meetings he may have had with the prime minister are on this basis which is not in itself a breach of the ministerial code.”Sir Jeremy also published the “principles of engagement” agreed between the prime minister and Mr Crosby to “avoid any conflicts arising” from the strategist’s dual roles of Tory adviser and lobbying interests.No 10 refused to say yesterday when this document was drawn up, saying only it reflected “what was agreed at the time” of Mr Crosby’s appointment last November. The principles state that Mr Crosby would not use his Conservative party position to further his private interests, lobby for clients or help clients by claiming to have privileged access to ministers and officials.The prime minister has been repeatedly asked over recent days whether he had discussed packaging with Mr Crosby, but has refused to answer whether the pair had talked about the matter, saying only he had not been “lobbied” on the issue.The renowned election strategist also runs a company called Crosby Textor, which – it has gradually transpired – has clients in tobacco, alcohol, oil, airports and property development.In a statement issued on Tuesday by his company, Mr Crosby said: “At no time have I had any conversation or discussion with or lobbied the prime minister, or indeed the health secretary or the health minister, on plain packaging or tobacco issues. Indeed, any claim that I have sought to improperly use my position as part-time campaign adviser to the Conservative party is simply false.”
110;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Downing Street will only say that Mr Crosby has never “lobbied” Mr Cameron.There was confusion yesterday over whether the prime minister had ever queried who Mr Crosby’s clients were before he hired the Australian last autumn.At the weekend a government spokesman said that Mr Cameron had been “unaware” that his political adviser worked for Philip Morris, the tobacco company, in the UK.Asked whether the prime minister had asked to see a list of Crosby Textor clients eight months ago, Downing St refused to comment. A Conservative Party spokeswoman said: “It would be inappropriate to comment further.”Labour called on the prime minister to “clarify his conversations” with his adviser on tobacco and alcohol.“There is a pattern of behaviour here by David Cameron, he looked the other way and didn’t ask the right questions on Andy Coulson,” said a party source. “He now claims to be looking the other way and not asking the right questions about Lynton Crosby.”Mr Cameron’s attempt to shift attention back on to the unions involves a new crackdown on union funding of election campaigns, which will be inserted into the same bill.The move has been criticised by Labour and the trade unions as a shameless political move designed to distract attention away from questions about the Tories. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, has been rocked by news that Unite – his biggest financial backer – sought to manipulate the candidate selection in Falkirk, a Scottish constituency.The legislation will limit spending in the year before an election any spending by third-party organisations affiliated to parties and giving more than £100,000: in practice the trade unions upon which Labour depends. In future this spending will be counted towards a party’s national spending cap.William Hague, the foreign secretary, was forced to deny that he had ever been “lobbied” by Mr Crosby.

113;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2013-07-14T23:06:21Z;Labour seeks changes to lobbying bill after Crosby allegations;;The Labour party has called for amendments to the forthcoming lobbying bill following allegations that Lynton Crosby, the Conservative election strategist, has been influencing government policy on tobacco advertising behind the scenes.Liberal Democrats, including former health minister Paul Burstow, have linked Mr Crosby – whose lobbying company works for the tobacco firm Philip Morris – to a decision last week to ditch plans for plain packaging on tobacco products.The Lib Dem suspicions, aired in The Observer newspaper, come as Stephen Dorrell, a Tory MP and chair of the all-party select committee on health, said his committee would probe the government’s reasons for dropping its packaging plan.But Labour believes that stronger action is needed, and has put forward a series of changes to new legislation designed to make lobbying more transparent, expected to be published this Tuesday.The changes include the requirement that any professional lobbyist doing a senior job for the government of the day should declare their activities, and that such senior appointments should be scrutinised by an independent committee to make sure of no conflict of interest.Jon Trickett MP, shadow cabinet office minister, accused David Cameron of “standing up for the wrong people”.“If this bill is about cleaning up lobbying it should be used to clean up the lobbying at the heart of Downing Street,” Mr Trickett said. “Labour is determined to stand up to vested interests and we will push amendments to the government’s lobbying bill that will once and for all clean up this aspect of politics.”But senior Conservatives took to the airwaves over the weekend to defend Mr Crosby, accusing those who linked him to the tobacco policies of mounting a “smear campaign”.Grant Shapps, Tory party chairman, told Sky News: “Lynton Crosby advises the Conservative party, not the prime minister, and he doesn’t advise – at all – on policies. His entire role is on campaigning, to the party itself. So this is pretty much a smear campaign.”Patrick McLoughlin, transport secretary, also told the BBC that Mr Crosby “works for the Conservative party, not the other way round”.When asked whether David Cameron had discussed the issue with his strategist, Mr McLoughlin said: “I don’t know about all the conversations the prime minister has. He’s said in the House of Commons he’s not talked to Lynton Crosby about tobacco.”
114;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Big Tobacco vs Little Uruguay;;"Philip Morris International, the makers of Marlboro, the world’s best-selling cigarette brand, has won the right to take its case against marketing restrictions and graphic health warnings in the South American country to the World Bank’s arbitration tribunal, ICSID.A decision is still years away, but spokeswoman Julie Soderlund told beyondbrics the company believed Uruguay had violated a bilateral investment treaty with Switzerland, where Philip Morris is based. She welcomed the decision by ICSID to accept jurisdiction to hear the case, adding:This will be the first time in this case that there will be independent assessment of these arbitrary and unnecessary regulations.Philip Morris objects to being made to pull, under the rules introduced by Uruguay in 2009, different variants of the same brand from shop shelves. That meant that it could not sell, say, Marlboro gold alongside Marlboro Red, and ended up pulling 7 out of 12 cigarette varieties, it complains.It also objects to having its branding crowded out on cigarette packets, which Uruguay has since 2009 required to be 80 per cent covered, front and back, by graphic health warnings (after, it says, this survey was conducted). Prior to that, the warnings covered 50 per cent, which Philip Morris did not contest. (See the evolution below).Even though the tobacco giant has won the right to proceed with its case, Uruguay is convinced that tough anti-smoking laws and the policies to which Philip Morris objects, implemented under by Tabaré Vázquez, the former president and an oncologist, are paying off.Vázquez is widely tipped to return to power in elections next year, and has made clear that he is passionate about the anti-smoking cause. Only in May, he gave a conference at the Inter-American Development Bank on the subject. So expect no let-up there.The government is due to hold a news conference later on Wednesday.Uruguay is not the only country that Big Tobacco is taking to court. Philip Morris and others also object to Australia’s plain packaging rules for cigarette and Thailand’s move to implement health warnings covering 85 per cent of the packets.But the Uruguay suit is an interesting test case in a country considered one of the best places in Latin America to invest. One to watch.Related reading:

115;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Smoking: Plain packaging war smoulders;Developing world will stage real battle;When James Reilly, the Irish health minister, announced in May that he would introduce legislation next year requiring that cigarettes be sold in packets bearing no more decoration than a brand name and a health warning, stocks in tobacco companies stumbled. This was despite the fact that Irish smokers contribute just a tiny fraction to the industry’s revenues.Yet supporters of such a law say this was the rational market recognising what antismoking groups have been arguing for years – well before 2012, when Australia introduced the world’s first plain-packaging law– that standardised packets would significantly reduce the number of people who take up smoking, continuing a drive that television and radio advertising bans started several decades back, and which public health advocates say has saved millions of lives.But the tobacco industry is adamant that the law will have little impact on the incidence of smoking – and might even increase tobacco use, since plain packaging is likely to reduce pricing power.Moreover, the industry’s executives and lobbyists insist, plain packaging will make life easier for black-marketeers, providing oxygen to a seedy network of smugglers, robbing government coffers of duties and endangering smokers by allowing unregulated counterfeit products to seep into the market.The world’s four biggest tobacco companies – British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco – challenged the Australian law domestically, and lost. Philip Morris is pursuing a separate case in Hong Kong, and Ukraine and Cuba are battling the legislation through the World Trade Organisation. But whereas some countries, such as New Zealand, are awaiting the outcome of the WTO challenges before following in Australia’s footsteps, and others, such as the UK, have indicated plain packaging is not a priority, Mr Reilly’s decision in Ireland shows that legal wrangling might not stem the tide of countries deciding to follow suit.The appeal of standardised packets, says Mark Costigan, the Irish health minister’s spokesman, is that while smoking bans in bars, restaurants and workplaces have had quick and demonstrable success in reducing second-hand smoke exposure, plain packaging offers a chance to chip away at the stubbornly steady number of young people who continue to smoke.There is not yet strong evidence from Australia that standardised packets reduce smoking, but Deborah Arnott at Ash, the UK antismoking group, argues it is early days yet. “Fifteen- and 16-year-olds have had 14 years of seeing cigarette packs. The impact will grow over time.” Moreover, evidence linking advertising and smoking incidence is abundant. A 2008 report from Cochrane, a scientific review group, looked at nine studies measuring the relationship and found that “non-smoking adolescents who were more aware of or receptive to tobacco advertising were more likely to become smokers later”. And in the US, the number of Americans who smoke nearly halved in the three decades following a 1970 ban on cigarette advertisements on TV and radio advertising.Of course, other measures also contributed to that decline, and governments facing the steep costs associated with nearly 6m smoking-related deaths a year – forecast to rise to 8m by 2030 – are considering all the levers. The European Parliament is weighing the adoption of an updated Tobacco Products Directive that would not impose plain packaging but instead increase the size of health warnings, ban flavoured tobacco and prohibit products with higher-than-average toxicity or addictiveness. Private insurers, meanwhile, have long offered monetary incentives for customers to give up smoking, in the form of lower rates.Martin Deboo, a tobacco analyst at Investec Securities, argues that the best way to reduce smoking is to increase the price of tobacco products. But in countries such as the UK, that measure is reaching its upper limit.That might leave public health authorities in developed countries scrambling for new ideas, and balancing health with civil liberties as they weigh bans on smoking at home, for example, or when children are in the car.But the developing world, which is home to the majority of the world’s 1bn smokers, has more room for improvement. “Smoking rates will go up as incomes go up, and you’ve got this industry promoting its product very heavily …in the countries where incomes are rising rapidly,” says Ms Arnott. “That’s where the battle will be fought.”
116;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Tobacco industry looks to ecigarettes for growth;;Demand for electronic cigarettes is booming – and big tobacco companies are hoping to get a piece of the fast growing $1bn market.In the US, the three largest manufacturers, which control 85 per cent of the domestic cigarette market, will all be selling ecigarettes by the end of the year.“They don’t want [ecigarettes] to be their Kodak moment,” says Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking & Health, a health group. Corporate history is piled with the corpses of giant companies, such as the US camera film company, brought down by consumers’ sudden adoption of new technology – and the companies behind Marlboro and Camel do not want to be added to the heap.Altria and Reynolds, the biggest and second-biggest tobacco groups in the US by sales, this month announced their plans to launch ecigarettes – rechargeable tubes that let users inhale vapour, rather than smoke, for a nicotine hit. In the UK, British American Tobacco bought an ecigarette start up at the end of 2012, while Imperial Tobacco, which owns the Golden Virginia brand, announced its own foray into the market earlier this year.Tobacco executives say they have been studying demand and have decided to test the waters. “The category is in its early stages and time will tell how it will evolve,” Marty Barrington, Altria chief executive, told investors in New York last week.“It’s like Betamax and VHS,” says David Hayes, a tobacco analyst at Nomura. “We don’t know what the preferred standard will be.”Previous attempts to get nicotine addicts to shift from traditional tobacco have been mixed. Snus – a small bag of nicotine, ingested by stuffing it under your top lip – is popular with Scandinavians but few others.In the 1990s Reynolds introduced Eclipse, a cigarette that produced heat, but did not burn. “The knock on effect was that it tasted horrible – one of these details that’s hard to get over,” points out Erik Bloomquist, an analyst at Berenberg bank. Eclipse was eventually scrapped.Ecigarettes have, so far, been an exception. US retail sales of ecigarettes could pass $1bn this year from $600m in 2012, according to Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo. In the UK, there are already 1.3m users, according to ASH.The devices are “revolutionising the tobacco industry”, says Ms Herzog, who estimates that “consumption of ecigs could surpass consumption of conventional cigs within the next decade”.Not all in the industry agree. “[Ecigarettes] will be smaller than our combustible business,” says David O’Reilly, who heads BAT’s research arm and sits on its management board. “It will be a big category, as long as we’re able to innovate,” he added.Whether or not ecigarettes will overtake traditional tobacco is a secondary concern. For tobacco executives, the fact that they provide growth in an industry where volumes have fallen steadily since 2009 is enough to pique their interest.Reynolds’ chief executive Dan Delen says ecigarettes are a category where the company expected “expanding growth to mitigate some of the volumetric decline” in traditional smoking.Altria and Reynolds both say ecigarettes will eventually command better profit margins than their tobacco counterparts, although they would not give specific estimates. Wells Fargo estimates that margins could reach the mid-40 per cent range in another five years, compared with conventional cigarette margins of about 40 per cent.Not all tobacco companies are as gung-ho about ecigarettes.Philip Morris International, the world’s largest tobacco group by sales, is the most high-profile ecigarette refusenik, and is instead focusing on developing a cigarette that heats rather than burns tobacco, producing less tar and smoke.While BAT invested about £40m in its ecigarette subsidiary CN Creative, it spent £2bn on a share buyback a few months later. Imperial Tobacco, the £22bn tobacco company based in Bristol in the southwest of the UK, will not have an electronic product out until at least 2014.The lack of enthusiasm has left some analysts perplexed, especially given Imperial’s reliance on developed markets in western Europe – an area where cigarette volumes have slumped more sharply than in the rest of the world.Time, however, is not necessarily a pressing issue. The embryonic ecigarette manufacturing sector is ripe for consolidation, with 250 operators in the UK alone. Global tobacco companies have the financial firepower to buy in to the sector once the market has settled, rather than running the risk of heading down a research cul-de-sac.Craig Weiss, chief executive of NJOY, the US leader in ecigarettes by market share, compares the devices to the introduction of filtered cigarettes in the 1950s. “They were perceived initially to be fake and artificial,” says the 39-year-old. “There was foam between you and your tobacco.”But from an initial 2 per cent of sales, filtered cigarettes came to dominate the market within a decade. He’s betting ecigarettes will follow the same path, and has won over celebrity investors including Sean Parker, the Napster founder, and Bruno Mars, the pop star.Mr Weiss argues that the big companies’ entrance into the market is positive for NJOY since it drives customers into stores in search of electronic devices and raises awareness through advertising. Ecigarettes, unlike regular cigarettes, can be advertised on television in the US. “I’m not in this business to steal market share from [rival ecigarette company] Blu,” he says. “I’m in this business to steal market share from Marlboro.”
117;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2013-05-28T16:40:55Z;Ireland plans to adopt plain packaging of cigarettes;Republic will become second country to ban branding;Ireland plans to become the second country in the world to ban all branding on cigarette packets following a decision on Tuesday to introduce a law forcing tobacco companies to use plain packaging.Health chiefs lauded the move as a vital tool to combat youth smoking, while tobacco companies warned removing all logos, trademarks and colours from packs would benefit criminals involved in illegal smuggling.“While many arguments will be made against such an introduction, I am confident that this legislation will be justified and supported purely by the fact that it will save lives,” said James Reilly, Ireland’s health minister.He said he expected the legislation to be enacted by the Irish parliament early next year.Australia introduced the world’s first plain packaging law in December when it replaced corporate logos on packs with drab olive green coverings decorated with gruesome pictures depicting the health risks of smoking. Earlier this year New Zealand and Scotland also announced plans to phase out branding on cigarette packages, although neither country has set a definitive timeframe for introducing plain packaging yet.The move by Dublin follows an intensification of a global battle between Big Tobacco and health campaigners over several tough new measures designed to curb smoking.British American Tobacco, Britain’s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a legal bid to block the introduction of plain packaging legislation in Australia last year.However, a challenge was recently lodged at the World Trade Organisation by four tobacco producing countries – Ukraine, Honduras, Cuba and the Dominican Republic – which allege Canberra’s ban on branding breaches trade rules on international property rights.“Destroying the fabric of trademarks, high-quality brands, and geographical indications, the reputations of which took decades to develop, is not an effective way to reduce smoking,” said the Dominican Republic in a statement this month.Ireland, where almost one in three people smoke, was the first EU state to introduce a ban on smoking in the workplace in 2004. Dublin followed up with bans on packets of 10 cigarettes, in-store tobacco advertising and displays of tobacco products at retail outlets in 2009. Mr Reilly is also considering introducing a ban on smoking in cars which have children as passengers.Tobacco companies said there was no credible evidence to suggest plain packaging would reduce youth smoking rates.“Any proposals to unjustifiably take away our intellectual property will only serve the interests of criminal gangs and counterfeiters,” said John Freda, general manager of JTI, the owner of Benson and Hedges.“Plain packaging will make it easier for the underworld to manufacture fakes, putting money in the pockets of criminals and taking money out of the tills of shopkeepers across Ireland,” he said.Tobacco smuggling is a growing industry in Ireland, with almost one in five cigarettes smoked illegally smuggled into the country.A political controversy erupted in Ireland earlier this month when it was revealed that tobacco company executives met the Irish prime minister, minister for finance and justice minister to lobby privately against the proposed law.Earlier this month the UK abandoned plans to introduce plain packaging law, with the coalition instead deciding to focus on core policies when it outlined its legislative agenda. The decision prompted questions about the role of Conservative party adviser Lynton Crosby, whose consultancy had advised the tobacco industry in Australia on ways to fight off similar regulations.
118;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2013-05-23T09:54:58Z;China’s smokers: CNTC’s captive market;;"A recent conference held by the China Medical Board, a US foundation, on China and the Global Burden of Disease identified smoking as the third greatest risk to health in the country, behind dietary risks and high blood pressure but ahead of China’s deadly environmental pollution about which so much has been written.Asia is one of the last great global bastions of smoking, with China and Indonesia – the first and fourth most populous countries in the world – setting the regional lead. China alone is home to more than a third of the world’s smokers, puffing away at a rate of more than 2tn cigarettes a year.China has 350m smokers, equivalent to the population of about 10 Canadas. Smoking has a long tradition and is embedded in social customs. Cigarettes are a common and acceptable form of gifting and sharing at almost any special occasion, be it Chinese New Year or a milestone business meeting. Workers can and do spend anything from a day’s pay to over a month’s wages on a single pack of Chinese-made luxury cigarettes.Where demand is big, so is supply, and the China National Tobacco Corporation is the world’s biggest tobacco company by sales. It generates an estimated 7-10 per cent of government revenues, yet the CNTC has a very low profile in global media. This is despite the fact that its very existence as a state-owned enterprise is almost a contradiction in terms – today, most governments around the world are trying to advise their citizens about the dangers of smoking and to persuade them to give it up.The CNTC enjoys a virtual monopoly in China over marketing, production, distribution and sales of all tobacco products, domestic or foreign. Multinationals were only allowed into the country in the 1980s in exchange for modern manufacturing equipment. Today British American Tobacco (BAT) and Philip Morris International (PMI) are tasked with distributing Chinese brands to the outside world. The World Trade Organization’s repeated calls for a loosening of the CNTC’s monopoly appear to have been met by its strengthening, in the name of anti-counterfeiting.Partnering with the CNTC is the only way foreign manufacturers such as BAT and PMI can access the Chinese market. Adam Spielman, a Citigroup analyst, estimates that in 30 to 50 years’ time there will be virtually no smokers left in Britain. Yet BAT and PMI are among the most successful companies in the world, with earnings per share consistently growing at more than 10 per cent a year. This makes them ideal defensive stocks for investors not deterred by the associated health and social issues. Global financial crises, recessions and higher taxes all have little effect, as cigarette companies pass on these higher costs to their consumers. In a rare public statement, CNTC revealed last year that it made profits of $19bn 2011.Smoking shows no signs of abating in China. In 2009, Wang Chen, a leading respiratory disease expert, estimated that nearly 60 per cent of male doctors were smokers, the highest percentage in the world. Also in 2009, Chinese legislators attempted to bar government officials from accepting cigarettes as gifts because such gifting was seen as corrupt and wasteful. The bill did not pass. Other than in a few major cities, smoking in public is left unchecked.The CNTC manufactures more than 900 brands of cigarettes, from D graded cigarettes targeted at rural farming regions up to A graded luxury cigarettes, aimed at those with pocketbooks to match their desire for prestige and luxury products. The CNTC’s Red Pagoda Hill brand, the most popular in China, accounts for 4 per cent of its total sales, the same share as that of all foreign brands combined.BAT and PMI are reliant on the CNTC to sell their brands in China (555 for BAT and Marlboro for PMI); CNTC needs Big Tobacco to distribute Chinese brands to the world. However, since Chinese brands are virtually unknown outside the country and appeal mainly to the Chinese diaspora, and because smoking is generally on the decline around the world, it looks like Big Tobacco is doing better out of the arrangement, even with rampant smuggling and counterfeiting in China.Related reading:

119;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2013-05-21T20:00:51Z;Carlos Slim stubs out cigarette habit;;"Carlos Slim is always on the move: reviewing, restructuring and reinventing his companies.His latest action in this direction came on Tuesday with his industrial conglomerate, Grupo Carso, exiting its investment in Philip Morris México (PMM). Carso agreed to sell its remaining 20 per cent stake for $700m to Philip Morris International (PMI), which becomes sole owner of PMM.The reason: Carso wants to focus on its three main and most-profitable divisions: retail (Grupo Sanborns, which is publicly traded), industrial (Condumex) and construction (Carso Infraestructura y Construcción, or Cicsa). The last two are fully owned by Carso.The sale of PMM after three decades under Slim’s wing is emblematic of his long standing business strategy of constantly evaluating the performance of his multiple businesses to determine their future.With the sale, Slim is also parting ways with a company that was crucial in his empire-building activities during the eighties and early nineties.PMM, which was long ago known as Cigarros la Tabacalera Mexicana, provided Slim with the cash flow he needed to buy dozens of companies in the eighties, when he began assembling what is now one of the world’s largest business empire.So wide-ranging is Slim’s reach, one would be hard pressed to find anyone in Mexico who does not use one of his services (telecoms, internet) or products (books, copper cable, a coffee at a Sanborns restaurant) on a daily basis.Back in the eighties, the Mexican economy was a shambles and many businessmen, fearing the country was heading towards a socialist economic model, decided to sell many of their companies at fire sale prices.Slim thought the opposite. With the cash generated by Cigatam, as his cigarette-maker was also known, he began buying many enterprises that faced rough times (mainly as a result of the country’s successive devaluations) but which were otherwise fundamentally sound.Since then, Slim hasn’t stop buying, remodeling, keeping and, if needed, selling company after company.In this context, the move to exit PMM seems to suggest that Mexico’a wealthiest man thinks it’s now time to focus on businesses that face less scrutiny from the government and the public and which offer greater growth prospects. And, just as in the US and Europe, sales of cigarettes in México are heavily taxed.While PMM is still a great cash-cow, Slim seems to want to focus on retail, industrial and construction, mainly of infrastructure projects, because of the country’s growing middle-class and its growing infrastructure needs.Specifically, if the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto manages to get through Congress an energy reform that allows private companies to participate in transportation, refinery and oil and gas extraction, then Slim’s industrial conglomerate could be especially well-placed to reap the benefits.Just two weeks ago, Carso said it had reached a leasing agreement for $415m with Pemex Exploración y Producción, a subsidiary of Pemex, Mexico’s state-owned oil monopoly, to supply one of its maritime platforms.More of these contracts could be in the cards for Carso and Slim if Peña Nieto succeeds in passing his energy reforms. Onwards and upwards then.Related reading:

120;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2013-05-09T10:58:58Z;Tobacco groups race to recruit Indonesian smokers;;As students and teenagers sip coffee and eat noodles in Tebet, a bustling South Jakarta district of cafés and clothes shops, coquettish models wearing short white dresses encourage them to buy Dunhill’s new “Mild” cigarettes and sign up to a marketing database.An accompanying TV advertisement for the brand launched in Indonesia last year by London-listed British American Tobacco portrays a male model spearfishing before cooking up his catch with his fashionable friends while the voiceover declares it is “time to discover what fine taste is all about”.Such messaging has been effective in promoting smoking as a lifestyle choice for happy-go-lucky young Indonesians like Titis Katanti, who dropped out of medical school to become a model.“I got used to smoking because everyone in my family smokes and my friends smoke too,” says the 21-year-old, who gets through three packets of cigarettes a day, as she hangs out with her friends in Tebet. “It’s better to be an active smoker than a passive one.”All this promotional activity is proscribed by BAT’s self-imposed marketing code, which prohibits advertising or promotion that links smoking to professional or sporting success, popularity or sexual prowess.But BAT has exempted itself from its own rules in Indonesia, where international and local tobacco companies are fighting it out for market share in one of the embattled industry’s last great frontiers.With 61m smokers – two-thirds of men and 5 per cent of women – Indonesia is the world’s fourth-biggest cigarette market and one of the least regulated.Like other large smoking nations such as Russia and China, which long resisted the global shift towards tighter regulation, Indonesia has finally started to introduce some controls on tobacco.Emerging markets: News and comment from more than 40 emerging economiesFollowing the introduction of limited curbs on tobacco advertising this year, health campaigners and tobacco industry executives agree that regulation will only get stricter in the coming years as the government becomes more worried about the social and financial impact of tobacco-related diseases, which killed 190,000 people in 2010.So BAT and Philip Morris International, which both acquired large Indonesian tobacco companies, and their local rivals like Gudang Garam and Djarum are racing to reach as many new smokers as possible while they still have a free hand.By sponsoring music concerts, sports events and even educational scholarships, cigarette companies have ensured that many young Indonesians think smoking is “cool”, says Mia Hanafiah, chair of the national commission on tobacco control.“Indonesia has been without proper regulation for too long,” she says. “With all the advertising, many young people think there are no risks. Tobacco companies are putting all their efforts into increasing the numbers of smokers now.”Muhaimin Moefti, chairman of one of the main tobacco lobby groups in Indonesia, says that the industry plays a crucial role in supporting the fast-growing economy, employing up to 6m people from farmers to street hawkers and contributing Rp80tn ($8.2bn) to government revenue last year through excise duties.Industry executives also say they do not deliberately target young people and support the government’s introduction of a ban on selling cigarettes to under-18s, even though they accept that the government has no resources to enforce it.But, at a time when cigarette sales are falling in many of their traditional developed markets, international tobacco companies are reluctant to go beyond the local regulation for fear of losing out to their rivals in a highly competitive but profitable market.Many of Indonesia’s wealthiest tycoons from the Hartono family to Peter Sondakh made their fortunes by selling cigarettes and PMI’s $5bn acquisition of Sampoerna, another family-owned Indonesian tobacco company, in 2005 has been one of the most successful the industry has ever seen, rival executives say.BAT, which acquired Bentoel, a local tobacco company, for $494m in 2009, says that it is working with other tobacco companies and the Indonesian government to ensure better regulation and “a level playing field”.But, says a BAT spokesman, “implementing our international marketing principles in full without other industry players following similar standards, would have placed our relatively new and small business there at an exceptional disadvantage”.
121;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;BAT lifts prices to offset slowing sales;;Global demand for cigarettes continued to slide as British American Tobacco, the world’s second-largest tobacco company by market share, opted to increase prices to redress slowing sales volumes.Revenues rose 5 per cent for the three months to March 31 at constant exchange rates. The improved sales at the FTSE 100 group gave some succour to investors and analysts spooked by the comparatively weak performance of US rival Philip Morris in its latest results. Shares in BAT rose 1.3 per cent to £35.92.Only Asia-Pacific saw smokers lighting up more than in the previous year. Cigarette volumes in the region rose 6.7 per cent to 48bn. By contrast, the number of cigarettes sold in North America slumped 13.5 per cent to 32bn, and fell about 10 per cent to 26bn in western Europe.Nicandro Durante, chief executive of the group behind Lucky Strike and Dunhill, said: “This is a good performance against a backdrop of fragile economic conditions persisting in many parts of the world.”Sales of roll-your-own cigarettes continued to rise in Europe, as smokers looked for cheaper ways to get their nicotine. Sales of fine cut tobacco jumped 9.5 in western Europe as a whole. Pall Mall, the largest fine cut brand in Europe, saw its sales jump more than a fifth in western Europe, with strong growth in Spain and Italy.Overall cigarette volumes at the group fell 3.7 per cent to 160bn, with lower volumes in Brazil in particular offsetting growth in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam.
122;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2013-04-17T18:53:45Z;Smokers turning more to illicit tobacco;Consumption of non duty paid cigarettes soared by two thirds in 2012;UK smokers, fed up with constant price rises, are turning to smuggled and counterfeit tobacco in greater numbers than ever before, according to research.The number of cigarettes smoked in the UK that have not had duty paid on them leapt nearly two-thirds in 2012, according to a report by KPMG on behalf of Philip Morris International, the tobacco company.About one in six cigarettes in the UK were either smuggled into the UK or are counterfeit.Last year, Britons smoked 1bn knock-off cigarettes – 49 per cent more than in 2011. The average retail price of a standard packet of 20 cigarettes has risen from £4.50 to nearly £8 over the past ten years. Of the £8, nearly £6.20 is tax, according to the Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association.Debbie Corris, the owner of Jim Ingram, an independent tobacconist in Whitstable, Kent, says smokers are brazen about asking for counterfeit cigarettes – known as cheap whites. “People will walk in, especially during the summer when the out of town people come in, and ask for cheap whites,” she said.Counterfeit cigarette brands such as Jin Ling have become near household names among some smokers. “Some people actually think Jin Ling is a [legitimate] brand,” added Ms Corris.The jump in illicit tobacco consumption comes as the UK government mulls introducing plain packaging legislation, which critics argue would make it even easier for counterfeit cigarette makers to flood the market.Paul Williams, head of corporate affairs at Japan Tobacco International, whose recent advertising campaign against plain packaging fell foul of the Advertising Standards Agency, said: “Plain packaging proposals will provide a step-by-step guide for the counterfeiting of legitimate products, and make it even less expensive to copy them.“The biggest winners would be international criminal gangs,” he added.The rise of illicit cigarettes is a headache for the exchequer, which earns almost £10bn per year from duties on tobacco – which increased 5 per cent in the most recent Budget. The exchequer loses about £1.2bn per year in duty, according to HMRC.The trade in counterfeit cigarettes also hits newsagents, who lose both revenues from tobacco sales and customers in general.In his shop in Glasgow’s West End, tobacconist Geoff Barrett does a roaring trade in cigarette filters, cigarette papers and lighters – but not tobacco. “We don’t sell as much rolling tobacco as we used to, but we sell the same amount of cigarette papers,” he said.“There’s a 30 odd per cent gap in terms of the numbers of cigarette papers to the actual tobacco we sell. Before, that never happened.“It hurts us because it’s a key driver of footfall,” said Mr Barrett, who is also a spokesman for the Tobacco Retailers’ Alliance, a lobby group.Even the large tobacco companies are feeling the pain. Imperial Tobacco, the world’s fourth largest tobacco manufacturer, blamed the rise of illicit tobacco sales for their recent slump in sales.Tobacco smuggling is a global problem, costing governments in Europe, North America and elsewhere tens of billions of pounds in lost tax every year.The UK and Ireland have among the highest illicit tobacco sales in the EU. The high price of a packet of cigarettes in both countries – because of high taxes – provides criminals with the opportunity to make healthy profit margins.A typical pack of 20 cigarettes retails for €9.40 in Dublin while a packet sold on the black market costs less than half that. A packet of so called “cheap whites”, brands that are not registered for sale the EU, can be bought by criminal gangs for as little as 30 cents from factories in countries such as Belarus, Ukraine and China.A report published this week by JTI Ireland, a Japan Tobacco Group company, shows 28 per cent of all cigarettes consumed in Ireland last year were illicit sales that evaded excise duty, up from 26 per cent in 2011.“Irish criminal gangs are making about €3m a week in selling illegal cigarettes,” says Frank Gleeson, chairman of Retail Ireland, an organisation representing shop owners.Ireland often acts as a gateway into the larger UK marketplace. For example in 2009 customs authorities intercepted a consignment of 119m illicit cigarettes in Co Louth, Ireland – one of the largest hauls ever recorded in Europe.Smugglers regularly change their tactics to avoid detection. A few years ago large amounts of counterfeit cigarettes were imported from factories in China into Europe. Containers were landed in big ports such as Antwerp and distributed around Europe in smaller loads. Chinese contraband cigarettes are typically very low quality and contain higher amounts of toxic substances than regular cigarettes.Cigarette factories in Belarus and Ukraine have also been pinpointed by customs officials as selling to criminal gangs, who smuggle them into the EU. Greece has become a popular route for tobacco smugglers recently as its borders are porous because of the economic crisis and the near collapse of its customs authorities.Some illicit cigarettes originate in EU countries such as Cyprus and Italy. In these cases the smugglers typically ship the cigarettes to the Middle East, north Africa or even Asia before bringing it back into the EU and evading duty.A significant amount of illicit cigarette smuggling involves so called “ant smuggling”, whereby individuals, typically from countries where prices are low such as eastern Europe, fly into the UK and Ireland with suitcases containing several thousand cigarettes. Often several smugglers can fly into the UK or Ireland on a single flight.Penalties for cigarette smuggling are much lower than for drugs smuggling, which carries mandatory minimum sentences of up to 10 years in Ireland. This means criminal gangs can generate tens of millions of euro a year in revenues while facing only the threat of fines or a short prison sentence.
123;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;BAT tests ‘less harmful’ cigarettes;;British American Tobacco has started clinical trials of a cigarette designed to reduce the harm caused by existing products.Some 300 volunteers in Germany took part in the first six-week trial, which showed that prototypes substantially reduced exposure to some “toxicants” – harmful compounds in tobacco smoke. The results are published on Monday in the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology.David O’Reilly, BAT group scientific director, said the prototype cigarettes would not be introduced as a new product line but, if further research showed they cut the risk of smoking, the technology used to produce them would be transferred to existing cigarettes.Mr O’Reilly pointed out that non-smoking tobacco and nicotine products, such as e-cigarettes and snus (Swedish mouth tobacco), are already “known to pose a substantially lower risk than cigarettes”.“We don’t know whether it will be possible to prove scientifically that reduced toxicant cigarettes reduce health risks,” he added. “But we believe reducing smokers’ exposure to cigarette smoke toxicants continues to be an important research objective, given the numbers of people who smoke and the numbers who are likely to continue to smoke for the foreseeable future.”The German study – which BAT is following up with a larger six-month trial – is the industry’s most comprehensive test of the clinical effects of reduced toxicant cigarettes, Mr O’Reilly said. Philip Morris International of the US had undertaken a similar but smaller trial.BAT incorporated four toxicant-reducing technologies in the prototype cigarettes: two related to the tobacco and two in the filter. A tobacco-processing technique uses an enzyme to remove natural chemicals that become toxicants when burnt. An inert tobacco substitute containing calcium carbonate and glycerol was also added, which dilutes the smoke.The filter technologies include a resin that removes compounds called aldehydes produced by burning sugars in the tobacco, and there is activated carbon with a novel internal structure designed to trap other smoke toxicants.The company combined the technologies in three different test cigarettes, which produced lower levels of toxicants than conventional cigarettes in “smoking machines” in the lab. The clinical trials are meant to show whether these benefits show up in real smokers – the industry has been embarrassed in the past by attempts to launch “safer cigarettes” that failed because people smoked them differently to ordinary cigarettes.Participants’ urine and saliva samples were analysed for “biomarkers” that measure exposure to toxicants. The results demonstrate big reductions in some toxicants among those who smoked prototype rather than conventional cigarettes, including known carcinogens such as aminobiphenyls and nitrosamines.“Not all toxicants were reduced, and we do not yet know what level of reduction will be required to give a meaningful reduction in health risk,” said Chris Proctor, BAT chief scientist. “But these results provide the impetus for us to conduct additional further longer-term studies and to develop biomarkers more relevant to biological effects.”
124;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2013-02-22T12:33:09Z;Philippines: winning Japanese investment at the expense of China;;"The First Philippine Industrial Park, some 50km south of Manila, is already a whopper, accounting for about 3 per cent of the country’s total exports. Which is why it is notable that Sumitomo Corporation, the Japanese trading house that owns 30 per cent of it, wants to make it even bigger.By 2014, the 67 companies that currently call it home – including Honda, Canon, Nestle and Philip Morris – could be joined by 20 more, as Sumitomo spends about Y5bn to expand the 349-hectare site by almost a third.The plan confirms two things. First, that Japanese companies will continue to steer funds into faster-growing, more dynamic economies – even as the recent depreciation of the yen makes investment back home that little bit more attractive.The Philippines scores particularly well for its “rich human resources with good levels of English and high hospitality,” says Yasushi Fukuda, general manager of Sumitomo’s overseas industrial park division, which also runs parks in Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand.Japan’s total FDI stock in the Philippines stood at just over $10bn at the end of 2011, according to government data, more than five times the level of a decade earlier – a rate of growth exceeded only by investment in India (13x), China (8x) and Thailand (6x) over that period, within Asia.The second conclusion to be drawn is that a fair amount of this newer investment by Japan Inc is happening at the expense of China, as companies baulk at spiralling labour costs after the blow-up over a tiny chain of islands in the East China Sea.Osaka-based Funai Electric was hit by wage-hike demands from Chinese workers after anti-Japan demos broke out last year, the Nikkei newspaper reported this week. It is now shifting production to a new site near Manila.China was getting expensive already. Monthly base salaries for manufacturing workers in China grew by roughly 40 per cent over five years to $328 as of October 2012, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation. By contrast, workers get $253 in the Philippines, $145 in Vietnam and $53 in Myanmar.This year Japanese companies expect to pay Chinese factory workers 10 per cent more than in 2012, says Jetro – double the equivalent rate of increase in the Philippines.Without naming China in particular, Fukuda of Sumitomo notes that wage hikes and worker shortages are driving many Japanese companies to consider “diversification of production facilities.”And where better than the Philippines, where about 97 per cent of Japanese companies with overseas operations are yet to venture?Notably, it is not just the Hondas and Canons that Sumitomo is looking to lure. It says it is considering offering factory facilities for lease, with logistics and procurement support, as a way to encourage small and mid-sized Japanese businesses to set up shop.Although the official sales promotion is yet to begin, “inquiries from prospective customers have been rapidly increasing,” says Fukuda.Related reading:

125;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-12-19T19:39:28Z;EU plans to increase cigarette warnings;;Tobacco companies would be required to print much bigger warning labels on cigarette packets, and would not be allowed to sell menthol and other flavours that appeal to youngsters, under a new proposal from Brussels.Under current rules, warning labels must cover 30 per cent of the front of a cigarette pack. The new law would increase that to 75 per cent and the labels would have to include grim images of the effects of smoking.The draft legislation marks the first time in more than a decade that the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, has attempted to tighten the rules for tobacco products in one of the industry’s most lucrative markets.It has become a subject of added interest both in Brussels and within the industry because the legislation was the basis for an influence-peddling scandal that led to the October ousting of John Dalli, the health commissioner.Tonio Borg, the new health commissioner, emphasised to reporters in Brussels that the directive – long in the works – had not been affected by the scandal or competing lobbying campaigns.“I didn’t make this tougher or water it down,” he said. “I didn’t change the directive in either direction.”The goal of the proposal, he added, was not to prohibit smoking, but to curb some of the features – such as special flavourings and slim cigarettes – that companies used to make it more appealing, particularly to younger consumers.According to EU figures, smoking is responsible for almost 700,000 premature deaths in Europe each year and results in €25bn in medical bills.Mr Borg left open the possibility that EU states might follow Australia’s example and ban all labels on cigarette packaging. But he noted that the policy was under challenge at the World Trade Organisation, and suggested that it was not yet ripe to mandate its adoption across the EU.Philip Morris International, one of the world’s largest tobacco companies, attacked the proposal in a statement on Wednesday, saying that it would not help to achieve the commission’s public health goals, and could cause unintended consequences, such as an increase in the black market.The Smoke Free Partnership, an anti-tobacco campaign group, broadly welcomed the draft legislation, but bemoaned the lack of a full labelling ban, and expressed concern that it could fall prey to industry lobbyists during a review by EU states and the European parliament, both of which must give their approval.Like the product it seeks to regulate, the directive has generated unusual controversy. Mr Dalli was forced from office after an investigation by the EU’s anti-fraud office found evidence he was aware that one of his Maltese associates had sought €60m in exchange for lifting an EU ban on snus, a smokeless form of tobacco that is popular in Sweden.Mr Dalli rejected the claims and alleged that the tobacco industry had framed him in order to weaken the forthcoming directive. In a further echo of the scandal, the former commissioner filed suit in Belgium on Wednesday against Swedish Match, accusing the company of defamation.Swedish Match, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the matter.Under the new proposal, snus would continue to be banned in all EU states except for Sweden, which has enjoyed an exemption since it joined the union.
126;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-10-30T19:27:01Z;Tobacco – tips for growth;Imperial and Swedish Match both demonstrate hard work for growth;Health police, regulation, austerity, price wars – it is a wonder that tobacco companies manage to eke out any kind of growth at all. They have to work hard for it though, as Imperial Tobacco and Swedish Match both demonstrated on Tuesday. At Imperial, strong performances in Europe were cancelled out by weakness in America and falling profits in the logistics business. At Swedish Match the reverse was true, with volume growth in US cigars countered by market share losses in Swedish snus because of a price war. The result was uninspiring performances all round – Imperial’s full-year operating profit edged up 2 per cent (before a goodwill write-off), while Swedish Match’s third-quarter operating profit was up 4 per cent.Some companies are doing more to take the future into their own hands than others. Imperial has been investing in brands such as Davidoff and JPS, increasing advertising spending by a quarter. And, like rivals BAT and Philip Morris, it puts more than 3 per cent of its revenues into capital spending as it develops new products. Swedish Match is splashing out more than it used to – capital spending is expected to rise by a fifth this year as it increases manufacturing capacity for cigars – but even after that its capex to sales ratio is under 2.5 per cent.That has not prevented Swedish Match shares from attracting a premium rating. But a lot of the elements that supported its valuation are starting to weaken. The price war in Swedish snus is a big blow, and hope of an end to the ban on snus elsewhere in the EU is fading. That in turn will dim speculation that the company could become a takeover target. Even after Tuesday’s 9 per cent fall, the shares trade at a premium to BAT and Philip Morris, which are on 15 times earnings.

127;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-10-16T13:59:42Z;Russia: smoking bans in the pipeline;;"Russia is finally getting tough on tobacco with a new law that will ban smoking in public places by January 1, 2015 and increase taxes on cigarettes by as much as eight times over the same period.In a video blog released on Tuesday, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the government would go ahead with the measures despite complaints from foreign tobacco producers, who managed to carve out a niche in Russia at a time when European and US sales were plummeting.In his video message, Medvedev blames foreign tobacco companies for taking advantage of the Russian market immediately after the fall of the Soviet Union.“Unfortunately then, in the 1990s, the government did not calculate the risks of foreign tobacco investments in the Russian economy. Having put money into the advertising, design and production of light, so-called ‘women’s cigarettes’, the tobacco companies doubled sales primarily at the expense of women and unfortunately children,” the prime minister says.Medvedev says that it was four foreign tobacco groups who were responsible. He did not name names but the four largest foreign tobacco groups in Russia by sales are British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco.The government’s crackdown on smoking represents a sharp reversal from its earlier policies, which allowed smoking rates to rise quickly among teenagers, women and the Russian population as a whole.In an article following Medvedev’s announcement, Russian daily Vedomosti noted that just a year ago then-president Medvedev awarded a state decoration to Pierre de Labouchere, the chief executive of Japan Tobacco, lauding him as a foreign citizen who had helped build “friendship and cooperation with Russia”.According to Medvedev’s message on Tuesday, Russia has the highest percentage of smokers in the world: 44m people out of a population of 142m are smokers and tobacco claims 400,000 Russian lives a year.From 1992, the percentage of female smokers tripled from 7 to 22 per cent, while the average age that Russian children began smoking decreased from age 15 to age 11, Medvedev said.Historically the Kremlin has been reluctant to take aim at national vices for fear of stirring political unrest. But there are signs that this time the government may enact its promises in full.The crackdown on tobacco coincides with a wider campaign against alcoholism, with alcohol producers starting to see a sharp uptick in taxes along with restrictions on advertising and the hours during which they can sell their products.In the case of tobacco, Medvedev said more than 80 per cent of Russians supported the government’s anti-tobacco campaign, as did two-thirds of regular smokers.The government plans to submit its anti-tobacco bill to the Duma on November 1, and the bill could be passed as soon as early next year. It would eliminate smoking in restaurants, bars, cafes and government buildings by January 1, 2015 and would reduce the number of kiosks and stores where cigarettes may be sold.According to Bloomberg, the health ministry is proposing that taxes on tobacco be raised from Rb510 ($16.50) per 1,000 cigarettes to Rb4,000 ($129) per 1,000.Global tobacco stocks appeared unaffected by Medvedev’s announcement, with BAT, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco all moving up by a fraction of a percentage point on Tuesday.Yet there are signs that the new rules could have a big affect on their business, much in the way that new beer regulations have had for Carlsberg.According to the Wall Street Journal, Japan Tobacco relies on Russia for 11 per cent of its global profit, Philip Morris for 9 per cent, BAT for 8 per cent and Imperial for 5 per cent.Related reading

128;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Nestlé sets new low for European bond yield;;Nestlé has broken the record for the lowest coupon offered on a four-year bond in Europe, as central bank action around the world pushes down government bond yields and stokes demand for corporate credit.The world’s biggest food company by sales issued €500m worth of debt at a coupon of 0.75 per cent on Thursday. The average coupon on European three-to five-year corporate debt is around 2.4 per cent, according to the Barclays index.This follows news that S&P had cut Spain’s credit rating to triple-B minus from triple-B plus, leaving the country on the verge of losing its investment grade status. The agency cited Spain’s deepening economic recession and inability to handle mounting borrowing costs.While Nestlé lost its triple A rating in August 2007 following the launch of a share buyback programme, it still has one of the best credit ratings in Europe, pegged at Aa2 by Moody’s. Based in Switzerland, the group is in a defensive sector and has a global presence.“The issue ticked all the boxes for a safe haven investment,” said Tomas Lundquist, head of European corporate debt capital markets for Citigroup. “The low coupon is being driven by the low absolute yields on government debt.”The record low coupon for a corporate bond comes as average yields on corporate debt have fallen sharply after news from the European Central Bank in September about a fresh bond-buying programme to support the eurozone.The Barclays Euro Corporate Bond index shows yields have fallen a full percentage point since the start of the year to 2.4 per cent, down from 2.8 per cent in late June.The record low 12-year bond coupon was set by Philip Morris in May at 2.9 per cent and the 15-year coupon record low was set by TeliaSonera in August at 3 per cent. Nestlé already set the record for the lowest seven-year and 10-year European coupons in July and September.Some investors maintain the rally in corporate credit cannot go much further given the current low level of yields. “More than a few participants are beginning to get nervous,” said Suki Mann, head of credit strategy at Société Générale.“But that’s only because they can see the finishing line and want to make sure the returns garnered this year are protected, hoping against hope that we can stay stable at worst, or see only a moderate pullback if things look like they’re about to go awry,” he added.
129;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-10-04T11:51:38Z;Indonesia tobacco: still some puff left;;"Promoting its recent World Tobacco Asia conference in Jakarta, UK-based organiser Quartz Business Media was unashamed, noting on its website that “Indonesia is a recognized tobacco-friendly market with no smoking bans or other restrictions and regulations in contrast to neighbouring Asean countries.”With 61m smokers – that’s 67 per cent of all men and 5 per cent of women – and an average 20-pack costing just Rp12,700 ($1.32), Indonesia is the world’s fourth biggest cigarette market, in addition to being one of the least regulated.Tobacco companies in Indonesia are allowed to target young people by sponsoring concerts, including a recent gig by British balladeer James Morrison, or using sports stars like Manchester United’s Rio Ferdinand to front their poster and TV campaigns.So Indonesia is a very attractive proposition for international tobacco companies and other investors. As a result the proposed initial public offering of Wismilak, a medium-sized tobacco producer, should attract significant interest, depending on pricing.The Surabaya-based, family-owned company – whose name is a local spelling of “Wish me luck” – has told the Indonesia Stock Exchange that it is planning to sell a stake of up to 30 per cent this year.One banker who has spoken to the company said that they could be looking to raise as much as $70m-$100m and that the IPO, if successful, could spark a new round of speculation about possible mergers and acquisitions in the highly lucrative tobacco market.Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco have already taken the plunge, acquiring local clove cigarette (or “kretek”) producers Sampoerna and Bentoel respectively. The other big producers – Djarum, Gudang Garam and Nojorono – are still family controlled, although Gudang Garam has a stock market listing.There has long been speculation that the likes of Imperial Tobacco, Japan Tobacco, the China National Tobacco Corporation and South Korea’s KT&G would like to get in on the action in Indonesia.But, say bankers, convincing families to sell their profitable tobacco businesses for a reasonable price has proved difficult thus far.Indonesia’s health ministry is pushing for tighter regulation and higher taxes and, although international tobacco companies insist publicly that they welcome tougher rules on marketing and health warnings, executives admit privately that growth in the market is likely to slow in the coming years.So the window of opportunity for tobacco investors looks like it could soon start to close, albeit over a long period of time as the powerful tobacco lobby pushes back against new regulations.Related reading:

130;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-09-27T21:44:05Z;Smoking: Big Tobacco’s market place battle;Manufacturers face increasingly stringent regulation, says Christopher Thompson;Despite the steady march of smoking bans in offices, restaurants and public spaces, tobacco use continues to kill nearly 6m people each year.Accounting for one in every 10 adult deaths, smoking is arguably the most widespread public health threat in the world and the single biggest preventable cause of cancer.While the vast majority of those killed are either smokers or ex-smokers, an estimated 600,000 die from the effects of inhaled second-hand smoke.Little wonder that the Geneva-based World Health Organisation describes the habit as an “epidemic”.The government of Australia, which already has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, plans to implement the world’s toughest antismoking laws, dubbed “ plain packaging”.All cigarettes would be sold in olive green packets, with the brands in standardised font and graphic health warnings – pictures of mouth cancer and other smoking-related illnesses – taking up most of the pack.Unsurprisingly, Big Tobacco has fought back. The world’s four biggest cigarette companies outside China – Japan Tobacco International, British American Tobacco, Philip Morris International and Imperial Tobacco – are suing the government.They argue they are being stripped of their intellectual property. But, in August, the companies lost their first case in Australia’s high court.Nicola Roxon, the attorney-general, whose father, a smoker, died of cancer when she was a child, hailed the ruling as a watershed moment. “The message to the rest of the world is Big Tobacco can be taken on and beaten.”Plain packaging is due to be implemented in December. Alarmed that such regulation could spread to more profitable markets, some tobacco companies have provided support to Ukraine and Honduras– which have significant tobacco interests – in making a formal complaint against Australia at the World Trade Organisation.In addition to being anti free-trade, Big Tobacco argues that plain packaging will make cigarettes easier to counterfeit and smuggle and therefore would not reduce cancer rates.Nicandro Durante, chief executive of BAT, says: “It’s a bad piece of regulation that’s not going to meet public health goals.”Nevertheless, Britain, Norway, New Zealand, Canada, India and France are considering similar measures. The EU is expected to address the issue this year.Gregory Connolly, director for the Centre for Global Tobacco Control at Harvard University, says tobacco companies are right to worry. “A nation such as Australia can adopt a very high ceiling,” he says. “There’s no level playing field [on regulation], so companies have to adapt and it drives the tobacco multinationals crazy.”But the bigger question is whether such regulation will expand into emerging markets, where 80 per cent of the world’s 1bn smokers live and where cancer deaths could rise markedly.Prof Connelly says: “In the 20th century, there were about 100m deaths from smoking in the west. We will have 1bn deaths in the 21st, the vast majority of them in the developing world.”Some developing countries are leading a fightback.In March, Brazil announced a ban on all flavoured tobaccos – such as menthol cigarettes. It argued that such products lured youngsters into smoking.In Uruguay, health warnings must cover 80 per cent of a cigarette packet, while smoking outdoors is banned near hospitals and schools.But two of the world’s biggest markets maintain a light touch when it comes to regulation.A US federal court recently barred the government from requiring tobacco companies to put health warnings on cigarette packs on the grounds that they violated free speech laws.As for China, where a third of the world’s smokers live, the enforcement of smoking bans outside the main cities is lax.For health campaigners, a more unlikely source of support may be found in tobacco companies themselves. Big Tobacco and a host of independent companies are betting that e-cigarettes, vaporisers and nicotine inhalers may be future alternatives.Paul Triniman, chief executive of UK-based Kind Consumer, which is developing a cigarette substitute, says: “If you can allow smokers to get the nicotine hit without tar, there would be a significant improvement on a harm-reduction basis, whereby they can satisfy their craving without carcinogens and toxins.”Last year, BAT established Nicoventures, a division devoted to cigarette alternatives. It plans to launch a nicotine inhaler by the end of 2014. Philip Morris plans to launch what it describes as a healthier version of its cigarettes under the Marlboro brand in 2016.But with Big Tobacco continuing to drive cigarette volumes in emerging markets, it is within national governments where the battle ground between public health and tobacco commerce lies.“There are two trains coming – one is the tobacco companies and the other is states’ exercising national sovereignty based on public health principles.”
131;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-09-12T11:28:39Z;Tobacco companies – out of puff;Plain packaging, smoking bans and higher taxes take their toll;Gauloises have their helmets and Gitanes their dancers. But the two French cigarette brands may soon be sheared of their packaging adornments. Rumours in France suggest that the government could force tobacco companies to strip branding from their products, as well as increasing taxes. It is hardly surprising that shares in Imperial Tobacco, which owns both brands, are down 10 per cent in the past month.France is not the only cause of the tobacco stock sell-off, and Imperial is not the only victim. The sector has fallen sharply of late as talk in France has been joined by proposals in Russia to ban smoking in public places and a more general rotation out of defensive stocks. Japan Tobacco (which generates a fifth of its revenues in Russia, according to Investec) is down 14 per cent since mid-August, British American Tobacco is off 7 per cent, and Philip Morris International 5 per cent.Imperial has not been aided by its exposure to Europe’s unhelpful combination of wary consumers and enthusiastic regulators. Four-fifths of its sales come from the region, while its revenue growth and returns on capital lag those of BAT and Philip Morris. And although Imperial has long been seen as a takeover target, competition concerns would make a deal tricky. All of which leads to a justified share price discount to rivals. Imperial’s enterprise value is nine times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, against 11 for BAT and Philip Morris, which generate over half of their sales in emerging markets.The possibility of legislation in Russia suggests that emerging markets will not be immune from tighter regulation. For now, that threat should be offset by market growth. The same cannot be said for developed markets. That makes BAT and Philip Morris the more attractive options, despite the higher valuation.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
132;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-09-03T19:46:34Z;US groups’ euro debt issuance surges;;"US companies have issued more debt in euros this summer than in the previous two-and-a half years combined as they seek to take advantage of the red-hot European corporate bond market.Investment-grade companies including Philip Morris and Cargill have borrowed $5.6bn worth of euros in the past four months, compared with $2bn worth borrowed each year in 2010 and 2011, according to Dealogic, the data provider.Since late 2009, when the European sovereign debt crisis kicked off in earnest, US companies have been reluctant to borrow in Europe, but as risk appetite has improved in recent months they have been seeing a window of opportunity to borrow at low rates.“Some US-based companies have been coming back into both the euro and sterling markets to fulfil the funding needs of their European businesses,” said Marco Baldini, head of European corporate bond syndicate at Barclays Capital.“In addition, other US issuers are looking to diversify their investor base.”Procter & Gamble, for example, was last month able to issue €1bn of 10-year bonds at 25 basis points above mid-swaps, the European reference point for funding bond issues, which was even better than the 50bp over mid-swaps from its last euro issue in October 2007.“There has been a big uptick in cross-Atlantic borrowing this year,” said Myles Clarke, co-head of the global syndicate desk at RBS. “Sometimes the funding is more attractive than what is available locally and it can add to the diversification of the issuer’s investor base.”This comes as appetite for high-yielding assets in the corporate debt market has been stoked by comments in late July from Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, that he was willing to do “whatever it takes” to support the euro.August was the best month for US companies issuing in euros since September 2009, with $1.8bn being issued over the month. The $3bn worth of sterling-dominated bonds issued by US companies this year is also the highest since 2009.These figures are still small in terms of issuances by US companies in their own domestic markets, where the value of deals reached about $130bn in August.European companies issued $20bn worth of debt in August, the highest
on record and more than double the $8bn average for the month, according to Dealogic data dating back to 1995."
133;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Australia upholds tobacco branding ban;;Australia’s top court has rejected a challenge by the world’s biggest tobacco companies seeking to overturn a law requiring cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging.The law, approved by parliament last year, requires cigarettes to be sold in drab dark packaging from December, without logos but featuring graphic images of smoking-related diseases. Brand names can still be used but only in a standard font, size and position.British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris International, and Japan Tobacco had argued that the world’s first plain packaging law was unconstitutional because it amounted to an acquisition of intellectual property without adequate compensation.But on Wednesday, the High Court struck down the challenge, which is being closely followed outside Australia by the EU and several countries that are consulting on whether to ban branding on tobacco packaging.“The plaintiffs argued that some or all of the provisions of the act were invalid because they were an acquisition of property otherwise than on just terms,” the court said in a summary of the decision. “At least a majority of the court is of the opinion that the act is not contrary to section 51 of the constitution.”The EU is considering introducing plain packaging, while the UK government finished its public consultation on the issue last week.John Doherty, head of regulation at the UK-based law firm Manches, said the alcohol and fast food industries were watching developments closely.“The Australian judgment and the UK’s proposed plain packaging regime for tobacco products will be of major concern for all producers of consumer products that have known adverse health effects,” he said.“The most obvious candidates next in line to face similar initiatives will be the alcohol, soft drinks and fast food industries.”The spectre of plain packaging has prompted many tobacco companies to invest in a new generation of smokeless alternatives to cigarettes as the industry faces down regulatory threats across the globe.The High Court is to publish its reasons for the decision later in the year. The Labor government had argued that it was not acquiring intellectual property, but preventing tobacco companies from using their brands to promote the products.Nicola Roxon, Australia’s attorney-general, and Tanya Plibersek, health minister, welcomed the decision.“This is a victory for all those families who have lost someone to tobacco-related illness,” they said in a statement. “No longer when a smoker pulls out a packet of cigarettes will that packet be a mobile billboard.”The decision, which had been expected by legal experts, does not, however, mark the end of the legal battle over plain packaging. It will be contested under international trade agreements.Philip Morris is challenging the law under the 1993 Bilateral Investment Treaty between Australia and Hong Kong. This has led to accusations by Ms Roxon that Philip Morris deliberately transferred ownership of its Australian business from a Swiss parent company to Hong Kong so that it could launch proceedings. Trade complaints have also been filed at the World Trade Organisation.“We will have to wait to read the court’s opinion to fully assess today’s decision,” said Philip Morris. “Regardless, the legality of plain packaging, including whether Australia will have to pay substantial compensation to Philip Morris Asia, remains at issue and will be considered in other ongoing legal challenges.”BAT expressed disappointment at the decision and said the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act was a “bad piece of law that will only benefit organised crime groups which sell illegal tobacco”.The company said: “The illegal cigarette black market will grow further when all packs look the same and are easier to copy.”Additional reporting Christopher Thompson
134;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-08-12T16:04:23Z;Big tobacco push for cigarette alternatives;;Big tobacco companies are investing in a new generation of smokeless alternatives to cigarettes as the industry faces growing regulatory threats across the globe.The world’s four biggest tobacco companies outside China – Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco International and Imperial Tobacco – are positioning themselves for an increasingly smoke-free future as they seek to entice smokers to non-combustible substitutes such as electronic cigarettes, tobacco vaporisers and nicotine inhalers over the next decade.“It will be one of the big discussion points in the industry in coming few years,” says Peter Nixon, vice-president of communications at PMI. “We think [smokeless cigarettes] can be a significant revenue segment in the future as an alternative to cigarettes.”The smokeless tobacco market, which also includes chewing tobacco and snuff, was worth $14bn of the $664bn world tobacco market according to Euromonitor in 2011, with cigarettes still accounting for over 90 per cent of the total.PMI is working on plans to launch a cigarette under the Marlboro brand in 2016 where the tobacco is heated rather than burnt – thus creating less smoke and tar – to attract more health-conscious smokers.Last year British American Tobacco set up Nicoventures, a business division devoted to smoking alternatives, which is working towards launching an inhalable pure nicotine product within the next two years or so. It believes the product will offer a safer alternative to smoking while still meeting smokers’ cravings.“We don’t see smokeless cigarettes as being a niche product,” said David O’Reilly, BAT’s group scientific director. “This will be a major focus going forward – giving cigarette smokers a healthier alternative whilst not compromising on the taste and the sensory pleasure of smoking.”The change in direction by tobacco companies comes as the industry faces increased regulatory pressure both in mature markets and emerging economies such as Brazil, South Africa and Uruguay. Last year Australia passed the world’s most strident anti-tobacco regulation, dubbed “plain packaging”, whereby tobacco products are sold in drab, standardised packs with graphic health warnings replacing brands. Plain packaging is also being considered in the UK and the European Union.The biggest component of the present market for cigarette substitutes is electronic cigarettes, dubbed e-cigarettes, which are unregulated. Imperial, which last year bought an undisclosed stake in an e-cigarette company, said they are poised to expand significantly.“There is demand from people who want to move from tobacco products … and it will keep growing,” said Alex Parsons, a spokesman for Imperial. “A couple of years ago no one was speaking about e-cigarettes, now there’s a proliferation of companies across the globe.”Companies have invested in smokeless alternatives before with mixed results. In the 1980s the US conglomerate RJR Nabisco pioneered one of the first smokeless cigarettes, called Premier, at an estimated cost of more than $300m. But it sold poorly amid consumer concerns over the taste and smell.
135;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
136;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-08-12T15:45:19Z;Big Tobacco bets on e-cigarette future;;When a passenger on an intercity Megabus coach service reported seeing smoke emanating from a carry-on bag last month, British authorities feared a terrorist attack, and closed down a big motorway.What armed police, fire crews and bomb disposal experts discovered was altogether less sinister: the “smoke” was in fact vapour from an electronic cigarette device.E-cigarettes contain nicotine-infused water that is inhaled as a vapour and can be legally consumed indoors, not to mention on intercity coaches.Some contain a red glowing end to resemble the burning tip of a cigarette, and are available with various tobacco-like flavours such as menthol.They retail from about £20 for a “starter kit” containing a battery powered tube and vapour charges that contain several hundred doses.As conventional smokers are encouraged to extinguish their butts through a mix of increasing state regulation of public consumption and high taxes, Big Tobacco and a host of independent companies – such as Skycig, Vapestick, Vapouriz, Ploom and Steamlite – are betting that smokeless cigarettes could be a future substitute.E-cigarettes have been on the market for several years, but few solid statistics are available on their uptake among the UK’s 10m smokers.Estimates for the size of the UK’s e-cigarette market range from £10m up to £70m.According to figures from some of the multitude of e-cigarette makers, about 2m Britons have a tried the devices and 650,000 have become regular users.However, that number could grow as greater regulation looms, such as plain packaging proposals that would remove brands from cigarette packs.Last year British American Tobacco established Nicoventures, a company division devoted to cigarette alternatives. It plans to launch a nicotine inhaler by the end of 2014.“With both increased regulation and increased demonisation of smoking, you need to give smokers safer choices,” says David O’Reilly, BAT’s group scientific director.“The vision is for another product which can compete with enjoyment of smoking cigarettes, and e-cigarettes are closest thing on market that meets those needs.”A private company called Kind Consumer, backed by BAT and advised by Sir Terry Leahy, is seeking to raise £10m from private investors for research and development of a cigarette substitute to launch around 2015.“Our aim is to give addicted smokers craving nicotine an alternative option to a cigarettes,” said Paul Triniman, Kind Comsumer’s chief executive. “If you can allow smokers to get the nicotine hit without tar, there would be a significant improvement on a harm-reduction basis whereby they can satisfy their craving without carcinogens and toxins.”E-cigarettes are almost entirely unregulated in the UK, are not subject to uniform standards, and have been outlawed in countries including Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Canada.That has not stopped companies such as FTSE 100 company Imperial Tobacco taking an undisclosed stake in an e-cigarette company, or Japan Tobacco International signing an agreement to commercialise the nicotine “vaporisers” made by San Francisco-based Ploom abroad.“E-cigarettes are growing at a phenomenal rate because of cigarette restrictions . . . we’ve been monitoring that and we want to build our knowledge and understanding of the industry,” says Alex Parsons, Imperial’s director of communications.Much of the UK’s e-cigarette market is geared towards smokers trying to give up. The nicotine replacement therapy industry – which includes nicotine replacement chewing gum and patches – is worth some £150m a year.No e-cigarette has yet gained UK approval as a medicinal nicotine replacement therapy, although the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is investigating the devices and is scheduled to report back next year. The US Food and Drug Administration has also examined the product.“The problem is that these products have come on to the market with very little information known about them,” says ASH, the antismoking lobby group.“They are neither a tobacco product, neither are they a medicine. They don’t appear to cause harm, but we simply do not know.”In spite of concerns over their safety, the MHRA wants to regulate their use rather than ban them and push smokers back to tobacco cigarettes.Philip Morris believes a bigger market will be found either in replacing cigarettes altogether or as complementary devices for when smokers cannot light up, such as in a restaurant, aircraft or bus. As such, the company plans to launch what it describes as a healthier version of its cigarettes under the Marlboro brand in 2016.“When you burn a cigarette you inhale some flavour and smoke . . . so we’re looking at different ways of heating tobacco so you get flavour and nicotine but less smoke,” says Mr Nixon. “E-cigarettes don’t taste that great, so we’re working on something closer to the traditional cigarette.”
137;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-07-24T08:31:31Z;Premium brands boost Imperial Tobacco;;Price increases and a focus on promoting its premium cigarette brands have buoyed revenues at Imperial Tobacco, in spite of volumes continuing their decline at the FTSE 100 tobacco group.Smokers cutting back on their habit dragged down volumes of cigarettes and loose-cut tobacco – a measure known as “stick equivalents” – 3 per cent in the nine months to June 30 year-on-year, slowing from the 4.1 per cent decline reported in the first half.However, the world’s fourth-largest cigarette company by market share increased revenues 3 per cent year-on-year by targeting its premium brands, such as Davidoff and West, towards wealthier smokers.The Bristol-based company on Tuesday said sales of what it calls its four “key strategic brands” – including Gauloises Blondes and JPS – were up 13 per cent compared with the same period a year ago, with volumes up 6 per cent.The four brands account for almost a third of total stick equivalent volumes at the group, which has managed to edge up its prices over the past year in spite of higher taxes and new antismoking regulations, such as Australia’s looming introduction of plain packaging laws.Other methods to boost revenues include the introduction of cigarette packs that can be flipped open with one hand, as well as filters that release a menthol flavour when squeezed.“Imperial Tobacco’s ability to drive these brands harder through innovation is a key component of its investment case,” said Chris Wickham, analyst at Oriel Securities, who reiterated his “buy” recommendation on the stock.However, Imperial’s troubles continue in recession-hit Spain– its biggest market by revenues after Germany and the UK – with stick equivalent volumes down 11 per cent year on year.Spain, which comprises about 7 per cent of Imperial’s total revenues, was the cause of a profit warning last year when a price war broke out with British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International.Poland and Ukraine were other weak points for Imperial, as an influx of illicit tobacco hit the market and hurt sales. Volumes of Imperial’s fine-cut tobacco fell 37 per cent in Poland year on year, while cigarette volumes slipped 11 per cent in Ukraine.“Challenging conditions persist in some markets but we have a strong record of delivering growth in this environment,” said Alison Cooper, Imperial chief executive.Imperial, whose other brands include Richmond, Rizla papers and Golden Virginia fine-cut tobacco, has focused on improving sales of its range of luxury Cuban cigars – up 10 per cent year-on-year – which have found popularity in emerging markets in Asia.Imperial Tobacco shares closed unchanged at £24.49.

This year’s surge in Russian and Turkish consumer activity has given a welcome boost to Philip Morris International, the US tobacco group.As the company warned last month, the financial benefits would have been even greater had it not been for the recent turmoil in emerging market currencies. “Currency headwinds” held the company back, turning a 3.4 per cent gain in operating income before currency adjustments into a 2.7 per cent decline. Expect more such announcements from multinationals active in emerging markets.Reporting its second quarter results, PMI disclosed an 8.7 per cent increase in cigarette sales in Russia, led by a 12.5 per cent rise in premium brands including Parliament and Marlboro. Turkey was up by even more, 8.9 per cent. Overall, eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EEMEA) was the top-performing region, with a 5.1 per cent increase in shipments, compared with a 1.2 per cent decline at group level.In financial terms, the EEMEA region’s lead over the rest of the world in the three months to the end of June was just as noticeable. Net revenues rose 6.9 per cent to $1.15bn, compared to a 1.8 per cent decline to $8.12bn, and operating incomes were up 13.5 per cent at $948m, versus a 2.7 per cent decline (after currency adjustments) at $3.68bn.Net revenues, excluding excise taxes, were down 1.8 per cent at $8.1bn, or up 2.9 per cent excluding currency and acquisitions.CEO Louis C. Camilleri said in a statement:Our broad geographic footprint, world-class brand portfolio and a strong pricing environment remain the cornerstone of our continuing ability to capitalize on growth opportunities around the world, whilst enabling us to weather uncertainty in those markets where economic conditions are still currently weak.In other words, emerging markets are good for us.Related reading:

139;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-07-06T20:04:00Z;JT threatens UK over plain packaging;;Japan Tobacco International, the world’s third-biggest tobacco company by volume, has warned it will take legal action against the UK government if it implements plain packaging for cigarettes.Speaking at the launch of a £2m advertising campaign sponsored by the company against the plain packaging proposals being considered by the Department of Health, Martin Southgate, JT’s managing director for the UK, said the company would consider taking the government to court to protect its brands if it did not “see sense”.“We would be prepared to defend our position if it ended up in court but we don’t want to,” he said.JT said court challenges would be considered at a UK and European Union level. He added that the company would likely make a decision in September after the UK’s DoH finished its consultation on plain packaging next month.The warning is the latest escalation in criticism of government proposals by the tobacco industry. It worries that the UK could soon follow the example of Australia, where all tobacco products are due to be sold in identical drab packs with standardised brand names and carrying large health warnings later this year.Alison Cooper, the chief executive of FTSE 100 constituent Imperial Tobacco, criticised the health department for being “anti-business” in May.Philip Morris International, the maker of Marlboro, recently commissioned a report which predicted a steep increase in cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting if plain packs legislation was implemented.JT echoed this concern. The maker of Camel and Silk Cut cigarettes said its relative UK market share could suffer as the share of the illicit trade increased.Separately Mr Southgate attacked the independence of the health department and said there was evidence the ministry had already made its decision.“There are indications a decision has already been made to implement [plain packaging] …despite the lack of evidence which exists,” he said.However, tobacco control campaigners argue plain packs could be an important tool in reducing smoking, particularly among young people who are partly attracted to smoking by brands and colourful packaging, tobacco control campaigners say.So far only Australia has passed legislation on plain packs.JT is party to a legal battle there accusing the government of illegally confiscating their brands. The policy is also being considered in the EU.
140;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-06-27T08:29:04Z;StanChart: EM currency warning;;"Standard Chartered Bank on Wednesday became the latest company to warn of the impact of this year’s sharp decline in emerging market currencies.The bank said in a statement that growth in income and in pre-tax profits would be below 10 per cent in the six months to the end of June, due to the slow down in Asia and a drop in Asian currencies against the US dollar, not least in the Indian rupee.StanChart shares fell 2 per cent early in Hong Kong, before investors decided that there wasn’t much in the announcement that they didn’t know already – and the stock recovered to trade 1 per cent lower. But StanChart is not alone. Procter & Gamble and Philip Morris International have both this month warned of the impact of EM currency swings on their results. There will be others.StanChart said in its statement:Local currency weakness is expected to drag group income by over 2 percent, with the Indian rupee being the major contributor.With its extensive EM operations, Standard Chartered is more exposed than most international banks to EM currency swings. Analysts won’t be shocked by Wednesday’s announcement having pencilled in forecasts of a pre-tax profit increase of around 11 per cent for 2012, the same as 2011, and down from 19.6 per cent in 2010.Given the turmoil in EM currrencies, it could have been worse. The Indian rupee and the Russian rouble are both down by nearly 11 per cent in the second quarter of 2012, and the Brazilian real is 12 per cent lower.Other heavily-traded currencies have fared only a little bit better – the Czech crown is down by 10 per cent on the quarter, the South African rand by 9.3 per cent, the Polish zloty by 8.6 per cent and the Mexican peso by 6.8 per cent.The fact that three of the four Bric (Brazil, Russia, India and China) economies are leading the way is significant because these big countries dominate emerging markets and have collectively provided the biggest stimulus to global growth since the economic crisis hit in 2008.Even the largest Bric – China – has slowed efforts to boost the renminbi and allowed it to decline in the last three months, albeit by only 1 per cent.For the half-year, the picture is only slightly better as the sell-off in the second quarter has obliterated modest gains made in the first three months. Among the worst performers, the Brazilian real is down by 10 per cent, the Rupee by 7.1 per cent, and the Czech crown by 5.3 per cent.These dramatic falls are driven mainly by investors’ flight to safety to the US ollar in the light of the euro crisis. But there are also growing fears over the weakening economic performance of emerging economies – which has centred on their standard-bearers, the Brics. Investors seem to have decided that this time around China and the other Brics cannot restart the world economy as they did after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.David Bloom, head of foreign exchange strategy at HSBC, says: “I think people are having second thoughts about the whole Brics experience.”Significantly, the sell-off in Brazil, Russia and India has been greater than in those EM currencies that have traditionally seen the largest swings, including Mexico, South Africa and Poland. This is partly because the bigger economies have more liquid currencies which are easier to dump in a sell-off, and partly because investors had higher hopes of the Brics, with their large domestic markets, weathering the crisis better than their smaller rivals.While the consensus remains that emerging markets will grow faster than the developed world in the long run, the immediate challenges may overshadow the outlook for some time to come. As Sebastien Barbe, head of emerging market research at Credit Agricole, says: “People are looking at emerging markets and saying there is a new normal coming. So markets are trying to price the new normal.”For China, that could mean annual gross domestic product growth of 7 per cent, instead of 10 per cent. For almost all economies it brings uncertainty, which in a risk-off environment, worries investors.Some emerging markets policymakers, who were until recently mostly glad to see their currencies shed some of the rapid gains made in the post- 2009 recovery, are now trying to stop the rot. Brazil, for example, this month cut a tax on overseas loans. India last month reduced the overseas income companies can hold in foreign exchange to encourage them to bring funds home, and this month increased ceilings on foreign investment in government bonds. Brazil, Russia and India have all intervened in the markets to support their currencies.Concerns about excess inflows of short-term money have rapidly turned into worries about investors rushing for the exits. According to the Brazilian central bank, investors withdrew $6.3 billion from Brazil’s stocks and bond. in Russia, where capital flight has been a persistent challenge, outflows reached a net $46.5bn in the first five months of the year, compared to $80bn in the whole of 2011.And as economies slow and currencies fall, EM-based foreign exchange borrowers will face a big squeeze. Russian companies have been prominent in reducing fx loans after suffering mightily from over-exposure in 2008-9. But Asian companies have been borrowing heavily in recent months, as have their Brazilian counterparts.When some of these businesses come to publish their 2012 financial figures, StanChart’s mild profits warning will quickly be forgotten.Related reading:

141;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-06-21T21:02:19Z;US stocks fall amid broad sell-off;;US equity markets on Thursday suffered their largest one-day drop since the start of the month as investors prepared for the downgrade of major US banks with sentiment also hurt by worries over the global economy.The S&P financials index dropped 2.3 per cent in regular trading and then after the closing bell Moody’s lowered the credit ratings on 15 major global investment banks’.In after-hours trading, shares in Morgan Stanley rose 3.4 per cent as the cut was less severe than expected and that offset a drop of 1.7 per cent to $13.96 in regular trading.Shares in JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs also moved higher in after-hours trade after they had their ratings cut. Negative outlooks on the bank’s ratings remained in place.Earlier during regular trading, shares in Bank of America dropped 3.9 per cent to $7.82, JPMorgan Chase fell 2.6 per cent to $35.51 and Citigroup lost 3.6 per cent to $28.83. Goldman Sachs dropped 2.7 per cent to $93.90.That weighed on the broad market, but energy, material and technology stocks led losses, with commodity-based stocks hit hard by fears of slowing global economy.The S&P 500 lost 2.2 per cent to 1,325.51 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.9 per cent to 12,573.57 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.4 per cent to 2,859.09. The CBOE’s Vix index, dubbed the “fear gauge”, rose more than 16 per cent to 20.06.Quincy Krosby, financial markets strategist at Prudential, said: “The combination of economic data that was weaker than expected, continued worries over eurozone sovereign debt crisis and disappointment from the Fed’s monetary policy decision was a lethal combination and triggered a broad sell-off.“At these levels markets are moving to what most analysts think of as being oversold,” she added.Among a host of stocks that experienced sharp price declines, Bed Bath & Beyond shares tumbled after the housewares chain announced a slowdown in same-store sales for the second quarter and forecast profits that were well below market expectations.The dramatic 17 per cent fall to $61.17 came after the company’s share price hit a record high on Tuesday.Gary Baxter, analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note: “One of the reasons behind the weaker guidance was costs associated with the acquisition of Cost Plus, numbers we are quite sure investors did not have in their models. Near term, we do not expect the stock to outperform. That said, we believe investors are overreacting to the costs of the acquisitions and underestimating the benefits.”Investors who were expecting more aggressive stimulus from the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday were mildly disappointed after the central bank decided to extend Operation Twist for another six months but left the door open for further easing if the economy deteriorates.That was followed by the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey index dropping unexpectedly and data showed that initial jobless claims had not fallen as much as hoped.Disappointing economic news from China and Germany also weighed on stocks before the opening bell. Worries about slowing demand in China and Europe triggered selling of materials and energy stocks, which are strongly correlated to commodities, especially crude oil.ExxonMobil fell 3.4 per cent to $82.11 and ConocoPhillips fell 2.5 per cent to $52.07, but the biggest loser among S&P energy stocks was EOG Resources, an independent oil and gas group, which fell 6.9 per cent to $86.48.Meanwhile, disappointing US existing home sales figures put downward pressure on builders and home improvement stores. Pulte fell 4 per cent to $9.14 and DR Horton fell 2.7 per cent to $16.29.Among tech stocks, Apple fell 1.4 per cent to $577.67 while Google and Oracle lost 2.4 per cent to $565.21 and 2.4 per cent to $27.81, respectively.Shares in Red Hat, the largest seller of the open-source Linux operating system, slumped 6.2 per cent to $53 as deferred revenue missed some analysts’ forecasts.Ebay edged higher in early trade after the online auction sales group announced plans to build a new data centre that would draw power from renewable energy fuel cells instead of the electric grid. But the company’s shares soon fell in line with the rest of the tech sector, closing 2.6 per cent to $41.83.Philip Morris International’s fell 3.3 per cent to $85.60 after the world’s largest tobacco company by revenues warned that the strengthening US dollar would drag on its earnings this year. The group’s profit warning comes on the heels of similar warnings from Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo on Wednesday.ConAgra was a rare bright spot, up 2.7 per cent to $25.26, after adjusted quarterly profit narrowly beat Wall Street estimates.
142;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Philip Morris warns on strong US dollar;;Philip Morris International, the world’s largest tobacco company by revenues, said on Thursday that the strengthening US dollar will be a drag on its earnings this year.The US company that sells tobacco products overseas warned that foreign exchange fluctuations could cut 25 cents off its earnings per share in 2012, reducing the top end of its forecast from $5.30 to $5.20 a share. Excluding the impact of currencies PMI expects its profits to rise by 10-12 per cent from a year ago.PMI’s profit warning came a day after Procter & Gamble reduced its earnings outlook and PepsiCo said that foreign exchange would be a bigger drag on its performance than it anticipated.In spite of currency concerns, PMI said it was making progress on other fronts.Louis Camilleri, chief executive, said in an investor presentation on Thursday that the company has been successful at fending off excessive excise taxes in most countries and had made substantial progress with “modified risk tobacco products” which are expected to support sales as more people quit smoking.“We are on the eve of what we all believe could be a paradigm shift for our industry and for PMI,” Mr Camilleri said.However, PMI warned that plain packaging legislation that the Australian government is trying to impose, and that other countries are considering, represents a risk.“We are witnessing more frequent calls for measures that are not only arbitrary and alarming, but that stand little or no chance of achieving the benefits that their proponents claim,” Mr Camilleri said.
143;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-06-10T15:43:41Z;Philip Morris hits at UK over plain packs;;"Philip Morris International, the world’s biggest cigarette company outside China, has attacked the credibility of the UK’s Department of Health in its public consultation over whether to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products.A report commissioned by the maker of Marlboro cigarettes – seen by the Financial Times – said the DoH’s cornerstone study on plain packaging, failed to provide evidence that it would reduce smoking rates and relied on studies that were “not reliable, rigorous, high quality … and [contain] unrepresentative samples”.The comments, in a report by the US-based consulting company Compass Lexecon, represent unusually strident criticism from a big tobacco company and come after Alison Cooper, the chief executive of FTSE 100 Imperial Tobacco, criticised the DoH for being “anti-business” last month.They indicate widespread tobacco industry worries that the UK could soon follow the example of Australia, where all tobacco products are due to be sold in identical drab packs with standardised brand names and carrying large health warnings later this year.The DoH report by the Public Health Research Consortium, a network of researchers funded by the DoH, is the largest government report to date into the efficacy of plain packs in reducing smoking rates.Professor Gerard Hastings, one of the report’s authors, said: “Just over three dozen studies were identified and these show that plain packaging can help smokers in three ways: by increasing the prominence and effectiveness of health warnings; by making the pack, and thereby smoking, less appealing and removing the confusion about relative harm which pack design can cause.”Separately, Philip Morris has also released a study by academics at Transcrime, a criminology research centre based in Milan, which warned plain packaging would make counterfeiting cigarettes easier and could lead to an increase in tobacco smuggling into the UK.“We don’t think plain packaging would reduce smoking rates and would just lead to an increase in the black market for cigarettes,” said Philip Morris.So far only Australia has passed legislation on plain packaging. The government is fighting a series of legal battles with tobacco makers, who accuse it of illegally confiscating their brands. The policy is also being considered in the EU.British American Tobacco described the DoH’s evidence for introducing plain packs as “limited”.“We are very concerned therefore that this evidence base and consultation impact assessment process falls short of standards that would normally be required before policy should be considered, let alone implemented,” said BAT.DoH said the government would remain “impartial” on plain packs until it finishes its consultation in July.This article has been amended to reflect the fact that Philip Morris International does not make Benson & Hedges cigarettes in the UK."
144;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-05-09T17:45:44Z;Philip Morris faces AGM fire on marketing;;"Philip Morris International, the global tobacco company, came under fire during its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday as activists condemned it for strong-arming countries that try to deter smoking and for marketing its products to youngsters.“Philip Morris has built its empire by putting at risk the wellbeing and livelihood of millions of consumers across the globe,” John Stewart, of Corporate Accountability International, said.Louis Camilleri, chief executive of Philip Morris, calmly fielded questions for nearly an hour at the New York meeting. But at times he hit back at the criticism, saying activists were “at times blinded by their hatred” of the tobacco industry.The Philip Morris annual meeting is open only to shareholders, but opposition groups such as CAI often buy a share in the company so they can come and make their voices heard.CAI presented a letter calling on Philip Morris to roll back its strategy of “intimidation by litigation” ahead of the World Health Organisation’s global tobacco treaty in Seoul later this year.The company, maker of the Marlboro brand, has filed lawsuits against Australia, Uruguay and Norway to fend off tightening anti-smoking measures.Tobacco groups have been fuming over plain packaging legislation due to be implemented in Australia later this year and under consideration in Europe.Mr Camilleri called the packaging rules, which would remove corporate branding from cigarette packages, “a very flawed policy” and said it would only drive down the price of cigarettes and make smuggling easier.He argued that advertising and marketing were not significant drivers that encouraged people to take up smoking and that smokers would probably continue to be loyal to the company’s brands.Philip Morris has been under pressure to scale back its advertising and has been criticised for targeting children.Its Indonesian unit was scolded by the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance last year for a billboard that read: “Dying is better than leaving a friend; Sampoerna is a cool friend”, implying that smokers would rather die than quit.“We recognise that cigarettes are a cause of very significant diseases and that’s why we try to operate our business in the most responsible manner possible,” Mr Camilleri said. “We are often criticised because we enter so-called emerging markets, as if that makes them smoke. They’ve been smoking for centuries.”People came to the Philip Morris meeting from as far as Hawaii and Sri Lanka and several told stories of relatives who died or became sick from smoking.Mr Camilleri expressed sympathy for the dying father of one woman and said he would encourage the man, who had heart surgery, to try to quit. He also backed down on controversial comments he made last year, when he told critics it was easy to stop smoking.“It can be excruciatingly difficult to quit,” Mr Camilleri said. “Many millions of people have been successful and we should be encouraging and giving the proper motivation.”"
145;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-05-07T18:55:34Z;Imperial head fumes over plain packaging;;Imperial Tobacco, the Bristol-based FTSE-100 company, has criticised the UK government’s consultation on smoking regulation as “anti-business”.Alison Cooper, the 46-year-old cigar-smoking chief executive of the world’s fourth-largest cigarette company by market share, said she had written to the government for clarification about the department of health’s consultation on introducing plain packaging – in which tobacco companies would have to sell their products in identical drab packs with large health warnings.“It’s not just a tobacco issue any more, it’s about government’s role…[and] a precedent for other businesses in terms of this is where governments can go,” Mrs Cooper told the Financial Times. “This is not about a health issue at all. This is anti-business.”Last year, Australia became the first country to pass plain packs legislation, due to be implemented in December this year.The law is being challenged in the country’s courts by the world’s biggest tobacco companies outside China – Imperial, British American Tobacco, Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International – and by some member countries at the World Trade Organization, which accuse Australia of illegally confiscating intellectual property.The European Union is also looking at plain packaging. If enacted it could cost Big Tobacco billions of pounds in revenue as companies compete against each other on price and smokers trade down to cheaper cigarettes.“From a health perspective the average price will go down, so people would consume more,” said Mrs Cooper.“The so-called evidence supporting plain packaging is purely put together by anti-tobacco lobby groups…[so] we need to push here to make sure we get a genuine consultation with the health department. Maybe it should be overseen by someone like business instead, because I’m concerned it won’t be genuine otherwise.”The comments represent the most direct criticism yet by a tobacco company boss of the government’s plain packaging consultation, launched last month.However Imperial, which owns the Davidoff, Gauloises and Lambert & Butler brands, rejected the suggestion its revenues would be substantially hit.“I’m not bothered by people trading down, because if you look at our products in Australia it’s towards the value end of the market and similarly in the UK we’ve got huge strength in the value end,” said Mrs Cooper.“We want business to grow here. We’re slipping into another recession and yet we’ve got a government who said they’re sensible going down a route potentially of not having a genuine consultation about something which is significant not only for the tobacco business but other stakeholders.”A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The health secretary has made clear that he has an open mind about action in the light of this consultation.“We want to hear as many views as possible about whether tobacco packing should remain unchanged, plain packaging should be adopted or a different option should be considered.”Meanwhile, Mrs Cooper, who celebrates her second anniversary in the job this month, said she was focused on generating “organic growth” as she moved Imperial away from being a cigarette manufacturer into a consumer goods company.“It’s how we cross-sell our total tobacco portfolio.” she said. “For example, someone who smokes a Cohiba cigar may smoke a Davidoff once or twice a week.“Or, as happens a lot in the EU, people smoke fine-cut tobacco during the week then on a Saturday night prefer to have a pack of cigarettes and not bother with roll-ups. It’s about making sure you have something to fit the various occasions.”This month, Imperial reported a 2 per cent increase in interim revenues to £13.9bn despite cigarette sales volumes falling by more than 4 per cent as consumers in recession-hit economies cut back on their habit.But Citigroup analysts worry that the price increases successfully passed on by the company could be jeopardised if a larger competitor starts cutting their prices.“The company is highly dependent on Philip Morris’s pricing decisions,” it recently said in a research note. “In the majority of its markets, it has little ability to make its own pricing decisions . . . Historically, PM has been willing, when provoked, to spark a price war.”Mrs Cooper said the company’s innovation – such as tobacco packs that glide open when touched and different-sized cigarettes – would continue to persuade consumers to pay more for the same brand.“Our focus on innovation is about brand differentiation and giving consumers a reason to smoke our product at a particular price point rather than someone else’s,” she said.Plain packaging, in which both packs and cigarettes are standardised, could check that strategy.Martin Deboo, an Investec analyst, summed up industry sentiment last week when he said plain packaging would not be allowed to pass quietly. “We expect a bare-knuckle fight from the industry,” he said.
146;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-05-01T17:55:53Z;Imperial Tobacco revenues defy austerity;;Regular increases in the price of cigarettes have driven up first-half revenues at Imperial Tobacco, despite “double dip” recessions in the UK and Spain dragging down volumes.The maker of the Davidoff, West and Gauloises brands, which is battling higher taxes and new anti-smoking regulations such as Australia’s plain packaging laws, reported a 2 per cent increase in interim revenues to £13.9bn in the six months to March 31.The rise came in spite of consumers in recession-hit economies cutting back on their habit, pushing down volumes of cigarettes and loose-cut tobacco – together known as “stick equivalents” – 4.1 per cent to 159.1bn in the six-month period.Jonathan Fell, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said innovations such as cigarette packets which slide open, were persuading consumers to pay a little more to smoke.“There has been a noticeable step up in innovation to persuade consumers to spend a few pennies more – it’s part of a strategy to stop them trading down to cheaper brands,” he said. “I also expect we will see cigarette volume increases in emerging markets in the second half.”The results are an improvement on Imperial’s first quarter, when cigarette volumes dropped 7 per cent and net tobacco revenue slipped 1 per cent.Bristol-based Imperial has focused on innovation and brand building – such as altering pack sizes and the look of cigarettes – to lessen the hit of higher prices on cash-strapped consumers.“We are still tobacco and are defensive, so even though you see a bit of market softness, compared with other consumer goods industries this is still an environment where we can do well,” said Alison Cooper, Imperial’s chief executive.Imperial, which this year has been the subject of takeover speculation, said volumes of its luxury Cuban cigars rose 3 per cent – driven by growth in Asia – compared with the first half of 2011, while sales of smokeless variants of tobacco such as snus rose 74 per cent.The company said Spain – its biggest market by revenue after Germany and the UK – was improving following last year’s profit warning prompted by a price war with rivals British American Tobacco and Philip Morris.Mrs Cooper said she expected the decline in volumes in Spain, which is back in recession, would slow from double to single-digits this year.Pre-tax profits increased from £943m to £1.1bn while diluted earnings per share fell from 91p to 82.3p due to higher taxation.An interim dividend of 31.7p was proposed, up 13 per cent from last time.Imperial Tobacco shares rose by 3.7 per cent to £25.56.
147;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-04-27T01:40:14Z;US hires top lawyer to lead Google case;Case history includes McVeigh, Pfizer and Philip Morris;The US has turned up the heat in its long-simmering antitrust investigation of Google, bringing in a prominent litigator to lead its case.The Federal Trade Commission’s hiring of an outside lawyer with a record in high-profile criminal and civil cases is a rare tactic for the agency and suggests that it is gearing up to sue the search group, according to legal experts.Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the FTC, said on Thursday that Beth Wilkinson, a partner in the litigation department of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New York, had been appointed to take charge of the agency’s Google investigation.A former general counsel at mortgage group Fannie Mae, Ms Wilkinson’s cases working for the government and in private practice have included presenting the closing argument that secured the death penalty for Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma bomber, and leading the defence in prominent product liability and class action cases for Pfizer and Philip Morris.The hiring of a special counsel indicates that Mr Leibowitz believes his investigation has turned up strong evidence against Google, said Samuel Miller, who took on a similar role as special counsel during the Department of Justice’s first investigation of Microsoft in 1994.The FTC “would not have made this public unless it had a strong case and was prepared to take it to court”, he said.Google refused to comment.The US agency began its investigation early last year, echoing a separate review under way in Brussels, and has not shown its hand publicly before. Bringing in a special counsel suggested that the FTC could be ready to take action within months, according to antitrust lawyers.Google faced a similar threat three years ago from the DoJ, which brought in a litigator to look into its proposed search partnership with Yahoo, and dropped its plans when a lawsuit was close to being filed two months later.“It’s probably more than a negotiating stance – it’s a big step to take,” Mark Patterson, a professor at Fordham Law School, said of Ms Wilkinson’s hiring.Legal experts have warned that bringing a successful complaint against Google could prove difficult under US law unless the government can turn up clear evidence that the search company deliberately set out to harm competitors.Complaints to the government have centred on damage other companies say they have suffered by being relegated in Google’s search rankings and by the preferential treatment Google has given in its search results to its in-house services in areas such as maps and comparison shopping.Both Argentina’s Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia and the Korea Fair Trade Commission in South Korea have also opened investigations into certain business practices, according to a company filing this week.Ms Wilkinson’s record as a white-collar criminal lawyer and expert in internal corporate investigations would make her well-suited to investigating Google’s actions, said Mr Patterson.
148;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-04-26T11:42:19Z;JT rebuffs calls for dividend increase;;Japan Tobacco rebuffed calls by activist investor The Children’s Investment Fund, for increased dividends and share buybacks, saying the proposals were “short-term focused” and warning that they would lead to a loss of competitiveness.JT, which is under pressure from TCI to nearly triple its dividend, buy back shares and cancel all treasury shares, rejected all recommendations the UK-based fund submitted as agenda items to be put to shareholders at the general meeting in June.TCI is calling on JT to raise its dividend to Y20,000 from Y6,800 last year, to bring its dividend payout ratio closer to those of its international peers.The UK fund points out that JT’s average payout ratio of 25 per cent of earnings compares unfavourably with British American Tobacco’s average payout ratio of 70 per cent and that of Philip Morris, at 120 per cent.TCI is also pushing JT to buy back Y800bn of its own shares and improve shareholder returns.The fund has written to the Japanese government, which plans to sell down its 50 per cent stake in JT, urging it to vote in favour of its recommendations.However, president, Hiroshi Kimura, said: “Their view is too short term.”Mr Kimura, who is to become chairman after the AGM, added that JT would not put the interests of shareholders above those of its other stakeholders.He said both RJR International and Gallaher, which were acquired by JT, became acquisition targets because they had to use their cash flow to pay off debts or to satisfy shareholders rather then invest in the business.“What they had in common was that business investment became secondary [to shareholder interests] which meant that their business was damaged and their products deteriorated,” Mr Kimura said.“I would like to keep these lessons in my heart,” he said.JT is setting aside Y250bn to buy back some of the shares that the government is planning to sell and is increasing its dividend to Y10,000.This is substantially below the Y800bn of share buybacks and the Y20,000 dividend that TCI is asking for.Nevertheless, the total of JT’s dividend payment of Y120bn and the Y250bn of potential share buybacks equals its forecast free cash flow of Y370bn.“We find it very interesting that JT appears ready to return 100 per cent of its free cash flow to shareholders this year,” said Toby Williams, analyst at Macquarie in Tokyo.The move comes as the tobacco group reported a 32 per cent rise in net profits to Y320.9bn on a 1.2 per cent drop in revenues to Y2,033.8bn under International Financial Reporting Standards.

Also in the energy sector, GDF Suez offered a hefty £6.5bn to buy out minority shareholders in International Power and Canada’s Couche-Tard paid a high $2.8bn price for Statoil Fuel & Retail. Meanwhile the world’s biggest maker of wind turbines, Vestas, hoped that a rumoured takeover would save it from recent travails.Elsewhere it was about supermarket shelves and the products on them. The world’s third biggest grocer, Tesco, is planning to overhaul its faded UK operations, but there is little evidence that things are moving quickly. Tesco’s suppliers fared better: the beautifully run Coca-Cola’s shares are near a 14-year high, French food group Danone is moving in the right direction and cigarette maker Philip Morris is in rude health (even if its customers may not be). In the pills and potions aisle, US developer of antibody drugs Human Genome Sciences rebuffed GlaxoSmithKline’s $2.6bn offer while Abbott Lab’s investors appear apathetic about its impending split into two companies. But there may soon be no Nokia phones to sell if chief executive Stephen Elop does not solve the company’s multiple difficulties.In banking, the wealth management divisions of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley performed well while Goldman Sachs finds its share price back at the same level as at the end of 2005. In Europe, ING has a queue of suitors for its Asian insurance business while the UK’s Lloyds Banking Group has been left with only one credible buyer for its branches. In China, the country’s second biggest broker, Haitong, is the first of the big casualties of last year’s market turmoil to have another go at listing as it priced its Hong Kong shares. Whatever else they were doing, financial institutions were surely advising their clients to steer clear of Argentina for awhile.John Casey, Lex Publisher
150;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-04-06T21:17:42Z;Big Tobacco campaigns on freedom;;The footage resembles a music video for an anarchist punk-rock band. Policemen, warning signs, CCTV cameras and spiked fences appear in a rapid sequence of black and white shots. A thrashing guitar soundtrack begins – cue the message: “Welcome to Nanny Town”.In fact, the YouTube video is the latest tool in the armoury of the tobacco industry, which is facing an onslaught of curbs in the UK including Friday’s introduction of a ban on tobacco displays in large shops.Andrew Lansley, the health secretary, said the measure was introduced so that people “literally no longer see smoking as a normal part of life”. Before the government’s next consultation into plain packaging, in which cigarettes are sold in identical drab packaging without logos, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are helping to fund an unconventional libertarian campaign.“There is a feeling among the general public that the theft of trademarks is a step too far in terms of tobacco regulation,” said Michael Prideaux, BAT’s communications director. “Who will be next? I think the libertarian argument resonates among people who wouldn’t normally take notice of what the tobacco industry say.”Where past anti-regulation efforts focused on the detrimental effects to businesses, such as corner shops, tobacco companies and their supporters are now targeting the broader theme of personal freedom to stave off the world’s toughest anti-tobacco laws.“Plain packaging is the persecution of minority lifestyle choice,” said Simon Clark, director of the Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco, or Forest, which will receive £330,000 in corporate tobacco funding for 2012 and is spearheading a campaign called Hands Off Our Packs (Hoops). “It feels as if we are part of a growing libertarian movement – this is something quite new and, from our point of view, very encouraging.”So far Australia is the only country to pass plain packaging laws, which are due to be implemented in December. The world’s four biggest tobacco companies outside China – Philip Morris, BAT, Imperial and JTI – have launched lawsuits against the Australian government, accusing it of confiscating their brands. Earlier this month they were joined by Ukraine who accused Australia at the World Trade Organisation of violating international law regarding intellectual property.In the UK, the Hoops campaign has enlisted the support of prominent think-tanks.“There are a chorus of voices [saying] that government intervention is going too far and tobacco, the most regulated consumer product, is at the coal face,” said Mark Littlewood, director of the centre-right Institute of Economic Affairs. “Plain packaging is the start of a slippery slope to the government becoming ‘big mother’ to every adult.”In February the free-market Adam Smith Institute, which received about £9,000 in funding from tobacco companies last year, published a report on plain packaging in which it criticised “anti-smoking extremism and the risks of hyper-regulation”.The message is supported by libertarian groups such as Freedom Association, Progressive Vision and Liberal Vision, the Liberal Democrat blog, none of which receive tobacco funding.Nonetheless, the campaign has drawn a sharp response from tobacco control groups. According to Action on Smoking and Health, the tobacco industry is “increasingly resorting to the use of front groups and third party advocates” to influence policy outcomes.“I think they’re trying to enlist supporters to lobby government,” said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash. “Because they can’t get through the door to Number 10 they’re trying to persuade others to do so for them.”Tobacco supporters point out that some of the pro-packaging groups receive government money. Ash received a £150,000 grant last year from the Department of Health although Ash said this was not to lobby for tobacco control. Regional organisations who support plain packaging such as Smokefree Southwest, Fresh North East and Tobacco Free Futures receive funding from local NHS bodies.Meanwhile the libertarians hope to expand their nanny state argument beyond smokers to alcohol and fatty foods. Their message? Come for smokers, and booze and burgers are next.“Part of our campaign is to emphasise that this debate goes far beyond tobacco,” said Mr Clark. “In our view it’s only a matter of time before alcohol and fast-food are targeted in exactly the same way.”
151;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-02-14T18:06:51Z;Big Tobacco prepares for packaging switch;;Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, at less than one in five people, but it will still be the key battleground for the tobacco industry in 2012.From the start of December, under the world’s toughest antismoking laws, tobacco companies will have to sell their products in identical drab packaging, without logos but featuring graphic images of smoking-related diseases. Brand names can still appear but in a standard font on the front of every packet.Big Tobacco has launched an aggressive fight back against the plain packaging law. The curbs on Australia’s $9.5bn-a-year smoking market do not pose much of a threat to profits. But the bigger worry is that, just as the ban on smoking in public places spread from California across the world, Australia’s move could spread to the $161bn cigarette market in the European Union and beyond.Some analysts even raise the possibility that emerging markets could implement similar laws, giving Big Tobacco even more of a problem.“Obviously there’s a possibility other countries will follow,” said Michael Prideaux, director of corporate affairs at British American Tobacco (BAT), who described the move to plain packaging as part of “the de-normalisation of tobacco”.A person familiar with internal discussions at Philip Morris International (PMI), the world’s second biggest publicly listed cigarette company by sales, said: “This is the alpha and the omega as far as tobacco companies are concerned.”The European Union is considering introducing plain packaging as part of proposed revisions to tobacco regulation expected later this year. In the UK, the Department of Health is due to publish the results of its consultation on plain packaging in the spring.Battle lines are already being drawn. In the UK Imperial Tobacco, BAT and Japan Tobacco (JTI) have helped form a libertarian-style campaign group called “Hands Off Our Packs”. It urges supporters to say no to “more Nanny State diktats”.“Our fundamental argument is that people are informed and should be allowed to make an adult choice,” said Paul Williams, head of corporate affairs at JTI. “The ban could make its way to alcohol and obesity.”JTI, PMI and the Australian arms of BAT and Imperial all launched legal challenges within days of the Australian law being passed last November by the federal parliament in Canberra.They argue the plain packaging law breaches the Australian constitution, will cost taxpayers billions in lost excise duty, and will be a boon for cigarette smugglers. They say there is no evidence it will lower smoking rates. Australia’s high court is expected to hear the cases in April.But privately all the tobacco companies are preparing for life after plain packaging. In particular, they are considering how to market different cigarette brands which look alike.“Word-of-mouth will become more important,” said Mr Prideaux. “We will have to differentiate on products differently [than in the past] …probably more on taste, to give consumers something they want to talk about.”There is growing concern among Big Tobacco that price wars could follow.“Without brands how do you charge a premium?” said Peter Nixon, vice-president of communications at PMI. “We assume brand choice going forwards will be about price …we will see prices going down so we are likely to see revenues going down.”Last year, PMI published an internal study, seen by the FT, in which it projected the average price of cigarettes falling by up to 19 per cent if plain packaging was implemented as companies compete on price.The cost would be heaviest in emerging markets, where companies are trying to persuade new middle class consumers to trade-up to premium brands.Jonathan Fell, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said that while he was not worried about a reduction in short-term smoking rates, the ability of tobacco companies to achieve premium prices would be questioned.“It’s clearly something investors will be concerned with if it’s implemented,” he said. “I don’t think there’s massive amount of difference in developed and developing economies in terms of regulation. As countries like Brazil and South Africa have done in the past, they would normally be pretty quick to catch on and implement what others have done.”Publicly, the companies are confident of winning their court cases in Australia. If the courts force the government to back down, they hope it would set an example to other governments considering plain packaging laws.Alex Parsons, director of corporate communications at Imperial, said he does not believe there will be an immediate “domino effect”.“I think others will wait and see how it plays out in Australia,” he said.
152;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Plain cigarette packaging labelled unlawful;;Big tobacco companies are claiming Australia’s plain packaging law breaches the nation’s constitution because the government is effectively acquiring brands and intellectual property without compensation by suppressing branding.Philip Morris International is also challenging the law under the 1993 Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) between Australia and Hong Kong that relates to investment promotion and protection.But Australia’s Labor government is in no mood to back down. Attorney-General Nicola Roxon has accused Philip Morris of using legal tricks to try and derail the law. The former health minister alleges the company deliberately transferred ownership of its Australian business from a Swiss parent company to Hong Kong so it could launch proceedings under the Australia/Hong Kong BIT.Philip Morris says there was a legitimate business purpose for the transfer and that the deal was approved by the Australian government and the Federal Investment Review Board.Ms Roxon has also accused British American Tobacco (BAT) of using iconic Australian images to promote cigarettes in Europe – a kangaroo appears on packs of Winfield in France – and threatened to spearhead legal action against the industry. The government claims 15,000 Australians die each year from tobacco-related diseases.Professor Gillian Triggs, from the University of Sydney, says big tobacco may find it difficult to prove the plain packaging law breaches the constitution.“The question is whether the Australian government is acquiring intellectual property or destroying it,” says Prof Triggs. “And there’s a strong argument that it’s not an acquisition.”However, a challenge from BAT, to be conducted under the arbitration rules of the UN Commission on International Trade Law, has a greater chance of success, she said.“At the international level, the argument will be whether a government can adopt a policy that is not demonstrably based on scientific fact. There does not appear to be any scientific evidence that plain packaging has a demonstrable positive effect on public health.”
153;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-02-12T19:55:11Z;Activism benefits Japan Tobacco investors;;Shareholder activism is widely frowned upon in Japan but the Japanese public is nevertheless set to reap the benefits of a surge in shares of Japan Tobacco, following calls by one of its large investors to improve stakeholder returns.JT’s stock has risen 32 per cent since June last year, when The Children’s Investment Fund, the UK-based activist fund that has a stake of about 1.4 per cent, went public with calls for the company to raise its dividend and buy back shares.The Japanese government, which owns just more than 50 per cent of JT’s shares, has seen its stake, worth Y2.05tn ($26bn) at Friday’s close, rise by more than $6bn since TCI began its campaign. During that same period the Nikkei average has fallen by 5 per cent.TCI, which gained notoriety in Japan after an unsuccessful bid in 2006 to influence the management of J-Power, the utility, embarked on an unusually public activist campaign last summer when it wrote to Japan’s finance minister, pointing out that the government could boost the value of its stake if JT were to raise its dividend pay-out or buy back stock.JT has, on average, returned 25 per cent of its earnings to shareholders in dividends and share buy-backs in the past three years, compared with 70 per cent for British American Tobacco and 120 per cent for Philip Morris, TCI wrote at the time.The UK fund also encouraged Tokyo to reduce its stake in the company – a move that would lessen political influence over management and which JT and other investors have also called for in the past.The Japanese government has subsequently decided to sell its stake in JT to raise funds to pay for the reconstruction of parts of north-eastern Japan devastated by the earthquake and tsunami in March last year.As the first step in a process expected to take several years, the government proposes raising about Y500bn through a sale of JT shares.JT, meanwhile, last week said that it would increase its dividend for the year ending March 2012, from Y8,000 to Y9,000. But it denied that the decision was influenced by TCI and said it had a long-term plan to raise its pay-out ratio.It has also said it would consider buying back some of the shares that the government sells.
154;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Imperial’s Spanish losses continues;;A combination of anti-smoking regulation, higher taxes and a price war precipitated a double-digit fall in cigarette volumes in the key Spanish market during the first quarter for Imperial Tobacco.The FTSE 100 company, which owns Davidoff and Gauloises brands, declined to specify the extent of the fall for the three months to 31 December but said it expected the rate of decline to slow during the remainder of the year.It caps a miserable year for Imperial in Spain, its biggest single market by revenue after Germany and the UK, coming in the wake of a profit warning last June due to a price war with rivals BAT and Philip Morris.In November Imperial reported its full year operating profit in Spain had fallen by more than a quarter to £200m.Jonathan Fell at Deutsche Bank said he expected the losses to moderate.“The extent of the volume loss in Spain is very unusual in the context of developed cigarette markets – but it’s the result of higher taxes, more regulation and worse economic circumstances…the economic situation might not improve rapidly but the impact of other factors should reduce so we shouldn’t be seeing the market decline at a double-digit rate this year.”The tough market in Spain, as well as trade sanctions in Syria and price increases in the US, saw Imperial’s overall cigarette volumes drop 7 per cent contributing to a 1 per cent decline in net tobacco revenue. However, cigar chompers in Russia and China boosted Imperial’s luxury cigar volumes in emerging markets by 14 per cent.Alison Cooper, Imperial’s chief executive, said the company was focusing on its four strategic brands - Davidoff, Gauloises, West and JPS - in Asia-Pacific, Africa and the Middle East.“Combined stick equivalent volumes of our key strategic brands were up 3 per cent and net revenues up 10 per cent with our focus on driving growth in these brands in emerging markets and fine cut tobacco in the EU,” she said.Shares in Imperial Tobacco closed up 1.45 per cent at £23.03.FT COMMENTThe received wisdom that tobacco stocks like Imperial provide a haven during times of economic uncertainty has been shaken by the company’s pain in Spain. Imperial shares, after a 27 per cent price increase during 2011 boosted by a £320m buy-back, have declined by 5 per cent since the beginning of the year. While volatile Spanish consumption should smooth out, stronger pricing has led to what the company said is an “underlying” increase in net revenue of 3 per cent. That’s bolstered by a strategy of persuading smokers in emerging markets to trade up to Imperial’s premium brands. Priced at 11 times 2012 earnings Imperial shares are cheap compared with its peers such as BAT on over 15 times. If the company’s Iberian troubles moderate that could be good value.
155;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2012-01-22T18:47:34Z;Verizon and AT&T: it’s not just the yields;Two big high-yielding US telecoms groups may hold risks after good dividend run;The past year has been good for big companies that pay big dividends. There are 27 US companies with enterprise values greater than $40bn paying dividends over 3 per cent, according to Capital IQ. Over the past 12 months these have returned 16 per cent to shareholders, on average, compared with the S&P 500’s 5 per cent. Stocks as diverse as Philip Morris, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Duke Energy, Intel and Chevron have all delivered great performances.After such a good run, however, the big-cap yield trade may be concealing risks. Consider two examples: Verizon and AT&T, the big, high-yielding US telecoms groups. They have followed the larger trend, returning 19 and 14 per cent, respectively, for investors over the last year.The biggest flag would be if these two companies’ free cash flows did not comfortably cover their payouts. On first blush, they appear to do just this. In recent years, AT&T’s dividend has absorbed about two thirds of free cash flow. At Verizon, only about a third of reported free cash flow has gone in dividends historically, but there is a catch: Verizon owns only 55 per cent of its wireless business (Vodafone owns the rest) which account for most of the cash. Bernstein Research estimates that once the minority stake is backed out, Verizon’s free cash flow only just covered its dividend payments in 2011 (though the cash flow picture will improve in 2012).That leaves little room for error at Verizon (which reports on Tuesday). And there is reason to wonder if dividend growth may be limited at both companies, because revenue growth is threatened. Wireless data growth has accounted for essentially all the sales growth in recent years, and it is now decelerating. The failure of the T-Mobile/AT&T merger could keep price competition humming, too. Investors must keep industry fundamentals, not just yields, in mind.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
156;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-12-30T13:45:26Z;Price and tax drive illicit tobacco trade;;The working-class Harehills neighbourhood in Leeds is an unlikely crossroads for global criminality – a jumble of down-market stores, pungent take-aways and immigrant-owned mini-marts featuring adverts in Arabic and Polish. But behind a false wall in one local shop, past the halal meat counter, lies a stash of some 10,000 untaxed cigarettes from eastern Europe – a modest slice of the illicit tobacco market flourishing throughout Britain and the EU.“I’d guess that over half the cigarettes smoked in Harehills are illegal,” said an officer from HM Revenue & Customs, which recently conducted several raids in the area. “Sometimes, after a bust, all we have to do is drive round the block, come back and they’ve already re-supplied.”One shop owner, a stout man in his thirties with gelled, jet-black hair, is part of the local tobacco underworld. Originally from northern Iraq, he is on first-name terms with some of the officers from HMRC’s local Inland Enforcement team. During the past year his modest convenience store has been targeted many times.“Here the duty is so much – if I buy British Marlboros I may sell five or 10 packets a day,” he said. “People here have no money, they’re not working, so we get Marlboro for £3 from Poland – it is not just here, it is the whole area.”The trade in illicit – untaxed – tobacco has recently become the fourth-largest global tobacco business by volume.“If taken in its entirety the illicit trade is only behind BAT, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco worldwide,” said Michael Prideaux, director of corporate affairs at British American Tobacco. “It represents anything between 6-12 per cent of global volume, so between 330bn-660bn cigarettes a year.”Although tobacco companies do not disclose how much they lose from the illicit trade, Philip Morris International, the world’s largest tobacco company by sales, said it is “significant”.“Illegal tobacco broadly is now a large portion of the global market,” said Peter Nixon, vice-president of communications at PMI. “Our price structure varies country by country based on local tax levels, so the losses to us are a significant concern.”A combination of government duty increases and economic depression is set to make the problem worse, according to the industry, depriving companies and national exchequers of billions of dollars in revenue.“The drivers are price and taxes. Before the 1990s you didn’t see that much globally, but since then we’ve seen tobacco taxes around the world go up so there’s more incentive for smugglers,” said Mr Nixon.The EU, with its porous borders and large, varied markets, has seen some of the steepest growth in illicit trade. In 2010, according to PMI, one in 10 European cigarettes smoked – 64.2bn – were either untaxed or made of counterfeit tobacco, a rise of nearly 2 per cent, or 8bn illicit cigarettes, since 2006.While the UK average for consumption of illicit cigarettes is about 10 per cent of the total, in London it has risen to one in five and in cities such as Nottingham and Ipswich one in three. As for roll-up cigarettes, PMI estimates that half of all loose tobacco in the UK is illicit.Part of the problem is stigma, or the lack of it. The steady increase in the cost of smoking has seen young professionals increasingly buying under the counter.“If you look at price differentials between Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, which have packs in some cases below one euro, and then the UK where a pack of Dunhill or Kent is around £8, the profits that can be made are just so vast,” said Pat Heneghan, BAT’s global head of anti-illicit trade. “Given the differentials of tax and price [the problem] will get worse before it gets better.”Back in Harehills, the HMRC squad found some 24,000 illicit cigarettes during a day’s work, equating to a tax loss of more than £9,000. It is a fraction of the estimated £2bn lost every year to tobacco smuggling, according to the government.The convenience store owner, however, appears undeterred. Planning his next trip to Poland, he said he is selling the van he previously used: “I want a truck.”
157;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-11-21T10:33:22Z;Australia stubs out tobacco packaging;;Big tobacco companies have started the legal fightback against a new law in Australia requiring cigarettes be sold in plain, unbranded packages – the world’s first of its kind.Philip Morris, the world’s largest cigarette maker by sales, issued a legal challenge to the new law shortly after the Australian parliament approved it Monday, fearing it could set a precedent for other countries to take similar action in a bid to reduce smoking.The company, which has just under 40 per cent of Australia’s tobacco market, is seeking the suspension of the law and compensation for damages, which it says could amount to “billions of dollars”.Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, which is also planning a legal challenge to the bill, argue that the law unconstitutionally limits their ability to use their intellectual property without compensation.Australia, the first country to require plain packaging, will be an important test case for other nations, including the UK, that are considering similar restrictions.“Plain packaging means that the glamour is gone from smoking,” Australia’s health minister, Nicola Roxon, said.Some countries, including many from Latin America, have criticised the plain packaging law for its impact on small tobacco producers and raised the issue in meetings of the World Trade Organisation. Tobacco companies argue plain packaging will make it easier for counterfeiters to fake their products.The law is expected to be formally approved by the country’s governor-general in the next fortnight, after which it will take formal force, although the actual new packaging will not be used until December 2012. BAT, Australia’s market leader with a 46 per cent share, said it will officially file its separate legal action with the Australian High Court after the law receives the governor-general’s royal approval.Philip Morris says the plain packaging legislation violates both Australian law and the bilateral investment treaty between Australia and Hong Kong where the company’s Asian operations are based.A Philip Morris spokeswoman said in a statement: “The government has passed this legislation despite being unable to demonstrate that it will be effective at reducing smoking and has ignored the widespread concerns raised in Australia and internationally regarding the serious legal issues associated with plain packaging.”Arbitration between multinational companies and countries in Asia remains rare, said lawyers in the field, and the resolution in Philip Morris’s case could set precedent for future cases by companies considering using arbitration in challenging a state decision or new law.Robert Pé, a lawyer with Orrick who specialises in dispute resolution in Asia, said: “If Australia were eventually to lose this arbitration [case] that might dissuade governments of other countries from adopting such radical legislation as Australia has adopted.”
158;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-11-18T00:31:06Z;Legg’s Miller says ‘success equals survival’;Value Trust manager claims longevity as he steps down;After almost 30 years running what became the flagship mutual fund for Legg Mason, Bill Miller could at the very least claim longevity as he discussed his retirement on Thursday.“This is a brutal business, success equals survival. If you have survived, you will have succeeded,” he said, recalling advice from an older colleague as he began a career as an investor three decades ago.The former military intelligence officer, who started a doctorate in philosophy before being drawn to finance, has also received many other plaudits.In 1999, he was voted fund manager of the decade by analysts at research group Morningstar, a remarkable achievement for a value investor when markets were dominated by the search for the next fast-growing dotcom.Yet the last five years have been harsh, bringing an abrupt end to a 15-year run during which Mr Miller’s Legg Mason Value Trust consistently beat the S&P 500. Since 2006, the fund has placed dead last out of the more than 800 funds in its category, according to Lipper, a research group.So in April next year he will hand the torch to his co-manager, Sam Peters. “We’re having the second period of underperformance in 30 years. The last was back in the late 1980s when I took over from my partner, and now it’s a good time for Sam and his team,” says the 61-year-old Mr Miller.Much of the poor performance, however, Mr Miller puts down to fundamental changes in the structure of the market since 2005. “The huge rise of exchange-traded funds, which allowed people to buy baskets of things which caused correlations to rise, and of course the rise in algorithmic trading.”The rising tendency of stocks to move in concert with each other since 2005 has made life very difficult for all active managers, particularly as markets become driven by fears for the success or failure of government policy. “Most of the people who invest in the same way we do are having poor results as well,” he said.Meanwhile, investors do not tolerate losses. From $21.5bn of assets in 2007, the fund now manages less than $3bn. “It’s very clear that clients and the general public and pension plans and whoever are much more short term than they used to be,” he said.Still, Mr Miller, who will continue to manage a smaller fund for Legg Mason, remains upbeat for US equity markets and his value investing approach.“That strategy has to work at some point again because the math is the math and companies can’t trade at huge discounts to what they’re worth for a long time. But it can go on for longer than is comfortable,” he said“The markets have largely discounted almost all of the European Union’s problems,” he added, arguing that while Europe faces recession, the US economy is accelerating.“There is no dearth of cheap stocks,” he said pointing out that “you can buy Pepsi at the same price it was in 2005.”“If Europe completely blows up, and there is monetary chaos until local currencies can be re-established, well how bad is that for Pepsi?” said Mr Miller.“I’m sure the stock will go down, but fundamentally Pepsi’s business is not going to change that much. Philip Morris International’s business? People are still going to smoke cigarettes.”
159;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-11-08T23:43:42Z;US corporate bond issuance rebounds from lows;;Companies have sold nearly $28bn of bonds in the US in the past two days, marking the best start to a week this year.Monday was the busiest day of the year with $20.3bn in new issuance in the US, including both investment grade and junk bonds, according to Dealogic, a data tracker. On Tuesday, Philip Morris, Halliburton and Hershey, the candy maker, were among the companies that sold debt.US corporate and junk bond markets have rebounded from their lows hit in early October when fears about Europe’s festering debt crisis peaked, lowering borrowing costs.“If you assume the market could turn ‘risk-off’ quickly and people view a window, it is better to use it now,” said Matt Toms, head of US public fixed income for ING Investment Management.Following Groupon’s initial public offering, US equity capital markets have begun to open up after being nearly shut from August to October. Ten companies are pitching IPOs to investors. If all 10 deals price as expected next week, it would be the busiest week for offerings since 2007, according to Ipreo, a capital markets data and advisory group.The surge in US debt issuance this week came in spite of lingering uncertainty about the problems in the eurozone, particularly about the fate of Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s prime minister who said on Tuesday that he planned to resign.“Investors have had to learn how to play in a more volatile market,” said Bryan Jennings, co-head of fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Stanley.In recent months, volatility throughout the financial markets had kept many corporate issuers on the sidelines. This has been compounded by so-called blackout periods around the latest earnings season when companies cannot sell debt, resulting in a significant backlog of bond deals as Thanksgiving and the end of the year approaches.Issuers are also eager to sell their deals ahead of the November 23 deadline for the so-called “super-committee” of US lawmakers to present a plan to save at least $1,200bn for the US government over 10 years, bankers said. If lawmakers fail to agree on a plan, it could again increase volatility in US markets, making it more difficult or expensive to sell bonds.High-grade investors said they had large cash balances in recent months as issuance dried up and buying bonds in the secondary markets proved difficult as liquidity levels have fallen. US funds that buy junk bonds have had three weeks of net inflows of more than $1bn, including a record net inflow of more than $4bn in week ended October 26, according to Lipper, the fund tracker.
160;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-10-26T22:25:08Z;BAT points to rising illicit sales;;The illicit cigarette trade has become the tobacco industry’s fourth-biggest business by volume worldwide according to British American Tobacco, as government tax increases push hard-up smokers towards the black market.“The illicit trade, taken as a whole, is number four [worldwide] by volume behind BAT, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco,” said Michael Prideaux, BAT’s director of corporate affairs. “[It represents] anything between 6-12 per cent of global volume, so between 330-660bn cigarettes a year.”In a trading statement, the owner of the Lucky Strike and Dunhill brands warned the expansion of illicit trade remained a threat to legal trade “driven by shock excise increases and pressure on consumers’ disposable income”.Despite a fragile spending environment BAT revealed 7 per cent revenue growth in the nine months to 30 September compared with the same period last year, buoyed by an increase in prices and a focus on smokers in emerging markets.Nicandro Durante, BAT’s chief executive, said the results showed the company is “on track for another year of good earnings growth.” The company cited good performances by BAT’s four so-called ‘global brands’ – Kent, Dunhill, Pall Mall and Lucky Strike – particularly in emerging markets such as Russia, Pakistan and Romania. Mr Prideaux said the company also benefited from solid growth in Japan, Australia, France and Germany.Overall volumes declined 0.4 per cent this year, although this narrowed from a 1.8 per cent decline in the first quarter.Robbie Aitken, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, said the results showed the company was on a positive trend. “We’re seeing an improving trend in terms of price mix and volumes,” he said. “The volume declines look to be moderating and I think the consumers have proved they can soak up the price increases.” In May BAT pushed further into emerging markets by acquiring Columbia’s second largest cigarette company, the privately owned Protabaco, for $452m.The company, which has an undrawn credit facility of £2bn ($3.2bn), said it spent £622m buying back 23m shares, or about 1.2 per cent of the existing share capital, so far this year.BAT shares rose 43.5p, or 2 per cent, to £28.96.● FT CommentThe latest quarterly salvo by BAT bolsters conventional wisdom about tobacco being a defensive stock during a recession: smokers don’t quit just because there’s a downturn. Moreover, the company’s impressive revenue growth shows higher prices and a focus on emerging markets can compensate for declining volumes. Such a strategy, coupled with its global footprint, means BAT is on track to meet analysts’ consensus of slightly more than £6bn in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation matching last years year-on-year earnings increase of nearly £600m. Investors have to pay for steady growth in uncertain times but, at 13.5 times 2012 earnings BAT’s shares look fully priced compared to smaller peer Imperial on 10.8 times.
161;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-10-20T17:34:13Z;Philip Morris fumes at ‘plain’ Australian plan;;Philip Morris International, the world’s largest cigarette maker by sales, hit out at the Australian government on Thursday for its plan to introduce plain, brandless, cigarette packaging, arguing that the move would undermine public health objectives and violate intellectual property protections.“The Australian government seems intent on ignoring these adverse consequences on introducing such a regulation,” Hermann Waldeme, chief financial officer of Philip Morris, said on a call with analysts. “We are therefore vigorously pursuing several legal avenues to challenge this unreasonable proposal and protect our valuable brands.”Last April, the Australian government proposed making all cigarette packets logo-free in a dull green colour displaying graphic images of smoking-related diseases. Brand names would be marked with a standard colour, size and font on the package.In June, Philip Morris threatened to sue the Australian government and on Thursday the company said it was “ramping up” its efforts to prepare for a legal battle if the proposal is passed.“Of course, we are in full swing to be ready for this situation,” Mr Waldeme said.Meanwhile, Mr Waldeme argued that there is no evidence that plain packaging would reduce cigarette consumption or youth smoking and said that, in fact, it would lower prices and increase illicit trade.Philip Morris also said it is bracing for an onslaught of new excise taxes, as governments facing budget crises look for more revenue. Mr Waldeme called such efforts “disruptive,” but said that most governments have realised that cigarette taxes have little impact on long-term revenues.In spite of the challenges facing the tobacco industry, Philip Morris reported robust third-quarter earnings. Net income rose 30.1 per cent to $2.46bn, or $1.35 a share, from a year ago as net revenues jumped 22.3 per cent year-on-year to $20.7bn.Cigarette shipment volumes were weak in Europe, declining by 3.5 per cent from a year ago. But this was offset by a 12.6 per cent increase in Asia, which Philip Morris calls its “growth engine”. The company, which is best known for its Marlboro brand, raised prices in Japan, Australia and Indonesia, but customers there proved willing absorb the increases.Bonnie Herzog, tobacco analyst at Wells Fargo, called the results “impressive” and said that Philip Morris was “firing on all cylinders”.Shares of Philip Morris closed 3.3 per cent higher at $68.19 on Thursday.
162;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-10-10T17:05:31Z;Global competition drives change;Emerging-market companies are altering the way business is done;Companies in the developed world are increasing their commitment to emerging markets at a faster rate than ever before.Faced with the prospect of stagnation (a combination of low growth and high inflation) – or worse – in the US, Europe and Japan, companies are plunging into the high-growth economies of Asia, eastern Europe, Latin America, and, increasingly, Africa.“Emerging markets have inflation issues, environmental questions and social problems, but overall they have better economic growth. In the developed markets you have slow growth and the risk of a new sovereign debt crisis,” says Alain Bokobza, a strategist at Société Générale, the French bank.In a study of European multinationals, Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, found that over the past two years, companies have diversified their exposure away from domestic markets more quickly than ever before. European companies now generate just 53 per cent of sales in developed Europe, while the share from emerging markets has leapt from 12 per cent in 1997 to 29 per cent.US companies are also following this trend, with a host of leading businesses increasing their sales to emerging markets to above 50 per cent, including Avon Products, the cosmetics company, (52 per cent), Tupperware Brands, the food container business, (58 per cent) and tobacco group Philip Morris (68 per cent).Admittedly, the average company is a long way behind these leaders in their exposure to emerging markets. HSBC, the banking group, estimates that British companies as a whole generate just 13 per cent of revenues from emerging markets. This figure is just 11 per cent and 7 per cent for Japanese and US companies respectively.But there is no doubting which way the winds of change are blowing in sectors open to international development – and international competition. Despite the economic challenges in their home markets, developed world multinationals cannot afford to focus only on their domestic rivals.This is also far from a one way street. Competitors from the emerging markets are breathing down the necks of established-market companies as never before. With the help of a recovery from the financial crisis that was much stronger than in the developed world, companies based in emerging markets are pushing into global markets at an unprecedented pace.Before the crisis, in 2007, there were 17 Chinese and Hong Kong companies on the FT 500 list of top groups by market capitalisation. By the middle of this year, there were 45, putting China/Hong Kong in second place behind the US.Emerging-market groups are becoming leaders in key industries. Two of the top five global wireless technology companies are from China – Huawei and ZTE. Mexico’s Cemex is the world’s largest building materials supplier, Brazilian-run Anheuser-Busch InBev is the biggest brewer, and three Indian groups – Wipro, Infosys and TCS – together are the top software exporters.So how is this global competition changing companies?First, businesses are having to respond faster than before. For example, a group with a Europe-wide pay freeze may have to be flexible enough to authorise salary increases to specialists and managers in developing countries, who are still able to jump ship for a better offer. Darryl Green, Asia president for Manpower Group, the recruitment agency, says: “Countries where people move easily – such as India – are seeing executive pay rising rapidly. The sight of [well-paid] expatriate foreign managers inspires local people to ask for more. Employers have to respond.”Second, chief executives are focusing on a broader range of challenges and opportunities than ever before. With emerging-market companies as well as established multinationals as rivals, there is no time to waste. A case in point today is Africa, where rapid growth in key countries, notably Nigeria, has persuaded many business people that the continent’s time may finally have arrived.Yum! Brands, the US group that owns Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC, is expanding its established KFC chain in South Africa and opening up in Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia, Ghana, Angola and Malawi.Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, recently created a new Africa division as part of its plan to increase emerging-market sales from 54 per cent last year to 70-75 per cent by 2020.Multinationals are also moving core decision-making units into emerging markets. Microsoft, the US software giant, has its biggest development centre outside the US in China. Cisco Systems, the US computer networking group, has what it calls a second headquarters, Cisco East, in Bangalore, India.With the internationalisation of operations comes the internationalisation of staff. For many groups this is now established practice. Even Japanese companies, famously conservative about promoting foreign staff, are changing. Manpower’s Mr Green says about half the new graduate recruits at big Japanese groups are not local, but mostly foreign graduates who have studied in the country and speak Japanese.And growing numbers of executives with emerging-market roots are making it into the boardroom. Swiss food group Nestlé recently appointed the Mandarin-speaking Wan Ling Martello, a US citizen of Chinese and Filipina origin, as its chief financial officer.The ultimate aim is to compete more effectively, especially in emerging markets, where the challenges are as great as the opportunities. Multinationals have learnt that price is not the only way of reaching emerging-markets customers. These buyers appreciate quality as much as rich-word clients, sometimes more so because a big purchase – such as a car – involves a much greater proportion of family income.By operating in the fast-growing emerging markets, companies are forced to innovate and develop products and processes which may not have existed before in the developed world. Coca-Cola, the US beverages group, launched a juice-based drink in China called Pulpy, which it is now rolling out around the world. General Electric, the US industrial group, pioneered low-cost medical monitors now in demand in developed countries.Emerging-markets innovation is not new. More than 20 years ago, Hindustan Lever, Unilever’s Indian affiliate, developed mini-sachets to sell soaps to poorer consumers. But what is new is the growing volume of such innovations. In outsourcing, Indian groups headed by TCS and Infosys have revolutionised information management by splitting work done by expensive on-site consultants from that carried out cheaply offshore.The rivalry between developed-world and emerging-market companies is not a wholly clean fight. Western groups complain of unfair competition, in the allocation of government contracts for example, of a lack of transparency and of intellectual property theft, notably in China.Emerging-market companies hit back with claims that developed-world markets are often protected by costly entry barriers, such as regulatory requirements. Nor is bribe-paying limited to the developing world.But these concerns have not slowed the fundamental processes of cooperation and competition between companies, which is likely to continue into the future.
163;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-09-13T17:15:12Z;Multinationals face dangers of growth gap;Faster rates in emerging economies create challenges, writes Stefan Wagstyl;"With Europe in the middle of a financial earthquake, there is nowhere to hide from the aftershocks.As Agustín Carstens, Mexico’s central bank governor, told the FT on Tuesday, “We have reached a point where this is very important for all the global economy …We can’t say any longer that emerging markets are decoupled …Even very strong emerging markets will suffer if Europe isn’t stabilised very soon.”This is fair enough. But emerging markets are entering the latest turmoil in the world economy from a better starting point. If, as expected, the International Monetary Fund cuts its predictions for the global economy next week it will be revising a 2011 figure of 2.2 per cent annual growth for the developed world and 6.6 per cent for emerging economies.This difference in growth rates is logical. Emerging markets are converging with the rich world, improving both incomes and productivity. In general, the faster this happens, the higher global incomes will be, benefiting the rich world (through bigger export markets) as well as the poor.The problems that the growth rate gap creates for policymakers, notably in managing the capital flows rushing from the developed to the developing world, are well publicised, not least by the IMF.But the gap also creates huge challenges for companies, both those based in the developed and the developing world. Whether it is GE or Huawei, they must operate in a multi-speed world.These challenges are particularly acute when parts of the globe are in trouble, as the eurozone now is. It is difficult for chief executives based in Milan, for example, to concentrate on the global picture when the streets are hit by rumours of local banks under stress.Hans-Paul Bürkner, chief executive of the Boston Consulting Group, the management consultancy, argues that this is a real challenge for European multinationals.“There’s a real danger that companies from the developed markets will be coping with low growth and will be content with low growth, whereas companies from the emerging markets will have very strong growth and very high ambitions. They talk in terms of 20, 30 or 40 per cent growth.”That means growth in fast-moving sectors, such as IT, rather than gross domestic product. But for most companies that is what matters. As Bürkner warns, the competition never seems to rest. “Today, Chinese companies with revenues of around $1bn say ‘perhaps we can reach $20bn or even $50bn’. Of course it’s an exaggeration – but you can’t deny that there’s real drive there.”Successful western and Japanese multinationals have responded to this challenge, with some deriving half their revenues and more from emerging markets. UK-based Standard Chartered Bank has 64 per cent of revenues from the developing world, for example; Philip Morris, the US tobacco group, is on 68 per cent.But there is a long tail. British companies as a whole generate just 13 per cent of revenues from emerging markets; for Japanese companies the figure is 11 per cent, and for American ones it is 7 per cent, according to HSBC.Emerging market companies also face hurdles as they take on their developed world rivals. They may be fuelled by high domestic growth, but they lack international experience. Mr Bürkner says: “You must get many things right – product development, marketing, distribution, and service may all be different from the home markets.”But emerging market groups have momentum. Before the global crisis, in 2007, there were 17 Chinese and Hong Kong companies in the FT 500 list of top groups by market capitalisation. In the mid-2011 list there were 45, putting China/Hong Kong in second place behind the US.Market capitalisation isn’t everything. But emerging market groups are becoming world leaders in key industries. For example, two of the top five global wireless technology makers are Chinese – Huawei and ZTE. Mexico’s Cemex is the world’s largest building materials supplier, Brazilian-run Anheuser-Busch InBev is the biggest brewer, and three Indian groups – Wipro, Infosys and TCS – are together the top software exporters.Competing with such rivals in good times is bad enough. Doing so in tough times is worse, as European companies may soon discover to their cost."
164;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-09-11T11:17:15Z;Switch from UK to emerging world pays off;A global focus has helped Baillie Gifford’s Global Income fund outperform;Emerging markets may appear volatile in the short term, but there is a strong underlying long-term growth trend, according to Dominic Neary, manager of the £18.8m ($30m) Baillie Gifford Global Income fund.The fund moved from a UK focus to a global one in March 2010 to enable greater diversification and to widen the opportunity set. Mr Neary says the fund’s overweight position in emerging markets makes it a little more volatile, but “reduces the likelihood of relative returns diverging as significantly from the benchmark”.High income stocks are generally less volatile than the overall market, while emerging market stocks are more volatile. One offsets the other, reducing the likelihood of an extreme performance divergence from the benchmark in either direction, he says.Mr Neary adds that investing in emerging markets has helped the fund to outperform both its benchmark and sector. In the 12 months to August 23, it has produced returns of 3.7 per cent, compared with the benchmark and sector’s losses of 0.72 and 0.94 per cent respectively.However, he says performance should be judged over a longer period. “You should measure performance over three to five years, particularly in a product like this, with a low beta, high income bias. You will therefore see significant periods of underperformance and outperformance as that bias is in and out of favour with the market,” he says.He attributes the outperformance to stock selection, as well as being overweight in emerging markets through 2010.Mr Neary is currently playing the growing consumption trend in Asia, through consumer stocks such as Philip Morris International – his top holding.The tobacco stock is one of Mr Neary’s favourites, as he believes the company has the strongest emerging markets exposure out of all of the tobacco companies.“Even though the number of smokers in western markets is falling, in emerging markets we expect it to increase, as a result of higher birthrates and market penetration,” he says.Sticking to the emerging markets, Mr Neary has recently added Brazilian utility company AES Tiete to the portfolio.The stock currently yields 10 per cent and offers a means of getting some exposure to economic growth in Brazil, he says.The stock also plays into a theme Mr Neary believes will produce outperformance over the long-term – electrical infrastructure. He points to underinvestment for the past 30 years in developed markets in the pylons and cables that transmit electricity, particularly in North America. So there is a desperate need for upgrading, while in emerging markets there is a need to build out.This is his rationale for holding General Cable, one of the world’s leading cable manufacturers, despite the fact it has no yield. “As the demand for infrastructure increases we expect revenues to grow,” he says.Despite its global focus, the fund still has a significant UK bias, with a quarter of the porfolio in UK stocks. Mr Neary says: “Global gives you diversification and greater opportunity. But the UK does have a strong dividend culture and an attractive yield on the market relative to others. However, our expectations have been reined back considerably, as austerity measures kick in.”Simona Stankovska is features writer at Investment Adviser, a Financial Times publication
165;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Tobacco industry’s smokescreen in packaging debate;Manufacturers are worried about the effect of Australian legislation on profits, says Kevin Brown;Tobacco manufacturers generally have a hard time trying to seize the moral high ground. But that is what is happening in Australia, where the Senate, the upper house of parliament, will decide in the next couple of weeks whether to approve the world’s toughest anti-smoking legislation.Under the Labor government’s proposals, all tobacco products would have to be sold in identical plain green packaging, without logos or design variations. Brand and product names would be in identical type, making it very hard to target specific market segments such as women or young adults.This draconian plan, already approved by parliament’s lower house, has triggered a furious assault from British American Tobacco, the market leader with 46 per cent of sales, and the smaller players Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco, which share most of the rest of the market. BAT says it will challenge the law immediately in Australia’s High Court if it passes in the upper house. This is a serious threat: only last week the court struck down a key plank of Australia’s foreign policy because it conflicted with elements of Australian and international law.Superficially, the fuss is surprising. From the perspective of the big international tobacco companies, Australia is a tiny market, its $7.9bn of sales accounting for just 1.8 per cent of the global total in 2010, according to a study by Deloitte published in February.But Big Tobacco has a broader view. Australia is not the only advanced economy thinking about plain packaging. Many have looked at it, and it is being actively considered in Canada, the UK and the European Union. Australian backing might give the idea fresh traction across the developed world.The legislation has substantial support. The plain packaging bill was supported unanimously in the lower house, though the conservative opposition unsuccessfully opposed a separate, but linked, trademark bill. An opinion poll for The Australian in August showed 48 per cent public support for plain packaging.Bowing to science, the tobacco companies no longer claim that their product is harmless. In evidence to a parliamentary inquiry in June, BAT Australia said there was “no question that smoking tobacco can cause serious and fatal disease”, adding that the only way to avoid the risks was not to smoke.Yet the industry is not bereft of arguments. One is that the government’s proposal is not based on evidence. It cannot be, since no other country has tried such an approach. But there is some evidence that graphic warnings on packs have had little or no impact on people’s propensity to smoke.A second is that the legislation is unnecessary. Australia has a range of measures limiting the marketing and sale of tobacco, and the incidence of smoking is already falling steadily. The government’s Institute of Health and Welfare reported in July that only 15.1 per cent of Australians over 14 smoked daily in 2010, down from 25 per cent in 1993.The tobacco lobby says this trend could reverse because prices will fall as the constraints on marketing make it hard to charge more for premium brands – one of the main drivers of profit.Customers may also be more attracted to illegal unbranded cigarettes. BAT also says the legislation would conflict with various bilateral trade agreements, Australian law on trademark ownership and World Trade Organisation rules.The most powerful argument, though, is that parliament is usurping the rights of adults to choose between competing legal products – deciding, in effect, that nanny knows best – while simultaneously breaching the tobacco companies’ constitutional rights by prohibiting the use of their intellectual property.These are not empty arguments. But they are not conclusive either. Restricting choice may be illiberal but parliament is entitled to prioritise public health. If the policy is not well-founded, or fails to achieve its objective, the voters have the remedy. None of the peripheral legal challenges to plain packaging is insoluble, though some might require further changes to the law if challenges are upheld.That leaves the constitutional issue, which is presented as a matter of principle but is really a matter of cost. Like most other advanced countries, Australia allows appropriation of property assets but requires “just terms”. That means there may have to be negotiations about compensation, which BAT suggests might be in the vicinity of A$3bn. But blocking the use of tobacco companies’ intellectual property is no different in principle from the acquisition of farming land for highways.From the point of view of their shareholders, the tobacco companies are right to fight. If the Australian proposals are implemented, similar laws will emerge elsewhere, with damaging effects on profits. But that is an argument located in the wallet, not on the moral high ground. It is not a reason for the Senate to vote No.Kevin Brown is the FT’s Asia Regional Correspondent

The ICB report is due on September 12.In response, UBS upgraded Barclays to “buy” with a 208p target price.Analyst John-Paul Crutchley told clients that, by 2015, Barclays would be able to have spun off its retail operations if required.“If full ringfencing is eventually introduced in the UK, the time that Barclays will likely to have before implementation would, we think, allow the group to effectively break itself up into its component businesses with lower exit costs,” he said.“Alternatively, if an outcome closer to the status quo is maintained, there is significant potential upside in the stock anyway.”Barclays closed 5.6 per cent higher at 180¼p. Hopes of longer implementation and more favourable liquidity standards also lifted Lloyds Banking Group, up 6.2 per cent to 35⅔p, and Royal Bank of Scotland, ahead by 8.2 per cent to 26¼p.US manufacturing and jobs data helped the wider market turn positive after a lower start with the FTSE 100 ending up 0.5 per cent, or 24.12 points, to 5,418.65.A 5.6 per cent advance since last Friday’s close put the index on track for its biggest weekly gain in more than a year.Hargreaves Lansdown bounced 17.7 per cent to 508½p after the broker delivered in-line annual results and said it saw no reason why a regulatory review would materially affect its revenue or profit.The stock dropped 25 per cent last month in response to proposals to prohibit payments from fund managers.Imperial Tobacco gained 2.3 per cent to £20.89 after Philip Morris International announced price rises in Spain. “If Imperial follows, it could boost operating profit by 3.5-4 per cent in a full year,” said Citigroup.Miners pared recent gains in tandem with metals prices after China said export orders had fallen for the first time in two years. Xstrata lost 2.5 per cent to £10.52 and Rio Tinto was 0.9 per cent weaker at £37.69.BP dropped 3.5 per cent to 388½p following Wednesday’s police raid on its Moscow office. Investors were increasingly nervy about the future of its TNK-BP joint venture, which accounts for a quarter of group production.A bid rumour helped Tullow Oil close higher by 3.2 per cent to £11.09. With results due from key exploration prospects in Liberia and French Guiana, traders called the timing of the story questionable.ITV faded 2.5 per cent to 59¾p. Nomura took the stock off its “buy” list based on “a weak macroeconomic environment for the UK for 2012 and beyond”.Among mid-caps, Charter International rose 4.7 per cent to 799p after the welding group opened its books to Melrose, which sweetened an indicative bid to 850p in cash and stock.Charter said it had taken the decision based on increased economic uncertainty – a caution that helped send Melrose 4.4 per cent lower to 300p. “If we are entering an earnings downgrade cycle, there is little chance Charter avoids a profit warning. We think Melrose are not too concerned about macro uncertainty though,” said UBS.Profit-taking carried Go-Ahead lower by 5.5 per cent to £14.96 after annual earnings and guidance from the bus and rail operator matched expectations. Shore Capital cut the stock off its “buy” list, arguing that fare hikes and rising unemployment may hurt its UK rail operations.An upgrade to “buy” from Numis Securities helped lift Telecity by 5 per cent to 572½p.

But he did not recommend buying the shares, despite the falling price, citing “our belief that more defensive names will likely outperform”.Dell dragged down rival computer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard, which lost 3.7 per cent to close at $31.39. Tech stocks were the worst performing of the S&P 500 index sectors, down 0.9 per cent.Analysts suggested manufacturers of tablets and netbooks would benefit from Dell’s troubles over the longer term but Apple, maker of the iPad tablet, saw its shares fall marginally to $380.44.Earlier, shares rose more than 1 per cent as traders shrugged off a 0.2 per cent month-on-month increase in producer prices in July, which stoked fears of inflation. The rise in producer prices was 0.4 per cent excluding food and energy prices, the highest since January.But a rally faded into the close, and the broad S&P 500 index closed up just 0.1 per cent at 1,193.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up fractionally at 11,410.21, but the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 2,511.48.Bob Haber, the principal of Haber Trilix advisers said today’s volatility could be the shape of things to come. “People don’t know how far a rally is going to go so it is very tempting to sell after small rises to lock in gains”A positive earnings report from Target had given some early lift to sentiment. The US’s second-largest discount retailer posted earnings of $1.03 a share, beating expectations of 97 cents a share. Its shares were up 2.4 per cent to $50.55 after paring early gains.That followed positive data from Home Depot and Walmart on Tuesday. Consumer staples performed well for a second day running, rising 0.8 per cent.But, shares in some retailers were falling sharply. Abercrombie & Fitch beat analyst expectations with earnings of 35 cents a share but its shares slumped 8.7 per cent to $64.87.Erika Maschmeyer, an analyst at Baird, said traders were unimpressed by the company’s refusal to discuss how much the poor economic environment will weight on revenue growth next year, but she expected the shares to recover in value by the end of the month.Telecom shares were the best performing sector on the S&P 500. Sprint shares continued to rise in the afterglow of Google’s bid for Motorola Mobility, with some traders predicting Google might bid for the network next. Sprint was up 3.6 per cent to $3.72 on the day, up 16 per cent for the week.Verizon and AT&T rose 2.1 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively as yield-seeking investors sought stocks which will pay reliable dividends.Shares in Tudou, a Chinese streaming video website, fell in their first day of trading after pricing an initial public offering late on Tuesday. The shares opened on the Nasdaq at $31. The stock finished 7.4 per cent lower at $26.85. “We cannot time the market,” said Gary Wang, Tudou chief executive. “But long-term investors like our story a lot. Fundamentally, it’s a play on the size of the Chinese consumer market and our focus on entertainment video is especially appealing to young consumers.”The pricing offered hopes that the IPO market could be thawing after freezing during the market volatility earlier in August but investors still appeared to be skittish. Tudou was forced to price its offering at an almost 60 per cent discount to rival Youku, whose shares were up 10.7 per cent to $26.47 on Wednesday.Cigarette manufacturers rose on news that a group of companies led by Lorillard are suing the US government over planned graphic health warnings on cigarette packaging. Lorillard was up 3.1 per cent at $108.38. Philip Morris International gained 2 per cent to close at $69.06.
168;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-07-27T07:50:05Z;Smokers in emerging markets lift BAT;Cigarette-maker hit by price war in Spain;An increase in prices and a focus on smokers in developing markets has helped British American Tobacco shrug off a decline in volumes.The maker of Dunhill and Lucky Strike cigarettes also offset the effects of a tobacco price war in Spain to boost turnover by 2 per cent to £7.4bn ($12bn), encouraging the FTSE 100 group to increase its interim dividend by 15 per cent.An 8 per cent jump in prices helped BAT also boost profit in spite of a 1 per cent fall in volumes to 344bn cigarettes “as the overall market share of the group increased and industry volume decline moderated”, the London-based company said.Adjusted profit rose 12 per cent to £2.8bn at BAT, which also makes the Kent and Pall Mall brands, beating analysts’ consensus estimates of £2.7bn.“With continued pricing momentum, an increase in market share and the rate of volume decline moderating, we are on track for another good year,” said Richard Burrows, BAT chairman.BAT’s exposure to developing markets has reassured investors about the prospects for tobacco companies after a report published in January by Citigroup analysts that forecast the end of smoking in the western world by 2050, which led to a brief drop in tobacco stocks.The tobacco company has aggressively promoted its brands in emerging markets, attracted by increased disposable incomes.In the six months to June 30, sales of Pall Mall rose by 14 per cent year-on-year, with growth in Pakistan, Turkey, Russia, Ukraine and Romania, which was partially offset by declines in Mexico, Italy and Spain.Volumes of Lucky Strike increased by 8 per cent, driven by growth in Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Chile and Argentina. Shipments to Japan were buoyed by a disruption in production by local cigarette companies following the country’s tsunami and earthquake in March.However, Spain continued to prove a weak spot after BAT this year moved to take market share from rivals including Imperial Tobacco by not passing on a tax increase to customers.The decision sparked a price war, which was exacerbated by Spain’s recent ban on smoking in public places, as well as the country’s weak economy leaving smokers with fewer euros in their pockets to fund their habit.BAT is also fighting government moves in Australia – where it controls 40 per cent of the market – to introduce uniform olive-green cigarette packaging.As a result BAT has turned its attention to emerging markets, and in May purchased Productora Tabacalera de Colombia – Colombia’s second-biggest cigarette maker – for $452m to become the second-largest tobacco group in Colombia after Philip Morris.The group is the maker of Mustang cigarettes, the second-most popular brand in the South American country, with an 18 per cent market share.As well as price rises, BAT aims to profit by pushing smokers towards premium brands, and the company has also started a subsidiary devoted to developing non-tobacco nicotine products.In the six months to June 30 BAT revenues rose from £7.3bn to £7.4bn, whilst pre-tax profit increased from £2.3bn to £2.8bn. Diluted earnings per share were up from 76.5p to 94p and an interim dividend of 38.1p, up from 33.2p, was proposed.BAT shares, which have risen by more than a quarter during the past 12 months, on Wednesday rose 37½p, or 1.3 per cent, to £28.99.
169;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-06-13T20:21:26Z;Imperial suffers as price wars hit Spain;;Imperial Tobacco has issued a profit warning stemming from a price war in Spain.The company, which owns the Davidoff and Gauloises brands, said on Monday that adjusted operating profits in the region could be as much as £110m ($180m) lower than previously forecast.Spain has not been the favourite territory of any tobacco company lately.The woeful economy means smokers have less money to spend, while a ban on smoking in public places instituted in January means they have fewer places to light up. The market has dropped precipitously as a result.However, two of the four global tobacco companies have borne the brunt of the pain in Spain. They are Imperial, whose Fortunas is the number two brand by volume in the country, and Philip Morris International, which makes the market leader Marlboro.Both groups have lost market share recently to British American Tobacco, primarily as it pushed its Pall Mall value brand through price and marketing. BAT boasted last month it aimed to “never miss a good crisis”, in reference to Spain.At first, Imperial gritted its teeth and held prices, in part because it was still paying down debt from its 2008 acquisition of Madrid-based Altadis.But Philip Morris took a different tack. Starting in May this year, it began a series of steep price cuts, and reasserted the role of its value L&M brand as the cheapest on the market.The ensuing price war eventually drew in Imperial, too, leading to Monday’s profit warning.But the war is attracting attention disproportionate to what it is costing Imperial, in part because it breaks with an industry-wide pattern that developed early in the recession and has been little questioned since.Despite volumes ebbing, revenues rose on higher prices. Even if smoking was not recession-proof, tobacco stocks seemed to be. Now some investors worry that Spain could be a harbinger of a new era of tougher pricing pressures for the industry.Imperial – and many analysts – argue the situation in Spain is unique.Its recession, after all, was deeper than elsewhere, and exacerbated by a tobacco tax increase late last year and the smoking ban this year. The structure of Spain’s tobacco duty means price wars hit government coffers, too, making price cuts attractive to companies wanting to influence government policy.Some observers believe Philip Morris is tilting for regulatory change. But one City analyst doubted that. “Price wars happen,” he said. “This is just getting attention because Spain is a big market and it’s in Europe.”He thinks Philip Morris is taking advantage of the weak dollar to stem market share declines, rather than fundamentally reassessing the trade-off between smoker retention and price.However, Martin Deboo at Investec Securities is more anxious. “With FY10 an annus horribilis for industry volumes, perhaps Philip Morris might be worried about consumption trends generally, a stance consistent with their FY11 guidance that pricing will be more ‘conservative’,” he wrote on Monday.“We sense they have a very keen awareness of when pricing is drifting too far away from what customers are willing to pay.”If this were the case, he said, “we see mature markets where Imperial is number two to Philip Morris – for example Germany, France and Poland – as concerns.”Imperial’s shares fell on Monday by 29p, or 1.4 per cent, to £20.56. Its difficulties play into market speculation that the number four tobacco group worldwide, by market capitalisation, could eventually be a take-over target. However, many sector watchers argue consolidation would be stymied by competition authorities.M&A would become more appealing for the industry if organic growth and pricing stuttered. But it is far from clear that it has reached that point. “You can’t really extrapolate from Spain,” said an analyst.Nor would weakening Imperial ahead of a take-over be one of Philip Morris’s aims. Competition concerns would keep the global market leader from picking off the number four.
170;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;BAT snaps up Colombian group for $452m;;British American Tobacco has cashed in on Philip Morris’s antitrust problems with the purchase of Colombia’s second-biggest cigarette maker, a deal agreed by BAT’s US rival in 2009 but scuppered by competition authorities last year.Productora Tabacalera de Colombia makes Mustang cigarettes, the second most popular brand in the country, with an 18 per cent market share. The $452m (£277m) deal will make BAT the second-largest tobacco group in Colombia after Philip Morris.The privately owned company sold 5.5bn cigarettes last year, and its addition will boost BAT’s volumes in the Americas by 3.7 per cent to almost 200bn. It should add 2 per cent to sales in the region.BAT is paying the same price agreed by Philip Morris in July 2009, which represents a multiple of 11.3 times the Colombian company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $40m last year. It will be funded by balance sheet cash.Philip Morris dropped its bid this January, saying regulatory approval had proved “too burdensome”. The company is already number one in the country and would have had to dispose of some brands to win approval for the Productora Tabacalera deal.Jonathan Fell, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said BAT was the obvious buyer following the collapse of the Philip Morris deal, since Japan Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco – the number three and four global groups in the sector – have only a minimal presence in South America. “It’s not like you could even use Colombia as a bridgehead, because the other countries are all sewn up,” he said.Nicandro Durante, BAT’s new chief executive, has said his focus in the first few years at the helm will be on organic growth, but he did not rule out bolt-on acquisitions to extend the company’s exposure to the developing world where cigarette volumes are growing.Analysts said that after paying down debt following the last round of industry consolidation – which ended with the purchase by Imperial in 2008 of Altadis, the world’s fifth-biggest tobacco group – the global leaders have cash to spend.Fulvio Cazzol, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, said the forward net debt to ebitda ratio for the sector had fallen from 3.2 times in 2007-08 to 1.5 times now.However, this deal falls far short of the “significant consolidation opportunities” highlighted by Goldman analysts, including a possible acquisition of Imperial Tobacco by BAT.BAT’s shares rose 1.2 per cent on Thursday, to £27.12. It shares are rated more highly than those of its peers Imperial and Japan Tobacco, in part because of its exposure to the developing world.
171;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;BAT lights up in Colombia;;"With all the focus on Asia and Eastern Europe as the prime emerging market battlegrounds for Big Tobacco, it is easy to forget that Latin America is a continent that hasn’t quite kicked its own cigarette habit.British American Tobacco on Monday offered a reminder of the continent’s money spinning potential, following a deal to acquire Colombia’s second-biggest cigarette maker, Productora Tabacalera de Colombia (Protabaco), for $452m (£277m).With 250bn sticks consumed annually, Latin America is much smaller than Asia (whose consumption figure is vastly inflated by China’s 2,163bn sticks a year habit), Eastern Europe (725bn sticks) and Western Europe (567bn sticks).And while volumes have fallen slightly, revenues and profits have been on the up as smokers on the continent, richer and more brand-conscious, trade up.“Latin America as a whole has been very quick in recovering from the banking crisis. Despite the worldwide crisis, Colombia has seen GDP grow throughout 2008 and 2010,” Michael Prideaux, a spokesman for BAT told beyondbrics.The deal to buy Protabaco – which sold 5.5bn cigarettes last year and has 32 per cent of the Columbia market – will make BAT the number two in country after Philip Morris International (which controls 49.5 per cent of the market).While the deal is modest in the context of BAT – which last year sold 708bn cigarettes and recorded revenues of £14.9bn – analysts see it as a sensible move.As Citigroup’s Adam Spielman noted:Beyond the cost synergies, the acquisition should alter the dynamics of the Colombian market favourably as there has been some price skirmishing in the market in the last couple of years, with the three players jostling for position while the sale was playing out. Furthermore, it should help strengthen BAT’s dominant position in Latin America in general, and the north of South America in particular. BAT has a 90% market share in neighbouring Venezuela and about 65% in both Peru and Central America/Caribbean.Like its competitors, BAT has seen cigarette sales in the US, parts of Europe and other mature markets fall amid increasing health concerns, smoking bans, higher taxes and advertising restrictions.Yet the world’s second-biggest tobacco company has sustained growth by focusing on raising profit margins in western Europe and increasing sales in emerging markets where populations and the popularity of smoking are still climbing.It has done deals in Turkey and Indonesia, and emerging markets now account for some 80 per cent of group volume and 60 per cent adjusted profit last year.Americas – which includes Canada but excludes the US – is the company’s best performing region.Jonathan Fell, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said margin for the Americas division was the highest at BAT at 39.5 per cent, compared with 35.4 per cent in Asia and 28.9 per cent in Eastern Europe.For those who follow tobacco news, this is not the first time BAT has tried to acquire Protabaco. BAT lost out to PMI in 2009. However, the maker of Malboro cigarettes was forced to pull its bid this January after Columbian regulators objected to the deal.BAT is paying the same price agreed by Philip Morris in July 2009, which represents a multiple of 11.3 times the Colombian company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $40m last year.Thursday’s deal will no doubt bring Latam back into focus for the tobacco industry. But for other big international tobacco companies like Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco, both of which have negligible presence on the continent, the deal is a reminder that they may have missed the boat.Related reading:

172;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-05-20T19:20:28Z;Imperial reflects downdrift at price war fears with Philip Morris;;Fears of a price war sent Imperial Tobacco sliding on Friday as the London market drifted lower.Imperial lost 1.3 per cent to £21.86 as pressure from the Marlboro-maker Philip Morris forced it to cut prices in Spain, which contributes about 8 per cent of group profit.The decision follows six months of jostling between Spain’s main cigarette companies after British American Tobacco moved to take market share from its rivals by not passing on a tax increase to customers.BAT capitulated and raised prices at the start of May, action Imperial followed immediately. But Philip Morris revealed on Thursday that it was not to follow suit, leading Imperial to reverse its price rise.Citigroup reckoned these skirmishes were symptomatic of a wider deterioration in worldwide tobacco pricing. “In an industry that has been marked by excellent price discipline in recent years, there is evidence that that discipline has weakened,” it said.But Royal Bank of Scotland, Imperial’s house broker, said the impact on group profits would be negligible. It would advise clients to treat the weakness as a buying opportunity.BAT, for which Spain contributes less than 1 per cent of earnings, rose by 0.8 per cent to £27.45.Financial stocks dragged on the wider market as concerns intensified about Greece and the eurozone. Having been up as much as 1 per cent in advance of a mid-morning expiry of options contracts, the FTSE 100 erased gains to close down 0.1 per cent or 7.5 points at 5,948.49. That left the index up 0.4 per cent for the week.Lloyds Banking Group was Friday’s top blue-chip faller, dropping 2.9 per cent to a one-year low of 51.6p. Late on Thursday, Goldman Sachs cut long-term earnings forecasts for the bank by as much as 88 per cent.Amec, the industrial services group, lost 1.1 per cent to £11.74 after a capital markets day that analysts described as “solid rather than spectacular”. Collins Stewart downgraded Amec to “hold”, arguing that there were no catalysts for outperformance on the horizon beyond the conversion of its acquisition pipeline.Among the gainers, BP jumped by 2.7 per cent to 460p after Mitsui, 10 per cent partner on its Macondo field in the Gulf of Mexico, agreed to settle all claims between the companies in regard to last year’s rig disaster.“Put bluntly, we believe the implications for BP are monumental,” said JPMorgan. “A rational partner has concluded, based on a complete set of evidence and investigatory reports, that Macondo was both multi-party and multi-causal in nature.“We believe this must make it more likely that the US Department of Justice will share its conclusions. This reduces the chances of a worst-case fine under the Clean Water Act of up to $18bn versus BP’s provision of $3.5bn.”Primark owner AB Foods rose 3.1 per cent to £10.90 after Exane BNP Paribas advised a switch out of Tate & Lyle, which weakened by 2.2 per cent to 614p.Micro Focus jumped 7.8 per cent to 398½p on confirmation that private equity groups Advent International and Bain Capital were interested in bidding. The IT company said last month that it had received takeover approaches, rumoured to be between 425p and 450p per share.Banking software maker Misys took on 0.9 per cent to 360p on continued speculation that Sungard, the US IT group, was a potential bidder. Aveva, the maker of design software for shipbuilders, added 4.2 per cent to £16.18 on a revival of gossip that it may be a target for Oracle or SAP.Howden Joinery, formerly MFI’s kitchens wholesaler, gained 0.5 per cent to 115½p amid speculation it may be a takeover target for Travis Perkins. Evolution Securities argued this week that Travis, off 1.5 per cent to £10.32, was ready to make acquisitions and was seeking to add kitchens to its portfolio. The building supplies group could afford to bid up to 164p per share for Howden on existing resources, it said.TalkTalk, the broadband provider, gained 4 per cent to 145¾p after Goldman Sachs reheated bid theories.“TalkTalk could be an attractive M&A candidate for a UK fixed-line player seeking scale . . . or a mobile operator that believes in the cross-selling opportunities of fixed-mobile convergence,” it said in a note raising the stock to “buy”.An upgrade by Goldman also lifted ITE Group, the eastern Europe-focused conference organiser, by 3.9 per cent to 243½p.Mitchells & Butlers dropped 3.9 per cent to 243½p after the pubs group provided no news on reinstating its dividend or appointing a new chief. A JPMorgan Cazenove downgrade to “neutral” on valuation grounds also weighed on the shares.
173;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Cheap debt sees boom in sales of corporate paper;;There was a sales boom this week in the corporate bond market as companies lined up to take advantage of cheap debt after a drop in US borrowing costs.Sales of US corporate debt, from highly rated as well as “junk” issuers, excluding financial companies, was poised on Friday to reach a record at nearly $30bn, according to Dealogic.US Treasury bonds, the benchmark for dollar-denominated corporate debt, have rallied since the middle of April, sending yields to levels not seen since late last year.In turn, yields on investment-grade bonds issued by industrial companies had fallen to 3.69 per cent on Thursday after topping 4 per cent in April, according to a Barclays Capital index. An all-time low of 3.34 per cent was reached in November last year.Sales of risky corporate debt, or junk bonds, were also strong after their yields reached a record low of 6.64 per cent this week, according to an index provided by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.“When markets are attractive, issuers find reasons to borrow,” said Mark Bamford, head of global fixed income syndicate at Barclays Capital.The chance to raise cheap debt has lured some of the biggest names in corporate America. Google, the world’s largest search engine which was sitting atop $36.7bn of cash at the end of March, sold its first issue of corporate bonds with a $3bn deal to boost its domestic cash reserves.A portion of Google’s cash resides overseas, and bringing that back to the US can mean a large tax bill.Google and Johnson & Johnson, which has a rare triple A rating, achieved some of the lowest interest rates on portions of their bond sales this week.Chrysler, which has ratings below investment grade, sold $3.2bn of junk bonds as part of a refinancing of government loans related to the carmaker’s 2009 bankruptcy.May is typically a busy month for the corporate bond market because it sits between a period of corporate earnings and the summer months.Companies are taking advantage of low borrowing costs to finance share buy-backs, and mergers and acquisitions after keeping high cash balances since the financial crisis.Last week Philip Morris sold $1bn of bonds, saying the possible uses “include share repurchases”.Financial groups were also issuers, including a deal from BlackRock that raised $1.5bn to fund the repurchase of preferred stock from affiliates at Merrill Lynch.The subtext for many companies pushing ahead with bond sales is the uncertain picture after the end of quantitative easing, the Federal Reserve’s programme to buy US Treasuries, on June 30.A debate is on about whether the end of “QE2” will bring in a period of rising rates. Rock-bottom rates present a quandary for investors looking to buy bonds because any subsequent rise in yields would result in a fall in bond prices. For companies, however, it is an easy choice.“If you are standing on the North Pole, any direction you walk is south,” said Martin Fridson, global credit strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “When you have optimal financing conditions, the thing to do is get your deal done now.”
174;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-05-18T18:53:31Z;Imperial Tobacco aims for organic growth;;"On the first anniversary last week of Alison Cooper’s appointment as chief executive of Imperial Tobacco, an analyst at Investec Securities reminded investors of the fundamental question that she needs to answer: can the FTSE 100 tobacco company transform itself from the M&A machine it has been over the past two decades into a vehicle for organic growth?Shareholders may have been temporarily distracted from that question by the announcement that Imperial would begin buying back shares.The company has paid down debt from its last big deal – the acquisition of Altadis, maker of Gauloises Blondes, in 2008 – to just over two times earnings.It will also push up dividends, hitting 50 per cent of adjusted earnings this year and aims to increase them ahead of the rate of earnings growth.But with investors’ “cash return bloodlust now sated” – as the Investec analyst Martin Deboo put it – the organic growth question is nagging again.Ms Cooper does not deny the importance of the answer, for employees as much as investors. She recalls how, a year ago, some staff had seemed hesitant about the new direction she was advocating.She wants to turn a team skilled at bedding down new businesses – from Australian, Dutch and African acquisitions in the late 1990s, to Reemtsma of Germany in 2002 and Altadis six years later – into one that can increase market share and volumes through better sales and marketing.“They all said, ‘we like Alison, we really want to go for it’,” she says. “But they wanted to get some meat on the bones.” Enthusiasm has grown in the course of the year, she believes, as seen at a recent management meeting in Prague. “All the feedback from Prague was, ‘we really see it’.”She has also brought in fresh blood. Two recent hires – a marketing director from Reckitt Benckiser and a sales director from Metro Group, the German retail business – underscore her belief that Imperial should think of itself as a regular fast-moving consumer goods company and that organic growth, not M&A, is top of the agenda.Investors, meanwhile, saw some signs of progress in the company’s half-year results. Sales of its premium Davidoff brand were up 9 per cent, helped by a strong performance in emerging markets. And while the West value brand had subdued growth – up just 1 per cent – and cigarette volumes were down as a whole, fine-cut tobacco volumes rose 5 per cent.“In most of my discussions with the investment community, I feel there’s a general growing confidence with the organic growth story,” says Ms Cooper.Mr Deboo is less convinced. He points out that market share declined in the six months to March 31 in 11 of the company’s 20 reported markets, including Russia, France and regulation-hit Spain.To counter these trends, Ms Cooper has been creating “cocktails” of solutions, designed for each territory. They are based on the notion that Imperial can improve revenues not just through pricing and cigarette sales, but by selling cigars, fine-cut tobacco, rolling papers and filters, even rolling machines.The difficult UK market, where Imperial generates 13 per cent of its revenues via brands such as Lambert & Butler, Regal and Golden Virginia, is a good example. The company is coping with poorer, recession and austerity-hit smokers by pushing fine-cut tobacco as a cheaper alternative to cigarettes. This year, it introduced an alternative to roll-your-own tobacco: cigarette-making kits, with filters already fitted into tubes, and a special cut of loose tobacco to be fed into the tubes using a machine.Julian Hardwick of RBS says: “There’s a perception in the market that the European Union is not a good place to have a tobacco business. One of the strong views that Alison has is that there are always growth opportunities. It may not be in cigarettes, it may not be in premium cigarettes, but there are always going to be opportunities, and it’s very important that Imperial capitalises on them through its ‘total tobacco’ portfolio. That’s a key mindset that’s brought to the whole business.”If Ms Cooper can’t capitalise on these opportunities, M&A could be back on the agenda – this time with Imperial as the target.Some of the 12 per cent climb in the share price since the start of the year has come on the back of research by analysts at Goldman Sachs arguing that four global tobacco companies – Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Imperial – is still one too many. They argue that debt across the sector is low, volumes are stagnating and competition issues are not insurmountable, particularly if BAT were to buy Imperial.Ms Cooper, who occasionally deviates from the on-message, unironic language of top managers to show a more jaundiced view of the world, is sceptical: “Anything to do with four to three has got very significant antitrust issues; I always describe it as not impossible but very difficult. But I’m sure bankers in particular will continue to speculate. Because I’m sure they’d love the fees on a deal like that.”Her counterpart at BAT, meanwhile, who is also new to the job, says M&A will not be his focus for the next few years at least.Mr Hardwick, of RBS, argues, like Ms Cooper, that if the market were taking bid speculation seriously, the shares would be much higher than they are. Even Mr Deboo says that the stock is a safe buy, “the closest thing to a bond available in the equity market”. He contests the notion, however, that Imperial is cheap next to rivals with greater emerging markets exposure.Ms Cooper prefers to see emerging markets as one of the opportunities on offer for a company occupying fourth position in the global market. For the M&A bulls on the sidelines, being fourth could offer other tantalising opportunities, too."
175;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-05-11T17:58:56Z;Blue chips borrow to fund buy-backs;;US blue-chip companies from Philip Morris to AT&T are taking advantage of cheap debt to finance share buy-backs and mergers and acquisitions activity at an accelerated pace.The rise in buy-backs and deals marks a turning point in the credit cycle, as companies become more willing to invest their cash and borrow more money. Since the 2008 financial crisis, many companies have been hoarding cash and building up ever greater treasure chests and rainy-day funds.“We are reverting to more typical historical averages and we are expecting the proportion of M&A financing in the bond markets to rise further this year,” said Bryan Jennings, managing director at Morgan Stanley.So far this year, companies with investment-grade ratings have borrowed more than $200bn in the dollar-bond market, up from $134bn by this time last year, according to Dealogic. This figure excludes bond sales by financial institutions.It is difficult to pinpoint how much of the borrowing by companies with investment-grade ratings is for activities such as share buy-backs and deals, and how much is used for capital spending or other purposes. Many companies do not specify exactly what they use bond proceeds for.Some do, however. This week, tobacco company Philip Morris sold $1bn of bonds and said possible uses “include share repurchases”. Telecoms group AT&T’s $20bn bridge loan for its $39bn cash-and-stock purchase of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA is expected to be refinanced in the bond markets.Mr Jennings has analysed bond sales by investment-grade companies since 2006. He estimates that about 20 per cent of the money borrowed in the dollar-bond markets in 2006 and 2007 was used to finance M&A.That proportion dropped to between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in 2008 and to below 10 per cent in 2009 and 2010, he calculates. This year, the ratio has risen sharply and he expects it will return to about 20 per cent.One factor fuelling bond sales is the fact that borrowing costs have remained at historically low levels. The recent fall in US Treasury yields has resulted in a decline in corporate borrowing costs back to record lows. After rising to just over 4 per cent in April, the average yield on bonds sold by industrial US companies tracked by the Barclays Capital bond index has this week fallen back down to 3.75 per cent, for example.“Many companies are surprised that interest rates are still this low, and they now have a chance to get a second bite at the apple,” said Jonathan Fine, head of the US investment-grade syndicate for Goldman Sachs, which expects $100bn of bond sales by companies with investment grade ratings in May. “There is a pretty homogenous expectation that long-term yields will go up.”
176;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-04-15T22:06:25Z;Imperial Tobacco lit up by talk of sector merger;;Takeover talk helped buoy Imperial Tobacco on Friday as the FTSE 100 edged higher. Shares in Imperial rose 1.9 per cent to £20.39 after Goldman Sachs argued that the cigarette maker was the most likely takeover target when sector consolidation returns.Low debt levels, strong cash generation, below average valuations and a lack of organic growth among the main cigarette makers suggest conditions are right for the four biggest tobacco makers to become three, said analyst Fulvio Cazzol.Of the four, Philip Morris International would face too many competition hurdles while Japan Tobacco looked an unlikely bid target given the Japanese government’s blocking stake, Goldman said. The most likely deal was therefore that British American Tobacco would buy Imperial, the smallest of the four, it continued.Such a combination would require BAT to sell Imperial’s assets in markets including Germany and Australia, as well as exiting Reynolds American, BAT’s US joint venture, Goldman said. The broker still forecast that a takeover would boost BAT’s earnings by between 2 and 15 per cent before cost savings.BAT closed up 1.3 per cent to £25.67 — matching the trend in the wider market after US data showed an unexpected rise in consumer sentiment for April. The FTSE 100 closed up 0.5 per cent, or 32.21 points, to 5,996.01. For the week the index was down 1 per cent.Hedge fund manager Man Group, one of the weakest performers since the Japan crisis, rallied by 4.2 per cent to 247p after Merrill Lynch argued that the stock had fallen too far. “Man’s recent share price has diverged from the behaviour both of AHL, its largest single manager, and the broader hedge fund industry. In our view, it would not take much good news to cause this gap to close,” it said.Merrill was positive on Autonomy, up 2.2 per cent to £22.00 in advance of results on Thursday. The software group’s lack of trading statement before the figures unnerved investors. Merrill said market expectations appeared reasonable.Reckitt Benckiser recouped 2.7 per cent to £31.43, having tumbled by 7.5 per cent on Thursday on the surprise retirement of Bart Brecht, chief executive. “We believe his resignation was triggered by a major strategic disagreement between Mr Brecht and the board, with the former potentially pushing for a transformative merger and/or an outright sale and the latter wanting independence,” said Liberum.Miners and oil companies drifted lower as Goldman Sachs reiterated its caution about oil and copper for the third time in a week. Essar Energy declined by 2 per cent to 448½p, BP was down 0.9 per cent to 459½p, Vedanta Resources lost 1 per cent to £23.13 and Rio Tinto was 0.8 per cent weaker at £43.25.Invensys was down 0.7 per cent to 323¾p as BarCap cut earnings forecasts by 7 per cent to reflect its failure to win a rail deal with Transport for London.Among mid-caps, Micro Focus dropped by 13.3 per cent to 262¾p after it parted company with Nigel Clifford, chief executive of the software maker for less than 12 months. Micro Focus said its trading was in line with expectations but , with two weeks of the company’s financial year left, investors found little reassurance. Salamander Energy was down 4 per cent to 300p after its Dao Ruang-2 well in Thailand failed to flow gas at a commercial rate, in spite of promising test results in March. RBS analysts had been valuing the prospect at 26p per share.In-line results and news that it had walked away from talks to buy casino website 888 sent Ladbrokes higher by 7 per cent to 141p. Peer William Hill followed, up 5.7 per cent to 196¼p.C&W Worldwide gained 2.3 per cent to 51¾p on an upgrade to “buy” from Investec, with the broker seeing potential for bid interest. Two profit warnings and the departure of its chief financial officer have pushed C&W’s valuation to only 3.5 times next year’s operating earnings, compared with about 5.5 times for the UK telecommunications sector, Investec said. The depressed price put no value on C&W’s UK network business, which provides 70 per cent of revenues, it said.“There comes a point [at which] investors (or competitors) start to notice the deep value potential. For C&W, we believe now is that time,” analyst Morten Singleton said. “Bids could come from UK mobile or international players with multiple potential synergy benefits to justify a premium to standalone value – possibly doubling the value of the equity.”

Those from Alabama, Nebraska and Oklahoma – all Republicans – have said that any plan to require principal reduction would be unacceptable.They, like many banks – including Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup – have opposed the plan on the grounds that it would be too difficult to decide who was eligible.Mr Miller, a Democrat, said his team was still working on how to define eligibility, but added that only the most distressed borrowers would be eligible. Some 4.8m borrowers are seriously delinquent or in some stage of foreclosure, according to Moody’s.A career prosecutor, Mr Miller has served as the Iowa attorney-general almost continuously since he was elected in 1978. He polished his negotiating skills in high-profile cases against big tobacco companies such as Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds as well as the Microsoft antitrust case.He said those cases taught him “not to get diverted” by political infighting and to “keep my eye on what needs to be done”.Mr Miller cracked down on subprime lending when he led a group of states in successfully suing Household International, now part of HSBC, and Ameriquest Mortgage Company for deceptive lending practices. Both companies settled for hundreds of millions of dollars.

She is an empty seat at the parliamentary committee at which she has thrice declined to make an appearance. She is a negative space, absent from non-occurring press conferences at the historic Bournville plant acquired via the £11.6bn purchase of Cadbury last year.It is not necessary for Ms Rosenfeld to show up for the hearings of the business select committee. It is quite possible for her to send a stonewalling lawyer in the form of Kraft general counsel Marc Firestone. This enables her, quite logically, to bracket hostility to Kraft concerning the badly managed Cadbury takeover as a little local difficulty in the UK that will die down in time.But while an appearance is unnecessary, it would have been advisable. Mr Firestone, formerly a lawyer at tobacco company Philip Morris, wriggled and swerved unconvincingly before an angry committee on Tuesday, attempting to justify Ms Rosenfeld’s absence. Some of the questioning was likely to be “rancorous”, he said. Ms Rosenfeld should have regarded that probability as a test of her mettle rather than a deterrent. Barclays, facing equivalent unpopularity because of its bonus policies, fielded chief executive Bob Diamond at a select committee in January. He performed with aplomb.Ms Rosenfeld, in contrast, appears to be a leader who leads from the front only when it suits her. As Tory MP, businessman and ex-opinion pollster Nadhim Zahawi pointed out, an appearance would now be in Kraft’s best interests. The half-life of British acrimony towards Kraft is being extended rather than reduced by the impression that the underperforming group is run by the Invisible Woman. Lord Mandelson, who helped Mr Diamond finesse his spiel, is surely available for other assignments. Ms Rosenfeld should give him a call.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
180;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2011-02-24T17:55:44Z;BAT’s buy-back falls shy of expectations;;British American Tobacco met analysts’ expectations with a 7.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for last year, but disappointed the market with the size of its share buy-back scheme.The maker of Pall Mall, Kent and Dunhill cigarettes increased revenues 5 per cent to £14.9bn and pre-tax profits rose to £4.39bn, helped by pricing, strong trading in commodity led economies including Canada, Australia and Brazil, and favourable exchange rates. At constant currencies, organic revenues rose 3 per cent.Investors were unimpressed, however, by the group’s £750m share repurchase, part of a buy-back programme restarted after a two-year hiatus. After a nearly 3 per cent drop in morning trading on Thursday, the shares recovered to close 16p lower at £23.97.Julian Hardwick, an analyst with RBS, said the size of the buy-back was sensible, even if it fell short of rival Philip Morris’s $5bn (£3bn) buy-back announced this month. “The £750m effectively utilised their cash flow. Anything more than that, they would have been borrowing to fund their purchases,” he said.Rogerio Fujimori, at Credit Suisse, said money was probably being put aside for small acquisitions in emerging markets instead – possibly including a Colombian cigarette maker Philip Morris recently decided not to buy. “The company is looking at deals, it’s obvious.”Paul Adams, BAT’s chief executive who will retire next week after nine years at the helm, said the company was “achieving or exceeding our strategic targets”. A cost-savings goal for 2012 was met last year and BAT was on track, he said, to meet its 35 per cent operating margin target in the next two years or sooner.Nicandro Durante, Mr Adams’ successor, predicted volume declines would remain flat or ease in the coming year. BAT sold 2 per cent fewer cigarettes around the world last year, compared with a volume fall across the market of 3 per cent. Its volumes were helped by the 2009 purchase of Bentoel, the Indonesian tobacco producer.The company and its rivals have been able to counteract volume declines of the past few years with higher prices – a practice Mr Durante said could continue for some time. “In most parts of the world, the price of cigarettes is still very low,” he said.In the long term, said Mr Durante, “the name of the game is going to be value. It’s about giving something else to the consumer in order to [get them to] buy premium brands”.In keeping with a policy of matching dividend growth with rises in adjusted earnings per share, BAT proposed a final of 81p – 15 per cent higher than last year – for a total of 114.2p. Basic earnings per share were 6 per cent higher at 145.2p.
181;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-11-25T18:34:48Z;Tobacco additive curb angers African farmers;;Rueben Mushili, who owns a small tobacco farm in the southern Zambian village of Chimusanya, worries his future could be jeopardised by events last week in far-away Uruguay.At a World Health Organisation conference in the seaside resort of Punta del Este, delegates voted to crack down on additives that make tobacco more palatable to young and first-time smokers.The move could have a disastrous effect on demand for Burley tobacco, which requires additives to moderate its harsh taste and is used in “American blend” cigarettes such as Philip Morris’s Marlboro range.“I make $4,000 a year from my tobacco field – it is almost my only source of income,” Mr Mushili says, sitting in the village’s grass-roofed meeting hut.“If I grew maize or ground nuts on the same field it would bring in only $120. There are 50 Burley farmers in this area and we all have extended families to support. This sudden move will leave a lot of families vulnerable – it will be survival of the fittest.”The WHO guidelines have drawn a sharp response from African governments. Eustarckio Kazonga, Zambia’s agriculture minister, has said the proposed restriction on additives “would promote poverty, especially in rural communities”, while Malawi’s government criticised it as a barrier to fair trade. The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, with 22 member states, resolved last month to oppose the WHO’s initiative, and has been backed by the African Union.“Comesa has been party to all the measures the FCTC [the WHO’s framework convention on tobacco control] has introduced so far – we’re not opposed to what it’s trying to achieve,” says James Mwansa Musonda, a senior trade adviser for the association. “But our issue is with the limited consultation and the impracticability of these proposals.”The consequences of the move will be “devastating”, he adds, with each farmer typically supporting up to 10 dependants. “This is not just a health issue. We feel discriminated against and disadvantaged by this measure.”Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman, says: “From the point of view of public health, there is no justification for flavourings that make tobacco more attractive.” Member states are free to adopt the guidelines in whatever form they deem appropriate, while a WHO document notes it is possible to produce cigarettes using Burley tobacco without additives.But Jonathan Fell, an industry analyst at Deutsche Bank in London, believes tobacco producers are right to be nervous. “It’s certainly the case that, in most cases, one needs to add flavourings to Burley to make it palatable,” he says.There is no apparent “scientific rationale” behind the WHO guidelines, with no evidence that young smokers are more attracted to American blend cigarettes, Mr Fell adds. “Companies will use much less Burley, causing a lot of dislocation among the people who grow it, but I very much doubt it would lead to any reduction in smoking rates. This is regulation for the sake of being a pain to the tobacco industry.”While the WHO has pledged to investigate alternative farming options for affected growers, Antonio Abrunhosa, chief executive of the International Tobacco Growers’ Association, says many will have “no economically viable alternative”. Alternative varieties which do not require additives, such as Virginia tobacco, are much more difficult to process and would require expensive infrastructure.A survey commissioned by the ITGA found that a rapid contraction in tobacco production could push Malawi into recession and hamper growth in several other southern African countries. Growers in Argentina, Brazil, Turkey and Greece will also be affected, Mr Abrunhosa says. Brazil is nonetheless set to support the plans.“Banning strawberry or chocolate flavourings – that makes sense,” Mr Abrunhosa adds. “But this will affect a whole range of other cigarettes, where there is absolutely no scientific evidence that youngsters prefer them.”The Framework Convention Alliance, an anti-tobacco group, accuses the ITGA of using developing-world farmers as a front for defending the interests of cigarette manufacturers.It lobbied delegates in Uruguay to pass the guidelines, arguing that reliance on tobacco had held back economic development in parts of southern Africa.But as he surveys his tobacco fields, Mr Mushili is unimpressed by such arguments. “These people worry that Africa is vulnerable, and that the children aren’t going to school,” he says. “But as soon as we find a way of uplifting ourselves, they ban it.”
182;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

DMMs do not get to see incoming orders before others, as specialists once did.But they are required under an “affirmative obligation” arrangement to buy shares in a falling market and sell in a rising market under certain circumstances, determined using a formula that is triggered under certain market conditions.DMMs also trade shares using their own funds - which is typical of proprietary traders such as Getco, which also engage in high-frequency trading strategies.Chicago-based Getco became the first proprietary trading firm of its kind to become a DMM in February, when it bought 350 “assignments” – that is, stock names or other types of securities linked to listed companies – from Barclays. The UK-based bank had itself just bought LaBranche, a long-standing DMM, but had to divest some of its assignments as part of that deal.Of Getco’s assignments, 234 are company stocks such as Nike, Bristol Myers Squibb, Mastercard, RBS, GlaxoSmithKline, Domino’s, Sotheby’s and Philip Morris International, for which Getco has market-making obligations.
184;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-10-28T03:02:51Z;BAT hurt by floods and declining volumes;;"British American Tobacco blamed illicit trade, a declining market for cigarettes in the western world and devastating floods in Pakistan for a higher-than-expected fall in organic sales volumes in the first nine months of the year.While organic volumes fell 3 per cent, BAT’s acquisition of Indonesian cigarette maker Bentoel last year meant total volumes were down just 1 per cent, at 526bn “sticks”. Western Europe, where customers bought 8 per cent fewer cigarettes this year than last, led the decline.Paul Adams, BAT’s outgoing chief executive, said on Wednesday that the industry – once considered recession-proof – had been hit by unemployment.“The recession’s impact on consumers is still with us and shows no sign of abating,” he warned. He also cited down-trading to black-market cigarettes as a reason for volume weakness, and said smokers’ decisions to do so were often driven by higher excise taxes.While volumes were lower in every region but Asia-Pacific, BAT joined its peers in making up for the loss through higher prices. With revenues achieving “good growth” in the nine months to September 30, Mr Adams said that BAT was “on track for another good year of earnings growth”.BAT, which has a history of maintaining margins through cost-cutting, also said it had begun preparations for closing its Lecce factory in southern Italy. The plant employs 400 and was part of BAT’s acquisition of state monopoly ETI.While the Pakistan floods were a one-off hit to volumes, the company also benefited from a one-off boost: as with its larger rival, US-based Philip Morris, BAT saw a surge in Japanese sales over the summer as smokers stocked up ahead of a tax change that pushes prices steeply higher.That contributed to an 8 per cent increase in volume growth across the group for its four key brands – Kent, Dunhill, Pall Mall and Lucky Strike – compared with a 4 per cent rise in total volumes last year. BAT attributed some of the growth this year to moving Brazilian and South African customers from local brands to Dunhill.BAT has been a favourite of analysts thanks to geographical diversity and success in reducing its cost base; last year, it derived no more than 30 per cent of revenues from any region of the world.Still, the shares fell on the drop in volumes, closing down 37p at £24.01.While revenues were also helped by foreign exchange rates, BAT expects this support to ease in the final three months of the year."

Mr Burtle’s tactic of aiming fruity flavours at youths has shared the fate of most forms of nicotine marketing, but snuff is one of the few areas of growth left for the US’s largest cigarette maker.In Altria’s third quarter, reported on Wednesday, smokeless tobacco sales were a 10th higher than last year. To UST’s well established Skoal and Copenhagen lines, Altria has added Marlboro-branded snuff. With integration savings, operating profits in the division were a third higher.Yet if this is the growth opportunity, investors might still cough nervously. Smokeless profits were flattered by last year’s expense of rolling out Marlboro Snus. The growth is also helped by discounting, pushing down average prices and suggesting a market with relatively dim prospects for ongoing expansion.Furthermore, in stock market terms at least, tobacco has already been rehabilitated. From a valuation low of just two times prospective earnings in 2003, Altria has steadily risen to the lofty 13 times rating it currently holds. And since the spin-out of Philip Morris International was completed in 2008, the company operates purely in the mature US market it dominates via Marlboro’s 43 per cent share.Marlboro smokers are ageing and conservative, though, meaning point-of-sale innovation is the last marketing tool aside from price left to Altria. And Marlboro’s market share has only ever been matched in the past by Camel in 1925, notes Credit Suisse. Marketing obstructions make challenging the brand by rivals difficult. Still, history would suggest Marlboro’s share has peaked in the US and the dwindling sales of past favourites (Lucky Strikes, Pall Mall and Winston, for instance), point to tougher times ahead.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

Miguel Messmacher, head of economic planning, said: “In spite of the changes, the deficit’s downward trend remains intact.” This year, the deficit was set at 0.7 per cent of GDP.The government managed to kill off a plan by opposition legislators of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to reduce value added tax from 16 per cent to 15 per cent.Mr Calderón’s administration had argued that such a reduction would have been irresponsible given the country’s already-low tax take as well as Mexico’s dependence on oil revenue.Overall, next year’s budget predicts economic growth at 3.9 per cent – slightly higher than the government’s original projection of 3.8 per cent – and an average oil price of $65.40 a barrel, $2 more than the government’s proposal.In addition, legislators agreed to slap a 25 per cent tax on energy drinks as well as raise the price of the packet of cigarettes seven pesos. In response, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, the two largest companies in Mexico’s cigarette market, threatened to withdraw their investments, according to the El Universal newspaper.The paper quoted the company as saying the proposed tax “put seriously at risk our investment and expansion plans, and threatens hundreds of direct and indirect jobs”.Together, the changes to the government’s original proposal are designed to generate an additional 60bn pesos, which lawmakers have earmarked for spending in areas of the country that have been hit by tropical storms and torrential rain in recent months.The approved revenue package will now go to the Senate, which must give a green light to the budget by the end of this month. The spending package, which is always potentially more divisive than the revenue portion, must be approved by November 15.
187;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-08-11T00:34:15Z;Philip Morris faces tougher rules in Indonesia;;For generations, Indonesia’s huge cigarette market was dominated by domestic players, while foreign companies struggled to gain even a foothold. Then, five years ago, Philip Morris International entered the country with the largest acquisition it had ever made.Philip Morris paid $4.8bn for Sampoerna, a manufacturer of kretek, clove-flavoured cigarettes, which are consumed by 90 per cent of Indonesia’s roughly 70m smokers. After snapping up several leading brands, it commands about 30 per cent of the market and is the leading tobacco company.Since 2005, Sampoerna’s production volume has almost doubled to 76bn cigarettes per year, driven mainly by stellar sales of its top kretek brand, A Mild, a slim cigarette flavoured with tropical Indonesian spice. Philip Morris’s flagship Marlboro and low priced kretek brands have also grown strongly.“The acquisition was a little bit of a coup and it was the only way you could get into this market correctly,” claims John Gledhill, president director of Philip Morris’s Indonesian operations, in an interview with the Financial Times. It “has been a stunning success. It was part of the driver for growth for the last five years”.Sampoerna made $555m in net profit last year, a 30 per cent increase from 2008. It employs 28,300 people at 10 factories across the island of Java, the heartland of Indonesia’s centuries-old kretek industry.Another 38 suppliers of its hand-rolled kreteks employ 60,000 more workers.In addition to its rich heritage, tobacco excise tax is a large source of Indonesian government revenue – Philip Morris pays roughly $2.5bn of tax a year – and 6m people work in tobacco farming and production.Philip Morris has invested $250m to expand production of machine-made Marlboro and A Mild since the acquisition, while aggressive advertising and product development have helped it stay ahead of leading competitors including British American Tobacco. BAT bought rival Bentoel last year for $494m.The Indonesian tobacco market, which is growing at 2-4 per cent per year, is the third largest after China and India. Population growth and rising purchasing power will continue to make it an attractive region in which to sell cigarettes as traditional western markets shrink.It is also the world’s largest, unregulated tobacco market with virtually no control of advertising.A Mild, the leading Philip Morris brand, recently ran an advert on a billboard in downtown Jakarta with skateboarders on a half-pipe ramp and a banner headline that read: “Go Ahead!” This sort of ad appears to run counter to internal Philip Morris guidelines of not marketing tobacco products in a way that appeals to minors.The World Health Organisation estimates that roughly 400,000 deaths in Indonesia each year are due to smoking-related illnesses. The health minister has vowed to sign the United Nations convention on tobacco control this year.One of the big challenges facing tobacco companies will thus be preparing for a tightening of health and marketing regulations.Mr Gledhill, who has held key management positions across Philip Morris since 1983, said that, rather than fearing control, Philip Morris supports tougher health guidelines because loose rules “just open the doors to everyone to criticise Indonesia”.Like regulated markets across the globe, the key will be finding a correct balance, he said. “Tobacco is inherent in the culture and fabric of society here, whether we like it or not. It is a very, very large employer. It is a very large contributor to the state coffers and it [the industry] needs to be more responsible.”

The index made its largest leap for two weeks, with industrials, financials and consumer discretionary stocks leading the charge.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, continued his testimony to Congress. But his comments largely reflected topics covered on Wednesday and did not weigh on sentiment. Investors also downplayed data that showed US jobless claims rose more steeply than expected last week. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were up 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 464,000.There was some relief as existing house sales fell less than expected by a seasonally-adjusted 5.1 per cent in June. The S&P 500 housebuilders rose 3.4 per cent.Michael Yoshikiami, chief investment strategist at YCMNET, said: “When you see home sales numbers and jobless claims numbers that go beyond this earnings season, we can see that the next earnings season is going to be the one that’s very difficult.” He added that although companies were raising earnings projections, it was because their original forecasts were “unreasonably negative”.Among stocks in the news, AmeriCredit surged 21.4 per cent to $23.91 after General Motorsannounced it was buying the auto finance lender for $24.50 a share.

Its shares rose 5.2 per cent to $63.15. Demand for smartphones boosted earnings at AT&T, the largest US phone group and Qualcomm, which makes chips for mobile phones. AT&T reported better than expected profits. Earnings before some exceptional items were 61 cents per share, against average estimates of 57 cents. Its shares rose 2.4 per cent to $25.51.Shares in Qualcomm pushed up 8.2 per cent to $39.11 as it benefited from strong demand for smartphones based on Google’s Android technology which needs more complex, expensive chips.Earnings rose to 47 cents per share from 44 cents per share for the same period a year ago.

189;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-06-25T00:00:02Z;Adams to retire as BAT chief executive;;Paul Adams will retire next year after seven years as chief executive of British American Tobacco and will be succeeded by Nicandro Durante, the chief operating officer.“This is the right time to make a change, both for me and for the company,” said Mr Adams, who has worked at BAT since 1991.An Italian who grew up in Brazil, Mr Durante joined BAT in 1981 and will become chief executive designate on September 1 before taking over in 2011.In doing so, the 53-year-old will become the first non-British head of BAT, the world’s second-biggest publicly listed tobacco group after Philip Morris International.A respected figure in the industry, Mr Adams has, during his tenure, sustained growth at BAT by cutting costs, increasing sales in developing countries and shifting customers to higher-priced products.Having sat out the wave of consolidation that had swept the industry because it thought prices were too high, BAT did two deals in 2008.It snapped up Tekel Cigarette, the state-owned Turkish cigarette group, for $1.72bn and purchased Denmark-based Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni in a deal valued at £2.1bn.The strategy appeared to have paid off. Mr Adams has beaten BAT’s goal for high single-digit growth in earnings per share every year since taking over in 2004, while the share price has risen nearly threefold during this period, compared with the 70 per cent rise recorded by rival Imperial Tobacco.BAT said Mr Adams, 57, planned to spend time with his family after 36 years of work. He had no plans beyond travelling, but added that board appointments could not be ruled out.The smooth succession planning comes in contrast to the controversy the group courted when it appointed Richard Burrows, the former Bank of Ireland governor, as its new chairman last summer.The appointment came only months after Mr Burrows apologised to the bank’s investors for its poor performance.Mr Durante is not the only person to have risen through the ranks to take the top job at a tobacco company. Alison Cooper, who stepped up to become chief executive of Imperial Tobacco in May, had also served as chief operating officer before replacing Gareth Davis on his retirement.BAT shares fell 12½p to £21.41.
190;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-06-14T12:15:43Z;Tobacco reform pressures rise in Indonesia;;When a video of a chain-smoking Indonesian toddler hit the internet in Indonesia, it drew outrage over the poor regulation of cigarettes in south-east Asia’s largest democracy. Two-year-old Ardi Rizal, who started smoking when he was just 18-months-old, has since been placed under the supervision of social workers to cut back from two packs a day.The case, though an extreme one, vividly highlights the growing pressure on the Indonesian government to make reforms to the tobacco sector at a time when domestic and international cigarette makers are trying to tap into the country’s enormous growth potential.Children make up an increasing portion of new smokers in Indonesia. About 1.8 per cent of its 60m smokers are now aged five to nine-years-old, according to a recent national survey.Indonesia is already the third-largest tobacco consumer in the world after China and India. More than 60 per cent of men smoke and average households spend more on tobacco than education, milk, fish, eggs or meat. And, according to the World Health Organisation, at least 400,000 Indonesians die annually from smoking-related illnesses.Endang Rahayu Sedyaningsih, Indonesia’s new health minister, says protecting the nation’s 240m inhabitants from smoking will be a big focus during her five-year term, but she admits that changing tobacco’s deep cultural, economic and political roots pose a huge challenge.“It is one of my highest priorities,” Mrs Endang told the Financial Times in a recent interview. “I will feel very guilty if I don’t initiate that.”Government guidelines being drafted to protect women and children will ban billboards, require pictorial warnings on cigarette packs and make smoking illegal in public buildings, she says.Weak enforcement of existing laws enables children to purchase tobacco. Lawmakers puff at their desks during televised debates and cigarettes are handed out at concerts sponsored by tobacco companies.Mrs Endang says she aims to adopt the United Nations convention on tobacco control, which has been signed by 168 countries but not Indonesia, by the end of 2010.Such measures are likely to be carefully watched by domestic and international cigarette makers operating in the country.Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco have both acquired controlling stakes in two local companies in recent years, as part of a wider trend by cigarette makers of moving into emerging markets to offset shrinking western markets.Last year BAT took an 85 per cent stake in Bentoel Internasional Investama, Indonesia’s fourth-largest cigarette maker, for $494m.As well as offering conventional cigarettes, foreign operators have also sought to break into the highly popular market for kretek, clove-flavoured cigarettes, which are consumed by 90 per of Indonesian smokers.Philip Morris, which purchased 98 per cent of Sampoerna in 2005 for $4.8bn, is the market leader with a 29 per cent share. Its kretek brands – A Mild, Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna Kretek, as well as Marlboro, are among the country’s top 10 brands.Sampoerna says that after booking net profit of $555m in Indonesia in 2009, an increase of 30 per cent from 2008, it expects the tobacco industry to continue to grow, although it admits “the growth rate might slow down”.Sampoerna also says that is has repeatedly urged the Indonesian government “to adopt regulation to further restrict marketing and advertising and to adopt an enforceable minimum age law with regards to tobacco purchase …We recognise that our products, like all tobacco products, cause disease and are addictive. In our view, issues surrounding tobacco are best addressed through comprehensive and effective government legislation.”Indonesia’s religious groups have also weighed in on the debate. Leading Islamic group Muhammadiyah recently issued an edict against smoking, prompting a counter protest by 10,000 tobacco farmers who demanded government protection.Analysts say, however, that efforts to stem smoking are not expected to have a serious impact on growth. Volumes rose 5 per cent in 2009 and key players predict steady sales increases for years to come.Indonesian cigarettes remain among the cheapest in the world, even after a 15 per cent increase in excise taxes earlier this year.“There is consumption growth of 1 per cent [per year],” says Setio Yohan of Mandiri Securities. “The consumption won’t be affected by the quota or a ban on cigarette ads or the anti-smoking campaign, but by the hike of cigarette excise.”
191;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-05-10T15:37:34Z;Closer integration with the EU boosts growth;;"A line of cranes, towering 80 metres above the River Danube, incessantly swings loads of
concrete, steel and other equipment into position at Serbia’s most impressive construction site.The bridge steadily taking shape, stretching over 2.2 km of river and wetlands near Beska, 60km north of Belgrade, is to carry two lanes of motorway.It will form a vital section
of the European Union’s Corridor 10, linking Austria to Greece, with 800km traversing Serbia.The infrastructure upgrade, currently in progress at several sites along the route, represents investment of some €800m this year alone, financed in part by loans from international institutions, such as the World Bank.According to Slavko Caric, executive committee president of Erste Bank in Serbia, it is money well spent, and very different from the unsustainable growth in the middle of the past decade.“If you increase debt, the question should be not by how much, but how are you spending it. Between 2006 and 2008, the economy was fuelled by easy credit, used for consumption. It is now going back to fundamentals; these infrastructure investments use loans under favourable conditions for investment,” he says.Such projects also alleviate unemployment, which has officially reached almost 17 per cent (registered people claiming benefits) after the economy shrank 3 per cent last year in the wake of the global crisis.This, combined with a workforce participation rate of only 50 per cent (the ratio of the labour force to the working age population – the EU average in 2008 was 66 per cent) – has forced the government to give priority to sustainable growth.Judging by experiences of others on the road of transition, Serbia must attract foreign direct investment (FDI), says Vuk Djokovic, state secretary at the ministry of finance.“Our share of exports in GDP is only about 28 per cent, significantly lower than the central European countries, where FDI accounted for about two-thirds of growth in the 1995-2005 period,” Mr Djokovic argues.To this end, an ongoing series of reforms – dubbed the “guillotine” package – has sought to ease the administrative and tax burden on businesses, with some success.Miroslav Stojanovic, a partner with Wolf Theiss, an Austrian law firm with a practice in Belgrade, says: “I think Serbia has a very good tax regime for investors, and many new laws have been passed to improve and bring Serbia’s legal system in line with the EU.“For example, the Business Registration Agency has been set up to accelerate the registration process for companies. Now it takes days, whereas, before, it could take two months.”Efforts to attract investors resulted in some high-profile successes prior to 2008, most notably Telenor, the Norwegian telephone company, Philip Morris, the US tobacco company, and Stada, the German drug maker.True, the crisis stalled most new investment decisions, resulting in a “very bad” 2009, but interest this year has been picking up strongly, says Vesna Peric, director of the Serbia Investment and Export Promotion Agency.She proudly points to Yura, a South Korean auto parts maker, as one recent success.“We set them up with a factory within a month. It’s very labour-intensive; we are talking about 1,000 new jobs, in Kragujevac [central Serbia],” she says.Yura comes in the footsteps of Fiat, the Italian carmaker, which has allocated some €700m to establish a joint-venture with Zastava, the flagship auto company in former Yugoslavia.The influx of foreign investors has created more than just jobs, says James Thornley, partner with professional services firm KPMG in Serbia. “When big international investors such as Philip Morris and US Steel come in, they bring a change of attitude and business culture. They raise the game, and that’s important, because the country lost 300,000 of its best people because of [emigration during] the conflicts in the 1990s,” says Mr Thornley.Nonetheless, more remains to be done, and he fears weariness has set in, slowing reforms. Standby credit from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) worth $4bn over two years has bolstered confidence but the government continues to haggle over IMF demands for budget cuts.“They’ve done the easier things, but I think matters have become a bit bogged down. There’s a legacy that goes back to the socialist-statist era. To get through the bureaucracy here, you find yourself doing things that are not really natural to someone coming from western Europe,” says Mr Thornley.While the government predicts 2 per cent growth this year, Mr Thornley thinks the next two years will be tough.He is not alone. “Claims by government officials that the crisis has bottomed out are not well founded,” says Mladen Kovacevic, an economist, who believes the method for predicting GDP growth is flawed.He also has concerns about planned privatisations, notably the sale of a 40 per cent stake in Telekom Srbija, the incumbent telecommunications company.“I wonder if the state will get good value from these sales in the wake of the crisis. If the company is sold, and the proceeds go to defending an over-valued currency, or supporting [unsustainable] consumption, then that is very problematic,” Mr Kovacevic says."
192;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-04-29T18:30:17Z;Australia plans cigarette packet branding ban;;Canberra is waging a battle against the world’s biggest tobacco companies by announcing a series of measures to crack down on smoking, including new laws that will force cigarette companies to adopt plain packaging from 2012.Other countries, including the UK, are also considering plain packaging – which bans logos, colours and brand imagery – but Australia believes it will be the world’s first nation to have the changes enshrined in law.Kevin Rudd, Australia’s prime minister, said on Thursday that the government would also increase excise taxes on cigarettes by 25 per cent and announced restrictions on internet advertising for tobacco products. The government would also set aside A$28m ($25.9m) in funding for new anti-smoking campaigns, he said.The higher tax would provide an additional A$5bn over four years for health and hospital costs, he added.The crackdown has served to focus the political debate in Australia on healthcare, a key battleground ahead of elections due later this year, and comes only days after Canberra abandoned its proposal for a controversial emissions trading scheme until 2013 at the earliest.Australia’s move to plain packaging will be fiercely opposed by tobacco companies, which believe the change will lead to an increase in counterfeit products and lower government tax revenues.Tobacco companies will also be concerned that Australia’s moves will be adopted by other countries, since earlier anti-smoking measures such as indoor smoking bans, large pictorial health warnings and display bans in shops are now prevalent around the world.The Australian unit of British American Tobacco said it was examining legal avenues, including whether mandatory plain packaging violated international trade laws and treaties. It added that the changes could also rob the company of its intellectual property.“We are saying it’s not advertising,” said Louise Warburton, head of corporate communications for BAT’s Australian unit. “It is a navigation tool to help consumers decide which products they want to purchase and which cigarettes they want to smoke.”The group said: “Governments around the world, including Canada, NZ [New Zealand] and the UK have already looked very closely at this measure and have decided it wouldn’t work.”However, the UK as recently as February said it was considering a raft of proposals to cut smoking, including plain packaging.Canberra said the move to plain packaging removed “one of the last remaining frontiers for cigarette advertising”.A proposed package design with graphic health warnings would make cigarettes less appealing, particularly to young people, it said. Brand and product names will be allowed on cigarette packages but in a standard position, colour and font size.Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris International also oppose plain packaging.Analysts said BAT, the maker of Dunhill, Kent and Lucky Strike, has the biggest exposure to Australia, with 6 per cent of its operating profit coming from that market. It is followed by Imperial and PMI, which respectively generate 3 per cent and 1-2 per cent of their operating profit from the country.With 22.9bn cigarettes smoked in 2007, Australia is a relatively small market compared to China (2,162bn), Japan (258bn), Russia (331bn) and the US (357bn).The industry has successfully offset a drop in sales volume in many western markets by raising profits, but analysts say that plain packaging could go a long way to undermining the power of tobacco brands and accelerating moves towards cheaper and lower-margin cigarettes.“We view generic packaging as the biggest regulatory threat to the industry, as packaging is the most important way tobacco companies have to communicate with the consumer and differentiate their products,” said Adam Spielman, analyst at Citigroup.“Our worry is more about mix than volume. If branding were removed, we fear consumers will have less reason to buy premium brands – and premium is much more profitable than discount.”In the UK, PMI, BAT, Japan Tobacco and Imperial are taking legal action against Westminster’s attempt to ban the display of tobacco products in shops. Analysts also expect tobacco companies to challenge the move to impose plain packaging.“The industry will undoubtedly sue for compensation for loss of intellectual property, and the compensation potentially could run into billions,” said Mr Spielman.
193;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-04-26T22:45:40Z;Tobacco giants set for legal clash with Labour;;A showdown is looming between the government and the tobacco industry after the world’s four biggest cigarette makers said they would launch legal actions against Westminster’s latest attempt to restrict cigarette sales in the UK.Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco yesterday each separately said they were seeking a judicial review of the relevant sections of the Health Act 2009, under which the government is looking to impose a ban on the display of cigarettes and tobacco products in shops and supermarkets by October 2011.The so-called “display ban” – which would force shops to stock cigarettes under the counter, where they cannot be seen by consumers – has already been introduced in countries such as Canada, Iceland and Ireland. While the UK government believes the measure could be an effective way to combat the problem of teenage smoking, the scheme has outraged the tobacco industry and many small retailers, who argued that the move would only encourage the illicit trade and endanger the livelihood of tens of thousands of small businesses.Imperial, which controls 45 per cent of the UK cigarette market with brands such as Lambert & Butler, said there was no evidence to show that such a ban would cut smoking rates in the UK.“If this misguided legislation is implemented it will simply fuel the growth in the illicit trade of tobacco and create a huge cost burden for retailers who are already under considerable pressure as a result of the difficult economic climate,” said Gareth Davis, Imperial’s outgoing chief executive.JT, which following its acquisition of Gallaher in 2007, now controls 39 per cent of the UK cigarette market, called the regulations “unreasonable and disproportionate” and said it had no option but to start the legal process to challenge the ban.Elsewhere, PMI, maker of Malboro and Chesterfield cigarettes, said experience from Iceland and Canada showed that display bans “have caused significant damage to small retailers, stifled competition between manufacturers and have had no impact on smoking rates.”The display ban is part of a Europe-wide offensive on cigarettes, which in recent years has seen the introduction of smoking bans in bars and restaurants in countries.Alan Johnson, health secretary, said 200,000 children under 16 years of age started smoking each year in Britain and the risk of premature death for them was three times higher than for people who start in their 20s.
194;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Tobacco groups settle Canadian legal cases;;Three tobacco companies have agreed to pay a total of C$550m to the Canadian government and 10 provinces to settle allegations that they abetted cigarette smuggling across the US-Canada border in the 1980s and 1990s.The penalties, which bring an end to more than a decade of litigation, are among the heaviest paid by companies in Canada. Under the settlements, announced on Tuesday, North Carolina-based RJ Reynolds will pay C$325m (US$323m) and JTI-Macdonald, a Japan Tobacco subsidiary, C$150m.Northern Brands, a former RJR subsidiary that is no longer an operating company, has pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and agreed to pay a fine of C$75m to the Ontario provincial government.With tobacco taxes considerably higher in Canada than the US, smuggling has been a persistent problem for the authorities. Much of the traffic is routed through semi-autonomous aboriginal reserves that straddle the US border with Quebec and Ontario. Quebec has estimated that at its peak contraband accounted for almost 60 per cent of cigarette consumption in the province.JTI-Macdonald was controlled by RJR until its acquisition by Japan Tobacco in 1999. RJR no longer does business directly in Canada. It promised, as part of the settlement, that if it returned, it would adopt “packaging, marking and other measures” that would help combat tobacco smuggling.JTI-Macdonald has agreed to expand internal controls on the manufacture, distribution and storage of cigarettes and to facilitate investigations into suspicious transactions.Similar allegations were settled in 2008 against Imperial Tobacco, a unit of British American Tobacco, and Rothmans Benson & Hedges, partly owned by Philip Morris.JTI-Macdonald described the settlement as “an important milestone for the company and its employees, securing a stable commercial and regulatory environment in which to do business for the future”.The company was forced to seek protection from creditors six years ago after the Quebec government demanded payment of C$1.4bn in excise taxes relating to charges of cigarette smuggling.JTI-Macdonald and eight former executives had been charged with fraud and conspiracy the previous year, based on claims they supplied the Canadian black market in the early ‘90s with large quantities of cigarettes from the US and the Caribbean without paying Canadian taxes.
195;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-04-08T21:15:33Z;India curbs foreign tobacco companies;;India has banned foreign direct investment in the manufacture of tobacco products after the government agreed to impose more restrictions on one of its largest industries on Thursday.In a decision that will frustrate the ambitions of foreign cigarette and cigar makers to expand in India, the cabinet committee on economic affairs has approved a proposal to forbid fresh foreign direct investment in the industry.Faced with falling cigarette sales in many developed markets as a result of health concerns, smoking bans, higher taxes and advertising restrictions, international tobacco companies such as Japan Tobacco, British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International have sought to increase sales in emerging markets to offset such declines.With 108bn sticks consumed annually, India is the world’s eighth-largest cigarette market. It is also one of the fastest growing, with the branded cigarette market growing at about 10 per cent a year.Yet despite the prize at hand, doing business in India has never been a straightforward affair for foreign tobacco majors.Although India liberalised investment in its tobacco sector in 1998, the rules allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment in cigarette-making, provided the manufacturer obtained an industrial licence and approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, an agency of the commerce ministry.Thursday’s policy change, which bars fresh foreign investment, was in line with a decision not to grant industrial licences for cigarette manufacturing, the government said.JT, the world’s third-largest cigarette-maker, has, for example, been seeking government approval to expand its production in India for two years.Instead, foreign groups have had to gain exposure to the fast-growing Indian market through holdings in local producers. BAT has a 32 per cent stake in Kolkata-based ITC, while JT controls half of Japan Tobacco India and PMI owns a minority stake in Mumbai-based Godfrey Phillips.On Thursday, Palaniappan Chidambaram, the home minister and member of the committee, said the restrictions were part of the government’s strategy to curb smoking across the country.However, some local tobacco producers have campaigned against foreign tobacco companies. Tobacco groups in Andhra Pradesh, one of the main growing areas, have lobbied Sonia Gandhi, president of the ruling Congress party, to impose curbs on foreign investment to help local companies compete.India is the world’s third-largest tobacco producer with a yearly output of 725m kilogrammes. It ranks as the sixth-largest exporter after Brazil, China, the US, Malawi and Italy.Domestic producers had also applied pressure on the government to prevent foreign companies from setting up subsidiaries to sell their own brands in India.PMI said the measure would not affect its current business in India, but questioned the logic of the ban.“It’s a protectionist measure that unfairly discriminates against foreign investors, basically,” said the company. “The public health argument does make you wonder. People are going to smoke whether the cigarettes are made by a local or a foreign company.”
196;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-03-12T14:36:41Z;Romania cracks down on tobacco smugglers;;Ten people forming an orderly queue in front of a man who does not at first sight appear to be selling anything have attracted the attention of a policeman at Obor, one of Bucharest’s busiest marketplaces.As the officer approaches, the man melts into the crowd. “I wish he hadn’t turned up. I really wanted to buy those cheap cigarettes,” says a disgruntled engineer in the queue.Following recent tax rises, sales of contraband tobacco products have soared in Romania, the second largest smoking market in central east europe, after Poland.Smuggled cigarettes accounted for 36 per cent of the €2.89bn market in the first two months of this year, according Novel Research, a research company.Austin Rowan, head of the cigarettes task group at the European Anti-Fraud Office, says the unit is monitoring the situation in Romania “very carefully”.Since the beginning of this year, authorities have confiscated a record 42m cigarettes, double the amount seized during the same period in 2008.The finance ministry and the interior ministry are working on a three-year national strategy to reduce illegal cigarette traffic. Draft legislation, due within weeks, could include more legal powers to confiscate smugglers’ assets and handing some of the judges’ investigative powers to customs, according to Dorel Fronea, deputy director of Romania’s border surveillance division of the customs service.Last month the authorities banned tobacco trading in duty-free shops, which they said made up about 30 per cent of illegal sales. “I am positive the level of cigarette smuggling will be a maximum of 20 per cent this year. We see it as our top priority,” says Mr Fronea.Cigarette taxes were raised three times last year, from €50 per thousand cigarettes in April, to €74, prompting anger among tobacco companies. “We need fiscal predictability. The authorities didn’t respect the agreed calendar, which included an excise increase of only up to €64,” said Gilda Lazar, corporate affairs manager with Japan Tobacco International Romania.They also say increasing excise duties merely encourages the illicit trade by making legal products more expensive. Smokers prepared to seek out black marketeers in Obor can get a packet of 20 Kent for 6 lei (€1.4), compared with the official price of 10 lei.Romania’s three main tobacco producers JTI, British American Tobacco and Philip Morris, say sales have fallen more than 40 per cent in a year as smokers switch to illegal imports from lower-tax countries such as Ukraine, Serbia and the Republic of Moldova. Countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have had similar experiences since they raised tobacco duties according to cigarette companies.The three companies, which employ more than 3,000 people in Romania, say jobs are at risk. Philip Morris closed its Romanian factory for two weeks last month. “The level of smuggling in January was dramatic,” says Andrei Vasilescu, corporate affairs director for Romania and Bulgaria. “Unless urgent measures are taken by the authorities, we may be forced to take more drastic measures, such as ceasing production.”The rising price of cigarettes is having an effect on inflation. About 1.7 per cent of last year’s 4.74 per cent inflation rate was due to tobacco products, according to the Central Bank.But Mr Fronea says there has been an upside: the authorities cashed 55 per cent more in cigarette excises in January than the same month last year.
197;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-02-25T22:52:55Z;BAT benefits from increased cigarette prices;Sales of three out of BAT’s four core brands grew;Raising prices in spite of the recession buoyed profits at British American Tobacco, which makes Dunhill, Kent and Lucky Strike cigarettes.Revenue for the year to December 31 rose 17 per cent to £14.2bn, boosted by acquisitions and favourable foreign exchange movements as well as higher cigarette prices. Pre-tax profit rose almost 11 per cent to £4.08bn,Like-for-like volumes fell 3 per cent, but this was outweighed by rising prices for most of BAT’s brands in most countries.Paul Adams, chief executive, said: “We do think the worst is over in terms of declining industry volumes and downtrading. ”Sales of three out of BAT’s four core brands grew, but Kent, the company’s premium brand, suffered a 4 per cent drop in sales.Diluted earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 136.3p and the total dividend rises 19 per cent to 99.5p after a final of 71.6p (61.6p).Rival Philip Morris International announced this month that it would return more than $12bn (£7.9bn) to shareholders via a buy-back. But BAT said its share buy-back programme would remain suspended.“We’ve given more money to shareholders in dividends this year than in dividends and a share buy-back last year,” said Ben Stevens, finance director. “We’re not indicating that there’s a big acquisition out there, we’re just committed to maintaining our triple B-plus credit rating.”Mr Stevens said that if BAT was to make acquisitions they would be in North Africa and Asia.BAT, which is the world’s second-largest listed tobacco company, said it was on track to achieve its target operating margin of 34 per cent by 2012. This year, it saved £239m of its £800m cost-saving target for 2008-12.The shares fell 51p to close at £21.80.Profits should continue to rise in 2010 as the company has shown putting up the price of a pack of cigarettes does little to deter ardent smokers. BAT’s policy of paying 65 per cent of adjusted earnings per share in dividends, plus a potential resumption of the share buy-back programme, can only mean the shares will continue to be nice little earners. Trading on a forward p/e ratio of 13 times, based on 2010 pre-tax profit forecasts of £4.8bn, the shares may at first appear expensive. But as the global economy revives, BAT’s exposure to emerging markets and its portfolio of premium brands could push profits even higher.
198;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-02-25T19:06:02Z;Tan changes his style for cigarette deal;;It is not difficult to see the business sense behind Thursday’s agreement between Philip Morris International and Filipino businessman Lucio Tan to combine their cigarette businesses in the Philippines.Between them the two companies will hold 90 per cent of the local tobacco market – a business that was last year worth about 78.9bn pesos ($1.7bn). Philip Morris is strong in the premium end of the market with brands such as Marlboro, while Mr Tan’s Fortune Tobacco dominates the low and mid-priced segments.For Philip Morris, the deal with Fortune Tobacco eliminates the pressures of rivalry with a big local operator at a time when the number of smokers in western markets is declining.Analysts say the deal will give Philip Morris leverage to fend off hostile legislation that could hamper the growth of the cigarette market in the Philippines – one of the least-regulated and least-taxed cigarette markets in Asia.In spite of several increases in excise taxes on cigarettes since the mid-1990s, the proportion of tobacco taxes to retail selling price has been steadily falling.Limits on tobacco marketing and advertising in the Philippines are also not as tough or as strictly enforced as compared with some other countries. Cigarette packs in the Philippines do not carry graphic health warnings.The market logic may be compelling for both groups, but the deal has come as a surprise for Mr Tan’s associates.They say that to enter into equity joint ventures with a strategic partner does not seem to fit the style of the 75-year tycoon who during the last five decades has built many of his businesses from the ground up.“He has had licensing agreements with foreign companies – but has never got into equity partnerships, especially where he does not own a controlling stake,” said an executive of Basic Holdings, one of Mr Tan’s holding companies. Mr Tan – who according to Forbes is now the second richest man in the Philippines with a net worth of $1.7bn – has built an empire that includes more than 100 businesses. As well as running the Philippines’ biggest cigarette company, Mr Tan owns its largest airline, some of the biggest banks, and one of south-east Asia’s biggest pig farms.The deal with Philip Morris, however, represents an important change in operating style for a man who usually likes to stay in total control.Philip Morris and Fortune Tobacco will have equal equity stakes in a new company. The deal gives Philip Morris responsibility to run combined operations of the two companies. Mr Tan will be chairman of the board but the president will come from Philip Morris.The deal could allow Mr Tan to leave his flagship company in able hands, defusing a potentially divisive succession issue. Last year, a rift prompted a younger brother, Mariano, to turn against Mr Tan, offering to give evidence in a government case against the businessman.“It reflects a possible strategic move to ensure long-term stability of his [business] empire because he knows his kids and siblings may not be as good as he is in running businesses,” says Wilson Lee Flores, a business commentator.
199;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-02-25T09:20:02Z;Philip Morris in tie-up with Filipino tycoon;;Philip Morris International yesterday unveiled a joint venture in the Philippines that will see it team up with Fortune Tobacco, a local cigarette maker owned by tycoon Lucio Tan, to create a company that will control 90 per cent of the domestic cigarette market.The newly formed PMFTC is expected to build on the two companies’ dominant positions in various segments of the Philippine cigarette market, which had an estimated volume of 85bn sticks last year, making it the world’s 12th biggest. Tobacco consumption in the Philippines was estimated to be worth 78.9bn pesos ($1.7bn) in 2009, according to the government’s statistics agency.The tie-up comes as other western tobacco groups seek to boost their presence in emerging markets, to counter a fall in smoker numbers in more developed markets as a result of tighter regulation, smoking bans and health concerns.Last year British American Tobacco bought a majority stake in Bentoel Internasional Investama, Indonesia’s fourth-largest cigarette maker, for $494m. Morris already has a big presence in Indonesia, mainly through its Sampoerna unit, which it bought for $5bn in 2005.The joint venture between Morris and Fortune operations will not only give the two almost total control of the local market but could also boost their ability to lobby against moves to increase taxes on cigarettes and adopt tougher rules on tobacco marketing and advertising.The Philippines imposes one of the lowest taxes on cigarettes in Asia and has yet to adopt tough tobacco control laws.Morris’s Philippines unit, which has a market share of 30 per cent, dominates the high-end segment of the market with brands such as Marlboro and Morris.Fortune, with a 60 per cent market share, leads in the medium and low-priced segments of the market.Mr Tan, majority owner of Fortune, is the second-richest man in the Philippines and has a vast business network.“By combining [Fortune’s] sales and distribution expertise with [Morris’] manufacturing and marketing capabilities, we are ensuring our continued success in this important cigarette market,” said Matteo Pellegrini, president of Morris in the region.The companies will contribute selected assets and liabilities into the venture, which is expected to eventually integrate production, marketing and distribution of their leading brands.Chris Nelson, Morris’s country manager, said the two companies would have equal equity stakes in the venture but refused to disclose its value.
200;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-02-12T01:53:43Z;Philip Morris to buy back $12bn shares;;Philip Morris International, the world’s largest listed tobacco company, will return more than $12bn (£7.7bn, €8.8bn) to shareholders over the next three years through a new share buy-back programme in the clearest sign yet of its confidence that the downtrading seen in some of its key markets and the effects of adverse currency movements are abating.The planned buy-back, which will begin in May, comes after the maker of Marlboro, Parliament and Virginia Slim cigarettes spent $11bn buying back shares over the past two years and follows a spate of share repurchases announced by companies such as Munich Re, the Royal Bank of Canada and IBM late last year.“The fragility of the economic recovery, particularly with regard to employment levels and currency volatility, naturally warrants a cautious outlook for 2010,” said Louis Camilleri, chief executive and chairman.“However, we enjoy solid momentum and remain confident that we will again post strong financial results this year. Our new $12bn, three-year share repurchase program underscores our optimism going forward.”Having spun off from Altria in 2008, PMI, which is based in Lausanne but is listed in New York, now generates all of its sales outside the the US. During the first three quarters of 2009, the group has seen earnings come under pressure as recession-hit smokers traded down to cheaper brands while the sharp rise of the US dollar eroded profits made in other currencies.But these pressures appeared to be easing, with PMI on Thursday reporting better-than-expected fourth quarter, helped by better pricing.For the three months to December 31, net earnings was $1.5bn, or 80 cents a share, compared with $1.4bn, or 71 cents a share a year earlier and the 79 cents a share expected by analysts.Still, net revenues for the full-year fell 2.6 per cent to $25bn as a result of currency headwinds. Net earnings was $6.3bn, or $3.25 a share, compared to $6.9bn, or $3.32 a share, the year before.The economic crisis in Spain and the weaknesses for premium-brand cigarettes in Russia, the world’s third largest cigarette market after China and the US, dented sales of PMI’s flagship Marlboro brand, which fall 2.8 per cent to 302bn units during the year – although Mr Camilleri believes the worst is over.Since its demerger, PMI has wasted little time hitting the acquisition trail, which include the $452m purchase of Colombian cigarette maker Protabaco and the C$2bn purchase of Canada’s Rothmans. On Thursday Mr Camilleri said the share buy-back programme will not affect the group’s ability to continue making acquisitions.“We have a list of projects we pursue…If a significant acquisition was to come about, we believe we can pursue it.”Shares in PMI gained 4 per cent to $48.72, giving it a market capitalisation of $92.8bn.
201;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2010-01-19T19:44:18Z;Norway fund shuns tobacco companies;;Norway has dropped 17 tobacco companies, including Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, from its sovereign wealth fund, adding to a growing list of stocks blacklisted by Europe’s biggest equity investor.Imperial Tobacco, Altria, Reynolds American and Japan Tobacco were among others barred from the $455bn fund – which owns more than 1 per cent of all global stocks – after the Norwegian finance ministry ruled that the companies were in breach of the fund’s ethical guidelines.The tobacco companies join a list of about 50 stocks excluded from the Norwegian fund on ethical grounds, ranging from arms manufacturers, such as Boeing and BAE Systems, to companies accused of environmental and labour rights violations, including Rio Tinto and Wal-Mart.Norway has sought to make its sovereign wealth fund a role model for socially responsible investment since introducing ethical guidelines in 2003. Tobacco companies initially escaped exclusion but Sigbjørn Johnsen, finance minister, on Tuesday said it was time for them to be removed.“It is important that the ethical guidelines reflect at all times what can be considered to be commonly held values of the owners of the fund,” he said.The fund, in which Norway invests its oil wealth for future generations, is the world’s second-largest sovereign wealth fund after that of the United Arab Emirates.According to Reuters calculations, the fund’s holdings in the 17 excluded tobacco companies were worth NKr14.6bn ($2.6bn) at the end of 2008. Its stakes included 1.3 per cent of British American Tobacco, 0.5 per cent of Philip Morris International and 1.3 per cent of Imperial Tobacco.The finance ministry said all stocks had been sold in advance of Tuesday’s announcement. It added that other companies connected with the industry could be excluded in future.The fund has a Council of Ethics that recommends stocks for removal, with the final decision made by the finance ministry.Norway stirred controversy last September by excluding Elbit Systems, an Israeli company that supplies the surveillance system for the “separation barrier” under construction by Israel in the West Bank.Other blacklisted companies include Honeywell and Northrop Grumman for their role in making nuclear weapons and EADS, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon for production of cluster munitions.
202;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-12-22T16:32:05Z;Japan Tobacco reacts angrily to tax rise;;Japan Tobacco on Tuesday attacked the government’s Y3.5 per cigarette tobacco tax increase, warning it would be “forced to raise its product prices,” by more than the tax rise.“It is regrettable that the government has reached such a decision, as JT has strongly requested that a balanced and rational debate on the tobacco excise be conducted,” the group said in a statement.“The effects of such an unprecedented excise increase on consumers and the industry in this difficult environment [are] immeasurable,” JT said.The tax on tobacco has never been increased by more than Y1 per cigarette, Japan’s largest tobacco company said.The higher tax, part of the government’s package or tax reforms approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday, will come into effect on October 1, 2010.The government also indicated it could relax or abolish a law requiring JT to buy domestically grown tobacco leaves, which are substantially more expensive than the global norm and would review its ownership of more than 50 per cent of JT.Investors reacted more positively than JT to the news, sending JT shares up by 5 per cent on Tuesday to Y308,000 in active trading.The tax increase was less drastic than feared, said Keiko Yamaguchi, analyst at Nomura in Tokyo.In 2008, under the opposition Liberal Democratic Party-led government, parliamentarians studied the possibility of raising the price of a pack of cigarettes from the current Y300 ($3.27) to Y1,000 ($11).If cigarette companies are able to raise prices sufficiently, “it will put an end to the trend of falling profits,” Ms Yamaguchi said.JT said it would review its prices, “taking into account the future of the market and the state of the economy.”However, in an unusual move, the government’s tax council said on Tuesday that the overall price increase for cigarettes, including the tax rise, would be about Y5.This suggests JT and other cigarette companies, including BAT and Philip Morris, will have limited room to raise their prices much more than Y1.5 per cigarette, said Yoshiyasu Okihira, analyst at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.Mr Okihira thinks the tax rise will lead to a drop in sales of about 16 per cent and, considering that cigarette sales are falling about 4 per cent each year, even without the tax rise, “it is not clear whether the Y1.5 increase will be enough to cover the drop in sales,” he said.The Japanese market, about 26m smokers, or 25 per cent of those over 20, was the fourth largest in the world in 2007, according to data published by ERC Group. But cigarette sales have been falling about 4 per cent each year, even without a tax increase.
203;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Weak Marlboro sales hit Philip Morris earnings;;Falling Marlboro sales and the continued strength of the US dollar have resulted in a 14 per cent decline in third-quarter earnings at Philip Morris International.The group, which was spun off from Altria last year and generates all of its sales outside the the US, said net earnings for the three months to end of September was $1.8bn, or 93 cents a share, down from $2.1bn, or $1.01, the year before.The weak economy and ever increasing excise taxes in many European markets have continued to put pressure on sales of its flagship premium Marlboro brand, which fell 4.3 per cent to 76.9bn units during the quarter.The is the third consecutive quarterly decline suffered by Marlboro and underscores how cash-strapped smokers are turning their back on higher priced cigarettes as the recession bites.Overall cigarette volumes – which include gains from acquisitions – were down 2.9 per cent to 219.3bn units, with other brands such as Chesterfield and L&M down 15.1 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively.While PMI has been able to mitigate the volume decline with price increases, revenue for the quarter still suffered a 5.3 per cent decline to $6.6bn as a stronger dollar shrunk profit earned in other currencies.Excluding the effects of unfavourable exchange rates, revenue grew 6.9 per cent while earnings per share rose 18.3 per cent.“The third quarter underscored our proven ability to deliver excellent results and improve our operating margins,” said Louis Camilleri, chief executive.“While we experienced lower organic volume in the quarter, this was largely anticipated given our pricing actions and the on-going impact of the economic crisis on total consumption levels, notably in Spain and Ukraine. Our year-to-date volume decline of 2.1 per cent better reflects our estimated full-year organic volume performance.”The earnings decline was less than analysts were expecting. The group, which in February sharply lower its profit guidance for 2009 on the back of currency headwinds, also raised its forecast for full-year earnings on signs that the foreign-currency impact might be lessening.The group is now expecting earnings per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.25. While this compares favourably to the $3.10 to $3.20 it guided the market towards earlier this year, it is still below the $3.32 acheived in 2008.Shares in the PMI, the world’s largest listed tobacco group, fell $1.36, or 2.7 per cent, to $49.46, giving it a market capitalisation of $95.7bn.

But he added: “Given the consolidation in the tobacco industry and given the size [of Swedish Match] you wouldn’t rule it out.” Swedish Match declined to comment.In the wider market, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 lost 0.6 per cent on Friday after reaching fresh highs for the year on Wednesday and Thursday.

205;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Woman in the News: Irene Rosenfeld;;"When Irene Rosenfeld goes out on her Rollerblades, the 56-year-old chief executive of Kraft Foods does not hold back. “You don’t want to get in her way,” says one person who has witnessed the in-line skating skills of the woman who this week unveiled a £10.2bn ($17bn, €11.7bn) approach for Cadbury, the British confectioner.Ms Rosenfeld clearly likes to move quickly. When she took over at the helm of Kraft in June 2006, she embarked upon what she described as a “rewiring” of the venerable food company, whose middle-of-the-road brands range from Oreos biscuits to Jell-O desserts and Kraft cheese slices.Within two months, she had removed half the top executive team. After nine, Kraft made a successful $7.2bn bid for the biscuit business of France’s Danone, and then sold off Kraft’s cereal business for $1.7bn. In an interview with Forbes magazine this year, she described patience as her “most challenged virtue”. This week she returned to the theme. “I have been repeatedly asked: ‘Why now?” she said of the approach to Cadbury. “The answer is simple: Why wait?”“She is very decisive,” says James Kilts, a Kraft veteran who left to lead Nabisco and Gillette through successful turnrounds. “What makes her so effective is that she understands all aspects of the business: consumers, customers, competition, the manufacturers and the technology,” he says. “She is not one-dimensional.”Ms Rosenfeld displayed her varied dimensions at a very young age. In speeches on leadership themes, she tells audiences that she is still proud of her first public role as treasurer of her local Brownie patrol in Westbury on New York’s Long Island, where she claims to have been a “diligent” collector of dues.At high school she continued to outperform, becoming president of the student council, delivering strong academic results and playing on “a dozen” sports teams. Her enthusiasm for sport shaped her decision to choose Cornell University, which has strong women’s athletic programmes. She describes her high school sports teacher, Joan Case, as one of her most important influences. (Ms Case went on to become the first female administrator in New York state’s then male-dominated school sports system.) Ms Rosenfeld describes Martina Navratilova, the tennis star, as a “tremendous inspiration”.At Cornell, Ms Rosenfeld completed an undergraduate degree in psychology, followed by a masters in business administration and a PhD in marketing and statistics. After a spell in advertising, she began her food industry career in 1981 at General Foods – later combined with Kraft after both companies were bought by Philip Morris in the 1980s. Her research work at Cornell, on consumer behaviour, shaped her approach to an industry that at the time seemed to focus more on itself than on its customers.“She believes in understanding consumers, she loves consumers, she has tremendous consumer insights,” says Mr Kilts, who met Ms Rosenfeld in the 1980s when he was a product category manager and she was working in her first job in consumer research. After seeing her presentation – which he described as “disciplined, analytical, fact-based” – he had her promoted to his own team “and she rose through the ranks”.In 2000 Ms Rosenfeld, now married and with her own two girls, led the team overseeing Kraft’s integration of its Nabisco purchase. She was also involved in plans by Philip Morris to spin off the food company as an independent entity. Her steady progress hit a speed bump in December 2003, when Roger Deromedi was named as chief executive of Kraft. She subsequently left to head PepsiCo’s FritoLay.But Mr Deromedi faltered and, less than two years later, she was back at Kraft as chief executive, now describing herself “as an insider with an outsider’s perspective”. Her mission was to revitalise the tired brands of a company that she said, with characteristic candour, “had lost its heart and soul” amid waves of cost-cutting that had affected quality. This had even led to a reduction in the cheese content of its famous Macaroni & Cheese packaged dinners – a move quickly reversed.She urged innovation and decentralised decision-making, giving more power to brand general managers and going outside the company for new executive talent to drive its increasingly global business. Five out of the 10 other members of the executive committee now came from outside the company, including Sanjay Khosla, the Indian-born head of its developing markets and global product categories; Mike Clarke, the South African head of Kraft in Europe who joined the company from Coca-Cola this year; and Tony Vernon, a former Johnson & Johnson executive, who took over the core North American business last month.New lines such as Oreo’s Cakesters – a soft cake version of the chocolate and cream cookie – or “live active” versions of Kraft cheese, have helped boost sales, as has increased demand for Kraft’s affordable basics. The company has a new, multi-coloured flower logo, instead of the old red, white and blue badge.In person, Ms Rosenfeld is direct and forthright, a ready listener whose apparent lack of interest in small-talk is offset by a readiness to laugh that is not immediately obvious. Colleagues say that at work she is approachable and accessible, having had the security lock on the main executive suite door removed soon after she arrived.“She will tell you when she is happy with something, and when she is not happy,” says one person who has worked with her. “With Irene it is like she says: what you see is what you get.”Given her evident determination, Ms Rosenfeld is unlikely to be put off by Cadbury’s rejection of Kraft’s initial cash and shares proposal – or by suggestions of a potential culture clash between a US corporate giant and Cadbury’s “British” history and culture. Similar comments came from France after the deal for Danone’s biscuit unit, maker of the LU Petit Ecolier and other “iconic” French biscuits.“If you look at the results of our LU integration, it has been quite seamless,” she said this week. “And that is essentially the playbook we are looking at here.”"
206;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-09-07T20:33:54Z;Kraft looks beyond the US cupboard;;From Ritz crackers to Jell-O deserts, and Oreo cookies to Maxwell House coffee, Kraft’s top packaged food brands may be more American than apple pie. They are found in more than 99 per cent of US households.With annual sales of more than $40bn (£25bn), Kraft has grown to be the largest US food company – globally, second only to Switzerland’s Nestlé – since Joseph Kraft first opened his wholesale cheese business in Chicago in 1903.But its £10.2bn ($16.7bn) proposal to Cadbury, already rejected by the UK group, reflects the company’s need to find growth it cannot easily deliver in a saturated North American market that accounts for about 60 per cent of its sales.Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive of Kraft, signalled her intention of looking internationally for growth – particularly in emerging markets – with the $7.2bn acquisition of the global biscuit business of France’s Danone, carried out shortly after Kraft was fully spun off in 2007 by its former owners, Philip Morris (now Altria).Since then, Kraft has completed both a restructuring of its business and a drive to revitalise its core brands with new product innovation and marketing efforts. Ms Rosenfeld said the company believed the time was now right for the Cadbury approach.The Cadbury chocolate business would fit with Kraft’s existing Milka and Toblerone businesses, acquired in 1990, as Danone’s LU biscuits was seen as a fit with Kraft’s Nabisco and Oreo brands.The combined brands would also benefit from improved global distribution, with Kraft’s strengths in Brazil, Russia and China complementing Cadbury’s distribution in India and Mexico. About a third of Cadbury’s sales come from developing markets.The deal would give the combined business the scale to compete more effectively with Mars of the US, strengthened by last year’s $23bn acquisition of Wrigley, the gum maker, giving each about 15 per cent of the global sweet market. Kraft would also acquire Cadbury’s gum business, which should benefit from stronger global distribution.Ms Rosenfeld suggested that uniting the two companies’ brands could create new opportunities by, for instance, combining Cadbury’s chocolate brands with the LU biscuit business it bought from Danone in 2007.While the strategic logic is evident, it is much less clear how Kraft might be able to inject more cash into what it would be prepared to offer for Cadbury.The Danone deal has left the US group with a comparatively high level of gross debt, about $20bn compared with its market capitalisation of about $42bn.A person close to the potential deal stressed that Kraft had been contemplating the bid proposal for some time, and had chosen to wait until global financial markets had become more stable.The person also argued that the current stock and cash deal could be financed without the need for any divestitures by Kraft, insisting that the move was aimed at overall growth, rather than a “grow and prune” strategy.Analysts in the US have suggested Kraft could consider selling its meats or cheese businesses, which include the Oscar Meyer and Philadelphia brands.The source also said Kraft had already been approached by several banks about potential financing, which he argued could be carried out without any threat to its existing credit rating.
207;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
208;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-07-23T21:08:51Z;Marlboro cigarette sales fall again;;Philip Morris International has offered the strongest sign yet that global demand for premium cigarettes is on the wane after Marlboro sales fell for a second quarter in a row.The world’s largest listed tobacco company said on Thursday that total shipments of its flagship brand fell 1.1 per cent to 78.3bn units for the three months to the end of June, as recession-hit smokers traded down to cheaper brands.In Russia, a key PMI market, the decline was particularly acute. Sales of premium brands there fell 12.3 per cent, with Marlboro and Parliament down 19.1 per cent and 4.3 per cent respectively.In spite of the softening in the premium segment of the market, Hermann Waldemer, chief financial officer, said the group had no plans for a replay of its “Marlboro Friday” price slash in 1993, when it cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes by almost 20 per cent.“That would be the wrong thing to do,” he told the Financial Times.Any volume weakness was being offset by price increases, he said, a view many analysts share.In recent years, tobacco companies have sought to offset declining sales in mature western markets by shifting customers, notably in emerging economies such as Russia, to more expensive brands.But this trend appears to be ending with the recession and analysts are expecting more smokers to trade down to non-premium cigarettes this year as unemployment increases.The sector’s number two, British American Tobacco, in May reported a slowdown in sales growth for some of its top brands in the first quarter of the year.By contrast, Imperial Tobacco, whose business is more geared towards the less expensive segment of the market, is seeing a sharp rise in the sale of loose tobacco for rolling cigarettes.In spite the weakness reported in the premium market, PMI raised its 2009 earnings forecast to a range of $3.10 to $3.20 a share from $2.85-$3.00, citing reduced concerns over currency exchange rates.For the quarter, profit fell to $1.55bn, or 79 cents a share, from $1.69bn, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier, hurt by the stronger dollar, although earnings beat expectations.A stronger dollar reduces the value of sales outside the US, and all of PMI’s sales come from outside the country.Adam Spielman, analyst at Citigroup, said the results showed that PMI could use price increases to generate “smoother” earnings growth that than most other large caps.
209;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-07-06T21:14:07Z;Wall St defensive stocks provide support;;Defensive stocks spurred a late rally on Wall Street to turn US equities positive on Monday following the previous session’s heavy falls.Multinational brand names fared well as investors remained in a cautious mode ahead of the start of earnings season this week.Philip Morris gained 2.8 per cent to $44.15 and Colgate-Palmolive picked up 3.2 per cent to $74.38.But energy and materials stocks were a significant drag as investors continued to worry about the pace of economic recovery.Those concerns triggered a fall on Thursday ahead of the long independence day weekend after a worse than expected jobs report, and were further heightened by words from Joe Biden, the US vice-president, over the weekend.Mr Biden said the Obama administration had “misread” how bad the economy was when forecasting 8 per cent unemployment, which took a further toll on commodities stocks as investors worried about demand.The price of oil tumbled to a five-week low, weighing on ConocoPhillips, which lost 0.3 per cent to $40.83, and Schlumberger, which fell 2.1 per cent to $51.45.Metal producers also suffered and, with Deutsche Bank warning that demand for copper could fall 3.9 per cent in 2009, shares in Freeport McMoRan, which mines the metal, gave up 7.6 per cent to $45.94.Alcoa the aluminium maker that is due to start the earnings season on Wednesday, dropped 6.1 per cent to $9.26.“We could see a defensive rotation here as investors wait cautiously for the start of earnings season,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished 0.3 per cent higher at 898.72 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 8,324.87. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.5 per cent to 1,787.40.Many big name banks were also lower with Citigroup down 3.1 per cent at $2.79 and Bank of America3.9 per cent lower at $12.15.The financial sector was near its lowest level since the results of the government’s stress tests on bank balance sheets sparked a rally in May.American Express was one of the few financial stocks to find significant gains after Stifel Nicolaus, the brokerage group, said it may benefit from new legislation restricting teaser rates, which analysts said AmEx did not rely on.AmEx’s shares picked up 5.6 per cent to $23.52.The economic negativity was punctuated by promising signs from Ford and FedEx two companies that provide early signs on consumer and corporate health.Ford’s shares lost early gains after sales at the company’s joint ventures in China rose 14 per cent to record highs. They closed 2.4 per cent lower at $5.75.Meanwhile, Michael Ducker, head of FedEx’s international business, told a German magazine that he saw signs of a turnround in the second half of the year. Shares in FedEx were up 3.2 per cent to $56.04.Data from the Institute of Supply Management also provided a glimmer of economic hope, showing that business activity in the non-manufacturing sector was marginally better than expected in June.But analysts warned economic data would need to show more positive signs to trigger another rally.“For the market to continue to rally, the news will have to go from negative to neutral or positive, and investors have started to realise that,” said Matt King, chief investment strategist at Bell Investment Advisers.EMC provided some impetus to the technology sector after the company said it would increase its offer for data storage company Data Domain to $33.50 a share.This puts EMC in a head-to-head battle with NetApp, Data Domain’s rival, which received regulatory clearance for its own bid for the company.EMC picked up 0.9 per cent to $12.89 while NetApp was 0.6 per cent lower at $18.85. Data Domain rose 2.6 per cent to $34.06.In the telecommunications sector, Sprint Nextel rose as analysts at Auriga upgraded the stock, citing continued demand for the company’s Boost pre-paid mobile telephone contracts, which have sold well during the recession.Its shares gained 3.5 per cent to $4.47.
210;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-07-02T21:16:05Z;Philip Morris in South African deal;;Philip Morris International, the world’s largest listed tobacco company, extended its push into smokeless tobacco products on Thursday with a deal to buy Swedish Match’s South African business for R1.75bn ($222m).The deal, which PMI said would still need to be approved by South African regulatory authorities, would give it a dominant position in nasal snuff products, as well as pipe tobacco, in the country.At the moment, pipe tobacco and nasal snuff account for 31 per cent of total tobacco sales in South Africa, according to PMI.“This financially attractive acquisition represents an excellent strategic fit for our business in South Africa,” said Jean-Claude Kunz, head of PMI’s Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa region.This is the fourth acquisition that PMI has made since its spin-off from Altria last March according to data from Bloomberg. The biggest was the purchase of Canada’s Rothmans for about $2bn last July.While the cigarette industry remains large and profitable, industry volumes have fallen at an annual rate of 1-2 per cent a year for the past 20 years – a trend that is expected to continue.As a result, PMI, which saw first-quarter shipments of of its flagship Marlboro brand decline 2.4 per cent, has, along with other large tobacco groups been looking at ways to expand their businesses beyond cigarettes.Smokeless products such as snus – a teabag-like pouch that users stick between their cheek and gum – and snuff have attracted the most interest thus far.In February, PMI announced a 50:50 global joint venture with Swedish Match to make and sell smokeless products such as snus.Last year, rival British American Tobacco boosted its presence in the snus market through the acquisition of Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni and Altria acquired UST, the largest chewing tobacco maker in the US, for $11.7bn.At the time, analysts said the Altria deal could set off more consolidation in the global tobacco industry. Swedish Match, one of the world’s biggest makers of snus, has long been seen as a potential acquisition target.While snus may be the latest buzz in the tobacco industry, smokeless tobacco products have attracted the wrath of anti-smoking advocates.Sweden is the only country in the European Union in where it is legal to sell snus, but BAT is testing the product in Canada and South Africa. The company says health authorities believe snus is healthier than smoked tobacco.Anti-tobacco groups said allowing snus to be sold in the EU would encourage people to consume tobacco.
211;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-06-11T22:53:21Z;Senate backs tighter curbs on tobacco;;The US Senate approved regulation on tobacco on Thursday that would usher in European-style restrictions on advertising and put prominent health warnings on cigarette packets.Barack Obama, who has himself struggled with a nicotine habit, said he would sign the legislation into law. “My administration is committed to protecting our children and reforming our healthcare system – and moving forward with commonsense tobacco control measures is an integral part of that process,” the president said.The Senate bill would put tobacco under the control of the Food and Drug Administration and follows the passage of a similar bill through the House of Representatives. The Senate bill is likely to go to Mr Obama for approval, said Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker.Edward Kennedy, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts and a leading supporter of the legislation, said the Senate vote in favour, by 79 to 17, was “a life-saving act for the millions of children who will be spared a lifetime of addiction and premature death”.Chris Dodd, a Democratic senator and a co-sponsor of the legislation, said: “This bill makes it harder for tobacco companies to addict our children, gives parents peace of mind, and will ultimately save lives.”Restrictions on advertising have divided the tob­acco industry with Philip Morris, the US arm of Altria Group and manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes, supporting the legislation, while smaller competitors such as Reynolds American, the maker of Camel, criticise it. Analysts note that the marketing curbs will make it harder for companies such as Reynolds to win market share from Philip Morris.But all companies are likely to be forced to change their packaging, moving a modest health warning on the side of the packet to a starker series of messages that take up the top half of the front and back of the packet.The FDA, which will levy fees on the industry starting at $85m a year and rising to $712m a year by 2019, could decide to ban the word “lights” from lower-tar cigarettes if consumers are misled into thinking they are less harmful.Flavoured cigarettes, apart from menthols, would be banned as part of the legislation in a measure designed to reduce the attraction of cigarettes to children.Smokeless tobacco, which manufacturers have focused on as a growth area because of perceived lower health risks, does not escape the legislation, which orders specific advertising warning of the risk of mouth cancer.Altria said it broadly welcome the legislation but said it “is not perfect”.“For example, we have expressed first amendment reservations about certain provisions, including those that could restrict a manufacturer’s ability to communicate truthful information to adult consumers about tobacco products.”Some lawmakers argue that the FDA is the wrong regulator for the industry, because it is supposed to ensure the safety of food and medicine, and that is impossible with tobacco.To prevent tobacco from being banned all together, the Senate bill explicitly says the FDA cannot forbid the sale of cigarettes or force nicotine levels down to zero. But smokers are likely to be able to see the ingredients of cigarettes printed on packets, along with the quantities of tar and nicotine, in line with existing standards in force in the European Union.
212;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-06-11T20:37:57Z;Wall St adds to gains as oil prices surge;;US stocks closed at their highest level of the year on Thursday as the surging price of oil boosted energy stocks, which added to the impetus created by fresh data suggesting that the recession is abating.The figures showed that, since January, the fewest number of people claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, well below what analysts had forecast.Meanwhile, the climbing price of oil drove energy companies higher. Chevron gained 2.4 per cent to $71.90 while Schlumberger rose 4.9 per cent to $62.18.This helped markets open higher, and they extended the gains after an auction of 30-year Treasury notes was well received, easing fears that rising interest rates could start to hurt the US consumer.They dipped shortly before the close, but the benchmark S&P 500 index was still able to finish 0.6 per cent higher at 944.89, the highest closing price since November last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 8,770.92 and the Nasdaq Composite index also rose 0.5 per cent to 1,862.37.“Jobless claims are moving in the right direction, although we don’t know if we’ve seen the effect of the automotive plant shutdowns yet,” said John Canally, an economist at LPL Financial.Consumer staples received a boost from indications that retail sales rebounded in May following April’s surprise fall.Defensive stocks in household name consumer companies did well. Philip Morris gained 0.8 per cent to $43.88, while Coca-Cola climbed 1.2 per cent to $48.58.But economists warned the numbers were not as good as the headline figures suggested, with much of the rise coming on the back of escalating fuel prices.“Given the government’s large fiscal stimulus we would have hoped that maybe sales would have been even higher,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “But they have been kept lower by the sharp rise in the price of gasoline.” Retail stocks remained suppressed on the back of similar analysis from a number of experts. Target fell 2 per cent to $39.55 while Kohl’s declined 1.9 per cent to $45.92.Bank of America was one of the strongest performers in the financial sector after it was upgraded by analysts at KBW, who said the bank’s balance sheet was much stronger after its recent capital raising.Shares in the bank, whose chief executive Ken Lewis addressed Congress on Thursday morning on the details of the takeover of Merrill Lynch last year, advanced 8.3 per cent to $12.97.Two of the country’s largest regional banks also did well after being upgraded by Goldman Sachs, which saw relative value in the shares of Regions Financial and Fifth Third. Regions jumped 9.3 per cent to $4.37, while Fifth Third gained 5.9 per cent to $7.77.Elsewhere in the financial sector, BlackRock confirmed its $13bn purchase of Barclays Global Investors to create the world’s biggest money manager. Early reports of the deal have sent BlackRock’s shares up nearly 10 per cent this week, and they rose 2.3 per cent on Thursday to $182.60.Homebuilders suffered after news that the number of foreclosures in May was the third highest on record, dousing hopes that the housing market could be set for a swift recovery.Three of the largest US homebuilders fell sharply. Centex lost 5.4 per cent to $8.52, KB Home dropped 2.9 per cent to $14.45 and Pulte Homes gave up 5.7 per cent to $8.87.But steelmakers built on the week’s stellar gains as the price of steel continued to rise and the dollar continued to fall. US Steel picked up 4.2 per cent to $41.83 and AK Steel rose 5.2 per cent to $21.14.The battle for supremacy in the smartphone market took a new turn as Palm, which launched its Pre phone last weekend, appointed Jim Rubinstein, who helped develop the iMac and iPod at Apple, as chief executive. Palm’s shares climbed 12 per cent to $13.43 on the news.UnitedHealth was one of the S&P’s heaviest fallers, however, after Oppenheimer warned that the health insurer’s aggressive bids for Medicare contracts could hurt profit margins in 2010. Its shares lost 6.5 per cent to $24.05.
213;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-05-12T20:46:30Z;Defensive stocks stem bank losses;;Defensive stocks helped Wall street erase early losses on Tuesday as investors repositioned themselves following the dramatic recent rises in some of Wall Street’s most beaten down sectors.Healthcare and consumer staples companies, which are traditionally more stable during a recession, were the biggest winners as investors sold riskier assets, which have enjoyed a steep run up in the past two months.Healthcare stocks were led higher by Pfizer, which gained 5.5 per cent to $14.93, after Credit Suisse said the company may boost its dividend in the future following its purchase of rival Wyeth.Other coroporate giants such as Coca-Cola and Philip Morris also performed well, rising 3.9 per cent to $44.40 and 3.2 per cent to $41.84 respectively.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent down at 908.35 points, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 8,469.11 points. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.9 per cent to 1,715.92 points.The markets had been led lower by financial and retail stocks, but rallied as investors looked to take advantage of lower share prices.“Every time we’ve had a dip, we’ve seen people stepping over each other to get into the market,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams.Banks fell despite positive comments from Federal Reserve governor Ben Bernanke on the results of the tests on balance sheets and a major asset sale by Bank of America to help cover its capital shortfall.The bank was reported to have raised $7.3bn by selling a large stake in China Construction Bank, helping to plug the $33.9bn capital shortfall revealed by the tests. But its shares continued to lose ground as investors took profits following the stellar rises in financial stocks over the past two months. BofA lost 5.3 per cent to $12.26.Other banks were also lower even though Mr Bernanke said the reception of the tests was “encouraging”, and the Financial Times reported that the subsequent share offerings would make banks hundreds of millions of dollars in underwriting fees. Citigroup fell 5.2 per cent to $3.66 and JPMorgan lost 1.3 per cent to $35.36.Bank of New York Mellon also dropped after it became the latest bank to announce a rights issue following last week’s tests. The bank said that it would look to raise about $1bn in order to pay off government bail-out funds, even though the tests revealed no capital shortfall. Its shares slid 3.8 per cent to $28.43.It was the fifth bank to go to the equity markets this week after similar announcements by BB&T, Capital One, KeyCorp and US Bancorp on Monday.US Bancorp said it raised $3.5bn from selling equity and debt on Tuesday, and may sell an additional 20.5m shares to accommodate for extra demand. Its stock fell 3.3 per cent to $17.89.“Share prices have got ahead of fundamentals, and while that feels uncomfortable right now, it usually happens when the market is coming up from the bottom,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management.Banks were not the only ones to tap the market for funds.Ford announced it would issue 300m common shares and use part of the proceeds to pay off its healthcare obligations to the United Auto Workers union as part of a recently agreed deal. The company tumbled 17.6 per cent to $5.01.Its rival General Motors slumped 20.1 per cent to a historic low of $1.15 after six executives sold their shares in the carmaker. Its market value is now only $702m.Meanwhile, the telecoms sector continued to gain ground the day after Virgin Mobile’s US business reported much better than expected profits and said average revenue per user would rebound in the second half of 2009.Other companies gained from the optimism surrounding the sector, with Verizon rising 2 per cent to $30.40 and AT&T climbing 1.5 per cent to $25.73.Elsewhere, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, called stories the company was look to purchase German software company SAP a “random rumour” and said his company had nearly finsihed making job cuts.The company issued debt for the first time on Monday to take advantage of its current low price. Its shares gained 3 per cent to $19.89.
214;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;No-nonsense chief fired up by innovation;;"Sitting in the glass-fronted private dining room that overlooks the Thames, Paul Adams, the no-nonsense chief executive of British American Tobacco, pulls out a cigarette from a pack of Kool menthol and asks: “Do you know what the magic in this is?”The product, called Kool Boost, features a small capsule that, when the filter is squeezed, releases an extra boost of menthol flavour.Launched in Japan – where it has built up a 1 per cent share of the market – in 2007, the product is part of a range of new smoking products that BAT has been rolling out in recent years. “People ask me how I plan to get premium brands to grow and the answer is right here,” says Mr Adams, pointing to his pack of Kool Boost. “Innovation”.As the head of the world’s second-biggest publicly-listed tobacco company with a market value of £33.5bn, the 55-year-old has good reasons to be focusing on product innovations.Like its competitors, BAT has seen cigarette sales in the US, parts of Europe, and other mature markets fall amid increasing health concerns, smoking bans, higher taxes and advertising restrictions.But the company, whose brands include Kent, Lucky Strike and Dunhill, has sustained growth by cutting costs, increasing sales in developing countries where tobacco use is growing, and shifting customers to higher-priced products such as Kool Boost and Kent nanotek – an ultraslim cigarette that offers the same potent puffs at half the size of a normal cigarette.But none of this comes cheap. Last year, BAT spent £105m on research and development, with the bulk of that going to research of “reduced harm” cigarettes.Only Philip Morris International spent more, with a R&D budget of $300m (£200m). Imperial Tobacco, whose business is more geared towards the value segment of the market, does not give a figure on R&D spend.But the investment has not been in vain; BAT shares have more than doubled in value in the past five years from 834p to £16.84. Meanwhile, Mr Adams has beaten BAT’s goal for high single-digit growth in earnings per share every year since taking over in 2004.Eileen Khoo, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes the focus on product innovation will take on greater importance in the years ahead, as large-scale acquisition opportunities (and with it cost-saving synergies) reduce and the recession prompts some smokers to trade down to cheaper brands or smuggled cigarettes.“Given the current environment, if you want smokers to continue smoking premium brands, you have to give them a reason to stay loyal to the brand,” she says. “And one of the best ways of doing that is through slicker packaging and new product features such as resealable packs, super-slims and charcoal filters.”Signs that global demand for higher-priced cigarettes is softening are appearing. Last month, Philip Morris International said first-quarter shipments of Marlboro declined 2.4 per cent; this week BAT reported a sharp slowdown in the volume growth of premium brands such as Kent and Lucky Strike, which Mr Adams smokes himself.“What we are beginning to see now is a significant deceleration in the growth of the premium segment, particularly in central and eastern Europe,” says Mr Adams, adding that the company could see some continuation of the deceleration, or even a reduction in the growth of the premium cigarette sales, especially in markets where unemployment will rise significantly.“That’s why we believe that innovation is so important,” he says. “If you are trying to get consumers to uptrade from medium price to premium price cigarettes, why would they do that unless there’s value added?”Still, Mr Adams, a former marketing director at Pepsi-Cola, recognises that innovation on its own will not be enough to ensure BAT’s long-term growth.That is why, after five years of watching its competitors consolidate (it thought prices for big listed companies were too high), the group came off the sidelines to do two deals in six days last year. It spent a total of about £3bn to acquire Tekel, the Turkish state tobacco company, and Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni, the cigarette arm of Denmark-based ST Group.Looking ahead, he says BAT will continue to study acquisition opportunities, though he says the sector is unlikely to see any more blockbuster deals like Imperial’s €16.2bn ($22bn) takeover of Altadis in 2008.Instead, he says, companies will look to state privatisations and smaller “bolt-on” deals in emerging markets such as North Africa or east Asia. “I think the Philippines is an opportunity for us as well at some point. If we were to get in there, it would be through an acquisition rather than organically. But that is not to say that we’ll be doing an acquisition in the Philippines tomorrow,” he says, laughing."
215;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-04-12T18:45:06Z;Private-label power play;;"“Trading down” is one of this recession’s big trends. And it’s global. AC Nielsen has found frugal consumers across 11 big economies are cutting spending by shifting to lower-cost brands – often retailers’ private-label goods. There has been no repeat – yet – of “Marlboro Friday”, when Philip Morris in 1993 slashed cigarette prices to dent competition from bargain brands. But, once again, plates are shifting.British retailers pioneered turning private labels into genuine rivals to leading brands. That boosts profits, since store brands, though lower priced, typically earn fatter margins. Now the recession is giving own-label another fillip. J. Sainsbury, the UK grocer, is beating rivals’ sales growth with a “Switch and Save” campaign encouraging customers to dump brands for Sainsbury’s equivalents.But the US may be seeing the biggest shift. Though penetration has historically been lower there, supermarkets such as Kroger and Safeway have improved store brands’ quality and sophistication. Now they are reaping benefits. The Private Label Manufacturers’ Association says private-label grocery sales rose 10 per cent last year to $83bn. Branded product sales grew just 2.8 per cent.Now retailing’s 10-ton gorilla, Wal-Mart, is revamping and expanding its Great Value private-label range – already North America’s biggest food brand. Citigroup forecasts the label could go from 16 to 40 per cent of Wal-Mart’s sales within three years. Ominously, it suggests Wal-Mart could use resulting margin gains to cut prices across its grocery range, unleashing a price war.That could hammer other retailers – and branded manufacturers. US grocers are already using their growing private-label clout to press brand-makers to reverse price increases they pushed through last year. Manufacturers are resisting, saying commodity prices have eased but remain high. Some name-brand manufacturers are frantically marketing their products’ advantages over cheaper store brands. They should beware. Having sampled the alternatives, many consumers may decide, post-recession, not to return to their old, expensive brands.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

216;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-03-20T21:03:35Z;Wall St held back by flagging banks;;"US stocks fell on Friday as the financial sector was weighed down by bad news for financial stocks and falling commodity prices.Banking stocks had soared on Wednesday on the back of plans from the Federal Reserve to double its balance sheet to stimulate the economy.But all of those gains were wiped out, and financial stocks lost 12.9 per cent in two days. The falls on Friday came after several pieces of bad news, including a lack of interest in the latest Federal Reserve lending plan, fears over plans to tax high-earners at bailed out banks 90 per cent, and the news from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that banks had made a heavier loss in the fourth quarter than originally reported.Bank of America was one of the biggest losers, dropping 10.7 per cent to $6.19. Wells Fargo lost 9.3 per cent to $13.99 and Goldman Sachs fell 2 per cent to $97.32.American Express also fell after analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey warned the company may post a loss in 2009 and 2010 and slash its dividend, hurt by rising unemployment and credit card defaults. Its shares lost 6.2 per cent to $12.26.The insurance sector suffered too, with Lincoln National falling after Moody’s downgraded the company’s debt. Its shares lost 9.1 per cent to $7.31.Sentiment towards financial stocks has swung over the week, but experts warned against reading too much into short term moves.“It’s a little early to see what the effect of all the bailout packages is going to be,” said Andre Weisbrod, fund manager at STAAR Financial Advisors. “We’re not going to see what changes the current but we are going to feel it slowly start to change.”Energy stocks contributed to the losses, as the price of oil fell off new highs for the year. Chevron lost 3.6 per cent to $64.71 and ExxonMobil dropped 3.3 per cent to $66.09..General Electric also fell after analysts at several companies cut their earnings estimates for the company following Thursday’s shareholder meeting. The stock lost 5.8 per cent to $9.54.The leading market measures all lost ground after a positive start. The S&P 500 lost 2 per cent to 768.54 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.7 per cent to 7,278.38 points and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.8 per cent to 1,457.27 points.The Nasdaq was helped by a good performance from technology stocks. Palm, the mobilephone maker, rose 2.3 per cent to $7.89 despite third quarter losses, as the company said it was on track to start selling the Pre, its new smartphone designed to compete with the BlackBerry and iPhone, in the first half of the year.Xerox said it would also miss analysts’ estimates with its first-quarter earnings, blaming slow sales. Shares fell 18.7 per cent to $4.34.Several companies have successfully raised cash through bond sales, or are moving to do so as investors turn to corporate bonds as the yield on government debt falls after the Fed’s plan to buy Treasuries. The activity in the debt markets has helped fuel stock price rises too.Philip Morris advanced
3.1 per cent to $38.36 after raising €2bn in bonds. Merck also rose after it said it would issue a $1bn bond ahead of its planned $41bn takeover of rival Schering-Plough. Its shares climbed 2.6 per cent to $26.72.Johnson & Johnson gave further support to the healthcare sector after UBS advised long-term investors to buy its shares. The stock rose 3.2 per cent to $51.67.The three main market measures were set to finish 0.7-1.8 per cent higher for the week, the first time this year that the S&P 500 has put together two consecutive positive weeks this year.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned that the S&P would find it difficult to push past 800. “The market doesn’t usually trade well the week after equity options expire, so we are likely to remain flat,” he said."
217;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-03-15T09:25:21Z;Pension fund treads a thorny path;;"Norway likes to think of itself as an ethical model for others. It spends 1 per cent of its gross national income on international development assistance and $1bn (£723m, €783m) to save the rainforest in Brazil.But the paradoxes within one of its most visible efforts, the ethical investment strategy of its government pension fund, show how difficult it is to bridge the irreconcilable differences between the two main purposes of the world’s second largest sovereign wealth fund: to make money while investing ethically. The most recent contradiction, and probably most ironic, is the finance ministry’s current consideration of whether to exclude companies for carbon emission violations.Norway’s NKr2,275bn (£239bn, €258bn, $329bn) Government Pension Fund - Global, originally known as the Petroleum Fund, is funded by revenues from fossil fuels and even invests in oil companies. The government was obliged to take up the matter after Norwegian environmentalist group Bellona last year made a formal recommendation to the ministry as part of a white paper on the fund’s management to be submitted to parliament on March 27.The paper is the culmination of the most exhaustive review of the fund’s ethical guidelines since their introduction five years ago. It will provide the eventual basis for any potential changes to the guidelines this summer.“Climate change was central [to the public consultation process],” says Martin Skancke, finance ministry director general for asset management. “But the advice was broad, including positive screening, active ownership and separate allocations towards green technology companies.”Several companies have also made recommendations in the current consultation for the fund to abstain from tobacco company investments. The fund can presently exclude tobacco companies on an ad hoc basis if their marketing poses a serious violation of ethical norms. So far, none have been excluded and in fact the fund has ownership in some of the major tobacco companies, such as Altria and Philip Morris, according to its year-end report.The list of contradictions does not end there. The fund has excluded Lockheed Martin from its investment portfolio, yet the country buys its planes. The fund also temporarily blacklisted US oil company Kerr McGee for pollution violations at a Western Sahara project, despite a Norwegian company being involved in the project.Moreover, Norway has a formal ethics council for the Government Pension Fund - Global, but cannot present conclusive evidence that ethical investing pays off financially.“It’s not difficult to find the paradoxes in this,” says Gro Nystuen, chair of the ethics council. “But if you try and do everything 100 per cent, it is paralysing.”Ms Nystuen is one of five council members, part of whose job it is to recommend which companies to exclude. She says the ethical part of the government pension fund’s investment strategy dates back to the late 1990s when journalists unearthed an embarrassing revelation about the fund’s investment in a Singapore company involved in anti-personnel land mines shortly after Norway hosted the international Land Mine Ban conference in Oslo. The situation prompted the eventual formation of the independent advisory council on ethics in 2004.The blacklist of excluded companies comprises polluting miners, weapons producers and companies with labour violations. The council gets its leads from the Ethical Investment Research Service, a UK screening company that looks at the 7,000 companies in the fund’s portfolio and mines for keywords. Eiris sends the council the names of 40 to 60 possible offenders every month. The council also gets tips from non-government organisations and journalists.The fund recently excluded investments in Canadian mining company Barrack Gold for environmental damages and US company Textron for cluster weapons production. There are currently 29 companies excluded from the fund’s investment portfolio.The council’s work has been conducive to changing the way some companies behave.Monsanto is a key example. The council initially recommended in 2006 that the finance ministry exclude the US agricultural company because of its use of child labour in its cotton seed production in India. But after working together with the company, and even going so far as to physically go into the fields and count children, the ministry decided last year to keep Monsanto because it had made significant improvements.The fund’s ethical investment strategy has also been influential in changing the way other pension funds invest. The Swedish AP Fund was persuaded to disinvest in Wal-Mart following Norway’s lead; Norwegian pension fund KLP has followed the government pension fund’s recommendations, and the fund has influenced the New Zealand Superannuation Fund."
218;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;BAT lifts dividend after 20% increase in profit;;The global tobacco sector further enhanced its reputation as a safe haven for investors on Thursday after British American Tobacco, the world’s second-largest publicly listed cigarette company, delivered a 20 per cent jump in annual pre-tax profits and raised its dividend payment by more than a quarter.For the year to December 31, sales volume rose a modest 1 per cent on an organic basis. But revenue grew by more than a fifth to £12.1bn ($17.3bn) thanks to price increases and currency gains from the weak pound.Pre-tax profit rose from £3.1bn to £3.7bn, while the full-year dividend increased from 66.2p to 83.7p via a 61.6p final payout.The figures, which even the most ardent non-smoker will find tough to ignore, suggest that despite the spate of bad news in recent weeks from the likes of Unilever and Kraft, food companies that are normally seen as ultra-safe, not all defensive stocks have run out of steam.Jonathan Jackson, head of equities at Killik & Co, said the global top four – Philip Morris International, BAT, Japan Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco – which control about 69 per cent of world cigarette sales excluding China, are more resilient to the downturn than food and staple goods retailers. “They have more pricing power, wide geographical spread and brands across all price ranges, giving them more protection against down-trading.”This view was echoed by Adam Spielman, tobacco analyst at Citigroup. He argued in a note this month that Imperial is “arguably, the most defensive of all European large-cap consumer names”.But Mark Costar, a fund manager at JO Hambro Capital Management, said that, while tobacco was less vulnerable to a downturn in spending, he feels the sector’s shares are now fully priced. “There are long-term structural issues within the industry and these are not being discounted in current share prices,” he said.Although tobacco consumption is declining worldwide, tobacco companies have continued to grow profits during the past decade. In the US and Europe, where public health programmes and high taxes have reduced smoking rates, the fall in volume has been offset by price increases.Emerging markets, where tobacco use is still growing, has also helped make up for the decline in developed countries.The World Health Organisation estimates that the number of smokers will grow from 1.3bn in 2006 to 1.7bn by 2025, with the bulk of new smokers coming from Asia and eastern Europe.
219;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-02-05T20:24:13Z;Premium brands face value plight;;For the biggest makers of consumer goods, the past decade has been dominated by “must-have” brands.Owners of recognisable products such as Dove shampoo (Unilever) and Gillette razors (Procter & Gamble) can charge premium prices. Shoppers in the boom years have been happy to spend more on toothpaste that helps whiten teeth or dishwashing tablets that add sparkle to wine glasses.But as consumers suffer and pressure grows to slash prices, brand owners need to beware the “ghost of Marlboro Friday”, according to Alan Erskine, analyst at UBS and broker to Unilever.In a note to clients this week, Mr Erskine referred back to April 1993 when Philip Morris slashed the price of Marlboro cigarettes in a bid to fight back against generic rivals. The decision backfired spectacularly, calling into question the premium value of a historic brand. Philip Morris shares slid 30 per cent and the knock-on effect led to a wider sell-off of consumer goods shares.The dilemma of Philip Morris 16 years ago is similar to the one facing the big brand owners now.Mr Erskine expects more “down-trading” to cheaper brands this year as unemployment increases. This will force consumer goods companies to expand promotions and move towards cheaper branded products, hurting margins.“Consumers down-trade in food, not through choice but through economic necessity,” Mr Erskine wrote. “And, as a consequence down-trading occurs much later in the economic cycle – when unemployment peaks – than with other consumables.”Others, though, will benefit from a shift to “own-label” products, such as Tesco’s “Value range” and Sainsbury’s “Basics” lines. McBride and Henkel are the big suppliers of “private label” household goods to the supermarkets, while Premier Foods, Northern Foods, Greencore, Uniq and Bakkavör provide ready meals.
220;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2009-02-04T22:41:58Z;Philip Morris shares tumble 4%;;The rapid and relentless rise of the US dollar has prompted Philip Morris International to sharply lower its profit guidance for 2009 on Wednesday, driving shares in the world’s largest cigarette maker down 4 per cent.The group, which was spun off from Altria last year and generates all of its sales outside the the US, said it expected 2009 profit per share to be in the range of $2.85 to $3.00, compared with analyst expectations of about $3.41 and the $3.32 achieved in 2008.While overall sales volume has remained robust, the maker of Malboro cigarettes said the stronger dollar meant the group could take a hit of $0.80 per share in 2009.Louis Camilleri, chief executive said the fall seen in the Russian rouble, Turkish lira, Mexican peso and the Ukrainian Hryvnia alone account for 60 of the 80 cent hit.“The global economic crisis obviously results in uncertainty, particularly on the currency front and at current exchange rates we face a steep hurdle,” he said.PMI’s estimate of currency impact was much more than what the market was expecting. Most analysts had projected it would decrease earnings by 40 cents a share.“The underlying business is performing exactly as we had expected, which in this economy is probably a mild positive,” said Adam Spielman, an analyst at Citigroup. “But in our view the much greater-than-expected currency sensitivity is a clear negative.”Excluding the adverse currency impact, the group said profit is expected to increase between 10-14 per cent.The unfavourable currency comparisons have already cut into to the group’s profit during the last quarter of 2008.Net earnings for the three months to end of December fell 7.8 per cent to $1.4bn, or 71 cents a share, despite a 2.2 per cent rise in revenue during this period.For the year, net earnings rose 14 per cent to $6.9bn, or $3.32 a share. Net revenue rose from $55.2bn to $63.6bn as cigarette shipment volume increased 2.5 per cent to 869.8bn units.Although the group said it has seen no sign yet that the global recession is having a material impact on sales, Mr Camilleri cautioned that “there is no certainty that these trends will be sustained.”“We recognise that the year has barely started and the global economic crisis is still unfolding,” he said.“Regretfully, currency will cast a dark shadow on our financial results should exchange rates remain at current levels,” he added.PMI’s comments on currency headwind also drove shares in other global tobacco groups lower on Wednesday.British American Tobacco closed down 3.1 per cent at £18.54 while Imperial Tobacco fell 2.5 per cent to £18.29.Shares in Japan Tobacco is likely to open lower on Thursday when the market opens in Toyko.
221;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-12-15T19:55:18Z;US smokers win right to sue tobacco group;;"Smokers have been granted the right by the US Supreme Court to sue Altria Group and other tobacco companies over claims their marketing tactics for “light” cigarettes are deceptive.The five-four ruling, which opens Altria’s Philip Morris and its peers to a spate of litigation, affirms an appellate court decision that federal cigarette labelling laws preventing states from enacting additional smoking regulations was not a reason to prevent a lawsuit from proceeding in a Maine district court.Citing the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, a group of long-term smokers claimed they were misled by Philip Morris’s efforts to suggest that Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights were less harmful than regular cigarettes because they had “lowered tar and nicotine”.While the plaintiffs acknowledged that the “light” brands did indeed have less tar and nicotine, they argued that the company knew that smokers compensated for the decreased potency of the cigarettes by holding smoke in their lungs longer or covering filter ventilation holes with their lips or fingers.The labelling act, enacted by Congress in 1965 after the nation’s surgeon general determined that smoking was harmful, requires that every pack of cigarettes sold in the US contains a “conspicuous warning”.The law, which was amended later that decade to strengthen the warning’s language and ban cigarette advertisements on television, pre-empted state laws.Philip Morris also maintained that the suits would undermine the Federal Trade Commission’s efforts to encourage tobacco companies to market low-tar brands.However, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in the Supreme Court’s opinion on the case that “respondents still must prove that petitioners’ use of ‘light’ and ‘lowered tar’ descriptors in fact violated the state deceptive practices statute, but neither the labelling act nor the FTC’s actions in the field prevent a jury from considering that claim”.The court did not rule on the merits of the plaintiffs’ case, which will now proceed in the district court.A federal trial court in Maine had granted Philip Morris’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case in May 2006.“While we had hoped for a dismissal based upon federal pre-emption, it is important to note that the Supreme Court made no finding of liability,” Murray
Garnick, associate general counsel and client services senior vice-president for Altria, said in a statement."
222;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-09-11T22:02:31Z;Coffee king with a taste for philanthropy;;Klaus Jacobs, the entrepreneur who built his family’s coffee roasting business into one of the biggest coffee and chocolate empires, has died at 71.German-born, Swiss naturalised and a UK resident, Mr Jacobs’ biggest move was the sale of Jacobs Suchard, the business he had developed through organic growth and canny deals, to Philip Morris.The proceeds went to creating Barry Callebaut, the world’s leading industrial chocolate maker, and Adecco, the biggest international temporary employment group.Born in Bremen in December 1936, he developed the family’s traditional coffee roasting business and moved into chocolate, most notably with the acquisition of Suchard, one of the best-known brands in Switzerland, where he also took up residence and gained nationality.The sale of the combined group and loss of the Suchard name to a US conglomerate was controversial in Switzerland.Barry Callebaut, the quoted Swiss chocolate company almost 70 per cent owned by family interests, developed into the world’s biggest chocolate producer.Separately, Adecco, almost 23 per cent owned by family interests and the foundation created by Mr Jacobs in 1988, developed into the world’s top “temping” group after the 1996 merger of Switzerland’s Adia, in which Mr Jacobs had invested, with Ecco of France.Mr Jacobs remained active in both “his” companies in various roles. But he was particularly involved with Adecco given his interest in youth and employment – as well as a corporate setback in 2004 that eventually prompted a split with Philippe Foriel-Destezet, the French entrepreneur behind Ecco, which left Mr Jacobs as the key shareholder.But it will be as much for his private interests and philanthropy that Mr Jacobs will be remembered.A keen horseman, he eventually gave up residence in Switzerland for a stud near Newmarket in the UK.He was also strongly committed to the scout movement.In November 2006, he made one of the biggest single donations of its kind in Europe with a €200m ($278m) gift to the International University Bremen, which renamed itself the Jacobs University Bremen.Speaking to the Financial Times at the time, Mr Jacobs said the gesture stood as an appeal to other business leaders to be more generous, especially in supporting education and science.Mr Jacobs, who like his mother, died from a brain tumour, was twice married and the father of six children.
223;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Altria buys UST for $11.7bn;;Altria on Monday announced that it would buy US chewing tobacco maker UST for $11.7bn, in a deal which would help offset Altria's declining US cigarette volumes and boost its position in the tobacco market by expanding its range of alternative tobacco products.Altria, the owner of Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris USA, has tried to build strength in the expanding smokeless tobacco category but has met with little success. UST, which makes Copenhagen and Skoal tobacco and also owns a wine distribution business, is the largest US maker of chewing tobacco.Altria said in a statement that it was offering to buy in cash all outstanding UST shares at $69.50 each, valuing the deal at approximately $11.7bn, including the assumption of approximately $1.3bn of debt.Shares of Altria were up 3.3 per cent at $21.65 in early trading. UST shares were 0.9 per cent higher at $68.16.An agreement between Altria and its smaller rival has long been expected by investors and Wall Street analysts.The two rivals have been unable to strike a deal in the past, largely because of disagreements over pricing, industry sources have said.Shares of UST were hit hard in the summer after it said tougher competition and higher gas prices were affecting its premium smokeless tobacco volumes. The stock had been trading just above $50 in the months before news arrived on Friday of a possible transaction, which sent the stock up to $67.55.According to Altria, the offer represents a premium of 28.9 per cent to UST’s three-month average share price of $53.90.Altria said it expected the acquisition to be accretive to adjusted diluted earnings per share within 12 months and to generate “an attractive double-digit economic return”.Combination of the two companies would lead to around $250m of annual cost saving by 2011, the company added.To finance the acquisition, Altria has changed a two-year, $7.5bn share repurchase programme to a three-year, $4bn programme. It has received $7bn in bridge financing Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan and it plans to access the public-debt market to refinance a portion of its credit facilities.A combination of the US rivals could set off more consolidation in the global tobacco industry, such as the oft-rumoured takeover of Lorillard by Reynolds, industry analysts have said. Lorillard was spun off from Loews last year.US tobacco stocks underperformed the broader market by 4 per cent in the second quarter, according to Goldman, as investors expressed concerns over pricing, volumes and potential increases in regulation and taxes.Altria split its US Philip Morris division from Philip Morris International in March, and investors speculated that it would subsequently consider making an acquisition. Altria bought John Middleton, a cigar maker, late last year.For the first half of 2008, Altria’s operating income was $2.6bn, compared with UST’s $451m. If Altria had owned UST since the beginning of 2008, Altria’s first half revenue would have increased 10.3 per cent to $10.4bn, it said.
224;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-09-05T20:19:59Z;Altria closes in on $10bn UST deal;;Altria is in late-stage talks over the takeover of US chewing tobacco maker UST for about $10bn.A deal could be announced within days, according to an insider.An agreement between Altria and its smaller rival UST, which has long been expected by investors and Wall Street analysts, would help offset Altria’s declining US cigarette volumes and boost its position in the tobacco market by expanding its range of alternative tobacco products.Altria, the owner of Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris USA, has tried to build strength in the expanding smokeless tobacco category but has had little success. UST, which makes Copenhagen and Skoal tobacco and also owns a wine distribution business, is the largest US maker of chewing tobacco.The two rivals have been unable to strike a deal in the past, largely because of disagreements over pricing, industry sources have said. But UST’s shares rallied more than 25 per cent by the close on Friday, after the New York Times initially reported that the companies were close to a deal.Speculation over the transaction was triggered on Thursday after UST’s top executives cancelled a presentation at a key analyst conference at the last minute. Investors quickly inferred that the move could be related to an imminent deal but the company would not comment on why its executives backed out of the presentation.Shares of UST were hit hard in July and August after it said tougher competition and higher gas prices were affecting its premium smokeless tobacco volumes. The stock closed at $67.55 on Friday, a few dollars below the value that would be implied in a $10bn deal.A takeover of UST at $70 a share would give Altria more flexibility with its balance sheet and boost its earnings per share by 4 per cent in its second year and 7 per cent in its third year, Goldman Sachs estimated.A combination of the US rivals could also set off more consolidation in the global tobacco industry, such as the oft-rumoured takeover of Lorillard by Reynolds, industry analysts have said. Lorillard was spun off from Loews last year.Altria did not return calls for comment.US tobacco stocks underperformed the broader market by 4 per cent in the second quarter, according to Goldman, as investors expressed concerns over pricing, volumes and potential increases in regulation and taxes.Altria split its US Philip Morris division from Philip Morris International in March, and investors speculated that it would subsequently consider making an acquisition.

225;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Altria and Philip Morris;;In any break-up, comparisons with the ex are inevitable. In the case of Altria and Philip Morris International, the differing fates of the US tobacco company and the international operations it recently spun off reflect a larger split in the tobacco market.PMI, freed to seek out overseas growth, shows signs of fulfilling its promise. Smokers in emerging markets find its pricier brands alluring, to the extent that PMI recently increased full-year earnings guidance to reflect growth of 19 to 21 per cent. Life is also good for its nearest competitor, British American Tobacco, which again beat expectations last week with strong growth in Russia, Romania and Asia. A wave of consolidation has left few takeover targets available. So both companies are building market share through innovation: BAT emphasises unusual packaging while PMI has added low-tar ‘Filter Plus’.Altria, however, is having a tougher time. Its shares fell after second quarter numbers last week showed sales slowing more than expected. The results stung because Altria’s chief domestic rival, Reynolds American, which has also struggled with declining volumes, posted a 13 per cent increase year-on-year in earnings per share for the quarter. Both companies also face a changing regulatory framework: the US House of Representatives last week passed a bill that would give the Food and Drug Administration the power to regulate tobacco, although any final action would likely be delayed until after the November presidential election. Altria now sees US cigarette consumption contracting by 3 to 3.5 per cent annually over the long term, worse than its previous 2.5 to 3 per cent outlook.All four companies have outperformed their local indices over the past 12 months, as has the UK’s Imperial Tobacco, reflecting a sense that tobacco stocks are defensive in a recession. After so much consolidation, though, success will now depend on them building up market shares and selling fancier smokes. Aspiring emerging market consumers look like the better bet.
226;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-08-04T18:47:08Z;Bacardi hires new chief from Colgate;;Bacardi has turned to Colgate-Palmolive for its new chief executive.The Bermuda-based distiller’s appointment of Seamus McBride brings aboard more marketing experience to help it compete with global rivals Diageo and Pernod Ricard.Mr McBride, 53, who has been running Colgate’s North American business, will take over from chief executive Andreas Gembler on September 1.Mr Gembler, 65, is retiring from Bacardi.A former chief executive of Philip Morris International, he was an independent director on Bacardi’s board when he was unexpectedly offered the top job three years ago following the sudden resignation of his predecessor, Javier Ferran.Mr Gembler spent much of his time at Bacardi trying to whip the privately held organisation into shape by complying with US corporate governance regulations and setting three-year plans.Mr McBride, an Englishman who has run Colgate’s marketing operations in the US, Europe, Australia and the UK during 25 years with the consumer goods company, is expected to focus closely on the branding of Bacardi’s spirits, which include Bombay Sapphire gin and Grey Goose vodka as well as Bacardi rum.“So much of what drives our brands is marketing,” Bacardi said.Bacardi recently missed out on acquiring one of the world’s most coveted brands, Absolut vodka, after Pernod Ricard won an auction for the spirit.Bacardi is now concentrating its energies on tequila, last week taking a stake (it refused to specify how much) in the US’s Patrón Spirits Company.The group owns one of the US’s fastest-growing spirits brands, Patrón tequila.Total tequila sales, which account for about 15 per cent of all spirits sold in the US, are also rising faster than other spirits, and were up 10.5 per cent last year to $1.6bn.Mr McBride will be the fifth non-family member to be chief executive of Bacardi, which is controlled by some 500 shareholders.
227;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Resilient BAT raises dividend;;British American Tobacco demonstrated its merits as a defensive stock as it delivered solid first-half results and raised its interim dividend 19 per cent.The owner of Dunhill, Lucky Strike and Kent cigarettes on Thursday said favourable currency movements and better pricing in many of its markets had helped push revenue up 15 per cent to £5.45bn.At constant rates of exchange, revenue would have increased by 6 per cent.Pre-tax profit was up nearly 16 per cent at £1.83bn, ahead of analysts’ consensus forecast of £1.74bn.Jan du Plessis, chairman, said the downturn in consumer spending had had little impact thus far on the company, which generates about half its profit in emerging markets.“While not immune from the consequences of an economic slowdown, we can certainly look to the future with more confidence than most,” he said.The upbeat interim update will offer further proof to tobacco sector bulls that the sector is well placed to weather the slowdown that other consumer-facing industries have been experiencing.Both Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris International reported strong quarterly sales figures last week as consumers in emerging markets continue to light up.By contrast, Unilever, Vodafone and Marks and Spencer have all warned of slowing sales in recent weeks.Like its competitors, BAT has seen cigarette sales fall in the US, parts of Europe and other mature markets amid widespread health concerns, smoking bans, higher taxes and advertising restrictions.However, the company has sustained profit growth by raising prices in western Europe and increasing sales in emerging markets where populations are growing and the popularity of smoking is on the rise.Profits in Europe and in Asia Pacific were up 31 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. The only dim spot is in Latin America, where profits fell £5m to £381m.Having come off the sidelines in February to do two deals in six days, BAT said it continued to be on the look-out for acquisition opportunities, particularly in north Africa and Asia where state monopolies could be put on sale.The group declared an interim dividend of 22.1p – an increase of 19 per cent.Shares in BAT, up 16 per cent over the past year, closed down 38p at £18.28.
228;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-07-31T20:01:11Z;PMI sets sights on Canadian rival;;Consolidation in the global tobacco industry continued apace on Thursday after Philip Morris International, the world’s biggest listed tobacco company, agreed to buy Canada’s Rothmans for C$2bn ($1.95bn) in cash.The C$30-a-share offer, which is being recommended by Rothmans’ board, represents a 17 per cent premium to the company’s 20-day average trading price to July 30.The deal, if successful, would give PMI control of a third of Canada’s cigarette market, including the leading share of the country’s fast-growing discount cigarette category.The acquisition would be a first for PMI, which was formed after Altria spun out its overseas operations in March. The move was designed to give the international business more freedom to pursue sales growth in emerging markets as well as shield it from the litigation risks facing the US business.Jonathan Fell, tobacco analyst at Deutsche Bank, said the deal was a sensible one given that PMI already owns 40 per cent of Rothmans Benson & Hedges. Rothman, the listed vehicle that PMI is acquiring, owns the other 60 per cent.Louis C. Camilleri, chairman and chief executive of PMI, said the transaction would not affect 2008 results and would add “modestly” to per-share earnings in 2009.“This proposed acquisition is a win-win for both Rothmans and PMI shareholders,” he said. “Rothmans shareholders will receive a significant cash premium and PMI consolidates its presence in a market that we deem financially attractive and of strategic importance going forward.”The company has generally performed well in a declining market, but has complained that contraband sales were chipping away at its market share.Earnings grew 18 per cent to C$117.6m in its latest fiscal year ended March 31. Sales were 8.4 per cent higher at C$670.6m.
229;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-06-26T22:33:49Z;Value of M&A tumbles as buy-out boom ends;;"The value of mergers and acquisitions in the first half sank by nearly a third from the same period last year to $1,860bn as the collapse of the buy-out boom prompted a steep drop in the number of high-value deals. (Click here for interactive table)The raw number of deals announced in the first half of the year topped the first half of 2007’s total, according to preliminary figures from Dealogic. But while the five biggest deals announced in the first six months of this year accounted for 15 per cent of global M&A volume, the overall number of transactions valued above $1bn dropped sharply.The volume of deals ann-ounced by private equity investors plunged 78 per cent to account for just 6 per cent of the global M&A market, the industry’s lowest share since 2001. The credit crunch continues to render buy-out investors unable to secure the debt they need to buy expensive assets. Corporate buyers have not been able to fill that gap but they became more aggressive in the second quarter.Six corporate mega-deals above $20bn, mostly in the telecommunications sector, doubled the first quarter’s mega-deal volume. Bankers attributed the jump to pent-up demand from companies that have wanted certain assets for years but had faced too much competition from private equity.“We’re very, very busy right now. There is evidence of a turn,” said Jimmy Elliott, JPMorgan global M&A head, who was surprised corporate buyers had not sprung into action sooner.Two large US spin-offs, through which Philip Morris and Time Warner chose to break
up their businesses rather
than build them through acquisitions, boosted the first half of
the year’s spin-off total to $157.9bn, its largest on record.The dollar value of deals involving European targets sank 40 per cent in the first half of the year to $640bn, the most significant regional decline. Dealmaking volumes in the US fell 30 per cent to $694.4bn. Activity involving targets in the Asia-Pacific region outside of Japan, on the other hand, hit a record high of $311.1bn, as China Unicom’s $32bn offer for China Netcom boosted volume involving Chinese targets to a record $114.8bn.Goldman Sachs topped the global M&A adviser rankings, followed by JPMorgan, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank.The amount of advisory revenue merger bankers generated during the first half sank 27 per cent, illuminating the extent to which the dealmaking slump has affected banks’ businesses."

231;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-06-06T18:35:33Z;Battleground for smokers lies in new markets;;The era of big tobacco deals more or less came to a close last summer with Imperial Tobacco’s €16.2bn (£12.95bn) acquisition of Spanish rival Altadis.The deal, which came hard on the heels of Japan Tobacco’s £7.5bn approach for Gallaher, consolidated the Bristol-based company’s position as the world’s fourth largest cigarette maker and gave it control of Altadis’s cigar business.In the process, it also meant the global top four – Philip Morris International (which spun off from Altria this year), British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Imperial – now control about 69 per cent of world cigarette sales, excluding China.For Gareth Davis, Imperial’s chief executive, the acquisition of Altadis caps an extraordinary 12-year run at the company. Under his stewardship, Imperial shares, which were worth less than £4 10 years ago, have risen more than sixfold to as much as £27 earlier this year. Pre-tax profits have jumped from £325m in 1997 to £1.2bn last year.In an industry that relies on scale to maintain profit margins amid falling sales in mature western markets, Imperial has proven a master of increasing its share of falling markets while keeping costs down. (The company said it was expecting to generate savings of €300m a year by 2010 from the Altadis takeover, rising to €400m by 2012.)But with most of the big deals done, some are beginning to wonder if Imperial’s rough-and-ready approach and appetite for sweating assets would be enough to keep the company on its winning streak.With cigarette sales falling in the US, parts of Europe and other mature markets amid health concerns, smoking bans, higher taxes and advertising restrictions, analysts say emerging markets will be the big battleground.It is not hard to see why. Setting aside China – which is a closed market dominated by the CNTC, a state-run company – emerging markets accounted for more than two-thirds of world demand for cigarettes in 2007. Although they represent only a third of the industry’s operating profit, sales there are booming. Last year, emerging markets generated 55 per cent of the industry’s profit growth.“Trading up in emerging markets has often resulted in replacing local brands with international brands and, there, the development of these franchises is critical to the long-term success of the international players,” says Jonathan Leinster of UBS.If a company’s success rests on its ability to target growth markets, then PMI, maker of Marlboro cigarettes and BAT, which counts Lucky Strike and Dunhill among its brands, appear well placed. The latter is expected to generate half of this year’s net profits from emerging markets and the former about 40 per cent.Imperial, by contrast, has the lowest exposure among the big four, with only about 17 per cent of its 2008 net profits expected to come from emerging countries, according to UBS.In the world of post-blockbuster deals, analysts say companies will now look to internal growth, state privatisations and smaller deals in emerging markets to increase volumes while lifting earnings through cost-cutting and share buy-backs.In this respect, BAT also appears to be a step ahead of the competition. Having sat out on the wave of consolidation that swept the industry over the past five years because it thought prices for big listed companies were too high, the company came off the sidelines to do two deals in six days this year. It spent a total of about £3bn on Tekel, the Turkish state tobacco company, and Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni, the cigarette arm of Denmark-based ST Group.While modest in size, analysts say these were sensible acquisitions done at a reasonable price. BAT paid 11.4 times historic annual earnings for Tekel and 11.2 times for its Scandinavian deal, well below the 14.2 multiple Imperial paid for Altadis and the 13 multiple Japan Tobacco paid for Gallaher.“Acquisitions are an important source of growth for the tobacco industry, but buying in growth only makes sense when the price is right,” says one analyst. The analyst reckons Imperial would probably have ended up paying 20 per cent less for Altadis had it waited a few months longer. “By then, the credit crunch would have made it much harder for CVC [the rival suitor] to challenge Imperial.”It is the Altadis deal that has helped cement Imperial’s global status, but the high price that Imperial has paid is not without its consequences. The strength of the euro against the pound and Imperial’s decision to buy in Altadis’s minority stake in Logista rather than sell the logistics business forced the company to announce a rights issue last month. The news prompted Imperial shares to suffer their biggest one-day fall in about six years.But not all analysts see Imperial’s exposure to mature western markets as a negative. Eileen Khoo, analyst at Morgan Stanley, the company’s joint broker, says that, given the strength of the euro, having strong exposure to European countries can be an asset.“We believe the earnings outlook has improved for Imperial, given strong currency tailwinds, improving profitability in central and eastern Europe,” she says.Looking ahead, analysts say state monopolies in Egypt and Algeria, if they come up for sale, will generate interest from the big four. But the big question is whether the Chinese market, by far the world’s largest, will open up.“It’s the Holy Grail that everyone is trying to crack,” says one industry veteran. But he warns that, given the size and ambition of the Chinese tobacco industry, western firms could become acquisition targets.
232;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-03-11T22:55:24Z;Philip Morris eyes purchases;;Philip Morris International said it would seek acquisitions, cost-cutting and annual earnings growth of 10-12 per cent after the cigarette maker’s spin-off from Altria’s US tobacco business this month.The forecast came as Altria, the world’s largest cigarette maker and owner of the Marlboro brand, gave investors the first financial outlook for the separated companies.In January, Altria said it would spin off PMI to shareholders on March 28 to unlock the faster-growing international cigarette business from the US, where consumption is declining.The move completes the break-up of Altria, the consumer goods conglomerate, which will effectively become Philip Morris USA and will retain its 28.6 per cent stake in brewer SABMiller.Spinning off PMI creates a strong international tobacco group that can use its stock as currency in the consolidation of the global tobacco industry. Altria will also have more flexibility to make moves to grow its US business.Louis Camilleri, Altria’s chief executive, who will become chief executive of the separate PMI, said the break-up of the conglomerate leaves “independent, focused and thriving entities”.In a presentation to Wall Street, PMI executives said they saw a number of attractive acquisition targets around the world. “I can’t tell you the time or scale other than [to say] we are vigorously pursuing those opportunities,” Mr Camilleri said.Potential acquisitions combined with cost-cutting and strengthening Marlboro and other brands worldwide would also help it hit “appropriately ambitious” long-term financial targets, he said.PMI’s forecast over the next several years included annual volume growth of 1-2 per cent.
233;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-02-22T20:40:12Z;BAT win boosts Turkish presence;;"British American Tobacco has strengthened its presence in Turkey, the world’s eighth-largest tobacco market, outgunning rival bidders to win the auction for Tekel Cigarette, the state-owned cigarette maker.The maker of Lucky Strikes emerged victorious with a $1.72bn (£873m, €1.16bn)bid after its rivals – Citigroup Ventures, Cinven and Dogan, a Turkish media and consumer goods conglomerate – bowed out during the process.The price is towards the high end of market expectations that had put the value of Tekel at $1.5bn-$1.8bn. However, analysts said the deal, struck on a multiple of 11.4 times Tekel’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in 2007, was in line with recent sector takeovers.Jonathan Fell, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: “This looks like a pretty sensible deal to me. The multiples are not extreme and it’s a chance to get an equalish market share with Philip Morris in a country where we are still seeing growth.”The Turkish cigarette market is dominated by Philip Morris, the US group, which has 40 per cent of the market. If successful, the transaction will lift BAT’s share of the Turkish market from 7 per cent to 36 per cent.Like its competitors, BAT has sought to build sales in emerging markets as tobacco consumption in western European markets declines after governments banned smoking in public places.About half of BAT’s revenues and pre-tax profits come from emerging markets.Tekel employs about 15,000 people, but its operations are loss-making. Last year, it reported a loss of nearly TL340m ($283m) on sales of TL916m.Nonetheless, Paul Adams, chief executive, said he expected the deal to become earnings enhancing from 2009, as improvements in the supply chain and savings
in administrative costs feed into the company’s overall results.Mr Adams said this would come in spite of an expected 5 per cent decline in the Turkish market as a public smoking ban is implemented over the next 18 months.“We are buying into a declining asset,” he said. “But the fall in volume will be compensated by the growing population, better pricing and consumers trading up.”The Turkish government is seeking to reduce the incidence of smoking in an attempt to reduce the cost of cancer treatment on the cash-strapped health service.BAT said the deal would be funded through bank debt. Shares in BAT edged up 16p to £18.74. The stock has risen more than 19 per cent in the past year."
234;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-02-18T22:03:03Z;BAT among final bidders for Tekel;;"British American Tobacco, the owner of Dunhill and Lucky Strike cigarettes, is among four groups that have submitted final bids for Tekel Cigarette, the state-owned Turkish group.An auction for the group, which analysts value at $1bn-$1.5bn (£513m-£769m), could be held by the end of the week.The other final bidders are one consortium that includes Turkish conglomerate Dogan Holding; another consortium including the Turkish construction group Lima Insaat; and the private equity firm Cinven, which is bidding in a consortium under the name of Strand Investment.The auction will be shown on Turkish television and is also expected to be recorded by international channels such as CNN to avoid allegations of corruption.The government opened the sale of Tekel late last year. This is the third time the Turkish government has tried to sell the cigarette maker. Previous attempts have failed because the government did not get the price it wanted or it did not get sufficient bids.The Turkish cigarette market is dominated by Philip Morris, which has a 40 per cent share. Tekel, whose market share has been declining, has about 29 per cent and Japan Tobacco International about 14 per cent.BAT, the world’s second-biggest tobacco group, has a share of almost 7 per cent and believes that further investment in Turkey makes strategic sense as cigarette sales remain stable in the country.However, the Turkish government has plans to impose a ban on smoking in all
public places within the next 18 months, including on public transport and in sports stadiums.Turkey is the eighth-largest tobacco market in the world.A strong global presence has helped BAT sustain healthy profits.Last year, BAT increased prices in many countries, including Brazil and Vietnam, and saw increased demand for its higher-priced brands, including Kent and Dunhill, in emerging markets such as Russia."
235;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-02-15T18:22:11Z;Tobacco groups warned on contraband;;Tobacco companies could be made responsible for clamping down on cigarette smuggling, with stiff financial penalties for failure, under proposed guidelines for a new global treaty to tackle the multi-billion-dollar illicit trade in tobacco products.The trade is estimated to deprive national exchequers worldwide of $40bn-$50bn in lost taxes every year and undermines the drive to raise cigarette prices, which experts say is the single most effective way of deterring people from smoking, especially the young.At the end of a week of negotiations in Geneva involving about 130 countries, delegates said on Friday there was broad agreement to require companies to track and trace tobacco products from manufacture to point of sale and fine them if contraband is seized.The proposals are modelled on an existing agreement between 26 of the 27 European Union countries (excluding the UK) and two tobacco giants, Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International that has already led to a big decline in cigarette seizures in the EU.The negotiations, conducted under the auspices of the World Health Organisation, marked the first step towards a legally binding protocol on illicit tobacco trade under the WHO’s 152-member Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which took effect in 2005.Other measures envisaged for the protocol, scheduled for adoption in 2010, include strengthened international co-operation to investigate and prosecute smuggling gangs, tougher penalties for illegal activity and better law enforcement, and help for poorer countries to put the measures into effect.Ian Walton-Georges of the EU’s Anti-Fraud Office, who chaired the negotiations, said he planned to draft a protocol that was “practical, effective and strong” ahead of a second round of negotiations later this year.The Framework Convention Alliance, a coalition of some 300 anti-tobacco groups, says the global illicit trade – dominated by organised criminal gangs – may have amounted to nearly 11 per cent of total sales, or 600bn cigarettes, in 2006.Contraband trade is particularly rife in Russia and other countries in eastern Europe, Latin America, especially Brazil, and in Africa and the Middle East. According to the WHO, 5.4m people died of tobacco-related causes in 2006, a figure projected to rise to 8m by 2030, four-fifths of them in developing countries.
236;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-02-06T20:25:06Z;Tobacco brands;;Where does Altria’s plan to spin off Philip Morris International leave the company’s Marlboro cowboy?For decades now, Marlboro has been the only truly global tobacco brand. Other tobacco companies sell their products all over the world, but Marlboro, with an 8.6 per cent share, is the only one that can lay claim to more than 2 per cent of the world cigarette market by volume.That may be about to change. Five other brands now hold at least 1.5 per cent of world market share and sales of all, except Japan Tobacco’s Mild Seven, are growing rapidly. Marlboro, by contrast, appears to be in decline. Its sales peaked in 2000 at 500bn cigarettes and fell to 455bn in 2007.Marlboro is facing multiple challenges. As a premium brand, it prospered between 1970 and 2000 by convincing western Europeans to trade up, but demand there is now sinking, according to AC Nielsen. Growth lies elsewhere. Discount brands Winston (shared by Japan Tobacco and Reynolds) and Philip Morris International’s own L&M are luring two types of customers: economising westerners and smokers in the emerging economies looking to upgrade, but unwilling to pay premium prices. Further down the sales chart, British American Tobacco brands Kent and Dunhill have also stolen a march on Marlboro with innovative packaging. Though their sales are still less than one-tenth of Marlboro’s, they are seen in Russia and elsewhere as trendier and more luxurious, analysts say. Then there is China, which remains essentially closed to outsiders. Five of the top 10 brands are now Chinese.But much of the developing world is still up for grabs. Marlboro’s managers have recently sought to freshen its image with brand extensions, including Indonesian clove cigarettes and Swedish smokeless tobacco. These forays will not be enough. Philip Morris International will need a lot more than its cowboy to stay ahead of the pack.Post and read comments on this Lex
237;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-01-30T19:53:42Z;Footsie lower ahead of rates decision;;Experian was in demand as the wider market drifted lower ahead of the US interest rate decision.Shares in the credit checking company advanced 5.8 per cent to 432½p – the biggest rise in the FTSE 100 – on positive feedback from investor presentations in London and New York.“A useful investor day, including some interesting potential long-term growth avenues. As expected there was little new colour on trading,” Cazenove said, adding that Experian was attractively valued.UBS said it had discovered that Experian’s UK credit services business was more diverse than it had previously thought, with non consumer credit accounting for close to 60 per cent of sales.In the wider market, leading shares moved lower in thin volumes ahead of the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, which came about three hours after the London market had closed.The FTSE 100 finished 47.9 points, or 0.8 per cent, lower at 5,837.3, while the FTSE 250 firmed 3.1 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 9,908.5.Turnover was low with just 2.3bn shares changing hands across the market.Brewer SABMiller was the biggest faller, losing 4.7 per cent to £10.87. Traders noted Altria had made no comments about its 28.6 per cent stake in SAB when it confirmed the demerger of its Philip Morris International cigarettes business yesterday.Meantime, Morgan Stanley warned that unprecedented increases in raw material prices could bring about a structural deterioration in brewers’ profit margins“SAB is almost exclusively operating in markets where affordability drives volume and has admitted that the cost increases have exceeded its own expectations,” the investment bank said.The poor performance of drug company Shire continued. Its shares – £11.49 at the turn of the year – fell a further 3.9 per cent to 889p after Goldman Sachs downgraded from “buy” to “neutral”.The broker cited concerns about sales of Shire’s new attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) drug Vyvanse as the reason for its downgrade.“Following a proprietary survey of ADHD treating physicians, we no longer anticipate acceleration in Vyvanse prescription trends,” it warned clients.Royal Bank of Scotland slipped 3.6 per cent to 385¼p on continued fears that the the bank would need to raise capital to bolster its stretched balance sheet. Citigroup, which cut its target price on the stock to 350p yesterday, said that RBS would need to raise £12.5bn to achieve a European average Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5 per cent.Pub operators were marked higher after Mitchells & Butlers, up 18 per cent to 473p, revealed late in the session that its advisers had received “tentative and preliminary” expressions of interest from several parties. That sent Enterprise Inns up 4.4 per cent to 449½p, and saw Punch Taverns rise 5 per cent to 709½p.Rio Tinto provided the day’s speculative feature. Its shares added 3.2 per cent to £48.19 on rumours that a Chinese investment fund had been given government backing to try and buy a $20bn stake in Rio and block a bid from BHP Billiton, off 0.2 per cent to £14.46.Vodafone, which reports key third-quarter performance indicators this morning, added 1.8 per cent to 176.9p after it was added to the “Europe 1” list of recommended stocks at Merrill Lynch. “We expect Vodafone to outperform in 2008 and see the 8 per cent drop year to date as a buying opportunity,” analyst Graham Ruck said, setting a 217p target price.Smith & Nephew, the medical devices group, put on 2.8 per cent to 654p after Deutsche Bank set a raised target price of 800p. “Our in-depth review of S&N’s prospects through 2010 suggests that our consensus forecasts could be too low and may significantly underestimate the improvements S&N’s new management team has been making in all divisions,” it said.Among mid-caps, Cairn Energy eased 2 per cent to £25.08 on talk today’s trading update could disappoint. Cairn has yet to secure approval to build a pipeline to transport oil from its Rajasthan field in India.Mapeley, the property outsourcing group, rose a further 3.7 per cent to £14.15 on talk that it had refinanced short-term debt.
238;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-01-29T21:19:20Z;Strong day for London but not Imperial Tobacco;;On a strong day for the London market, Imperial Tobacco lagged behind. Shares in the maker of Lambert & Butler cigarettes eased 0.2 per cent to £23.65 as investors switched into rival British American Tobacco, up 1.8 per cent to £17.73.That move was prompted by Citigroup, which criticised Imperial’s decision, announced last Friday, to launch a bid for control of Logista. Imperial owns 60 per cent of Logista as a result of its £8.8bn acquisition of Franco-Spanish tobacco group Altadis.“First, it will mean the rights issue required to purchase Altadis will be £200m bigger and second, at least for now, about 8 per cent of Imperial’s earnings will be derived from logistics, which we regard as inferior quality business to tobacco,” analyst Adam Spielman said.Mr Spielman said there were other reasons why investors should favour BAT over Imperial, including valuation, increased competition from Philip Morris International and the fact that BAT is the price leader in most of its main markets.In the wider market, leading shares bounced back from Monday’s losses as a larger than expected increase in US durable goods orders calmed recession fears.With investors nevertheless still betting the US Federal Reserve would cut interest rates again today, the FTSE 100 closed 96.3 points, or 1.7 per cent, higher at 5,885.2. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 added 264.9 points, or 2.8 per cent, to 9,905.4.Mining stocks dominated the blue chip leaderboard.Xstrata advanced 5.9 per cent to £37.19 on talk that Vale of Brazil had secured funding of about £25bn for a potential takeover bid. The rumour in the market was that Vale would now press ahead with an offer of £40 a share, in cash and stock.Meanwhile, Antofagasta added 6.7 per cent to 669½p, while Anglo American climbed 5.8 per cent to £26.08 and Kazakhmys rose 4.7 per cent to £11.93.Carnival, the cruise ship operator, eased 0.8 per cent to £20.84 after lowering first quarter earnings guidance because of higher fuel prices and lower spending on board some of its liners.Alliance & Leicester, off 3.5 per cent at 700p, underperformed after the mortgage lender warned losses on complex financial instruments had trebled to £185m. MF Global said there was a chance A&L would now be forced to cut its dividend.Traders also pointed out that A&L was the most expensive stock in the sector, trading at 1.9 times book value. In contrast Bradford & Bingley, 4.2 per cent stronger at 260p, trades on 1.1 times book value.Kingfisher added 4.1 per cent to 143p ahead of presentations by Ian Cheshire, the new chief executive, to store managers and investors. “We believe the plan for B&Q will then [after the presentations] be a lot clearer, for better or worse”, Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients.In the retail sector, J Sainsbury added 4.2 per cent to 390¾p as investors reacted to news that financier Robert Tchenguiz had increased his holding in pub company Mitchells & Butlers, up 5 per cent to 401p, to just over 22 per cent. Traders said the move eased fears that Mr Tchenguiz would be forced to sell his 10 per cent interest in Sainsbury.British Airways added 5.1 per cent to 329p as short sellers closed positions ahead of Friday’s third quarter trading statement. The talk in the market was that an airline based in the Middle East could announce a stake alongside the update.Among mid-caps, Debenhams, the department stores group, climbed 7.1 per cent to 71¾p after Milestone Resources declared a raised holding of 9.1 per cent. Milestone is the investment vehicle of Micky Jagtiani, the chief executive of Dubai-based retailer Landmark.Mapeley, the property outsourcing company, firmed 0.3 per cent to £13.64 on rumours of a management buy-out. Sector watchers, were sceptical, noting that by April Mapeley (market value of £412m) must refinance £260m of short-term debt.In addition, any deal would require the backing of hedge fund Fortress Investments, which controls almost 50 per cent of the company. As Mapeley shares traded as high as £30 as recently as June, traders were not convinced it would sell out now.

240;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2008-01-09T23:33:33Z;Blair’s new role is break with tradition;;By accepting a position with JPMorgan, Tony Blair will be clearing a path into the private sector that former Labour prime ministers have largely chosen to avoid.While there is no template for a life after Number 10, most former incumbents have lolled back on the cushion of inherited wealth and busied themselves writing books, pursuing their hobbies or love of whisky and giving speeches to any American with the money and inclination to listen.Apart from writing, the last two Labour prime ministers before Mr Blair – Jim Callaghan and Harold Wilson – limited their post-Downing Street business activities to, respectively, farming and hosting a short-lived and little-watched television chat show.Lord McNally, political secretary to Callaghan in the 1970s, said the former prime minister gave a few lectures, but became fed up after a couple of talks to audiences who were “only vaguely aware of who he was”. “In those days it was very much the feeling that you took your pension and retired. I don’t think they had any directorships,” he said.So by adding a corporate role to his responsibilities as Middle East envoy, Mr Blair is setting a new standard for his successor Gordon Brown.“Blair breaks the pattern,” said Kevin Theakston, who is writing a book on the lives of former premiers. “Previous Labour prime ministers didn’t take lucrative directorships or business appointments in the way that some Conservatives have.”Several former Tory leaders have found the corporate world to be a rewarding sanctuary. Margaret Thatcher acted as a consultant for Philip Morris, the tobacco group, while Edward Heath was a member of the public review board of Arthur Andersen, the accountants, and also had strong connections with the Chinese regime, regularly travelling there as an honoured guest.But the most relevant example for Mr Blair is perhaps Sir John Major – the youngest former prime minister in about a century when he left office – who became the European chairman of Carlyle, the private equity group, and director of Mayflower, the car components and bus company.While the income from Mr Blair’s new position in finance will be a welcome contribution towards his less than austere lifestyle, he is by no means facing the money woes that blighted some of his predecessors.Herbert Asquith, for instance, found himself so badly off that his friends organised a public appeal in The Times to pay off his debts and give him a pension. His successor David Lloyd George was forced to call upon the largesse of Andrew Carnegie, the American steel magnate.But since the time of Lloyd George, who was given the equivalent of a £3m advance for his own memoirs, writing has been the most lucrative pursuit – as well as the best way to settle old scores. Baroness Thatcher’s memoirs earned her £3.5m while Mr Blair has secured a deal worth £5m.Other former prime ministers found pleasure writing more obscure works, from Heath’s best-sellers on sailing and the Christmas carol to Balfour’s essays on such matters as “Decadence” and “Theism and Humanism”.While the generous salary and significant responsibilities make it clear why Mr Blair is interested in his new job, some might question why banks would hire politicians. “You wonder what they see in them, as to some extent they are wasting assets,” said Prof Theakston. “Blair knew notoriously little about economics. He was always a big picture man, not a policy-focused prime minister.”
241;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-12-17T19:11:54Z;Loews moves to spin off Lorillard;;Loews, the insurance-to-hotel group controlled by the Tisch family, is to sever its 40-year ties with its $14bn tobacco business Lorillard, in a move that underlines the US conglomerate’s desire to capitalise on the slowing domestic economy.The spin-off of Lorillard – maker of Newport menthol cigarettes, the second-largest brand in the US – will enable Loews to tap into investors’ renewed appetite for tobacco companies, which are less exposed to an economic downturn.The separation of Lorillard – acquired by Loews in 1968 – is also aimed at lifting the threat of tobacco litigation from the rest of the group, improving its credit rating and reducing the cost of raising funds for acquisitions.The move by Loews suggests conglomerates and other value investors such as Warren Buffett are looking to the liquidity squeeze and deteriorating economic environment as an opportunity to reshape their portfolios and make acquisitions.Analysts said independent Lorillard – which last year had revenues of $3.8bn and profits of $826m, about a third of Loews’ total earnings – could be a target for tobacco groups looking to improve their fortunes in the slow-growing US market.Chas Manso de Zuniga, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, said: ”The part that makes Lorillard attractive is …Newport, which is the leader in the menthol segment of the cigarette industry and a premium brand.”In August, Louis Camilleri, chief executive of Altria, parent of the world’s largest cigarette maker Philip Morris, said a planned split between its fast-growing international unit and its US business would provide “a potential acquisition currency” for both units. Philip Morris USA, which had $18.5bn in revenues last year and control of the dominant Marlboro brand in the US, lacks a dominant menthol cigarette brand.Altria declined to comment.Lorillard, whose stock market value is partly captured by shares in Carolina Group, a tracking stock issued by Loews, was valued at about $14bn on Monday.Jim Tisch, Loews’ chief executive, told the Financial Times the Lorillard spin-off move was driven by the desire to increase shareholder returns and improve Loews’ ability to hit the acquisition trail.“We are here to create value for our shareholders,” he said. “As a result of the transaction, there will be a dramatic improvement in our perceived risk profile”.Mr Tisch added that the Lorillard spin-off should prompt Wall Street analysts to revaluate Loews. He said the company was largely followed by tobacco analysts rather than conglomerates specialists, adding that he wanted Loews to be covered by the same analysts that follow Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.However, Moody’s, the credit rating agency, on Monday said it would retain its Loews’ rating unchanged.Under the terms of the deal, expected to be completed in the middle of next year, investors in Carolina Group will receive new shares in Lorillard.Loews will also exchange the 38 per cent stake it directly owns in Lorillard by distributing it to Loews’ shareholders in exchange for common stock.
242;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-12-14T18:52:02Z;Japan Tobacco and EU to jointly fight smuggling;;Japan Tobacco International, producer of Camel and Winston, will pay the European Union $400m in a deal to tackle the trade in bogus and smuggled cigarettes, receiving legal immunity in return.JTI will give the EU the sum over 15 years, while the European Commission and member states agree not to bring civil claims against JTI linked to its past behaviour over the manufacture, sale, distribution or storage of cigarettes.The EU loses an estimated €6bn a year in revenues as a result of the illicit market in cigarettes and the union last year accounted for three quarters of worldwide seizures of the illegally traded product.In 2004, the EU dropped money-laundering and smuggling claims against Philip Morris International, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, in a $1.25bn settlement spread over 12 years.Philip Morris said at the time that it hoped the pay-out would help the EU to tackle smuggling and counterfeiting.Under Friday’s deal, JTI will also step up tracking measures, and commit to making payments in the event of seizures of genuine products above certain quantities.Pierre de Labouchere, chief executive, said of the agreement: “It is out investment to protect our brands, our relationship with legitimate wholesalers and retails - but first and foremost our consumers.”Siim Kallas, EU anti-fraud commissioner, said the European Commission was “always open” to negotiations with other cigarette companies on similar agreements.JTI is a subsidiary of Japan Tobacco, the third biggest international manufacturer of tobacco products after market leader Altria - parent of Philip Morris - and British American Tobacco.In the year ended March 31, JTI had total tobacco net sales of $14.4bn. It acquired UK-based Gallaher, maker of Silk Cut, this year.The UK was the only EU member not to participate in the deal. It says it already has legislation to address the illegal trade in cigarettes.
243;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-08-29T23:25:20Z;Altria to split up Philip Morris;;Altria Group on Wednesday said it would split the international and domestic operations of Philip Morris, the world’s biggest cigarette maker, into separate public companies in a long-anticipated move.The fast-growing international unit, Philip Morris International, will be spun off to shareholders, severing it from Philip Morris USA, which is suffering from falling US cigarette consumption. The spin-off is set for next year after a unanimous board vote. Timing will be given on January 30.Louis Camilleri, Altria chief executive, will become chief executive of PMI, whose operations are based in Lausanne, Switzerland, but with a small headquarters office retained in New York. Altria will in effect become PMUSA, led by Michael Szymanczyk, and it will retain its 28.6 per cent stake in the brewer SABMiller.The move will complete the break-up of the Altria conglomerate, highlighted by the closure of the New York headquarters, cutting about 400 parent company jobs with an estimated $250m in cost savings.Altria has restructured, including a spin-off in March of Kraft, its US food unit, to boost value for shareholders as the US tobacco litigation threat receded.The last step marking a milestone in the global tobacco industry was to restructure Philip Morris, which makes Marlboro, one of the world’s most recognisable brands, and PMUSA’s and PMI’s increasingly different business agendas. Mr Camilleri said: “I am convinced that this transaction will enhance growth at both Altria and Philip Morris International.”A standalone PMI would be a fast-growing global contender. It has a 15.4 per cent share of the international cigarette market, but only 5 per cent of its profits come from emerging markets, which make up 60 per cent of international cigarette consumption. Its balance sheet would be strong and its stock would be robust currency to participate in rapid industry consolidation.PMI, which accounts for almost three-quarters of the cigarette makers’ total revenue, has made recent acquisitions in Indonesia and Pakistan and eyed fast-growing Asian and eastern European cigarette markets.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, said: “It’s at this point that we expect the beast to be unleashed…and shareholders will be rewarded.”Separating PMI and PMUSA is likely to cheer Wall Street as it will free both groups to become more efficient. Altria shares were up by just over 1 per cent at $69.80 at the close.Lehman Brothers and Centerview Partners advised Altria.
244;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-08-29T22:05:42Z;Altria splits;;First came the snack break. Altria spun off its Kraft food business, releasing it from the cloud of litigation risk. That made complete sense. Now it is following through with a cigarette break. Altria on Wednesday announced plans for the long-anticipated split between its fast-growing international business (Philip Morris International) and its mature US operations.The split no longer looks as compelling as it did. As litigation risk has subsided Altria has narrowed the valuation gap with international rivals. A few overseas consolidation opportunities have slipped away: Japan Tobacco bought Gallagher of the UK and Imperial is buying Altadis of Spain. And splitting up has its disadvantages. Not least, Altria’s Marlboro brand would be owned by two companies with potentially differing views on how to position it. New product development would no longer be shared.That said, Altria can still justify pressing ahead. First, as regards litigation, a split would theoretically give PMI (almost three-quarters of Altria’s tobacco revenue) a clean bill of health. That could lure in timid investors worried about legal woes returning to haunt the US business. Second, from a business perspective, PMI will have a very different profile. Volumes are growing rapidly, especially in Asia. It has space to grow market share and use its strong balance sheet to pursue what international deals are left. The US business, by contrast, already has 50 per cent market share and volumes are declining. It must focus on building a presence in smokeless tobacco while maximising cash returns to shareholders.Altria has a story to tell. But, given the record of recent demergers, it might take longer than hoped for any benefits to be reflected in the share price of the new companies.
245;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-08-29T20:28:13Z;Wall St rallies led by tech stocks;;Wall Street stocks rebounded strongly on Wednesday after sharp falls in the leading indices on Tuesday.Markets were lifted by the release of a letter from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to Charles Schumer, chairman of Congress’s Joint Economic Committee, saying the Fed is closely watching financial markets and is ”prepared to act as needed” should the economy be threatened.Shares were also bolstered by a resurgent technology sector, Altria’s long-awaited spin-off of Philip Morris International and some better-than-expected earnings results.Rebecca Engmann Darst, equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers, said US shares had in effect “recovered from a sullen, late-session tantrum” on Tuesday, sparked by the release of somewhat dour minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting.She said it showed how at times the markets had strayed from examining fundamentals. “Investors seem more preoccupied with watching a circus freak show than the main attraction of the economy.”The S&P 500 closed up 2.2 per cent at 1,463.76 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.5 per cent to 2,563.16.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.9 per cent higher at 13,289.29 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 2.5 per cent at 787.32.The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was up six basis points at 4.57 per cent.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index fell by 10.2 per cent to 23.63 after two days of sharp rises.The Nasdaq was boosted by healthy rises in several technology shares. Seagate Technology shares rose 3.8 per cent to $25.39 after the leading maker of computer hard-disk drives raised its first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late on Tuesday and several analysts lifted their price targets for the company’s stock.Apple was another strong performer, climbing 5.7 per cent to $134.08 after the company issued invitations to an event next week at which it is widely expected to unveil a new version of the iPod digital music and video player.Google rose 1.3 per cent to $512.88 after the internet search engine said George Reyes, its chief financial officer, would leave by the end of the year.Mr Reyes sparked a sharp drop in Google shares in February 2006 when he made off-the-cuff comments about the company’s need to “find other ways to monetise our business”.Oracle was another technology company in investors’ sights after SAP, the German software maker that it is suing for alleged theft of program codes, offered to settle. Its shares closed 4 per cent higher at $20.13.In other sectors, Altria Group rose 1.1 per cent to $69.80 after its expected announcement that it would spin off Philip Morris International, its tobacco unit. Altria also raised its quarterly dividend by 8.7 per cent to 75 cents a share.In earnings news, Big Lots had its biggest rise since March, gaining 9.9 per cent to $28.91 after the biggest US seller of discontinued goods reported second-quarter earnings above expectations.Borders Group shares rose 1 per cent to $14.94 after it reported a second-quarter net loss of $25.1m compared with a net loss of $18.4m last year. The slimmer-than-expected losses prompted Standard & Poor’s to upgrade the shares from “sell” to “hold”.“While industry conditions remain as challenging as ever, and we expect Borders Group’s turnround to take longer than management projects, the recent 35 per cent slide in share price mitigates further downside risk,” said Michael Souers, the ratings agency’s specialty retail analyst.In a sign that the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis continues to cloud investor sentiment, State Street shares fell 0.3 per cent to $61 on concerns about how credit-market turmoil has hit its managed funds.Mortgage applications fell by 4 per cent in the week to August 24, according to a report released on Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association.Dillard’s shares fell 0.6 per cent to $24.20 after it posted a hefty second-quarter net loss.Amgen was in the spotlight after a US federal court ruled that Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, had been infringing one of the biotechnology company’s patents. Its stock rose 2.4 per cent to $50.19 by the close of trading.Boeing shares were up 1.3 per cent to $96.90 after it said it had secured a $515m Nasa contract to produce the upper stage of the Ares I crew launch vehicle.Shares in PDL BioPharma plunged 20.3 per cent to $18.80 after the developer of technology for cancer medicines announced a restructuring and was downgraded by JPMorgan Chase.
246;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-08-26T17:25:42Z;Altria reaches crossroad on Philip Morris;;The future of the world’s largest cigarette maker, Philip Morris, comes into focus this week, as the board for parent group Altria meets with an opportunity to decide to spin off the fast-growing international tobacco business from the declining US unit.Wednesday’s meeting is highly anticipated by Wall Street for gauging the continuing momentum of US-group Altria’s methodical restructuring. In March, Altria spun off Kraft, its food business.Next on the agenda is the expected spin-off of Philip Morris International (PMI) into a separate company, and away from Philip Morris USA (PMUSA) and falling US cigarette consumption. Altria’s other asset is a minority stake in brewer SABMiller.A standalone PMI would be a fast-growing global competitor with a strong balance sheet. It has a 15.4 per cent share of international cigarettes, but only 5 per cent of its profit comes from emerging markets – which make up 60 per cent of the international cigarette consumption. Its shares would be robust currency for it to participate in rapid industry consolidation.Consideration of the spin-off comes after Louis Camillieri, chief executive of Altria, told shareholders in April that the group’s long-term strategic course including PMI’s future would be examined over the summer.Mr Camillieri said then at its annual meeting: “Over the next several months, we will continue to carefully and diligently examine the benefits of a spin-off of PMI and other possible value-enhancing options.”Altria declined to comment, except to reiterate that the board has a history of meeting every year at the end of August. It is a meeting where the dividend is declared too.Nevertheless, Wall Stall continues to see Mr Camillieri’s words and Altria’s actions as a signal that Wednesday is the crossroads for Philip Morris and PMI. For months, analysts have looked ahead to the board meeting.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, has predicted for months that Wednesday’s meeting would produce the decision to spin off PMI.Christopher Growe, analyst at AG Edwards, said: “We believe the company will announce its intention to spin-off Philip Morris International and increase its dividend by 9 per cent.”He estimates PMI comprises nearly 70 per cent of Altria’s potential break-up value, or roughly $52 per share, because of profits and growth prospects.Filippe Goossens, analyst at Credit Suisse, said: “Following the successful Kraft spin-off, we believe that Altria’s board will likely use its next scheduled board meeting to decide on a potential spin-off of PMI in order to maintain its current momentum.”But Mr Goossens also sees potential merit in keeping Philip Morris units combined, as the stabilised US litigation situation has closed the valuation gap between it and overseas competitors. He, along with other analysts, sees a large share buy-back – as big as $28bn – as an alternative strategy, but that a spin-off is still most likely. Other Altria’s moves signalled that it could be preparing for the spin-off of PMI.In June, the group made PMI self-sufficient, but removing overlaps in cigarette production and shifting remaining US production of PMI cigarettes to Europe by third quarter next year.Altria also has exhibited a methodical approach to restructuring, mirroring Mr Camillieri’s strategy of restructuring in “chronological” order.Altria is expected to use a similar template in a PMI spin-off to that used for Kraft, where it first announced an intent to separate the food group, then in several later steps updated investors on timing.There is also the potential for legal challenges by tobacco litigation plaintiffs to try to block a spin-off of PMI.
247;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-06-11T20:38:59Z;Blow to Philip Morris in class-action suit;;The US Supreme Court ­on Monday reinvigorated some tobacco lawsuits when it refused to allow Philip Morris to fight cases involving deceptive marketing of “light” cigarettes in federal court, rather than in more plaintiff-friendly state trials.The court ruled unanimously that Philip Morris, the big US cigarette maker, could not transfer a class­action lawsuit alleging deceptive marketing of light cigarettes from the Arkansas state court, where it was filed, to federal court. US companies often prefer to fight class-action lawsuits in federal court, which they see as fairer to corporate defendants.Philip Morris argued that the case should be shifted to federal court because the Federal Trade Commission, the US consumer watchdog, closely supervises testing of cigarettes.“We can find nothing that warrants treating the FTC/Philip Morris relationship as distinct from the usual regulator/regulated relationship,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the court. Ruling the other way could have let companies in a wide range of highly regulated industries escape from state courts, against the wishes of Congress, he wrote.The ruling could affect all “lights” cases alleging deceptive marketing, including those involving other tobacco companies. Smokers have filed similar suits in 20 states.The plaintiffs who brought the case said Philip Morris engaged in unfair business practices in marketing its lights brands. The case centred on a federal law that says a “person acting under a federal officer” can shift lawsuits to federal court. Philip Morris argued that the tobacco companies were “acting under a federal officer” by testing cigarettes for tar and nicotine.If that argument had been accepted, it would have “severely damaged the ability of consumers harmed by corporate fraud to achieve a remedy in state court”, said Edward Sweda, senior attorney for the Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University School of Law.The Supreme Court also ruled in several other business-related cases yesterday. The justices decided against imposing new restrictions on how US companies in bankruptcy can handle their pension plans. They also refused to impose minimum wage and maximum hours rules for home healthcare workers who are employed by an employment agency.The court also ruled that companies that voluntarily clean up environmental problems can try to recoup their costs by suing other businesses and the federal government.
248;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-05-21T20:37:12Z;S&P 500 narrowly misses new closing high;;The S&P 500 index failed to set a new closing high on Monday, after the benchmark briefly transcended a record level for the first time since the bursting of the dotcom bubble more than seven years ago.The S&P closed 0.15 per cent firmer at 1,525.10, after it reached a high of 1,529.87 earlier in the day. That peak was above its record close of 1,527.46 set in March 2000 but shy of the intraday high set the same day. Within the S&P, energy and technology were the leading industry groups.Deals and earnings results were in focus as the week began, with investors searching for a catalyst that could extend the past seven weeks of gains for blue chips and put the S&P in record territory.Merger and acquisition activity was led by AllTel, whose shares rose 6.7 per cent to $69.60. TPG Capital and GS Capital Partners, a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, made a $27.5bn, or $71.50 a share, bid for the wireless telecoms company.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards, said the market had been trading quietly, but the latest deal news kept investors mindful that merger activity was unlikely to slow down any time soon.AG Edwards has a year-end target of 1,550 for the S&P, but Mr Wren said: “We could get a surge that takes us above that level in the next few months.”A record pace of buy-outs and hefty stock buy-backs from companies have instilled a bullish backdrop for stocks, analysts said.Monday’s extension of the rally in stocks came as oil prices and Treasury bond yields remained near their recent peaks. Traders said asset allocation out of bonds into stocks had gathered pace last week.Mr Wren said rising Treasury yields were not hurting equity sentiment as “anything below 5 per cent is still reasonable”.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent higher at 2,578.79, with earlier gains pared by a slide in semiconductor stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 13,542.88, after blue chips set a new all-time high of 13,586.03 earlier in the day.Shares in Altria rose 1.3 per cent to $70.85, and the stock was one of the leading blue chips in the Dow.Citigroup believes the tobacco company will soon spin off Philip Morris International, a move that could propel the stock higher. “We continue to reiterate our strong ‘buy’ rating on Altria Group and our conservative $82 price target ahead of the PMI spin-off,” it said.That bullish tone was highlighted by current activity for options on the stock. TradingMarkets Options said put options for Altria that expire in June – contracts that profit should the stock price fall – “are the most under-priced puts of all stocks in our database”.Financial stocks were highlighted by analysts at Bespoke Investment Group. They noted that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan had registered gains of more than 10 per cent “since the subprime-driven declines in late February shook the group slightly”. By contrast, shares in Bear Stearns and Lehman “have basically gone nowhere”.General Electric rose 0.4 per cent to $37.10 after the $11.6bn sale of its plastic business to Saudi Basic Industries.Hologic fell 6.3 per cent to $54, after the medical equipment maker said it would buy Cytyc for $6.2bn, boosting the diagnostic device company by 22.7 per cent to $43.Yahoo slipped 1.3 per cent to $29.35, amid talk that the internet search engine may buy Bebo, a UK social networking site, for about $1bn.Dow Jones fell 3.5 per cent to $51.10, after a research group said News Corp was likely to give up its $60-a-share bid in the face of resistance from the Bancroft family, which wields voting control. News Corp rose 0.9 per cent to $23.90.In earnings, Lowes, the home improvement chain, said first quarter profit fell 12.1 per cent. The results were worse than analysts expected and the company’s shares fell 2.4 per cent to $31.88. Shares in rival Home Depot fell 0.6 per cent to $38.63.Saks reported an 86 per cent slide in first quarter profits from the year-ago period, which included gains on asset sales. Shares in the upmarket retailer fell 6 per cent to $21.33.
249;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-04-19T23:52:16Z;Altria off to a disappointing start;;Altria, the US parent of Philip Morris, the world’s largest cigarette maker, got off to a rocky start Thursday as a pure-play tobacco company as it reported disappointing first-quarter earnings – hurt by weaker than expected US demand.The group, which missed Wall Street estimates, reported a 6 per cent rise in profits to $2.17bn, or $1.03 per share, excluding one-time items and its former food unit Kraft, which it spun off to shareholders last month.Altria decided the time was right to spin off Kraft to focus on tobacco after its US litigation and legal uncertainty has largely cleared. Growth prospects continue overseas for tobacco, as US demand is in likely terminal decline.Reporting earnings for the first time without Kraft, Altria said US industry volume fell 4-5 per cent in the quarter significantly higher than its long-term trend.First-quarter revenues increased 8 per cent to $17.6bn, helped by international tobacco and a weaker dollar. Its shares fell 1 per cent to $69.40.
250;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-04-19T19:36:33Z;Altria’s next move;;The next phase is drawing nearer. Having spun-off Kraft Foods, Altria looks increasingly likely to separate its domestic and international cigarettes businesses.US operations remain a major drag on Philip Morris. Compared with last year, cigarette shipments in the US were down more than 6 per cent in the first quarter. The decline was accentuated by temporary factors, such as advance purchases last year because of an excise tax increase in Texas. The overall market share of Philip Morris USA was steady, with decent gains in the premium segment. But the volume shrinkage of 3 to 4 per cent that Altria envisions for the US market as a whole this year, underlines how challenging the environment remains. Skilful marketing and pricing can only go so far to offset such pressures.By contrast, Philip Morris International remains fast-growing, in spite of a few trouble spots. Brands such as Marlboro still have plenty of potential internationally. A split would also distance PMI further from US litigation risks and give it a more attractive acquisition currency. With regards to the latter, though, global sector valuations are already high by historic standards and investors should think twice before applauding any move by PMI to join the acquisition frenzy. With potential targets already scarce, it could easily end up paying over the odds. Anti-trust concerns would complicate most big deals.A separation might also end up slowing, rather than speeding up the process of gearing up Altria’s under-leveraged balance sheet. Such risks are hard to capture in sum-of-the-parts valuations, which suggest further gains in Altria’s share price in the event of a break-up. But the glee with which shareholders have already rewarded the company in anticipation of this suggests caution is now required. As Sigmund Freud reportedly said, sometimes, a cigar is just a cigar. The same might prove true of the world’s largest cigarette maker, no matter how you slice it.
251;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-03-26T19:43:59Z;Troubled Pakistan;;Pakistan is having a wretched time. In recent weeks it has received a stern rebuke from Capitol Hill and witnessed an ugly backlash against the president’s decision to suspend the country’s top judge – to say nothing of the murky murder of its World Cup cricket coach, Bob Woolmer.Global investors, who have poured money into the country in recent years, should take note. Political risk, normally par for the course when dealing with a military regime, has largely been shrugged off: testament to the US partnership and fruits of the economic reforms carried out by President Pervez Musharraf, who came to power in a 1999 coup. Partly due to those reforms, which helped reduce the fiscal deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product and rolled back state ownership, Pakistan has enjoyed average annual economic growth of 6-7 per cent in the past four years. Foreigners now own 5 per cent or so of the $50bn stock market, and cross-border mergers and acquisitions are on a roll. Standard Chartered of the UK paid $500m for Pakistan’s eighth biggest bank and earlier this month Philip Morris International, the US tobacco company, completed a $350m acquisition.Politics is the biggest stumbling block. Any sign that the extended honeymoon with the US is over, or that President Musharraf’s grip is weakening, would undermine stability. The series of national strikes that kicked off on Monday in protest against his suspension of the Supreme Court judge certainly point to disillusionment with the military leader. But there are other causes for concern. Pakistan is suffering its own fallout from consumer credit – pace South Korea and Taiwan among others. That has implications for the banks, which rushed into consumer finance in the early part of the decade, and for economic growth, which is heavily reliant on private consumption. Cashing in now, with the Karachi stock market up 13 per cent this year and 82 per cent since the beginning of the 2005, could avoid nasty shocks.
252;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-03-17T01:25:22Z;Altadis rejects buy approach from Imperial;;Altadis, the Franco-Spanish tobacco group, early on Saturday rejected an £8bn approach by Imperial Tobacco, saying the unsolicited bid was too low.The move came as Altria – owner of the Philip Morris cigarette brands – considered whether to intervene in the process. People familiar with the matter said they were “looking hard” at the situation.Anticipation of the next move in the battle for the tobacco market prompted sharp moves in the shares of both Altadis and its would-be predator on Friday.Shares in Imperial rose 108p to £23.30, on top of the previous day’s almost 8 per cent rise after its bid for Altadis was announced.Meanwhile, Altadis shares slid by almost 4 per cent in a late-market sell-off as it appeared to be stalling over its response to Imperial.Rejecting the bid early on Saturday, Altadis said in a short statement that it was reviewing its options.“The board…has carefully considered this approach and has unanimously rejected it on the grounds that it does not reflect the strategic value of the company and its unique and diversified assets, as well as their future growth prospects.”Analysts agreed on Friday that Imperial’s bid for Altadis would be the catalyst for “large-scale consolidation in the global tobacco industry”.“[This] might well be Altria’s last chance to bid for Imperial,” said Goldman Sachs analysts. Dresdner Kleinwort said Altria would want Imperial to gain market leadership in the UK.There was also speculation about a counter-offer for Altadis by BAT. Paul Adams, BAT chief executive, said recently that mergers and acquisitions were part of the company’s growth strategy. But he said there was nothing “of any real substance” to buy. “We are always open to acquisitions, but there is nothing at the moment that would offer shareholder value,” he said.“There are a number of businesses which I think would have a good strategic fit with us, but it’s really the finances.”Philip Morris International and BAT declined to comment.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent.

254;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-03-16T20:16:53Z;HMV suffers after gloomy prediction;;HMV dropped to its lowest level for four years after a prediction from a leading broker that the retailer’s core business was in “terminal decline”.This week’s profit warning and radical shift in strategy from Simon Fox, HMV’s new chief executive, underlined the extent to which the internet has changed the way music is consumed.Morgan Stanley said that in spite of sensible attempts to reposition HMV, the physical music and DVD market was deteriorating faster than first thought.Analyst Fred Bjelland, who slashed his price target from 145p to 100p, wrote: “HMV’s addressable markets are in accelerated decline, and Tuesday’s profit warning served as a harsh reminder that the market is not about to get any easier.“Despite being a member of the magic circle, Mr Fox has been unable to pull a rabbit out of the hat.”HMV closed 2 per cent lower at 123¼p, its lowest level since May 2003.The FTSE closed broadly flat at the end of a volatile week as investors’ attention turned to the horse racing at Cheltenham.The FTSE 100 fell back 2.6 points at 6,130.6, leaving the index down 1.8 per cent on the week.The mid-cap FTSE 250 gained 49.7 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 11,269.2.However, it lost 1.4 per cent for the week.It being a Friday, there was no shortage of bid speculation.Imperial Tobacco was again the biggest blue-chip riser, up 4.9 per cent to £23.30, as speculation continued that Philip Morris International would bid for Imperial, the world’s No.4 tobacco company to prevent an £8bn takeover of Altadis of Spain. Peter Czerniawski, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, said Philip Morris could afford to pay £24 a share.J Sainsbury, the retailer, rose 2.4 per cent to 556p as Robert Tchenguiz, the financier, upped his stake to almost 4 per cent and two more suitors were added to the list of potential buyers for Sainsbury.Private equity investors, led by Bain Capital, is said to be putting together a rival consortium to the CVC-led group that is already considering bidding, while unconfirmed reports stated that Reliance Industries, of India, was in talks to buy a stake in Sainsbury, the UK’s No.2 listed supermarket.Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer group, was up 2.8 per cent to £15.25, amid private equity rumours and hopes that the proposed sale of Cadbury Schweppes’s US drinks arm, under pressure from shareholders, could lead to a break-up of Unilever.Andrew Wood, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, was not convinced. He argued that while a break-up of Cadbury was a “no brainer”, splitting up Unilever could be “complex and ugly given that management had just spent the last two years sewing all the pieces together”.Hammerson, the property company, rose 3.6 per cent to £16.00 as talk of a bid from French rival Unibail resurfaced.Of the fallers, plumbing group Wolseley, badly hit by worries over the US housing market, lost 1.9 per cent to £11.99 ahead of its interims on Monday.In the mid-caps, PayPoint, the payment processing group, surged 18.5 per cent to 678p as annual profits came in way ahead of expectations.First Choice added 4.8 per cent to 284p amid talk of an imminent 300p a share bid. Private equity groups were in the frame this week, as was Sergio Mantegazza, the Swiss billioniare. There was talk that Mr Mantegazza could look to merge First Choice with his Monarch airlines operation. Vague bid speculation also sent Regus, the serviced offices group, 5.1 per cent higher to 129¼p, while Premier Oil gained 2.9 per cent to £11.75 amid rumours that the Middle East consortium that tried to buy the exploration company last year could return with a hostile bid.London Stock Exchange weakened 0.6 per cent to £12.13 as index tracker funds trimmed their positions ahead of a change to the exchange’s free float, which takes effect from the close last night. C&C Group was the centre of much speculation, as the maker of Magners cider rallied 7.5 per cent to €10.59 in heavy volume of more than 20m shares.
255;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;US ruling puts new limits on punitive damages;;The US business community on Tuesday won a limited ­victory in the battle to restrain high punitive damage awards, when the US Supreme Court imposed a new constitutional curb on such awards.But the 5-4 ruling, which came in a case involving Philip Morris, the big tobacco company, stopped short of the tough clampdown on punitive damages sought by US business.The court ruled it was unconstitutional for a jury to award punitive damages to punish harm to individuals who were not involved in a lawsuit – as they did in the Philip Morris case, where the jury punished the tobacco company for the injuries to all Oregon smokers, not just the smoker whose widow brought the lawsuit.The court said that amounted to “a taking of property . . . without due process”. It set aside the $79.5m punitive award and sent the case back to the lower court.“To permit punishment for injuring a non-party victim would add a near standardless dimension to the punitive damages question,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the court.“This is a big win for the business community,’’ said Robin Conrad, of the US Chamber of Commerce’s litigation unit. “Today’s decision correctly addresses business’s concern that punishing defendants for harm to those not involved in the lawsuit denies a company the right to defend claims against it.”Philip Morris said the ruling would give it an opportunity “to fully and fairly defend itself in this and other cases”.But the court refused to rule on the larger question of the size of such awards: the punitive award in the Oregon case was almost 100 times compensatory, or actual damages. The US business community had hoped for a clear statement that such an award was excessive.In addition, the court made clear that juries might consider harm to others in determining the size of punitive damage awards – just not directly.The majority said juries could consider such harm in determining the “reprehensibility” of the defendant’s conduct – one factor used in setting the size of a punitive award.“A lot will depend on future cases, whether that is practical protection or mere paper protection,” for defendants, said Mark Levy of Kilpatrick Stockton, a law firm.Still, the ruling is good news for tobacco companies and drug companies such as Merck, which faces more than 27,000 lawsuits over its painkiller Vioxx.■The US Supreme Court overturned a $79m antitrust award against Weyerhaeuser, the lumber producer, in a ruling that will help to shield companies from claims that they illegally tried to drive a competitor out of business, Bloomberg reports.The ruling is a victory for large US companies, giving them more room to bid aggressively for raw materials and other supplies without the risk of violating federal antitrust laws. Dow Chemical, Verizon Communications, Coca-Cola and Microsoft were among the companies that supported Weyerhaeuser.
256;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Imperial’s empire adds a surprise Commonwealth;;"Market should prefer this to a mega-dealImperial Tobacco’s unexpected $1.9bn (£971m) purchase of a small US cigarette-maker has many virtues. One is that it has shown up speculators and City analysts. Distracted by the potential for juicier-sounding deals – Altadis-Imperial, Philip Morris-Imperial, private (yawn) equity-Imperial – they ignored the charms of Bowling Green, Kentucky, home to Commonwealth Brands.Gareth Davis, Imperial’s chief executive, put it neatly on Thursday: “We all get besotted by scale and the mega-deal.” The markets rewarded him by marking down the shares by 61p to £21.70, partly on the grounds that Commonwealth’s US presence is an antitrust poison pill against any Philip Morris approach (assuming the US group does not step in before the deal is completed).Imperial was until Thursday bent on a “roll-your-own” approach to the US, building on its acquisition of Rizla 10 years ago. But that was a slow and comparatively costly strategy. Commonwealth, growing in the US discount cigarette sector, accelerates Imperial into the world’s second- largest market, still responsible for 20 per cent of cigarette profits. As for the risk of lawsuits, Commonwealth’s brands were not available until the early 1990s, by which time almost all potential litigants must have known they might be killed by them. Tough logic – but the sort of cold-hearted reasoning that should mean the advantages of the Commonwealth acquisition outlast short-term disappointment about the lost chance of a bigger deal at Imperial.King rewards knightJustin King seems to be reminiscing about his years at Asda as he mulls a possible future in the arms of CVC and friends. J Sainsbury’s chief executive told 500 store managers in a conference call this week not to worry about a possible change of ownership. Apparently Wal-Mart’s arrival at Asda was no bad thing in that it helped “galvanise” the group.The prospect of private equity snapping up Sainsbury no doubt also galvanises Mr King, given that the consortium wants to keep him and would pay him handsomely. But he will not be the only chief executive rubbing his hands. Sir Terry Leahy of Tesco must be delighted. It is easy to add market share when competitors are on the back foot. Tesco went from strength to strength in 2003, for instance, as suitors fought to take over Safeway.But Tesco’s strength has not only fed off others’ weaknesses. Since 1997, Sir Terry has ploughed his furrow with steely determination, never wavering from his four-point plan to make the UK business grow, expand internationally, develop non-food lines and move into other retail services such as savings accounts, pet insurance and internet shopping.As with Safeway, if and when a firm bid emerges for Sainsbury, others will put their hats in the ring. There is a slim chance that Stuart Rose, the chief executive of Marks and Spencer, will be among them. But he would be far better to learn from Sir Terry, the businessman he most admires, and carve his own strategic path than look to Sainsbury as his next big thing.Inside another empireTime was a listed company that had refocused its business, reduced its debt and cut its pension deficit, as Imperial Chemical Industries has done, would be left alone for a few years to pursue its strategy. But, as Alan Brown, ICI’s chief financial officer, says: “We’re playing in public now, with a crowd watching us.” The company is the object of persistent takeover speculation – with private equity firms, or, perhaps more likely, a competitor like Akzo Nobel (once the flotation of its Organon Biosciences subsidiary is out of the way) as possible bidders.Imperial Tobacco may have insured itself against immediate takeover but the passing of another “Imperial” company into foreign hands would still distress some patriots of UK plc. Sentiment aside, however, the situation is keeping ICI’s managers on their toes. With the shares on a forward price-earnings multiple of 14.5, based on UBS’s forecast of £515m for pre-tax profits in 2007, the company, which, following recent disposals, will specialise in paint, adhesives and starch, trades at a premium to peers in the sector. Its stock has risen 20 per cent in the past four months and the drop in the share price after yesterday morning’s announcement of a fall in fourth-quarter earnings revealed how sensitive the price is to the slightest disappointment.Management sees this rather differently. ICI now reveals more, for instance, about its National Starch business, which it has broken out into four components in the hope that investors will take a closer look. It thinks such valuable assets should provide a more durable foundation for the stock price than bid rumours. Of course, improved transparency also makes it easier for buyers to see how they might mount a takeover – but that is how the modern, post-imperial game is played.Sainsbury: elizabeth.rigby@ft.com

257;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-02-08T14:25:30Z;FTSE slips despite rate hold;;Imperial Tobacco was one of the biggest FTSE 100 fallers on Thursday falling 2.7 per cent to £21.70 after the cigarette maker surprised the market by announcing plans to enter the US through the acquisition of Commonwealth Brands for almost £1bn.Traders said the deal made it more difficult for Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, to launch a bid for Imperial as it would run into antitrust problems.But analysts countered by saying that it would be easy enough for Altria to dispose of Commonwealth if it bid for Imperial.Smith & Nephew bucked a weaker market in London on Thursday gaining 6.1 per cent to 613p after the medical devices group impressed investors with better-than-expected full year results and a $1.5bn share buyback.In the wider market, the FTSE 100’s recent strong run came to an end as investors paused to digest a flurry of results and decided to bank some profits.The FTSE 100, which hit a six-year high on Wednesday, closed 23.1 points, or 0.4 per cent, lower at 6,346.4, while the FTSE 250 faded 60.1 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 11,441.9.Reckitt Benckiser, up 4.5 per cent to £25.95, was in demand after its full-year results beat expectations.Better-than-forecast figures were also behind the advances in BG Group, up 4.2 per cent to 725p, BT Group, 1 per cent stronger at 319¾p, and GlaxoSmithKline, 1.6 per cent higher at £14.22.HSBC dipped 1.5 per cent to 917p as investors responded to news that its bad debt charge for 2006 would be around $10.6bn (£5.4bn) – or 20 per cent above forecast – because of problems at its US mortgage business.On a more speculative tack, Scottish & Southern Energy eased 0.6 per cent to £15.23 in spite of talk that it could be a takoever target for EDF.Away from the insurers, St James Place, the upmarket life assurer, was the top performer. Its shares gained 4 per cent to 476¼p on vague talk that HBOS, off 0.3 per cent at £11.31, might make a bid for 40 per cent of the company it does not own.Elsewhere, Forth Ports gained 1.4 per cent to £21.76, although traders said the rise had little to do with fresh takeover rumours. They pinned the advance on news that Cemex, the Mexican owner of RMC, had been granted approval to build a £27m port facility at the Port of Tilbury, which is owned by Forth.Investec Securities said the news was further evidence that Forth should benefit from the 2012 Olympics and the regeneration of Stratford in east London.British Energy sank 4.8 per cent to 419p in heavy volume of 19m on worries ahead of Tuesday’s third-quarter results. Investors will scour the results statement for news on when its Hinkley Point and Hunterston power stations will come back on line.Just before Chiristmas, British Energy said the stations would return to service before the end of March.Mitchells & Butlers firmed 1.5 per cent to 763p on talk financier Robert Tchenguiz might add to his 15 per cent stake in the pub group. Earlier this week, Mr Tchenguiz banked a €300m (£198m) profit from selling his shareholder in Sampo, the Finnish insurance company.Emap, the magazine publisher and radio group, gained 0.6 per cent to 778½p on talk that it is vulnerable to a bid from a private equity group.
258;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-02-04T22:46:48Z;Siemens chief makes case for conglomerates;;Klaus Kleinfeld, Siemens’s chief executive, has warned that investors live in an “Alice in Wonderland” world, spurning conglomerates in favour of single-industry companies even though this strategy could hurt them in the long run.Mr Kleinfeld declined to comment on a €420m ($544m) bribery scandal that has raised questions about the management of the German industrial group, which has 475,000 employees in more than 190 countries, and operates 60 business units.However, he rebuffed the growing perception that conglomerates’ size and complexity makes it impossible for top management to prevent strategic mistakes and irregularities.In an interview with the FT, Mr Kleinfeld launched an impassioned defence of conglomerates.His comments come as the pressure of capital markets and acquisitive private equity buyers are forcing many sprawling groups to break up. Last week, Altria, the owner of Kraft Foods and Philip Morris, and the toilets-to-brakes group American Standard announced that they would disband, after similar moves by Cendant and Viacom.By contrast, shares in more focused companies like Google and Apple are hovering around all-time highs.Mr Kleinfeld said that when the global economy slowed down and the business cycle turned, conglomerates would offer investors long-term financial stability, risk diversification and the strength of large management teams.“When you are in an up-cycle and the capital markets have plenty of opportunities to invest in single-industry companies . . . investors savour those opportunities,” he said. “[But] when things change, pure plays go down faster than you can look.”Mr Kleinfeld said part of the problem was the inability of diversified companies adequately to explain the advantages of their model to investors. He added that in many cases capital markets were in an “Alice in Wonderland situation where investors don’t listen”.His comments echo the beliefs of other business leaders such as Jeffrey Immelt, of General Electric, who have extolled the advantages of modern-day conglomerates.Others argue conglomerates are an anachronism in today’s liquid and fast-moving equity markets.Mr Kleinfeld, who is also on the board of Citigroup, another diversified company that has been under pressure to break up after setbacks, denied that conglomerates were becoming too complex to manage.He did not comment on Citigroup but said that conglomerates’ top management could exert wide-ranging influence by recruiting good managers and setting strict targets and procedures to monitor business performance.Additional reporting by Richard Milne in Frankfurt
259;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-02-02T18:53:02Z;Sainsbury leads FTSE higher;;Imperial Tobacco climbed to a fresh all-time high on Friday but the J Sainsbury takeover story took centre stage in London.The catalyst was a research note from one of the tobacco sector’s most respected analysts arguing that the cigarette manufacturer was a target for the owner of Marlboro.Philip Morris International is due to separate from parent company Altria next month and is widely expected to join in the sector consolidation that began with Japan Tobacco’s $19bn approach to Gallaher.Michael Smith, analyst at JP Morgan, noted comments this week from Louis Camilleri, Altria chief executive, that there were “no limitations” to Philip Morris’s ability to complete a large debt-financed tobacco deal.Mr Smith said Imperial Tobacco was the most likely target and the US group could afford to pay up to £28 a share: “We estimate Philip Morris is already essentially debt free and could [complete] debt finance deals in excess of $30bn”. Imperial Tobacco shares closed up 4 per cent at £21.75.In the wider market, shock news that a private equity consortium was considering a bid for Sainsbury sent the FTSE 100 to within a whisker of its six-year high in heavy volume of 4.2bn shares. The index rose 28.7 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 6,310.9 while the FTSE 250 jumped 121.8 points, or 1.1 per cent, to an all-time high of 11,343.3. Over the week, the blue-chip index rose 1.3 per cent while the mid-caps jumped 2 per cent.The approach for the UK’s third largest supermarket chain sent its shares 13.9 per cent higher to an eight-year peak of 507p amid speculation that the consortium would look at a sale-and lease back deal for Sainsbury’s property portfolio, worth £7.5bn according to some estimates.Fellow grocers Wm Morrison and Tesco rose 5.9 per cent to 300¾p and 3.7 per cent to 435p respectively while Marks & Spencer added 4.1 per cent to 717½p and B&Q owner Kingfisher rose 3.5 per cent to 252½p.Other property-backed stocks also gained including Enterprise Inns, up 2.8 per cent to 665½p, and Mitchells & Butlers, 4.4 per cent higher at 736p. The All Bar One owner was further boosted as it was added to Goldman Sachs’s “conviction buy” list. Brewer Marston’s, the former Wolverhampton & Dudley, rose 3.2 per cent to 443¾p. There were also rumours of predatory interest from a private equity house.Elsewhere, Prudential firmed 2.1 per cent to 705½p amid rumours that the life assurer could be a takeover target for HSBC, up 0.3 per cent to 935p. Traders said there could be something in the speculation. Prudential is seen as more attractive now it has sold Egg, its loss-making internet bank, while HSBC wants to more double the profits it makes from insurance in the next five years.Of the fallers, a flurry of downgrades dragged Royal Dutch Shell 1.8 per cent lower to £17.07 as this week’s news of record profit was overshadowed by fears of rising capital expenditure and modest production growth.Sage Group fell 1.8 per cent to 272p after the accounting software group was downgraded by Merrill Lynch. Centrica lost 1.4 per cent to 371p as Morgan Stanley said gains for the gas company’s shares had been “overdone”.Meanwhile, mining stocks were unsettled by rumours that a hedge fund had run up large losses in the commodities market. Rio Tinto fell 2.2 per cent to £26.91.Crest Nicholson rose 0.9 per cent to 621.5p on talk of a rival bid for the housebuilderLower down the market, Tanfield gained 12.8 per cent to 84p as the zero-emission vehicle technology group signed a deal to supply its battery powered Newton vans to Marks & Spencer.Hogg Robinson improved 1 per cent to 100p after Kaupthing Bank cleared an overhang by placing 7.5m shares at 99p. Kaupthing also handled an order of 7.8m shares in Intec Telecom, up 0.6 per cent to 43p, for a client, and was the most active broker in Sainsbury yesterday, turning over 40m shares.Interactive World, the digital media content business spun out of the Daily Sport, climbed 13.8 per cent to 87½p after an upbeat trading statement.However, Dawson International, the cashmere group that supplies Prada and Gucci, slumped 13 per cent to 5.87p as takeover talks ended without agreement.
260;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-02-01T21:03:53Z;Altria chief’s clear view of the tasks ahead;;"The last time Louis Camilleri gave an interview, in 2003, he accompanied his remarks about the future of Altria, the tobacco and food conglomerate he led, with occasional puffs on a Marlboro Light.Almost four years to the date, much has changed.Mr Camilleri faces the press with not a whiff of smoke in sight, in compliance with the “no smoking” signs dotted around Altria’s elegant Manhattan headquarters in the shadow of Grand Central Station.He is no longer in charge of Kraft Foods, having just announced its long-awaited spin-off from Altria’s Philip Morris tobacco businesses.Mr Camilleri’s years spent out of the limelight have also been marked by significant changes in the regulatory and competitive environment.Several US states have imposed tough rules on smoking, including banning smoking in offices and public places, and many more are considering it.However, the threat of litigation that had been hanging over Altria and its rivals for decades has receded and is now at the lowest level in years.Part of the rationale for the Kraft spin-off is that the tobacco industry’s survival is no longer threatened by massive damage claims that might have had to be met by the food business’s cash.But with domestic consumption in the US market, where Altria has a 50-plus per cent market share, inexorably declining, and competition abroad increasing, life as the leader of a stand-alone tobacco company promises to be challenging.Three significant items stand on Mr Camilleri’s to-do list in the face of these challenges. He must get tobacco federally regulated in the US; move into the growing smokeless tobacco products market in the US; and grab more of the enormous and growing international cigarette market – particularly in Asia.On the domestic front, Altria and Philip Morris USA (PM USA) are championing government oversight of the industry by the Food and Drug Administration.Senator Edward Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Health Committee, and Representative Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, are soon expected to introduce legislation that would give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco. Introduction of such a bill could come as early as next week.Mr Waxman said: “Tobacco is the only product that when used as directed kills, and it is mindboggling that it remains unregulated.”Many proponents of federal oversight believe any regulatory framework should include smokeless products – a market Philip Morris is planning to enter.“We – and PM USA – believe quite strongly that [regulation] would be in the best interests of the entire industry,” Mr Camilleri told the Financial Times.“It would bring a lot of clarity and ultimately it would assist our common objective, which is to reduce the harm caused by smoking.”RJ Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of Reynolds American, is more cautious, fearing regulation could put them at a competitive disadvantage.“We’re ok with reasonable regulation. But reasonable for us may not be reasonable for someone else,” said a company spokesman.Internationally, Mr Camilleri faces a different challenge – pushing Philip Morris International (PMI) to capture more of the huge cigarette markets in developing countries.China accounts for 35 per cent of the world consumption of cigarettes, and markets including India and Vietnam also beckon.Mr Camilleri said: “Less than 5 per cent of PMI’s income today comes from markets that represent more than 60 per cent of world consumption of cigarettes. Last year our share of the world market was only 15.5 per cent, so that gives you a sense of what we believe is our growth potential across the world.”With all the changes in the past years, Mr Camilleri acknowledges that Wall Street continues to look for more."
261;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-02-01T18:48:16Z;American Standard to break up;;American Standard is to break up into three, unravelling a $10bn toilets-to-brakes group dating back to the 19th century and sounding another death knell for out-of-favour US conglomerates.The decision by American Standard to spin off its vehicle controls business, sell its bath and kitchen products division and retain its air-conditioning division reflects growing investor dissatisfaction with sprawling groups.The disenchantment is a rejection of the notion – popular in the 1960s and 1970s – that conglomerates’ vast array of businesses offered investors protection from swings in the economic and business cycle.The current trend in favour of more focused companies such as Google and Apple has contributed to the demise of several diversified groups and raised questions over the strategies of some of the surviving ones, such as General Electric and Citigroup.This week Altria announced the spin off of Kraft Foods from its Philip Morris tobacco business, while scandal tainted Tyco is to break itself up into three in the next few months, mirroring moves by the property-to-travel group Cendant and the media group Viacom.Pressure on conglomerates to break up has been intensified by the rise of private equity funds, which have often used their vast cash resources to buy divisions of large groups.Analysts said that buyuot groups or foreign buyers, possibly from China, could bid for American Standard’s bath and kitchen unit. The business has been hit by high commodity prices and unsuccessful products, but its brands are popular in Europe and America.The vehicle controls division, called WABCO, could also be bought before the planned spinned off on the stock market, industry experts said.Fred Poses, American Standard chairman and chief executive, echoed the sentiment of many business leaders and investors when he said the break-up was the “best way to enhance shareholder value.”Although shares in American Standard, which began as a tinware shop in Massachussets in 1872, have risen more than 35 per cent over the past year, Mr Poses said the three businesses would be better off on their own.The surviving company is to take the name of the $6.8bn air-conditioning unit Trane. Investors reacted positively to the break up, sending American Standard shares more than 7 per cent higher in New York midday trading – the biggest gain in over six years.
262;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-02-01T02:10:03Z;Altria ready to spin off Kraft;;"Altria Group, the world’s largest tobacco company, wants to expand its international operations and offset sagging US consumption with smokeless tobacco products after spinning off Kraft Foods, Louis Camilleri, its chief executive, said.Mr Camilleri said the separation of Kraft from Philip Morris, whose brands include Marlboro, would leave both companies free to pursue acquisitions and focus on expansion.The move, announced on Wednesday, unravels a combination built two decades ago in a more uncertain time for the industry.Tobacco companies sought to diversify into more highly valued food businesses amid the threat of litigation and lack of opportunities outside the western world.“Tobacco has grown faster than food,” Mr Camilleri said. “All our competitors are pure-play tobacco companies and I think today focus is very important…the market rewards focused players rather than diversified conglomerates”.Mr Camilleri, who will step down as chairman of Kraft, said the tobacco company’s greatest opportunities were in developing economies such as China and India. “Less than 5 per cent of Philip Morris International’s income today comes from markets that represent more than 60 per cent of world consumption of cigarettes,” he said.“Last year our share of the world market was only 15.5 per cent so that gives you a sense of what we believe is our growth potential across the world.”Analysts expect Wednesday’s spin-off to be followed by a separation of the faster-growing international tobacco operations from the profitable but mature US business as early as this year. A split would enable Switzerland-based PMI to take advantage of its strong balance sheet for investment and acquisitions.In the US, where cigarette consumption has been falling for decades, Altria is looking to growth markets such as snuff and chewing tobacco.Mr Camilleri said Altria was to launch several products and look for acquisitions. “We probably have been slow at developing our own products. We like to come up with products that are innovative and we believe we have reached that point on several
levels,” he said.The spin-off of Altria’s 89 per cent stake in Kraft will take place on March 30, with Altria shareholders receiving about 0.70 of a Kraft share for every share of Altria they owned.Altria and Kraft reported divergent fourth-quarter earnings. Altria’s profit rose from $2.29bn, or $1.09 a share, a year ago to $2.96bn, or $1.40 a share, while Kraft’s net income fell 19 per cent."
263;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-01-29T18:25:45Z;FTSE falls amid defensive shift;;British American Tobacco was among the few talking points in a quiet London market on Monday.Its shares topped the FTSE 100 leaderboard, rising 2.8 per cent to a record high of £15.60.Traders said BAT was in focus ahead of results and demerger news from Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, later this week.They added that in spite of its recent strong run, its shares still looked cheap compared to rivals such as Imperial Tobacco, up 0.8 per cent to £21.24, and Altadis.However, BAT was also buoyed by speculation that it could increase the amount of cash it returns to shareholders.In a recent note, Citigroup estimated that BAT could return £1.5bn to shareholders without a downgrade to its credit rating. At the moment, BAT is returning £500m a year.In order to do this BAT would need to increase its distributable reserves and amend a standstill agreement with its US partner Reynolds American.However, there are ways round both issues and analysts would not be surprised if the company were already working on a solution.In the wider market, leading shares moved higher in low volume. The FTSE 100 came to rest 11.9 points, or 0.2 per cent, higher at 6,239.9, as strength in tobacco, aerospace and media stocks offset weakness in oils and utilities.Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 fell 13.9 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 11,104 - the first time it has underperformed the FTSE 100 since last Wednesday.Market turnover was poor, with less than 2.5bn shares changing hands. Traders said there was an increasingly jittery feel to the market, with institutions buying downside protection as the yield on the 10-year gilt rose above 5 per cent for the first time since late 2004.On a brighter note, British Airways climbed 2.7 per cent to 542p on relief that a 48-hour strike by cabin crew members of its largest union had been averted.In the media sector, WPP rose 0.8 per cent to 742½p after Merrill Lynch reiterated its “buy” rating and 810p target price. Merrill believes advertising agencies like WPP provide the best hedge against media fragmentation.Meanwhile, Yell Group, publisher of the Yellow Pages, added 1.5 per cent to 608p after a push from the same broker.“Yell is one of the few stocks in the media sector that offers good double-digit earnings growth, with a high degree of visibility, yet trades on a sub-sector valuation,” Merrill said.On the downside, the miserable recent run of Drax Group continued, with shares in the operator of Europe’s biggest coal-fired power station falling a further 3.4 per cent to a three-year low of 675½p.Traders pinned the fall on wholesale gas prices, which for February delivery were trading at 24.85p-a-therm yesterday. According to analysts that means gas-fired power stations can produce electricity more cheaply than stations fuelled by coal.However, further downside in the Drax share price looks limited. At 650p its prospective dividend yield would be over 8.4 per cent and that should provide a powerful support.Sugar producer Tate & Lyle remained in the doldrums. Its shares, which fell sharply last week after a surprise profits warning, shed 2.1 per cent to 582½p after the EU called for 2m tonnes of the European sugar quota to be withdrawn.SABMiller slipped 1.1 per cent to £11.70 after Goldman Sachs removed the brewing giant from its “buy” list, citing valuation. SAB shares have risen 15 per cent in the past six months.J Sainsbury faded 1.1 per cent to 432½p as one shareholder took advantage of the supermarket group’s recent strong run to place 13m shares through Morgan Stanley at 432p each.Away from the blue chips, engineering group FKI rose 5.1 per cent to 113¾p after being tipped in Barron’s.Pub company Mitchells & Butlers improved 1 per cent to 686½p as traders reacted to Friday’s after hours news that financier Robert Tchenguiz had increased his holding to nearly 15 per cent.One theory doing the rounds yesterday was that Mr Tchenguiz could use his holding to pressure the company into creating a Real Estate Investment Trust (Reit) for its property assets. These are currently valued at £5.5bn, or 746p-a-share.M&B was also buoyed by expectations that Thursday’s trading update would impress. Gyrus dipped 1.4 per cent to 403¾p despite UBS starting coverage with a “buy” rating. Setting a 482p price target, it said the medical devices group could be an attractive target for private equity.The personal insolvency sector fell sharply as Friday’s profit warnings from industry leaders, Accuma and Debt Free Direct reined in previous predictions of growth for the industry.Ben Archer, analyst at Charles Stanley, said the outlook for the sector was unlikely to improve until the industry drew up a code of conduct to stem mounting criticism from the banks. Debt Free Direct lost 35.7 per cent to 267p, Debtmatters fell 28.8 per cent to 163p, Accuma eased 19.5 per cent to 84½p, Cleardebt slipped 11.9 per cent to 2¾p and Debts.co.uk fell 9.5 per cent at 118½p.
264;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-01-28T23:53:02Z;Altria to breathe more easily without Kraft;;"Altria Group will this week end a 20-year era marked by tobacco litigation –
and an unusual conglomerate-like structure – with the spin-off of Kraft Foods from its core Philip Morris business.The move, to be announced on Wednesday, is the first step of a broader strategy likely to include the separation of Altria’s international tobacco business from its US operations.Altria’s market valuation is more than $180bn.Its break-up comes as other diversified groups are pursuing similar strategies in response to investor disaffection with sprawling conglomerates.In the next few months, Tyco will try to move beyond its scandal-ridden recent history by splitting into its three main divisions. Cedant, the real estate-to-travel agency group broke itself up last year.Even General Electric, one of the most successful conglomerates, has embarked on a spree of acquisitions and divestitures to refocus on higher margin industries.Altria acquired Kraft in 1988 for $13.1bn cash. Its separation is a sign that the cloud of litigation that has hung over Altria and other US tobacco companies for decades is dissipating.Louis Camilleri, chief executive, first signalled his intention to restructure the company into two or three separate entities in November 2004. But he said it was contingent on improvements in the litigation environment.Moving ahead before at least three outstanding litigation issues were resolved could have exposed the company to charges of “fraudulent conveyance” or disposing of assets to protect them from being used to pay damages.Last year Philip Morris USA, Altria’s domestic arm, won several big legal victories, setting the stage for the break-up.Altria, which also has a 28.7 per cent stake in SABMiller, the London-based brewer, will release details of what will be one of the largest tax-free corporate spin-offs on the day it reports fourth-quarter earnings.David Adelman, analyst at Morgan Stanley, told clients he expected a “plain vanilla” spin-off.Altria is likely to spin its 88.6 per cent stake in Kraft by giving its shareholders 1.46bn Kraft shares. Shareholders would receive about 0.69 of a Kraft share for every share of Altria they own.Mr Adelman expects a spin-off record date some time after March 15 – the approximate record date for Altria’s first quarter dividend – with a distribution date in April.The break-up is expected to unlock value in the tobacco operations as Altria has traded at a discount to the sum of its parts.When Mr Camilleri announced his plans two year ago, he said the group’s conglomerate structure left its tobacco businesses undervalued.On Friday, Altria’s shares closed at about $88. Some analysts put the break-up value of the company closer to $100 a share.With the Kraft spin-off out of the way, Altria is expected to pursue acquisitions, both in the US and overseas. In the domestic market, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes may make a strategic acquisition in the high-margin smokeless arena.Philip Morris International, the company’s growth engine, is also expected to participate in the consolidation of the global tobacco industry.“Given past statements about longer-term acquisition opportunities in the US and elsewhere, we believe Altria ex-Kraft is well positioned to be a buyer of other tobacco assets, notably UST at home and Imperial abroad,” Marc Greenberg, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a report.An independent Kraft will also be able to pursue large stock-based acquisitions, something it cannot do now because Altria must maintain at least an 80 per cent stake in the company in order to arrange a tax-free spin-off."
265;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2007-01-04T22:32:27Z;Australian company pioneers approach;;Australia’s position at the forefront of litigation funding rests in large part in the hands of one company, IMF, which pioneered the approach.While the company went public six years ago, it was a landmark ruling less than six months ago that transformed the group’s prospects. In the so-called Fostif case, the high court decided there was no public policy reason why litigation funding firms should be prevented from financing or co-ordinating class actions on behalf of others.Shares in the group, which had been languishing at below 50 cents, less than half their 2003 peak of A$1.01 (41p), soared to 80 cents.Until then, IMF – which since listing has oscillated between reporting modest annual profits and slipping into the red – had been stymied by a number of applications against it by Australia’s big law firms. They claimed it did not have the right to carry out its business except in the insolvency area, lodging “abuse of process” actions against it.While the actions did not stop IMF from continuing litigation work, it did lead some investors to question its business model.John Walker, IMF’s managing director, explained to the FT this week that in its early years the group had managed to operate successfully because it was “under the radar of the big end of town”.“The cost of justice had gotten to be so much that there was community support for [funding of litigation by third parties],” he reflected.But IMF’s profile increased substantially in 2003 when it won a A$60m settlement from Philip Morris and BAT over a licence fee dispute with tobacco retailers. From then on, its battle with the legal establishment intensified.Demand for its services, nevertheless continued to grow rapidly – at about 100 per cent a year, according to Mr Walker. It shows no sign of slowing.“What we offer is the reverse of the insurance industry. They control and fund the defence of claims,” he said. “We do the same on the plaintiff’s side.”At present, the group, which is only involved in commercial disputes, not in personal injury, has about 70 cases, representing total claims of about A$1bn.Up to a quarter of its work involves insolvency claims with a further third of its business coming from corporate clients who ask it to pursue other types of claims on their behalf – essentially a form of outsourcing.On average, cases last just over three years while IMF typically receives a fee equivalent to about 30 per cent of the net settlement, as well as its costs. About 60 per cent of cases settle out of court, 15 per cent it abandons and, of those that go to trial, it has a success rate of two out of three.
266;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-12-15T18:54:43Z;JT agrees to buy Gallaher for £7.5bn;;"Japan Tobacco has agreed to buy Gallaher for £7.5bn ($14.6bn) in a move that marks the biggest Japanese acquisition overseas and which is expected to spark sector consolidation.At £11.40 a share, the offer price represents a 16 per cent premium to the 979p share price the day before Gallaher announced it had received a bid approach on December 6.Shares in Gallaher closed at £11.55 on Thursday, giving the UK tobacco group a market capitalisation of £7.58bn, after it said it was in formal talks with a bidder. The higher price suggested the market was hoping for a higher offer or a counter-bid.However, Japan Tobacco said that Gallaher’s board had accepted its offer.Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, is to help finance the acquisition via a loan. Gallaher has agreed to pay Japan Tobacco a break fee of £52m if it goes on to accept a higher offer.Other potential bidders are thought to include Altria of the US, Spain’s Altadis and BAT of the UK. But most analysts think no such deal is likely. Altadis is thought too small to buy Gallaher while Altria’s Philip Morris would run into competition problems in Sweden, Austria and Germany. BAT has said it thinks tobacco companies are too highly priced for takeovers.Japan’s leading companies have been scouring the globe for acquisitions this year, flush with cash amid the country’s most prolonged economic recovery since the end of the second world war.Toshiba bought Westinghouse, the US nuclear power plant manufacturer, for $5.4bn; Softbank acquired Vodafone’s Japanese operations for Y1,800bn; and Nippon Sheet Glass bought the UK’s Pilkington for $4.2bn.Japan Tobacco shares closed 3.1 per cent higher at Y597,000 in Tokyo. The stock has surged nearly 15 per cent since it emerged that the company was considering a bid for Gallaher.The acquisition is the biggest deal in the European tobacco industry and will give Japan Tobacco the biggest market share in terms of volume in Russia, Europe’s largest cigarette market.Japan Tobacco, which is 50 per cent owned by the Japanese government, controls about 70 per cent of the Japanese tobacco market. The group owns the Camel and Winston brands outside the US and generates most of its income overseas.Gallaher has been struggling with a long-term decline in cigarette volumes in western Europe. Its four core markets of the UK, Ireland, Sweden and Austria account for about 70 per cent of group profits.The company has also suffered from price wars as well as from higher taxes and from smoking bans in several countries. In the UK, the company has been trying to protect its share of premium sales while increasing its share of the low-price market.Analysts had speculated that Philip Morris International or BAT could both make a rival offer because neither would face competition issues.Founded in 1857 by Tom Gallaher in Londonderry in Northern Ireland, Gallaher became a public company in 1928. It was acquired by American Brands in 1968 but was subsequently demerged in 1997. In 2000, it acquired Russian cigarette maker Liggett-Ducat and in the following year bought Austria Tabak.In addition to Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut, Gallaher’s brands include Mayfair, Old Holborn, and Hamlet.The shares rose 3p to 1158p on Friday.Satoru Aoyama, analyst at Fitch, said: “Japanese companies have been shifting from restructuring mode to growth mode, and since the domestic market is mature in most industries, they are looking abroad to boost their top-line growth.”"
267;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Japan Tobacco stalks Gallaher;;Japan Tobacco made an expected preliminary approach for Gallaher on Thursday, according to people close to the companies, but the offer was less than the current market price.The world’s third biggest tobacco company is offering £11.40 per share in cash for the UK tobacco group, valuing the deal at £7.47bn ($14.6bn). That represents a 16 per cent premium to the 979p share price on December 6, the day before Gallaher announced it had received a bid approach.Shares in Gallaher closed at £11.55 on Thursday, giving the UK group a market capitalisation of £7.58bn, suggesting the market is hoping for a higher offer or a counter-bid from a rival tobacco group.Analysts have speculated that Philip Morris International or BAT could both make a rival offer because neither would face competition issues.Imperial Tobacco is unlikely to look at Gallaher as it already controls around 45 per cent of the UK market. Gallaher controls around 37 per cent of the UK market and owns the Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut brands. On Thursday Gallaher declined to name its suitor in a statement to the stock exchange and said there was no certainty a formal offer would be made. The group has been the subject of persistent takeover speculation in recent weeks and as a result has seen its share price rise strongly.The shares gained 14 per cent over the past five weeks, ever since Japan Tobacco said it had money to fund an acquisition in Europe.An acquisition of Gallaher by Japan Tobacco would be the biggest deal in the European tobacco industry and would also give Japan Tobacco the biggest market share in terms of volume in Russia, Europe’s largest cigarette market.Japan Tobacco is 50 per cent owned by the Japanese government and controls about 70 per cent of the Japanese tobacco market. The group sells the Camel and Winston brands outside the US and generates most of its income overseas.Gallaher has been struggling with a long-term decline in cigarette volumes in western Europe.

268;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-12-07T23:06:28Z;Tobacco stocks light up the FTSE;;"Prudential shares rose sharply yesterday amid talk that the group was close to a sale of its UK life assurance division.The catalyst was a note from James Pearce, analyst at Cazenove, who upgraded Prudential from “in line” to “outperform” and said the company was poised to do just that.Mr Pearce said he believed Mark Tucker, chief executive, was ready to take “decisive action” to fix Prudential’s problems in the UK and said there was a “good chance” a sale would happen soon.“Our analysis suggests that if the UK life operation could be sold …then the stock price could rise to 777p,” he said.The most likely buyer would be Resolution, the life assurance consolidator, up 2.4 per cent to 654½p.A sale of Prudential’s UK life division would make the remainder of the group, which includes the fast-growing Asian operation,
a more attractive takeover target.In heavy volume, Prudential rose 4.2 per cent to 680p, close to its highest level since bid talks with rival Aviva were halted in March. Talk of a takeover sent fellow life assurer Legal & General 2.6 per cent higher to 157½p.In the wider market, the FTSE 100 rose for a fourth consecutive session thanks to merger and acquisition activity in the tobacco sector and a strong start to trading on Wall Street.The blue-chip index closed up 41 points, or 0.7 per cent, at 6,131.5, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 31 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 10,891.3.Dealers were left to consider the complicated jigsaw of possibilities for consolidation among cigarette makers after an approach from Japan Tobacco for Gallaher, up 21.6 per cent to £11.90.BAT, 2.2 per cent higher at £14.55, is rumoured to be ready to launch a counter offer for Gallaher, the owner of Benson & Hedges, as could Philip Morris of the US. Failing that, it is thought Philip Morris could look to buy Imperial Tobacco, up 10.2 per cent to £20.79. Imperial is also seen as a possible buyer of French-Spanish tobacco company Altadis.Barclays rose 3 per cent to 707p amid speculation that one or both of BBVA and Banco Santander, the Spanish lenders, were ready to make a move for the bank. Bank of America was also mentioned as a possible bidder. Although such speculation is not new, dealers noted the strong volume behind yesterday’s move, with more than 80m Barclays shares traded.Royal Bank of Scotland firmed up 2 per cent to £19.54 as analysts raised their estimates a day after the bank said profits for the year would be higher than expected. Deutsche Bank lifted its target price from £20.80 to £21.50.Capita Group rose 2.3 per cent to 592p after UBS raised its price target from 590p to 670p and said the support services company would continue to win contracts from councils looking to outsource services.Next, the clothing retailer, lost 1.7 per cent to £17.50 amid continued mutterings that trading on the high street was poor. AllianceBoots fell 0.8 per cent to 791½p while Argos owner Home Retail Group slipped 0.5 per cent to 403p.In the mid caps, a late rally in Woolworths shares drove the sweets-to-DVDs 15.4 per cent higher to 37½p – above the level the shares were trading at prior to this week’s profit warning. Speculation immediately focused on Baugur, its leading shareholder. There has been talk the Icelandic group would look to break up Woolworths in the new year.Wolverhampton & Dudley, the brewer of Marston’s Pedigree, slipped 1.7 per cent to £17.28 in spite of speculation that Punch Taverns, up 1.7 per cent to £12.08, had appointed advisers to work on a bid for the company.Takeover speculation boosted condoms and sandals company SSL International, up 5 per cent to 371¼p; Biffa, the waste management company, 3.1 per cent higher at 288p; and soft drinks company Britvic, which rose 1.9 per cent to 246½p.Investors were left nursing losses in Premier Oil and Rank Group. Premier fell 10.5 per cent to £12.05 after it said takeover talks, with Dubai Energy, had been terminated.Rank lost 4.1 per cent to 255½p after its much-anticipated trading statement delivered a cocktail of disappointments. Not only was there no bid – as had been strongly rumoured – but the sale of Hard Rock raised less than had been hoped while trading at Mecca Bingo has been hit by the smoking in ban Scotland."
269;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-12-07T20:04:57Z;Tobacco consolidation;;It is a sector that has beaten global equities in each of the past 10 years bar one (1999), and by 277 per cent since 1996 in dollar terms. Yet demand is stagnant and shifting to low-margin developing markets. Its products face bans and punitive taxes and its companies litigation. Tobacco is an unlikely success story. Japan Tobacco’s approach to Gallaher may spark wider consolidation aimed at kickstarting further performance.It is easy to see why deals are on the agenda. Although 12-month forward earnings estimates continue to tick up – by 9 per cent so far in 2006, according to FTSE – the four engines of performance are running out of steam. First, most companies have by now adopted the consumer goods strategy of promoting core brands. Second, bolt-on acquisitions of inefficient businesses are now hard to find and no longer big enough to move the needle. Third, litigation risk has already, as Philip Morris put it recently, “substantially improved”. Fourth, more generous cash payouts – JT excepted – are now reflected in a forward price/earnings ratio, which at 15 times, exceeds the market’s for the first time in a decade.Is consolidation really the answer? The last big deals, aimed at gaining brands and geographic reach, were in 1999, when British American Tobacco bought Rothmans International and JT bought RJ Reynolds International. Recent efforts have been bolt-ons but highly synergistic ones. Imperial Tobacco’s 2002 purchase of Reemtsma generated savings worth 40 per cent of the target’s enterprise value. Global tobacco’s balance sheet is in good nick. Excluding Altria, owner of Philip Morris, net debt is just 11 per cent of market capitalisation. Once Altria spins off Kraft Foods next year, it will have only $2bn of net debt.The small companies will be bought. Gallaher might attract rival interest from BAT. While JT is busy, Imperial could finally tackle Spain’s Altadis. The big risk is that a decade of discipline is blown on deals at decade-high valuations. BAT’s management have expressed this fear. And JT’s then chief executive said valuations were “very expensive” – way back in August 2005.
270;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-12-07T12:49:21Z;Gallaher shares light up;;Today the markets get their first chance to assess Gallaher’s statement that it has received a takeover approach. That announcement came late yesterday, just as most of the UK Companies desk was walking out to a pub quiz.The poor souls who stayed behind or filed from the restaurants will take the story on today, with the focus so far being on the 20 per cent rise in Gallaher’s share price. The approach has come from Japan Tobacco, which owns the Camel and Winston brands outside the US. However, stand by for others – perhaps Altria (Philip Morris) or BAT – to have a go as well. We’ll tell you with whom Gallaher, owner of Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut, would fit (with JT, they would be a powerful force in the former Soviet bloc).Elsewhere, Caffe Nero is being bought by its management and its two leading shareholders for £225m. The independent directors are recommending this 270p offer even though in September they received a higher proposal at 300p from a trade bidder. The higher proposal was conditional on due diligence and on Caffe Nero’s two largest shareholders backing it (they have 43 per cent) but they didn’t want to sell.Premier Oil shares are down sharply after the company said talks with potential bidders were off.A drop in annual profits at First Choice looks a bit better than expected. However, the real story may lie in any update we get on the sale of their mainstream package holidays business (to MyTravel or Thomas Cook, probably) or in what they say about the new air passenger duties announced in the PBR yesterday.Rank confirmed our story about the sale of the Hard Rock Cafe chain for $965m (£490m) to a company set up by Florida’s Seminole Native American Indians. The company will return £350m to shareholders. It also unveiled a decline in bingo revenues and the appointment of a new chairman (Peter Johnson, chairman of Inchcape).Rumours of the Day: Two old favourites: Barclays (up 4 per cent) and SSL (up 5 per cent) are both being lifted on takeover rumours.Make or read a commentSee previous blogs
271;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-12-07T00:45:51Z;Japan Tobacco in talks with Gallaher;;Japan Tobacco, the world’s third-biggest tobacco company, has made a takeover approach for Gallaher, the UK group that owns the Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut brands.The approach is expected to trigger a counterbid for Gallaher, which has a market value of £6.4bn ($12.6bn).Philip Morris is the most likely suitor. BAT and Imperial Tobacco might also be interested but they would face heavy competition issues.People familiar with the situation said on Wednesday night the talks were at a preliminary stage. The two companies have had one discussion.Gallaher has been the subject of persistent takeover speculation in recent weeks. The UK company’s shares have risen strongly over the past two months, gaining 13 per cent to close on Wednesday at 979p.On Thursday, shares of Japan Tobacco surged 5.5 per cent to Y533,000 in midday trading in Tokyo.Gallaher said on Wednesday night it had received an approach but declined to name the company involved. It said there was no certainty an offer would be made.Japan Tobacco, which also owns food and pharmaceutical businesses, controls about 70 per cent of the Japanese tobacco market. A former state-owned monopoly, it sells the Camel and Winston brands outside the US. Japan Tobacco’s international tobacco business is stronger than its domestic operations.International sales rose 12.2 per cent in the six months to the end of September, helped by the growth of Camel in Italy and France, and Winston in Russia, Italy and Spain. Domestic sales fell 8.3 per cent, partly due to higher retail prices.Gallaher, by comparison, has been struggling with a long-term decline in cigarette volumes in western Europe. Its four core markets of the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden and Austria account for about 70 per cent of group profits.It has also been suffering from price wars, especially in Spain, as well as from higher taxes and from smoking bans in several countries. Gallaher has estimated that a UK smoking ban in pubs would lead to a 4-5 per cent decline in smoking volumes.Sales have been stronger in the Commonwealth of Independent States, which includes Russia and Ukraine, but these markets are relatively small for Gallaher.In September, Gallaher reported a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 of £259m, helped by a £23m drop in restructuring costs year-on-year.
272;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-12-04T23:45:31Z;Jakarta tax to hit cigarette maker;;"Gudang Garam, Indonesia’s leading cigarette manufacturer, is likely to be the biggest casualty of the government’s decision to increase minimum prices next March, analysts said on Monday.Beneficiaries are expected to be HM Sampoerna, the number two producer bought by Philip Morris last year for $5.2bn, and, to a lesser extent, Bentoel and privately-owned Djarum.From next March minimum cigarette prices will increase by 7 per cent and an additional graduated charge will be levied on each cigarette. The rise is to ensure that tax revenue from the tobacco industry meets the 2007 budget target, which is increasing 9 per cent from this year to Rp42,030bn ($4.6bn), the finance ministry said.The graduated charge will be Rp7 per cigarette for companies that produce more than 2bn cigarettes a year; Rp5 for between 500m and 2bn cigarettes; and Rp3 for fewer than 500m.Gudang Garam’s market share has been falling for a decade and analysts say there is no end in sight to the slide. Its share fell to 25.9 per cent in the first half of 2006, according to sales figures from AC Nielsen.Sampoerna, which overtook Djarum last year, saw its share rise to 23.5 per cent from January to June.Cigarette producers said on Monday that they were still assessing the likely impact on business.“It will put more pressure on the cigarette industry but we are still calculating how big the impact will be on Bentoel,” said Christianto Tedjo, finance director of Bentoel, one of the five largest manufacturers.Nick Cashmore, an analyst at CLSA in Jakarta, said the producers could not claim the hike was unexpected.“The government is just clamping down on a health issue,” he said. “They
have been flagging it for some time.”"
273;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-11-24T22:52:12Z;Cigarettes and alcohol;;Emerging markets, the last bastion of growth for purveyors of cigarettes and alcohol, are cracking down on bad habits. Thailand plans to ban alcohol ads from next month, while Indonesia is mulling higher taxes on cigarettes.This is a blow for profitability as well as vice. Cigarette manufacturers have assiduously sought to sell more in less health-conscious nations. Philip Morris last year paid $5.2bn for a cigarette manufacturer in Indonesia, a populous country where about 70 per cent of young men smoke. Similarly, brewers endeavour to cash in on countries where binge-drinking is on the rise: young Thais knock back an estimated 8.5 litres of alcohol each year. Others benefit too: tobacco is a big contributor to government revenues in Indonesia, while alcohol advertising helps fill the pockets of the media industry.Yet those who make money from the bad habits of others need not fret too much. Emerging markets typically exhibit fast economic growth and slow legislative processes. Industry lobbyists have clout, and could yet stymie the new proposals. Sin industries are generous sponsors and both Thailand and Indonesia, often in the news for the wrong reasons, need all the help they can get to woo tourist dollars. Thailand’s plans threaten to scotch next year’s Johnnie Walker Classic golf tournament in Phuket and the Bangkok Rock Festival. The government may well surmise there are less painful ways to beat the scourge of alcoholism.
274;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
275;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-10-25T10:56:53Z;FTSE closes above 6,200;;Tobacco stocks were among the standout features as the FTSE 100 closed above 6,200 on Wednesday for the first time since February 2002.Gallaher, the maker of Slik and Benson & Hedges cigarettes led the sector’s advance. Its shares climbed 3.1 per cent to 884½p on a mixture of positive analyst comment and takeover speculation.Cazenove lifted its rating on the company for the first time since June 2005, citing recent share price weakness that has left Gallaher trading at a big discount to rival Imperial Tobacco Group, which reports full-year figures next week. Imperial gained 1.6 per cent to £18.55.News of Cazenove upgrade came as Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, said it would announce the timetable for the disposal of its Kraft Foods business at the end of January.Once Altria has demerger Kraft, traders expect the company to hit the acquisition trial and see Gallaher as an obvious target. They also reckon Gallaher could be in the sights of Japan Tobacco.Meanwhile, British American Tobacco, which reports third quarter earnings today, rose 2.5 per cent to £14.82p. The gains came after Reynolds American, in which BAT, has a 42 per cent stake, announced strong results and a US federal appeals court said it would hear arguments about whether a $200bn tobacco trial can proceed as a class-action lawsuit.Strength in the tobacco sector, coupled with gains for heavyweight oil stocks after positive US inventory data, helped FTSE 100 close 32.1 points, or 0.5 per cent, higher at 6,214.6. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 rose 23.8 points, or 0.2 per cent, to a record high of 10,425.4.Tate & Lyle had another good session. The sugar company was the best FTSE 100 performer, rising a further 3.7 per cent to a record high of 801p, on news that its European starch operation had been up for sale and talk that next week’s half-year results will trigger earnings upgrades.In addition, Deutsche Bank upgraded to “buy” yesterday and set a 900p price target, up from 550p previously, citing the potential of Tate’s value-added ingredients business.GlaxoSmithKline gained 1.5 per cent to £15.11 as traders took positions ahead of today’s third quarter results. The talk in the market yesterday was that the figures would impress and that Europe’s biggest pharmaceutical company might announce an increased share buyback or a disposal.GSK and rival AstraZeneca, off 1.2 per cent at £35.92, also drew support from UBS which upgraded its rating on the sector to “overweight.”“Pharma is trading on the same price earnings ratio as defensive stocks for the first time in 16 years,” UBS said, as it advised clients to switch out of the insurance sector.That call was reckoned to be behind the weakness in Legal & General, off 1.2 per cent at 142¼p, Aviva, down 1.2 per cent to 792p, and Friends Provident, 1.6 per cent cheaper at 192¾p.Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker, slipped 0.3 per cent to 465½p after former house broker Morgan Stanley initiated coverage with an “overweight” rating and 490p target price, citing the likelihood counter offer to Tata Steel’s 455p-a-share bid.Smith & Nephew, the orthopaedic group, slipped 0.7 per cent to 510¾p on concerns that it could be the rumoured bidder for US rival BiometFund management group Henderson Group was the top performer in the FTSE 250 and main talking point. It shares closed 4.9 per cent higher at 112p after another session of heavy trading. Over 30m shares changed hands on top of 23m on Tuesday.Predictably some traders attributed the rise to rumours of a bid approach although market professionals reckoned it had more to do with a research report from the Australian office of Credit Suisse. Setting a 125p target price, the broker said Henderson was cheap compared with its rivals and could return a further £150m-£200m to shareholders next year.Elsewhere, bid rumours continued to swirl around leisure conglomerate Whitbread, up a further 1.1 per to a record high of £14.21. Traders believe Starwood Capital, a US private equity group, has appointed advisers and is working on a deal.In the same sector, Millennium Corpthorne Hotels rose 3.8 per cent to 541¼p on rumours of a sale and leaseback deal.Bid speculation helped Enodis, the catering equipment group, improve 1.6 per cent to 187¾p.Software company Misys improved 2.4 per cent to 205p after UBS repeated its “buy” recommendation in the wake of Tuesday’s news that ValueAct Capital Partners, an activist US investor, had amassed a 4.4 per cent stake.ValueAct is the previous employer of Mike Lawrie, the new chief executive of Misys. UBS noted that ValueAct has stake in healthcare software specialist, Per-Se, and in the past couple of years had bid for two software companies, Acxiom and MSC Software.Carphone Warehouse advanced 3.3 per cent to 291p after Man Securities . There was also talk that Carphone could be a takeover target for BSkyB, which fell 1.9 per cent to 545½p as its shares traded ex-dividend.Wolfson Microelectronics rallied 6.4 per cent to 287¼p on the view that its recent woes have left the designer of chips for the iPod and Playstation vulnerable to a bid. The stock was also helped by a Bridgewell Securities upgrade to “buy”.Premier Oil firmed 0.3 per cent to £12.87 on rumours that some shareholders have been approached to see if they would back a £14-a-share offer.Spectris, the instruments and controls maker, firmed 1.7 per cent to 667p on above average volume of 6.7m - equivalent to 5.3 per cent of the company.Finally, Northgate Information Solutions fell 11.7 per cent to 82½p after takeover discussions were terminated, while Grainger Trust fell 1.7 per cent to 688½p. After the market closed property company Regis Group said it was no longer interested in bidding for Grainger.
276;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-10-19T21:59:49Z;Altria delays earnings release;;Altria Group, parent of the Philip Morris tobacco companies and Kraft Foods, has postponed its earnings release by a day. The move surprised analysts and prompted speculation about the long-awaited spin-off of its Kraft stake and the possibility of a share buy-back announcement.Altria will report earnings next Wednesday – two days after Kraft discloses its results and a day later than previously expected. The earnings release and conference call now fall on the same day as a planned informal board meeting.In the past, Altria reported the morning after the Kraft afternoon earnings call the prior afternoon – a routine that has remained unchanged for years.“Altria does not do anything by accident,” David Adelman, analyst at Morgan Stanley, told clients. “The key question, therefore, is what does Altria want to review with its board of directors prior to releasing earnings and holding its quarterly conference call?”Mr Adelman said Altria would “most likely” remain “intentionally ambiguous regarding break-up timing but would both authorise and initiate a moderate ongoing share repurchase programme”.An announcement of the tax-free spin-off of its 88.1 per cent Kraft stake “although possible . . . is very unlikely” next Wednesday, he added. The company could, however, announce its “revised thinking regarding the likely timing of, and the precise remaining hurdles to, a corporate restructuring”.Last month Bill Ohlemeyer, Altria vice-president and associate general counsel, doused market speculation of an imminent Kraft spin-off after a US federal judge ruled that the Schwab case, involving the big cigarette makers and tens of millions of smokers of “light” cigarettes, could proceed to trial as a national class action.Investors are growing weary of waiting for Altria’s corporate restructuring into two or three standalone entities. The company signalled its intentions back in November 2004, but says it has been waiting for improvements in the litigation environment.In a report, Christine Farkas, analyst at Merill Lynch, said she does not expect Altria to announce the Kraft spinoff, but said it was possible “the board has since reconsidered the legal issues surrounding Schwab and is now prepared to be more aggressive”.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, took a bullish stance on the timing, saying the “most likely” reason for the earnings delay is that the board will announced the Kraft spinoff. “Although there could be other reasons, possibly an acquisition, we are maintaining out thesis that Altria’s board realises it must act now and spin off Kraft Foods since there is risk in waiting,” she said in a report.
277;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-10-01T23:01:46Z;Court back in session with full docket;;The US Supreme Court could be about to rewrite some fundamental rules governing the economy as it begins a new term on Monday with a docket that has an unusually high number of business cases.Half of the docket so far is business cases – including potential landmark cases involving punitive damages, patent, antitrust and environmental law – and more could be added. “It’s a very important term for business,” says Jonathan Franklin, of the law firm Fulbright & Jaworski.US companies will be watching closely to see how the reshaped court – with two new justices whose views on many business issues have not been tested – will rule in areas that can mean millions of dollars to individual companies.The justices will weigh in on the debate over how to punish corporate wrongdoing by considering whether to tighten limits on punitive damage awards, the big fines levied by juries to protest and deter corporate misconduct that are often out of all proportion to actual damages. The case before them involves a $79m (€64m, £41.5m) award won by the widow of a former smoker against Philip Morris, the cigarette maker.But it reaches far beyond tobacco, and could have big implications for every company that makes or sells products in the US.The court has tried several times to rein in punitive damage awards, but many lower courts have ignored these rulings. In the Philip Morris case, the punitive award was nearly 100 times the damages awarded to compensate the victim.The court must decide whether such large awards are constitutional, where the defendant’s conduct was particularly reprehensible (as the Oregon Supreme Court found in the Philip Morris case). The justices will also decide whether juries can award punitive damages for harm to people who are not involved in the lawsuit – for example, all Oregon smokers, as they did in the Philip Morris case.Both of these issues are crucial for business, but it is far from clear how the court will rule. Both new justices, Chief Justice John Roberts and Samuel Alito, have little record on punitive damages and they face an awkward choice: should they defend the right of business to avoid unconstitutionally excessive awards or should they uphold the right of individual states to protect their citizens by letting the states regulate punitive amounts?The vote of the new justices could tip the balance.The justices will also hear a potential watershed patent case, which could set a standard for determining when an invention is too obvious to deserve patent protection.Legal experts say the decision could affect virtually every patent case, since every patent application must pass the test for “non-obviousness”.Critics of the US patent system say that too many obvious inventions are patented – like the adjustable accelerator pedal at issue in KSR v Teleflex, the case before them.If they tighten that standard, says Professor Jay Thomas of Georgetown University Law Center, it could effect a “broad transfer from patent owners to the public domain”, and many controversial business method patents could be threatened.Later this week the court will hear another patent case, MedImmune v Genentech, that could determine whether it will be easier in future to challenge questionable patents in court. “This is a technical case but one of very great importance to the business community,” says Kenneth Starr, former Whitewater special prosecutor and a Supreme Court expert at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.“The court seems to have the feeling that something is wrong with US patent law. They don’t know what it is and they don’t know how to fix it, but they are looking for the right case,” says Mr Franklin.Competition law is another newfound interest of the justices: they will hear a case, Bell v Twombly, that could set a new standard for alleging conspiracy in antitrust cases.Roy Englert, Supreme Court litigator at the law firm Robbins, Russell, Englert, Orseck and Untereiner, describes the case as “a pitched battle between the business community and the class action bar” because of its potential to alter the power of lawyers to strongarm companies to settle such cases.The court will also hear a duo of important environmental cases, including one that tests whether the Environmental Protection Agency has the right to refuse to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. That case could also affect the power of interest groups to challenge the Bush administration’s controversial environmental policies more broadly.
278;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-09-29T20:57:50Z;Wall Street lower after week-long rally;;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its highest level in more than six years on Friday after a week of strong advances for equities. The S&P 500 reached a five-and-a-half year high during the week.The main indices made their strongest gains early in the week, buoyed by bullish analyst sentiment, higher earnings forecasts and upbeat comments on the US economy and inflation from the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve.Tobacco stocks sank after a federal judge in New York granted class action status to smokers of light cigarettes. Altria, parent of Philip Morris, tumbled 7 per cent to $76.55 on the week, and the S&P Tobacco Index had its worst week in more than two years.The semiconductor sector had a mixed week. Shares in Broadcom gained 8.9 per cent to $30.34 after BMO Capital Markets raised its fourth-quarter and 2007 earnings forecasts for the company.Intel surged 7.9 per cent during the week to $20.57 – its best week since August 2003. On Tuesday, it said it would begin shipping microprocessors containing four cores in November. The chipmaker also won a legal victory with the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by rival Advanced Micro Devices.PMC-Sierra, however, lost 8.2 per cent to $5.94 after it lowered its revenue forecasts for the third quarter due to weak demand for communications chips.The slowdown in the
communications sector fed through to Ciena, maker of networking equipment for the telecommunications industry, which sank 9.3 per cent to $27.25.General Motors jumped
8.6 per cent over the week to $33.26, as GM’s chief executive Rick Wagoner met in Paris with Carlos Ghosn of Nissan and Renault to discuss a possible alliance. The stock was further boosted when Kirk Kerkorian said his Tracinda investment group, which already owns nearly 10 per cent of GM’s stock, might increase its holding by 10m shares.At the close on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent, or 39.38 points, for the day at 11,679.07, up 1.5 per cent on the week.The Dow reached its second-highest intra-day level on Friday, and also had its second highest close ever on Thursday. However, the blue-chip index was still about 70 points short of its all-time high.The S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent, or 3.30 points, for the day at 1,335.85, a gain for the week of 1.6 per cent. It too rose to a multi-year high on the week, at one stage reaching its highest level since February 2001.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent, or 11.59 points lower, for the day at 2,258.43, a 1.8 per cent rise for the week.Both the Dow and the S&P 500 had their best quarters since 2004, rising 4.7 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively. The Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks still gained over the quarter but by less, rising 4 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.The Dow and S&P 500 also outperformed the Nasdaq and Russell in the previous quarter.“It’s been an extremely strong quarter and it’s certainly been a surprisingly strong September,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach, who believes equities will advance at a slower pace in the final three months of the year. “I expect another positive quarter, but I don’t think it can be as strong as last quarter,” he said.Since the beginning of the year, the Dow has risen 9 per cent, followed closely by the Russell, which added 7.9 per cent. The S&P 500 has returned 7 per cent, while the Nasdaq remains a laggard, gaining 2.4 per cent.Heavy machinery makers made strong gains on the week. Caterpillar fuelled much of the Dow’s advances as it added 4.8 per cent to $65.80. Deere, which makes farm equipment, gained 8.1 per cent to $83.91 following bullish comments on the stock in investor magazine Barron’s.After falling for the past four weeks, crude oil closed higher this week. Oil services group Weatherford International added 8.6 per cent to $41.72, and Marathon Oil rose 8 per cent to $76.90.Ebay rose 8.6 per cent to $28.36 after Goldman Sachs raised its third-quarter revenue estimate on the stock. Ebay’s Paypal payments unit also reached a settlement with the attorneys general of 28 states to improve how it notifies users of their customer rights."
279;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-09-25T16:50:42Z;Market Overview: Equities, bonds in US rise;;"Oil prices seesawed on Monday, while equity and bond investors continued to ponder whether weakening US housing data would spark a hard or soft landing for the world’s largest economy.Both US stocks and Treasuries extended gains after Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said: “The recent tempering of US economic growth to a more sustainable rate . . . should act to lower the inflation rate over time.”A slowing economy was reinforced by news that median US house prices for existing homes fell 1.7 per cent year-on-year to $225,000 in August, the biggest fall since November 1990 and the second-biggest fall in the survey’s 38-year history.“The sentiment in the bond market is that when house prices go south, the overall economy will slow,’’ said Rick Klingman, head of Treasury trading at ABN Amro. The big question is whether the sliding housing market sparks “broad based weakness across the economy and that remains to be seen,’’ he said.US Treasury prices continued to rally, with yields on 10-year bonds falling to a seven-month low of 4.55 per cent, aided by the tone of the housing data and Mr Fisher’s comments.The housing data buffeted stocks, but they rebounded after Mr Fisher spoke.By the close of trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.6 per cent, with the S&P 500 up 0.9 per cent and the Nasdaq
Composite sporting a gain of 1.4 per cent.Tobacco stocks were noticeably weaker, with Altria Group, the owner of Philip Morris and Reynolds American, falling after a federal judge ruled that a lawsuit accusing tobacco companies of defrauding smokers into thinking light cigarettes were safer than regular brands was a class action.Crude oil erased early losses that pushed prices to a six-month low under $60 a barrel on Monday. Prices rebounded above $61 a barrel amid comments from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that the 11-member group was looking at the supply of crude after a 20 per cent fall in prices in the past six weeks.The early losses in oil prices pressured energy and natural resources stocks across the Atlantic where Statoil, Neste Oil and Norske Hydro, as well as miners such as BHP Billiton and Xstrata, were among the biggest fallers.Major continental markets just about managed to keep their heads above water, with Germany’s Xetra Dax firming up 0.3 per cent, as ongoing merger and acquisition activity supported prices.But oil-heavy markets were unable to shake off the sectoral weakness, with
London’s FTSE 100 slipping 0.4 per cent and Norway’s Oslo All Share tumbling
3.4 per cent. Earlier, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 had closed flat.Oil prices fell, aided by BP saying late on Friday that it would restore most of its shut-in output at the Prudhoe Bay oilfield in Alaska this week, and amid signs of reduced tension between Iran and the west.Interest rate expectations and demand for carry continued to drive the currency market, with the high-yielding New Zealand dollar rising 1.2 per cent to a seven-month high of $0.668 against its US counterpart.Sterling strengthened to £0.6708 against the euro, within a whisker of last week’s 15-month high, as Sir John Gieve, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said he considered voting for a second successive rate rise at the Bank’s September monetary policy committee meeting."
280;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-09-22T12:41:53Z;Corporate name changes;;Name changes can work, as Saloth Sar, Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu and Robert LeRoy Parker discovered. For corporations, rebranding usually invites ridicule. The decision on Friday by the UK’s MFI to sell its retail DIY unit and rename the residual joinery business is a case in point. “Galiform” ticks all the right boxes: a first letter near the beginning of the alphabet, easy pronunciation, a hint of dynamic activity, and, critically, meaninglessness.At least Galiform has a decent excuse. Newly independent businesses need names. Occasionally their baptisms actually succeed. The City mocked BT Mobile’s transformation into mmO2 until it became a highly successful brand. Lucky timing meant that Accenture escaped the fall out that might otherwise have hit the former consulting arm of disgraced accounting giant Arthur Andersen.Other companies change names to muffle history. Keen to appear global, EDF, BP, and BAE Systems now avoid spelling out names which spell out their nationality. The uninitiated would never guess that Altria mainly sells Philip Morris cigarettes. Only a lone few corporations haul around their historical baggage proudly. The colonial-era operator of the world’s busiest canal still calls itself Suez. Aeroflot provided the spectacle of a company being floated with a Soviet hammer and sickle in its logo.Deals are the main explanation of name changes. The diplomatic alternative can get cumbersome, as Schoder Salomon Smith Barney and Vodafone Airtouch Mannesmann discovered. Still, mergers have supplied a spate of bland, classical or latinate names such as Verizon, Eon, Aviva, Corus, Diageo and Fortis. At least they have not sunk to the level of Dixons, an unglamorous UK electrical goods retailer, mysteriously renamed DSG International. That rechristening is something that even Pol Pot, Mother Teresa and Butch Cassidy would find hard to understand.
281;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Philip Morris faces key ruling on ‘lights’;;"Philip Morris USA, the cigarette maker owned by Altria Group, faces a key hearing on Wednesday in a case that seeks class-action status for all US smokers who bought “light” cigarettes.The Schwab case, filed in 2004, alleges the major US tobacco companies violated federal racketeering laws by falsely claiming “light” cigarettes were safer than regular ones. It is seeking damages in the tens of billions of dollars.Investors are closely watching the case as it is one of the industry’s more important remaining legal risks. Most analysts, however, do not believe the case will delay Altria’s plans to spin off its 88.1 per cent stake in Kraft Foods.“The lawsuit presents a risk principally because of its potential scale, and perhaps more importantly, because it is proceeding before Judge [Jack] Weinstein, who in the past – and in contrast to the overwhelming majority of other US judges – has allowed novel, large-scale aggregated tobacco claims to proceed,” said David Adelman, analyst at Morgan Stanley, in a report.Judge Weinstein, who crafted class settlements in litigation over asbestos and Agent Orange, will on Wednesday hear arguments on class certification; the statute of limitations; and the effect, if any, of US District Judge Gladys Kessler’s findings in the government’s civil racketeering case against the industry, Mr Adelman added.Because the Schwab case is being brought under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, there is a four-year statute of limitations. That means the plaintiffs’ lawyers have to show the class members were not aware “light” cigarettes were not safer than regular cigarettes until after 2000.The federal RICO statute also requires the plaintiffs’ attorney to prove “reliance” – that the class of smokers relied on the same false statements made by the cigarette companies when buying “light” cigarettes, and did so to their detriment.“Reliance and statute of limitations are excellent examples of why class actions cannot work in tobacco cases,” said William S. Ohlemeyer, Altria vice president and associate general counsel. “These issues can be resolved only by examining the particular and unique facts of each individual smoker – what they knew, when they knew it and how they made their decisions about smoking.”Judge Weinstein is not expected to rule on Wednesday on class certification but may give an indication of his likely decision. Even if the case is ultimately certified, the industry has the right to appeal against the decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit before the start of the trial."
282;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-08-18T20:24:35Z;Ruling clears way for plan to split Altria;;Shares of Altria Group, the parent of the Philip Morris tobacco companies, gained 4 per cent on Friday after a favourable legal ruling cleared the way for the tax-free spin-off of its Kraft Foods unit.Altria and Philip Morris USA, both defendants in the Justice Department’s civil racketeering case against the industry, late Thursday said they would seek a review of the complex ruling, which found the big US cigarette makers guilty of racketeering.However, the key element of Judge Gladys Kessler’s ruling was that she said she did not have the ability to award substantial financial penalties against the companies.Altria will therefore be encouraged to move forward with its plan to split into two or three separate entities.The judge did, however, order the companies to remove descriptions such as “light” or “ultra light” from cigarette packages and to publish statements concerning smoking and health issues, among other things.Christine Farkas, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the potential financial liability resulting from the DoJ case action had “acted as a major impediment” to Altria’s long-promised restructuring.With the spectre of substantial monetary damages removed, the question is: How soon will Altria announce the spin-off of its 88 per cent stake in Kraft?Analysts are divided on the timing. Citigroup’s Bonnie Herzog told clients she expects a press release to be issued during the board’s meeting on August 30, if not earlier.Judy Hong, of Goldman Sachs, said the “best-case scenario” for a spin-off announcement is “late” this year as the board may want to get a better understanding of what Judge Jack Weinstein is thinking in the Schwab case.He is expected to rule in the coming months on whether the case can move forward as a nationwide class-action for millions of light cigarette smokers.Oral arguments are scheduled for September 13.Altria’s shares rose 3.4 per cent to $83.46 in midday trade, while Kraft’s shares fell 0.67 per cent to $32.69.
283;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-08-18T00:12:14Z;Tobacco companies ‘deceived smokers’;;Altria Group, parent of the Philip Morris tobacco companies, moved closer to spinning off its Kraft Foods unit after a federal judge ruled it had lied about the consequences of smoking but decided against imposing significant financial penalties.In a 1,652 page opinion released on Thursday, Judge Gladys Kessler ruled the largest US cigarette companies violated anti-racketeering laws and ordered them to make corrective statements about the health effects and addictiveness of smoking. She also banned them from using terms describing cigarettes in ways that convey health claims.“Cigarette smoking causes disease, suffering, and death,” Judge Kessler said. “Despite internal recognition of this fact, defendants have publicly denied, distorted, and minimised the hazards of smoking for decades.”The judge stopped short of ordering the companies to fund a big anti-smoking campaign, as the government wanted.Analysts have said Altria was holding off on a Kraft spin-off because of uncertainties over the judge’s ruling and any remedies that might be imposed.The DoJ suit, which dates back to 1999, alleged that the tobacco industry violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by conspiring for decades to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking.“The defendants will now be referred to as adjudicated racketeers and that status will undermine their public relations campaign of portraying themselves as responsible corporate citizens,” said Ed Sweda, senior attorney for the Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University School of Law in Boston.The DoJ suit is considered the last major legal hurdle before the Altria board announces the beginning of the break-up of the company into two or three stand-alone entities. The board is due to hold its next regular meeting on August 30.“This is a home run for the tobacco industry, except for the part where they have to admit to the American people that they were lying for many years,” said Anthony Sebok, professor at Brooklyn Law School. “It’s a moral victory for the government, but not a decision with much financial consequence.”Both sides could now appeal to a US federal appeals court.
284;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-07-31T19:15:12Z;Serbia privatises mobile phone company;;Serbia on Monday completed the disposal of a mobile phone network in the country’s largest privatisation deal to date, giving support to investor confidence in the face of lingering political problems.Telenor, the Norwegian mobile telecommunications company, made the winning €1.51bn ($1.9bn, £1bn) bid for the state-controlled Mobi 63 network, which claims 45 per cent market share.The winning bid outstripped government expectations for the sale of the company, which recently came under state control after its private-sector main shareholder fled Serbia amid accusations of corruption. Privatisation officials said they had expected the auction would easily top €1bn, including the €220m licence price, but “not go this high”.Telenor – already active in neighbouring Montenegro – won 100 per cent ownership plus a 10-year operating licence for Mobi 63 over regional rival Telekom Austria after eight rapid-fire bidding rounds.The brisk bidding “shows there are not so many assets left” in the regional telecoms market, said Martin Schlaff, head of an Austrian private-investment group that held 30 per cent of Mobi 63 prior to the sale. “Obviously the bidders who went so far strongly believe [in Serbia’s growth potential].”Before the Mobi 63 sale, Serbia’s largest privatisation was the €518m sale of Nis Tobacco to US-based cigarette company Philip Morris in 2003.Serbia – still nursing political wounds from its 1990s wars – trails behind its neighbours in free-market economic reforms. Yet some investors say the former Yugoslavia’s most populous republic is ripe for foreign investment as other ex-communist markets cool down.Mr Schlaff said he would have liked to hold on to his Mobi 63 shares, though “not for that kind of money”. The government insisted he sell as part of the same package to a major strategic investor.The Schlaff group had first bought into the local mobile service provider – known until four months ago as Mobtel Serbia – as majority owner, buying 51 per cent from a family company led by Serbian entrepreneur Boguljub Karic.Mr Karic fell foul of the authorities and fled the country earlier this year to avoid bribery charges. The government – his co-owner and supposed partner – also accused him of hiding dividends from their joint venture.In April, the government reached a debt settlement with Mr Schlaff, opening the way for re-privatisation under the new brand, Mobi 63, which has about 2.5m users.Telenor officials said they were not worried about legal risks arising from Mr Karic’s former involvement.Telekom Austria, however, said it declined to bid higher for Mobi 63 because it saw more promise in going after the expected third mobile network licence.
285;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-07-26T20:46:29Z;Smoke still hasn’t cleared in tobacco case;;"When the Florida Supreme Court this month upheld a decision to toss out a $145bn verdict against the big cigarette makers, the ruling put Altria Group, parent of the Philip Morris tobacco companies, squarely on the path to spinning off its Kraft Foods unit.But the Marlboro maker still has another key legal hurdle to clear: the Department of Justice’s civil racketeering case against the industry.This is one of three roadblocks identified by the company to splitting into two or three stand-alone entities.What started out with a bang – a sweeping $280bn racketeering trial that posed a grave threat to the industry – was reduced to a whimper last summer when the government drastically cut its proposed remedies to $14bn over 10 years.However, the high-profile case is still important for Altria.While the proposed remedies are seen as financially manageable for the company and industry, Altria’s board will only have clarity once Judge Gladys Kessler, who presided over the bench trial, releases her pending ruling.The DoJ suit, which dates back to 1999, alleged that the industry violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by conspiring to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking.It said the defendants should “disgorge”, or forfeit, $280bn of “ill-gotten gains”.But last February an appeals court rejected the government’s effort to recover past industry profits, removing the biggest penalty that could have been imposed against the cigarette makers.It limited the case to “forward-looking” remedies that would prevent future violations of the law, rather than punish past conduct.The result, said David Adelman, analyst at Morgan Stanley, is an “emasculated” case.Still, he wrote in a report, given Judge Kessler’s past rulings, “it is naive to believe that she will not determine that the industry violated civil RICO in the past; there is a reasonable likelihood …of future RICO violations; and award certain remedies presumably intended to prevent and restrain future RICO violations”.Mr Adelman said much of the DoJ’s requested remedy – a $10bn national smoking cessation programme and a $4bn public education and counter-marketing campaign – “is arguably barred by the earlier disgorgement ruling”.That did not dissuade the government from persisting in its demands for far-reaching changes to the way the industry markets cigarettes.These include asking the judge to make companies sell research and development arms aimed at developing safer cigarettes; stop all motor-racing sponsorship; meet targets for cutting youth smoking; and pay for newspaper advertisements “correcting” their past health messages.If Judge Kessler rules against the tobacco industry and determines there is a “reasonable likelihood” of future industry RICO violations, she must fashion remedies that “prevent and restrain” future RICO violations, but she need not heed the government’s proposals.She could also find there is no reasonable likelihood of future wrongdoing, or that while there is a reasonable likelihood of future wrong-doing, most of the requested remedies are legally unavailable.Since the trial ended last June, the industry and its foes have been on tenterhooks. But even if Judge Kessler rules in the next few months, a final outcome could be several years away because of the appeals process.Analysts diverge on whether there needs to be a ruling before Altria’s board, which holds its next regularly scheduled meeting on August 30, gives the spin-off the green light.Louis Camilleri, Altria’s chief executive, has said a potential restructuring would proceed on the company’s own timeline and it would “not act prematurely”.But with two of the three big multi-billion dollar cases behind it, and continuing improvements in the overall litigation environment, there appears to be momentum for a near-term break-up.Should Judge Kessler rule against the industry, it could have far-reaching consequences for the cigarette companies and positive implications for the tobacco control movement.“A judicial finding that the defendants are, quite literally, racketeers would likely galvanize tobacco control legislative efforts at the state and local levels,” said Mark Gottlieb, director of the Tobacco Products Liability Project at the Northeastern School of Law."
286;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-07-07T20:46:23Z;Tobacco;;A huge legal cloud has been lifted from the tobacco industry, now that Florida’s Supreme Court has thrown out a $145bn award against tobacco companies. There remains the potential for individual smoker trials - as opposed to the class action that was decertified in the same legal decision - but the financial impact would be negligible compared with the unique and vast financial risk that has now effectively disappeared.That should hasten moves by Altria to break itself up - something which was on hold until the litigation outlook improved - much to investors’ relief since there should be considerable value to be unlocked.Altria currently trades at a roughly 10 per cent discount to a sum of the parts valuation, if one were to apply industry earnings multiples to Altria’s Philip Morris International (PMI) and Philip Morris USA. That discount widens if one were to award a premium to the Philip Morris businesses because of the strength of the brands, including Marlboro, and the benefits of scale. In addition, investors are surely hoping that the tobacco balance sheets are geared up, post their spin-offs - bringing them more in line with industry peers. That too might yield some extra value that the market does not appear to be assigning.Splitting PMI off from Philip Morris USA would have the additional benefit of insulating the former from further US litigation risks, however much reduced these may now seem.
287;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;FTSE rises 1 per cent over week;;"SABMiller traded lower on Friday amid fears that a legal ruling in the US could lead to a 28.7 per cent stake in the London-listed brewing company being put up for sale.On Thursday, Florida’s highest court threw out a $145bn (£79bn) damages award against the US tobacco industry. One consequence of the ruling is that Altria, the parent company of cigarette maker Philip Morris and Kraft Foods, can now start formally planning its break-up, a process that should be completed by the end of the year.According to analysts, this will inevitably raise the question of what Altria plans to do with its 28.7 per cent holding in SAB.Credit Suisse’s Michael Bleakley thinks Altria will wait for SABMiller shares to recover from their recent weakness before selling. The shares have fallen 14 per cent in the past three months on concerns about the company’s exposure to emerging markets.He says it is also possible the stake will be retained by Philip Morris USA as collateral against any future US tobacco litigation.But with traders taking the view that “overhang” rumours will continue to dog the share price, SABMiller closed 1 per cent lower at 960½p.In the wider market, leading shares fought back from early weakness to close the session almost changed.The FTSE 100 closed down just 1.1 points, or 0.02 per cent, at 5,888.9 – a decent performance given early weakness on Wall Street. Traders said the London market had been supported by oil stocks, which tracked the crude price higher.Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 fell 30.1 points, or 0.3 per cent, to finish at 9,431.6. Over the week the blue-chip index rose 55.5 points, or
1 per cent, while the mid-cap index advanced 8.9 points, or 0.1 per cent.Corus was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 on Friday. Shares in the Anglo-Dutch steel group advanced 4.4 per cent to 451p as rumours of a joint-approach from Russian billionaires Roman Abramovich and Alexi Mordashov, the owner of Severstal, refused to die down.Elsewhere, British Airways gained 3 per cent to 359p after low-cost rival EasyJet, 8.7 per cent stronger at 425p, said it expected full-year profit growth to be in the range of 40-50 per cent, up from its previous forecast of 15 per cent.On the downside, PartyGaming surrendered 5.9 per cent to close at 108p on news that the US House of Representatives will next week debate legislation aimed at banning internet gambling.While the bill is expected to sail through the House, analysts note that it is unlikely to get through the Senate before it breaks for elections in November.Drug company Shire rose 1 per cent to 811p on rumours of a private equity bid. Broker UBS reckons a venture capital group could afford to offer £10.50-a-share for Shire and still make a very healthy return.Aviva, off 3.6p per cent at 725p, was also under pressure as the insurer said it was in talks to buy US company AmerUs and that any deal would be part-funded by a share placing. That news also affected Prudential, down 2.6 per cent at 585½p, as traders took the view that another Aviva bid for the Pru was now out of the question.BT Group eased 0.3 per cent to 237¼p, in spite of rumours of a bid for Openreach, its “last-mile” network business, from an infrastructure fund.Among new issues, Southern Cross made a very good stock market debut. Issued at 225p through UBS
and Morgan Stanley, its shares, trading on a conditional basis, closed at 270p, valuing the UK’s largest care home provider at just over £500m.Citel also enjoyed a good first day as a listed company. The company, which makes a device that allows companies to turn traditional telephone systems into voice over internet protocol-based networks, raised £7.4m through a 95p a share placing via Panmure Gordon. The shares closed at 117½p, putting a value of £25.4m on the business.Jacques Vert rose 10 per cent 16¾p as traders took the view that plans to tackle its pension fund deficit could leave the clothing retailer vulnerable to a bid."
288;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-07-06T23:32:00Z;Cigarette makers breathe a sigh of relief;;The history of US litigation is strewn with superlatives and highly charged emotions, but there is little doubt that Thursday was Big Tobacco’s biggest day in court.The decision by the Florida Supreme Court to uphold a previous ruling and reject a $145bn punitive damage award claim against some of the biggest US cigarette makers lifts a huge financial and legal threat for the industry.Although the outcome of the so-called “Engle” case was expected – partly because the requested damages were so high – Thursday’s ruling puts an end to years of uncertainty for companies, investors and even plaintiffs.“For the most part, the court has done what we wanted them to do,” is how William Ohlemeyer, associate general counsel for Philip Morris USA, summed up Big Tobacco’s mixture of relief and elation at the Florida ruling.But if the end of Engle is likely to neuter once and for all the potential for class action lawsuits and their astronomical damage claims, the decision was no slam dunk for Big Tobacco.Aside from confirming damages worth some $7m to two of the 700,000 plaintiffs, the court left the door open to individual lawsuits against the tobacco companies provided they sue them within a year.“This is not a complete victory for the tobacco industry,” said John Coffee, an expert on tobacco litigation at Columbia University Law School. “It will be Chinese water torture, drop by drop.”Indeed, Stanley Rosenblatt, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, said that some of the court’s findings, namely that smoking is harmful and that the companies marketed “defective and unreasonably dangerous” cigarettes, could help future individual cases.“The job of plaintiffs’ lawyers will be much easier in future cases,” he said.But even if tobacco companies are hit by a raft of smaller cases – a prospect they claim is unlikely – they have avoided a pay-out that would have bankrupted the whole industry.“The industry is still looking at significant but not lethal liability, particularly in the area of low-tar cigarettes,” where plaintiffs have had considerable success using state consumer protection laws, said Jonathan Turley, of George Washington University law school.The point was not lost on investors, who sent the share prices of the main companies involved – Philip Morris owner Altria, Reynolds American and Carolina Group, the tracking stock for Loews Corp.’s Lorillard Tobacco – higher.Altria investors had other reasons to look forward to the Engle verdict. The company has been waiting for a resolution of legal disputes to spin off its 87.6 per cent stake in Kraft Foods.Altria declined to comment on Thursday but its chief executive Louis Camilleri has indicated that a positive Engle verdict would remove a roadblock to the break-up.Although a pending Justice Department investigation into Big Tobacco, and Philip Morris’s hint it might appeal against part of the Engle verdict, could further delay the spin-off, Wall Street analysts are expecting it before the end of the year.According to Goldman Sachs, a three-way split of Altria, into Kraft, Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International – one of the options considered – could add 26 per cent to the market value of the companies.The Altria board has already paved the way for a sale with last month’s ousting of Roger Deromedi as chief executive and his replacement with Irene Rosenfeld, a food-industry veteran who returned to Kraft after a two-year stint running PepsiCos snack food division.Ms Rosenfeld is expected to accelerate the efforts to boost growth in sales and earnings. In order to achieve those goals, she could hit the acquisition trail.Wall Street bankers have long expected that once Kraft was free of the Altria link, it would look at take-overs, taking advantage of a share price no longer affected by the prospect of litigation risk.Among the most commonly mentioned targets is Danone, the large French yoghurts maker which was unsuccessfully pursued by PepsiCo last year. This would allow Kraft to expand away from more traditional products such as processed cheese into higher growth products such as yoghurt.Ironically, Big Tobacco’s ability to survive litigation over the nefarious effect of smoking could prove a boon for investors in dairy products popular among health-conscious consumers.Additional reporting by James Politi and Lauren Foster in New York and Doug Cameron in Chicago
289;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-06-25T19:16:45Z;Smoke clears for Philip Morris;;Philip Morris USA, Altria Group’s domestic tobacco unit, faces the lowest number of new lawsuits in nearly a decade – a sign that the cloud of litigation over the industry is lifting.The dip is a contrast to the years following the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement between 46 states and the industry, when plaintiffs’ lawyers inundated cigarette makers with claims. As part of the deal, companies were ordered to make public thousands of pages of internal documents that showed how they strove to cover up smoking’s effects. The revelations fuelled a new wave of litigation.Last year, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes had 268 suits pending at the end of the year compared with 509 in 2003. So far this year, only seven suits have been filed and one case is scheduled to go to trial. That is down from 1997 when 437 cases were filed – the highest ever number.“Recent trends reinforce our belief that the litigation climate continues to evolve favourably and that greater clarity is slowly, but surely, emerging,” Louis Camilleri, Altria’s chief executive, said in the annual report.The shift is partly due to changes made following the MSA, which imposed marketing and advertising restrictions on cigarettes. It also stems from a reticence among tobacco lawyers to file new individual personal injury cases and class actions and the industry’s success in defending itself.“The personal injury individual cases are legally viable but less attractive than ever before,” said Anthony Sebok, a professor at Brooklyn Law School.In total, 1,549 cases have been filed against PM USA but only 51 have gone to trial. While some lawsuits have sought billions of dollars, PM USA and has only paid plaintiffs a total of $103m in the four cases it has lost on appeal.The change bodes well for Altria’s potential restructuring into two, or possibly three, parts – PM USA, Philip Morris International and Kraft Foods. The company has said the break-up hinges on “continuing improvements in the entire litigation environment”, including three lawsuits: Engle, Price, and the Department of Justice’s civil racketeering case against the industry.In December, PM USA won its appeal in the Price “lights” case but is still waiting for a ruling in the DoJ suit and the Engle class action, considered the biggest legal hurdle to Altria’s plans. In that case, the Florida Supreme Court is reviewing a decision to throw out a $145bn verdict against the industry.Tobacco watchers hope the justices will rule in the two weeks remaining before summer recess. If not, they will have to wait until the court resumes releasing opinions at the end of August.
290;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-06-14T18:24:27Z;Quest to make smoking less of a drag on health;;In a scene from the satirical film Thank You For Smoking, the head of the Academy of Tobacco Studies tells his colleagues: “We don’t sell Tic Tacs, we sell cigarettes. And they’re cool, available and addictive. The job is almost done for us.”In the real world, however, the business of selling smokes is more complicated. Legal and health risks, shrinking customer numbers and bans on using the product in public places are prompting the west’s tobacco industry to develop so-called reduced-risk cigarettes – what some term “potential reduced exposure products”, or Preps.Biotechnology, pharmaceutical and cigarette companies are researching – and in some instances already marketing – tobacco that is genetically modified, specially cured or has some other way of reducing harm. The question is how such products will be regulated and how big a share of the smokers’ market they could achieve.“If there is real innovation and an acceptable product that is substantially lower in risk, it has the potential to be a game-changer for the entire industry,” says David Adelman, tobacco industry analyst at Morgan Stanley. “Coming up with an acceptable reduced-risk product that doesn’t compromise taste is, in some sense, the Holy Grail.”Safer cigarettes, designed to produce fewer toxins, have been around for nearly two decades. RJ Reynolds (now part of Reynolds American) developed two – Premier in 1988 and the “smokeless” Eclipse in 1996. But neither was a hit.In 1998 Altria’s Philip Morris USA started testing an “electronically heated smoking system” called Accord, which reduces the smoke and ashes from the end of a cigarette. Last year it launched Marlboro Ultra Smooth – a cigarette with a “new carbon filter” – in three test markets.Philip Morris has been careful not to make health claims about Accord or Ultra Smooth, the first product from its top-secret Smoke Constituent Reduction (Scor) research programme. Misleading assertions would raise the risk of litigation.While tobacco watchers diverge on harm-reduction policy or what the industry will look like in the future, most agree smokers hope for a safer cigarette and, given the choice, would switch. So why have Philip Morris’s and RJR’s attempts not been commercially successful?“There is no question current smokers want a reduced-risk product,” says Bonnie Herzog, tobacco and beverages analyst at Citigroup. “But it has to taste, drag, smell, burn and look like a regular cigarette.” To date, no product has come close.Then there is public mistrust. “Consumers do not trust Big Tobacco’s claims,” Ms Herzog says. “However, if some government body would also stand behind a particular product, they would feel more comfortable.” Industry observers say the future marketing of reduced-risk cigarettes needs to go hand-in-hand with government control of tobacco products – for which anti-smoking advocates have lobbied for decades.Pro-regulation advocates say government oversight would create a scientific gatekeeper to monitor new products. It would also make cigarette companies accountable to an agency that would verify claims of fewer toxins or less harm and prohibit “reduced-risk” health claims if they could not be substantiated.Philip Morris, the only US cigarette maker to lobby for regulation, has said that granting the Food and Drug Administration authority over tobacco products would address issues such as standards for defining and marketing any reduced-risk cigarettes.“Whether the tobacco market moves into less harmful products, or to products that look more like pharmaceutical products, depends almost entirely on whether legislation is passed creating strong government regulation of tobacco products and how they are marketed,” says Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.In 2000 the US Supreme Court ruled that the FDA did not have the authority to regulate tobacco as a drug and made clear Congress would have to change the law if it wanted the agency to supervise cigarettes. In 2004, the Senate twice approved a bipartisan bill giving the FDA power to regulate – but not ban – cigarettes and tobacco products. The legislation failed in the House of Representatives.Last year similar bills were reintroduced to Congress. Mr Myers says the US is “closer than ever” to regulation but congressional leadership and the administration are “standing as a roadblock”.Kenneth Warner, dean of the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health and director of its Tobacco Research Network, says regulation hinges on three factors: a sympathetic Congress and administration, more resources for the FDA and an “activist” FDA that is “willing to take chances”. “We need regime change in order to make FDA regulation happen and work,” he says. “But I do think it is a real prospect in the next five to 10 years.”If regulation does happen, some believe it would increase competition not only among cigarette makers but also between the industry and pharmaceutical companies.Scott Ballin, a tobacco and health policy consultant, sees a convergence of tobacco and pharmaceutical industry interests over the next decade “as both look at the tobacco arena as a profitable area for developing harm reduction and smoking cessation products”.Drugmakers have long had a stake in aids to quitting, with nicotine- replacement therapies such as gum, patches and lozenges. Now treatment is shifting towards pills such as GlaxoSmithKline’s Zyban. Last month Pfizer won US regulatory approval for Chantix, which mimics nicotine, hitting the same receptors in the nervous system to alleviate craving.Mr Myers says tobacco products will change if regulation is strong. “The tobacco industry will be forced to compete based on the relative safety of different products – and the tobacco industry will be forced to compete with non-tobacco products that satisfy the nicotine urge but don’t kill.”
291;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-06-06T23:05:36Z;Opportunities ripe for the M&A merchants of south-east Asia;;"The recent furore over mega-listings by Chinese banks has deflected attention away from south-east Asia in terms of investment banking activity.Yet in recent years, many of Asia’s highest profile deals, particularly mergers and acquisitions, have involved companies from the region.“The trend started last year – the largest transaction in non-Japan Asia was actually the Sampoerna deal [Philip Morris’ $5bn acquisition of the Indonesian clove cigarette company] – and that has extended into this year,” says Ronnie Behar, Credit Suisse co-head of mergers and acquisitions, non-Japan Asia.As of June 5, there have been $44.87bn worth of M&A deals this year involving south-east Asian companies, compared with $58.16bn for all of last year, according to Dealogic, the data research group. Equities issuance this year is $6.1bn compared with $11bn for the whole of 2005.The biggest names in south-east Asian M&A continue to be Temasek, the Singapore state investment company, and its affiliated companies. Essentially a portfolio manager, Temasek is seeking to diversify its holdings equally between Singapore, Asia, the US and Europe. Currently, 45 per cent of its assets are in Singapore.Among its highest profile deals, Temasek in March paid £2.3bn ($4.2bn) for
11.55 per cent of Standard Chartered Bank and, in the same month, sold S$2bn (US$1.3bn) of shares in one of its flagships, Singapore Telecommunications.In January, Temasek paid the family of Thaksin Shinawatra, the Thai prime minister, $1.87bn for their 49.6 per cent stake in Shin Corp, the telecoms group, in the largest takeover of a publicly traded company in that country. The deal sparked protests that forced Mr Thaksin temporarily from office.Among the Temasek-owned companies, the most aggressive has been PSA, the Singapore ports operator, which bought a 20 per cent stake in Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa’s ports business for $4.4bn as part of its efforts to expand beyond its saturated home market.The numerous investments by Temasek and its affiliates offshore – Temasek has shares in 13 financial services groups alone – has led to speculation of a possible second round of activity by the group as it seeks to consolidate its various holdings.Temasek and its affiliates are also generating activity through their Singapore divestment programme. The group is believed to be considering giving up control of one of its two telecoms companies – SingTel or ST Telemedia.Aside from Temasek, regulatory changes are also driving activity in the region. A requirement that Singapore banking groups divest their non-core assets by next month led United Overseas Bank, Singapore’s largest private bank, and associated companies to sell 55 per cent of property affiliate Overseas Union Enterprise for S$989.9m to Indonesia’s Lippo last month.Regulators in Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia are also pushing for consolidation in their overcrowded banking markets.Bankers say there is speculation that Bank Indonesia, the central bank, is contemplating a “one presence” policy, in which one controlling shareholder cannot have more than one banking franchise, a move that would spur takeover activity there.Risk-hardy investors are also looking at other sectors in Indonesia following last year’s landmark acquisition by Philip Morris of the Sampoerna family’s controlling stake in HM Sampoerna.The deal has altered the mindset in Jakarta, says Roger Suyama, head of investment banking for Merrill Lynch in Indonesia.“Pre-crisis, in 1997-1998, no one was willing to give up control. Whereas they now realise if something comes up, they should at least take a look at it,” says Mr Suyama.Bankers point to the $3.2bn sale by Bumi Resources, controlled by the Bakrie family, of its Borneo coal mines as evidence of ongoing interest in deal-making in Indonesia.In Thailand, activity has been hurt by the Shin Corp controversy. But some companies are still attempting ambitious deals – GE Capital Asia Pacific, part of the US group, last month announced a plan to buy 25 per cent of Bank Ayudhya in spite of restrictions allowing one financial institution to own only 5 per cent of another.The transaction is awaiting a possible exemption from Bank of Thailand.The prospect of greater competition stemming from trade pacts is also leading to more M&A, with Vietnam considering stake sales in key companies such as insurer Bao Viet, and Malaysia seeking a partner for its struggling national car maker, Proton Holdings.Others say many of the biggest transactions in the region will continue to remain value-driven, a trend exemplified by the Hutchison/PSA deal and the recent surprise $2.1bn take-over by Japan’s Daikin of rival Malaysian air-conditioner maker OYL Industries.“The trend to take away is that opportunism and the ability to move quickly will remain the key deal drivers,” says one senior Singapore-based investment banker."
292;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-05-31T17:33:41Z;Patti Waldmeir: On the wrong side of justice;;"Jesse Williams started to smoke during the Korean war, when fellow soldiers told him the acrid stench would keep away the bugs. Now his ancient addiction – born half a century and half a world away – has provoked a crisis of conscience over how America should punish corporate wrongdoing in the 21st century.The tale of Mr Williams and his smokes – taken together with an oddly similar case about a pair of Canadians who were bitten by bedbugs in Chicago – is testing one of the most fundamental principles of the US justice system: that private lawsuits are a fair, effective and efficient way of regulating corporate behaviour.Just this week, the US Supreme Court agreed to reconsider this quintessentially American proposition by reviewing the case of Williams v Big Tobacco, in which Williams’s widow won nearly $80m from Philip Morris for its fostering of the addiction that eventually killed her husband. The future of the American economic model – light on government regulation, heavy on private litigation – could be profoundly affected by the outcome.The questions before the justices are ones they have faced before: is it fair to let juries impose huge punitive damages awards against companies that make things that hurt people – damages that are out of all proportion to the harm caused to the person bringing the lawsuit? Should jurors be allowed to punish defendants for harm they may cause to people who are not party to the suit? Is that necessary to deter corporate wrongdoing? Or is it economically counter- productive – and constitutionally unconscionable – to hit corporate defendants with damages in three-figure millions for each case of wrongdoing?That is where the bedbugs come into it: Judge Richard Posner, a federal appeals court judge famed for applying an economics- based approach to the law, recently defended a jury award of $186,000 in punitive damages against the down-market American hotel chain, Motel 6. The case involved a Canadian brother and sister attacked by bedbugs at a downtown Chicago Motel 6. They were awarded $5,000 for the pure indignity of it, and 37 times that in punitive damages.On the face of it, the award violated the Supreme Court’s guidelines on punitive damages: that they should be closely related to so-called compensatory damages, awarded to repay victims for things such as medical bills. The court said, in a 2003 ruling, that in most cases punitive damages would be not more than four times compensatory damages, and that the ratio should almost never exceed single digits.But Judge Posner, no friend of abusive litigation, still upheld a ratio of 37:1. Why? Because Motel 6 refused to spend $500 to fumigate the premises, and instructed its reception staff to say the bugs were ticks; because without the expectation of a big damages award, the plaintiffs could not have persuaded a lawyer (who takes a one-third cut) to sue in the first place; and because if they had not sued, no one would have discovered that the motel was infested with bugs.Judge Posner defended the right of juries to award punitive damages that are many multiples of the actual harm caused to the plaintiff – especially in cases such as this where the actual damages are quite low, because the anguish of being savaged by bedbugs cannot easily be quantified in dollars.Will the Supreme Court take a similar approach in the case of Mrs Williams, which has been dragging on since 1999? Will they agree with the Oregon Supreme Court that Philip Morris should be penalised, not just for giving her husband an excuse to keep smoking (by denying, for decades, the health effects of tobacco), but also for the illness of every other Oregon smoker not named in the suit?It seems unlikely. Bedbugs notwithstanding, it is normally a very bad idea to punish defendants for hypothetical wrongdoing that has not been tried in court. The Oregon jury found, by considering the facts, that Williams had been harmed by Philip Morris, but it did not consider whether the facts proved Philip Morris’s culpability in the case of other Oregon smokers.Courts should punish companies that engage in wrongdoing. But public policy should be made by legislatures and regulators, not individual juries trying individual cases: juries should stick to the facts before them, and keep punitive damages within single-digit limits. To do anything else puts them on the wrong side of justice: it is not their role to award huge sums in punitive damages for alleged wrongdoing that has never been proved in court."
293;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-05-30T18:41:09Z;US Supreme Court might clamp down on damages;;The US Supreme Court is to consider tightening limits on punitive damage awards by hearing a case later this year that could have big implications for every company that makes or sells products in America.The court said on Tuesday that it would review a $79m award won by the widow of a former smoker against Philip Morris, the big cigarette maker.But the case reaches far beyond the world of tobacco, and could test the justices’ determination to restrict the size of damage awards that juries can impose against a wide range of businesses.The court has tried several times recently to rein in punitive damage awards that measure juries’ outrage at corporate conduct, but are not closely linked to the damage caused to plaintiffs.But many judges around the country are ignoring the Supreme Court’s warnings on the issue.The US Chamber of Commerce has tried repeatedly to persuade the justices to intervene to try to enforce its past rulings, which it will now have a chance to do.Philip Morris says jurors in the current case were wrong because they punished the company not just for the health problems of the former Oregon smoker involved in the lawsuit, but also for the illness of other smokers who were not involved.The punitive damages awarded by the jury were nearly 100 times the damages awarded to compensate the victim – a figure far above the constitutional maximum of 10 times compensatory damages established by the justices in 2003.But the Oregon Supreme Court ignored these guidelines, saying the award was warranted due to Philip Morris’s “extraordinarily reprehensible” conduct in deceiving the public about the dangers of smoking.The case, which will be heard in the court’s next term that begins in October, could affect a wide range of US companies and multi-nationals that do business in the US, says Robin Conrad of the National Chamber Litigation Center, the legal arm of the Chamber of Commerce.“The problem continues to occur,” he says, “because the courts are not requiring adequate jury instructions so that the jury understands that harm to others is not something that can be taken into account.”In a separate ruling, the Supreme Court limited lawsuits by government whistleblowers, by making it harder for government workers to file lawsuits claiming they were retaliated against for speaking out about official misconduct.
294;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Tobacco war shifts between cheek and gum;;In the latest tobacco war, there is no smoke. And no fire. And there certainly isn’t any spitting.The battleground is unconventional, too: between cheek and gum.It started last month when Reynolds American, the second-largest US cigarette maker, announced plans to test-market Camel Snus, a smoke-free and spitless pouch product.Camel Snus is touted as “another tobacco pleasure” for adults, that can be used “anytime, anywhere”. Unlike other moist smokeless tobacco products, also known as snuff, the tobacco in Camel Snus is pasteurised, not fermented, and contains less moisture and salt. The result is that users do not have to spit.Philip Morris USA, Altria Group’s domestic tobacco arm, followed a week later with plans to test-market a smoke-free and spit-free tobacco pouch product. Taboka is aimed at smokers looking to switch to smokeless alternatives.Not to be left out, UST, the largest US smokeless tobacco maker, last week said it would test Skoal Dry, a spit-free smokeless tobacco product. It, too, will be marketed as an alternative for adult smokers.The tobacco companies hope the spit-free version will attract consumers who balk at the spitting associated with snuff but are looking for another way to get their nicotine fix. The new snuff products, they point out, are not marketed as a way to quit smoking.There is more at stake than offering consumers a more palatable choice: the smokeless business has attractive margins and rising sales while the number of smokers in the US is falling.The latest smokeless products have created a buzz in the tobacco industry – and in anti-smoking circles. The two sides have long been at war over federal regulation of tobacco products.Smokeless tobacco has also prompted renewed calls from anti-tobacco advocates for oversight by the US Food and Drug Administration, which oversees drug approvals and food labelling.Like cigarettes, smokeless tobacco products are not subject to federal regulation. Anti-smoking groups worry cigarette companies will encourage smokers to switch to smokeless products instead of quitting.Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, says the entry of the leading US tobacco companies into the smokeless market makes the need for FDA regulation “even more urgent”.“Without regulation, there is a significant risk that these new smokeless tobacco products will be marketed to kids who don’t currently use tobacco products or to smokers who are seriously considering quitting,” he says.He says that while Philip Morris has supported FDA regulation, RJ Reynolds, a subsidiary of Reynolds American, and UST have “vigorously opposed” it.In 2000 Philip Morris admitted for the first time that cigarettes were addictive and harmful and said publicly it supported “sensible” regulation of tobacco products.Altria said this week: “Altria Group and Philip Morris USA remain firmly committed to our long-standing support for comprehensive regulation of tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration.”Rival RJR says it is “committed to achieving a sensible consistent framework of laws and policies that govern the tobacco industry”, while UST says the company “would be willing to consider regulation that takes into account the differences between smokeless tobacco and cigarettes”.In 2004, the Senate twice approved a bipartisan bill giving the FDA power to regulate – but not ban – cigarettes and tobacco products. The legislation gained support in the House but failed in October.Last March legislation to provide the FDA authority to regulate broadly tobacco products was reintroduced to Congress. Anti-smoking advocates say it is unlikely legislation will be passed during this Congress but that the issue could gain traction next year.Scott Ballin, a tobacco and health policy consultant, says the role of an agency such as the FDA “cannot be underestimated”.“Without a neutral governmental agency charged with overseeing the manufacture, sale, distribution, labelling and marketing of all tobacco products, there is no way that a consumer will really know what products are available to them and the risks and relative risks associated with those products,” he said this month at a meeting of the Tobacco Merchants Association.While a united front on tobacco regulation does not appear imminent, Mr Ballin believes federal oversight is inevitable. “The industry is beginning to change and see that its long-term future is going to require – for its own marketplace protection – that there is regulation,” he says.
295;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-04-25T20:28:05Z;Lex: Reynolds American;;Unlike its Swedish counterpart, American moist snuff typically requires years of fermentation before it is ready for consumption. It has taken even longer for US cigarette makers’ interest in fast-growing oral tobacco to mature into a deal.The wait was certainly worth it for the family owners of Conwood. The $3.5bn cash offer from Reynolds American translates into about 14 times operating earnings and 7.7 times net sales. That’s hefty even by the standards of recent tobacco transactions and well above the multiples commanded by UST, Conwood’s larger US rival. Cost synergies look minuscule.Admittedly, the deal secures Reynolds a strong position in moist snuff, as well as other smokeless tobacco products. Given long lead-times in snuff production and brand loyalty, it would have taken years for Reynolds to build its own business. It will now be able to extend its cigarette brands swiftly into premium snuff, potentially holding on to consumers as they quit smoking.Even if that works, quantifying the net revenue boost is tricky. Limited public disclosure makes it hard to assess how sustainable margin improvements at Conwood will prove. Conwood’s strength in the value segment should provide protection. But the deal is likely to increase pressure on publicly traded UST to sell out to a stronger company. That could give Altria’s Philip Morris the chance to buy its way into the category at a more reasonable price than Reynolds has. As tobacco users know, waiting for the right moment tends to boost enjoyment.
296;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-04-20T14:27:33Z;Altria’s profit jumps 34 per cent on tax gains;;Altria Group on Thursday reported a 34 per cent jump in first quarter profit as a tax gain and robust domestic tobacco sales helped offset weakness overseas, especially in Spain.The US conglomerate, which owns the Philip Morris tobacco unit and 87 per cent of Kraft Foods, earned $3.48bn, or $1.65 a share, up from $2.6bn, or $1.25 a share, a year ago.Stripping out a tax benefit of 46 cents and other one-time items, Altria earned $1.28 a share, one penny above analysts’ average forecast.Revenue rose 3.1 per cent to $24.4bn from $23.6bn.“Our domestic tobacco business delivered strong share and income gains in the first quarter of 2006, reflecting the strength of the Marlboro brand,” said Louis Camilleri, chief executive. “Our international tobacco business achieved solid volume and share gains in many markets, but as previously anticipated, income growth was adversely impacted by a combination of factors, including unfavourable currency movements, lower results in Spain and a difficult comparison to the prior year.”In Spain, increasing sales of deep-discount products are cutting into Altria’s cigarette sales. Moreover, a smoking ban went into effect in most public places in January and the government increased taxes.“Unfortunately in Spain we have had to bear short-term pain to produce long-term gain,” Dinny Devitre, chief financial officer, told analysts. “But I believe we are on track to position ourselves well for the long term.”Altria reaffirmed its 2006 projection for earnings from continuing operations of $5.25-$5.35 a share.
297;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-04-19T16:44:28Z;Search for Altria lawsuit’s outcome becoming a habit;;If it is Thursday, it must be Engle-watch.Every Thursday at 11am, tobacco lawyers, investors and journalists browse the website of the Florida Supreme Court in the hopes the justices have reached their long-awaited decision in the Engle class action lawsuit.Altria Group, the US conglomerate that owns the Philip Morris tobacco unit and 87 per cent of Kraft Foods, has a lot riding on the outcome.The maker of Marlboro cigarettes is preparing to restructure and spin off of its Kraft Foods division but has repeatedly said the break-up hinges on continuing improvements in the litigation environment.This incudes three lawsuits: Engle, Price/Miles, and the government’s civil racketeering case against the industry.The Engle suit, led by Howard Engle, a retired paediatrician, was filed more than a decade ago and was the first class-action brought by smokers to go to trial.A July 2000 verdict in the case produced the largest punitive damages award in US history - $145bn - after jurors found the five largest cigarette companies liable for the illnesses of thousands of Florida smokers.The state’s highest court is considering whether to reinstate the original ruling after an appellate court in 2003 unanimously overturned the judgment, saying the trial plan was flawed, the damages excessive, and the original trial proceedings “irretrievably tainted” by the “misconduct” of lawyers representing the smokers.In a strongly worded ruling, the judges ordered the class be decertified, saying the individual issues were too diverse to be lumped together in one class.A year later, however, Florida’s Supreme Court unexpectedly agreed to review the case.Oral arguments were heard 17 months ago.Christine Farkas, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said Engle is “critical” to Altria “as a decision against tobacco could derail its promised restructuring until such time as it ultimately prevails”.In the Price/Miles “lights” class action, the Illinois Supreme Court in December threw out the $10.1bn verdict, handing cigarette makers a big win. It is now deciding whether to reconsider that decision.Ms Farkas said both the Engle and Price/Miles claims “have the ability to delay or - in the worst case - prevent” Altria’s plans.Altria is also awaiting news on the Department of Justice’s racketeering case.US District Judge Gladys Kessler is expected to rule in the near future but the case no longer poses the crippling financial threat it once did.Last year the government reduced its requested “remedy,” should it prevail, to $14bn from $130bn. Analysts expect the ruling to be financially manageable for the industry.Litigation is not the only issue tobacco investors will be thinking about this Thursday.Altria reports first quarter results this morning. The consensus forecast is for earnings of $1.27 a share. In the year ago quarter, earnings from continuing operations, including one-time items, were $1.24 a share.Investors will likely focus on Philip Morris International and challenges in Western Europe, particularly Germany and Spain.
298;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-03-20T23:24:24Z;US patent laws goes before the Supreme Court;;"The US Supreme Court will on Tuesday hear a case that tests a fundamental rule of innovation in America: exactly what kind of invention can be patented?With this and a handful of other cases this term and next, the justices are poised to step into a furious controversy over the US patent system, which is criticised both for granting too many, often poor-quality, patents, and for encouraging ruinously costly litigation.Congressional attempts to rewrite the patent laws have foundered, leaving the Supreme Court to try to create a better balance between competition and innovation in the patent field.Tuesday?s case, LabCorp v Metabolite Laboratories, involves a patented method of correlating blood homocysteine levels with vitamin deficiencies, relating to heart attacks.But it could affect cases well beyond diagnostic medicine; controversial software and so-called business method patents could also be vulnerable.?People are very alarmed at the potential of the court to upset the scope of eligible subject matter in areas well beyond diagnostics,? said Stephen Maebius, a patent expert at the law firm Foley & Lardner, noting that ?if you can?t patent as many things, you are effectively watering down the rights of patent owners?.But the justices might be reluctant to overturn the now well-accepted notion that software and business methods are patentable, Mr Maebius points out. Much will depend on whether the court sticks to the facts of the case, or decides the issue more broadly.The issue before the court is whether the process of ?correlating a test result? can be patented, or whether that would monopolise a basic scientific relationship used in medical treatment ?such that any doctor necessarily infringes the patent merely by thinking about the relationship after looking at a test result?.This ?correlating step? is analogous to information processing, and so what the justices say about it could affect other patents that involve processing information, says Mr Maebius.?The case has the potential to be one of the most significant patent decisions of all time,? writes Craig Steven Jepson, a patent expert at Franklin Pierce Law Center, who filed a brief in the case.But other patent experts say the case is not a good vehicle for deciding larger questions about patentability, and some predict the court might dismiss the case without deciding it.?The Supreme Court on Monday declined to review a $50m punitive damages award against Altria Group?s Philip Morris unit in the case of a smoker who was diagnosed with lung cancer and then died, Reuters reports from Washington.The lawsuit had been filed in California state court by Richard Boeken, who said he smoked two packs of Marlboro cigarettes a day for decades. Diagnosed with lung cancer in 1999, he was 57 when he died in 2002. A jury in Los Angeles awarded him a record $3bn in punitive damages and $5.5m in compensatory damages. The trial judge reduced the punitive damages award to $100m.A California appeals court last year further reduced it to $50m, and both Philip Morris and Boeken?s widow appealed to the Supreme Court."

sell about €1bn of bonds in euros and sterling.The maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes is returning to the market after postponing a sterling issue last December amid market uncertainty ahead of a legal ruling in the US on Philip Morris, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, about selling light cigarettes. The ruling went in the tobacco maker’s favour.The deal from BAT is expected to include a €500m issue with a maturity of September 2014 and a £300m deal that matures in September 2016, according to people close to the transaction.Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and RBS are lead-managing the sale."
300;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-02-21T13:10:18Z;Altadis profits lifted by strong final quarter;;Acquisitions continued to boost the bottom line at Altadis, the Spanish cigarette maker, which reported strong growth for 2005 although it grappled with difficult conditions and slowing demand in some of its key markets.Revenues for the year to December 31 were €12.7bn, a 33 per cent increase on 2004, while pre-tax profits were 12.6 per cent higher at €1.05bn. However, the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) margin fell from 31 to 30 per cent.Like most of the tobacco industry Altadis is under pressure in developed markets, where smoking is declining and governments are adopting anti-smoking measures. It is responding with price reductions and delaying price increases, acquisitions and extensive restructuring and pursuing growth in other markets.Cigarette sales returned to growth in the fourth quarter after a decline in the previous quarter, and showed an increase of 5.5 per cent for the full year, to €1.98bn, with Russian acquisition Balkan Star contributing €107m. Rapid revenue growth in the Middle East and Morocoo, and smaller growth in Germany, helped offset declines in Spain and France.Logistics, the group’s second-largest business, also grew strongly, helped by acquisitions made in France and Italy in late 2004. Its cigar business, which accounts for less than a quarter of revenue, benefited from increasing demand in the US.Spain, which is Altadis’ second-biggest European market, has recently banned smoking in offices and enclosed public spaces, increased cigarette taxes, and raised the minimum smoking age.These new measures led to a price war between Altadis and Philip Morris in Spain in January and early February, which Altadis said “markedly trimmed the profitability” in Spain. Altadis reiterated that the net impact of the price war on its 2006 ebitda was estimated at €170m, after the effect of new savings targets.However, it said the most recent changes, including a subsequent raising of some of its prices last week, indicated Spain would return to similar levels of pricing and profitability as other developed EU markets.A renewed restructuring programme announced last week will see a further 472 European jobs cut, after job reductions of 1,500 were announced last year under another programme.Last year Altadis closed production of the iconic Gauloise cigarettes in France, moving them entirely to Spain. It is also closing two Spanish plants over the next two years. Altadis is thought to be a potential takeover target for Imperial Tobacco, a UK rival.The shares were €0.04 higher at €36.39 in late morning trade.
301;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-02-06T19:27:18Z;Snuff back as Big Tobacco feels the pinch;;"With fewer Americans smoking and more cities adopting smoking restrictions, US tobacco companies face a key question: how to take their businesses beyond cigarettes.The answer may be in a can.The US is the world’s largest market for moist smokeless tobacco, also known as snuff, with more than 900m cans sold a year.While the cigarette industry is large and profitable, industry volumes have fallen at an annual rate of 1-2 per cent a year for the past 20 years – a trend expected to continue.By contrast, the smokeless category in the US, which has about 5.5m consumers, has shown consistent gains and is the only growing segment of the tobacco industry. In 2006 it is expected to show 4-5 per cent volume growth.This has not escaped the attention of the two largest US tobacco companies: Altria, parent of Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro; and Reynolds American, maker of Camel.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, says Reynolds will soon enter the smokeless market with its Camel brand, possibly making an announcement as early as tomorrow when it releases its earnings.“We believe the smokeless market could be an exciting opportunity for Reynolds, especially given the company’s existing sales force and distribution channel, the very high margins on smokeless tobacco and the company’s highly innovative team,” Ms Herzog says.Reynolds refused to comment.Last September, Philip Morris USA, Altria’s domestic tobacco arm, said the company was exploring ways to extend the business beyond cigarettes and was “looking at potential moves into complementary tobacco or tobacco-related products”.Last week, asked about the smokeless category, Louis Camilleri, Altria’s chief executive, told analysts: “Well, for obvious reasons, I wouldn’t want to say too much.”Analysts believe Philip Morris USA will enter the market with Marlboro, the world’s best-selling cigarette brand.Philip Morris USA and Reynolds will be up against a long-established competitor – UST, the largest US maker and distributor of moist smokeless tobacco, with about 75 per cent of the $3.5bn smokeless market. It dominates the premium segment with its Copenhagen and Skoal brands, each of which accounts for more than $1bn at retail.Murray Kessler, UST’s president and chief operating officer, says he will not be surprised if a cigarette company shows interest in snuff. “To some extent it validates what we have been saying: that there is an opportunity to convert adult smokers to smokeless, and that smokeless tobacco is a growing category.”UST has ramped up its efforts to convert adult smokers into snuff users as data suggest 63 per cent of new users are smokers or former smokers. With about 45m adult smokers in the US, opportunity abounds.While most new users enter the category with premium products, analysts say the price gap between the premium and deep-discount brands encourages consumers to trade down.According to Citigroup, the smokeless category grew 6.4 per cent in 2005, with most of the growth coming from the rapidly growing discount segment, which increased 28.8 per cent. The premium category, meanwhile, fell 2.5 per cent.While UST is a giant in the smokeless business – selling about 1.7m cans of snuff a day – it is a dwarf compared with the big cigarette companies.“If Reynolds or Philip Morris are moderately successful, it could have a modest overall favourable impact on their financial results, but it also has the potential to put significant incremental pressure on the incumbents in the market, especially UST,” says David Adelman, analyst at Morgan Stanley.With the premium segment already under pressure, the challenge will be to price smokeless product in a way that does not hurt the brand equity of the cigarette franchise, analysts say. UST’s Mr Kessler says he “couldn’t think of a worse time for a new entrant given the competitive marketplace”. But he concedes it could generate interest in the sector.Vince Gierer, UST’s chairman and chief executive, adds: “It is a validation of the category, and to my way of thinking it is not necessarily bad. To the extent the category could grow more than 4-5 per cent a year, that would be a good thing.”"
302;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Altadis enters Spain’s cigarette price war;;Altadis, the Spanish-French tobacco group, succumbed to a price war in its home market on Wednesday, announcing price cuts that could wipe €170m from group profits by the end of the year.Responding to last week’s move by US manufacturer Philip Morris to cut Spanish prices on its best-selling Marlboro cigarettes, Altadis said it would drop the price of its main Fortuna and Nobel brands from €2.50 to €1.85 and of most Ducados brands from €2.50 to €2.Tobacco companies are adjusting to new anti-smoking measures by the Spanish government, including a ban on smoking in offices and enclosed public spaces which took effect at the start of the year, with anecdotal evidence that people are responding.Aiming to curb the runaway growth of cheap brands, the government has also stopped kiosks selling tobacco, posing a challenge to tobacco companies’ logistics, and raised cigarette taxes.Altadis, which raised prices only last week in an attempt to pass the tax increase on to consumers, was taken aback by Philip Morris’s decision and said it wanted “to reiterate that it was impossible to act differently in these market conditions.”If prices remained at their new level, operating profit would take a hit of €170 in 2006, after a savings programme that would generate €80m in 2006, Altadis said. Michel Favre, finance director, said the cuts had been essential to maintain the group’s 30 per cent share of the Spanish market, and that it aimed to mitigate the impact by cutting €200m from costs over three years.In addition to the €80m, Altadis would save €46m in 2006 from the restructuring programme already in train, which would generate a total of €60m by 2008, he said. Altadis would reach its target with a further €60m saved from general and marketing expenses.Mr Favre told a conference call that Philip Morris’s price cuts had challenged the government, and that it was the responsibility of manufacturers to move pricing upward to a level where it could maintain a virtuous cycle.Competition has driven both Altadis and Philip Morris to launch brands selling as low as €1.35 recently. In comparison, a packet of low-cost cigarettes in the UK costs about £4.20 (€6.16)Altadis’ shares, which fell 10 per cent last week after Philip Morris’s price cut, were up 0.5 per cent to €34.68 by mid-morning.
303;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2006-01-26T18:12:05Z;Siemens powers Europe higher;;It has become something of a stock market tradition for Nokia’s share price to fluctuate wildly when its results are announced.The reaction on Thursday was no exception, with the stock falling as low as €14.35 before recovering to end at €14.89, down 1.5 per cent. The shares had climbed nearly 20 per cent since Nokia issued a profits warning last July.The world’s biggest maker of mobile phones reported a drop in operating profits despite rising sales in emerging markets. Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein maintained its “sell” recommendation on the shares, for which it has a target price of €11.80. “Despite buoyant demand, earnings per share look set to stay flat,” said Per Lindberg, DrKW analyst.However, the market generally responded well to a busy day on the corporate reporting calendar. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 12.76 points, or 1 per cent, to 1303.94.Siemens was one of the day’s star performers with a rise of 6.5 per cent to €76 after it unveiled a 31 per cent rise in new orders in the three months to December. See more on SiemensThe announcement offset news that combined charges of €350m at the company’s telecommunications equipment and IT services unit had pulled operating profits down by 10 per cent over the period.“These are good numbers for a big industrial conglomerate,” said Peter Reilly, analyst at Deutsche Bank.Deutsche said it remained buyers of the stock with a target price of €85. “We will make lots of small forecast changes but the net overall change will probably not be material,” Mr Reilly said.Alstom, the French engineering group, gained 4.8 per cent to €60.25. Deutsche Bahn, the German railway operator, said it was planning to spend some €3bn over the next few years on new regional trains and freight trucks. It named Alstom and Siemens as among the companies to have expressed an interest in tendering.Swiss rival ABB rose 4.4 per cent to SFr14.10 after it said it expected a positive investment climate among its energy clients to continue for another 18 months to two years.But there was severe pain for investors in Repsol YPF after the Spanish oil company said it would write off a quarter of its proven oil and gas reserves because of increased taxes in Bolivia and reduced production from Argentina.Repsol said the move would lower its net profits for 2006 by between €170m and €180m. But Antonio Brufau, the company’s chairman, said he was not tempted to replace the lost reserves through acquisitions.Repsol ended 7.7 per cent lower at €22.88.Altadis, the Spanish cigarette maker, was another of the day’s big fallers as investors reacted to news that US rival Philip Morris had cut the price of its Marlboro and Chesterfield brands in Spain.The announcement wrongfooted Altadis, which announced on Wednesday that it was raising the prices of its main brands because of a government tax increase. Analysts had expected Philip Morris to follow suit.Yesterday’s move meant that a pack of Marlboro cigarettes will cost less than Altadis’ best-selling brand, Fortuna.Altadis shares fell 4 per cent to €34.95.Erste Bank rose 1.2 per cent to €46.42 following a successful capital increase. The Austrian bank raised €2.7bn in a secondary share sale to fund the acquisition of Banca Comerciala Romana, Romania’s largest bank, the biggest takeover in Austrian history.Construction stocks were strong after a series of broker upgrades.Lafarge, the cement group, led the way with a rise of 6.6 per cent to €85.50, while HeidelbergCement gained 4.5 per cent to €84.45.Deutsche bank upgraded Spanish groups FCC and Sacyr, pushing up their shares by 3.4 per cent to €51.20 and 2.5 per cent to €20.11 respectively.Bayer fell 1.4 per cent to €33.61 after a study showed that its blood clot drug Trasylol increased the risk of kidney failure, heart attack and stroke. The news came as a further blow to Bayer following the $1bn recall of its Baycol cholesterol drug.“At first glance, we believe it would be very risky for doctors to continue prescribing Trasylol from a legal perspective with apparently safer and cheaper alternatives around,” said Christian Faitz at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.
304;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2005-12-15T19:33:36Z;Court reverses $10bn Philip Morris ruling;;Philip Morris began to emerge from the cloud of litigation overshadowing the tobacco industry since the 1980s on Thursday after judges in Illinois reversed a $10bn verdict against Marlboro Lights and other low-tar cigarettes.The class action award, alleging that smokers were misled about whether such cigarettes were safer, was seen as the most challenging of three big cases remaining against Altria, the parent company, and may hasten a proposed corporate break-up.It also points to an improving litigation environment for corporate America more broadly, as legislation to reform class action law and a changing mood among judges begins to weaken the power of plaintiff lawyers.“Any industry that confronts cases under consumer protection statutes – and that is every industry in America – will breathe a huge sigh of relief after this ruling,” says Michael Greve, a class action expert at the American Enterprise Institute, which advocates reform of the American litigation system.Analysts said the nature of the ruling was a “best-case scenario” for Altria because it made it harder to bring similar class actions by smokers of “lights” in other states. “The lights case has been the biggest hurdle for Altria’s board to break up its company and there is no question that it is now much closer to this event,” said Bonnie Herzog of Citigroup.Altria declined to comment other than to say it was “gratified” by the court’s decision. But Louis Camilleri, its chief executive, recently told analysts he thought emerging legal “clarity” should pave the way for an imminent restructuring likely to involve spinning off its Kraft Foods subsidiary and possibly Philip Morris overseas businesses too.The Illinois court’s ruling focused on the fact that the Federal Trade Commission, the federal consumer protection watchdog, had authorised tobacco companies to describe their products as “light” or “low tar”. The court found that Illinois state law precludes such suits when a federal agency has acted in this way.“The FTC could, and did, specifically authorise all United States tobacco companies to utilise the words ‘low’, ‘lower’, ‘reduced’ or like qualifying terms, such as ‘light’,” the majority ruling said.The opinion was written in a way that makes review by the US Supreme Court extremely unlikely, legal experts said.The court made clear that it disapproved more generally of such lawsuits, in which the plaintiffs fail to establish “that they sustained actual damages”, in the words of two justices who wrote a concurring opinion.Although the Illinois court’s ruling has no direct impact on other state courts, the fact the state has long been among the most plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions means a change of of heart by its justices is viewed as significant nationwide.“One would be foolish to bring a tobacco class action in Illinois or most other kinds of consumer class actions in Illinois,” says Prof Dick Daynard of the Tobacco Control Resource Centre at Northeastern University law school. “The court clearly is sending out signals that we don’t like these things.”
305;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2005-12-14T18:29:02Z;BAT puts issue on hold as suit looms;;"British American Tobacco on Wednesday postponed a planned bond issue amid investor uncertainty about the outcome of a US litigation case on Thursday, which could have implications for the whole tobacco industry.The company planned to sell a bond of benchmark size, which typically means £300m or more, with a 10-year maturity this week.BAT said on Monday morning that it had hired Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank and HSBC to lead-manage the sale. A few hours later, news emerged that the Illinois Supreme Court would today announce whether it would throw out a $10.1bn claim against Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes and part of the Altria Group.Yesterday, BAT, the maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes, told investors it had postponed the issue. “BAT has determined that, in light of the delay caused by the pending US litigation announcement on Thursday, and the proximity to seasonal slowdown in the
capital markets, [it] will not progress with the potential sterling transaction at this time,” said a spokesperson.Investors welcomed the decision. “It was a sensible thing to do. Investors would have found it very difficult to commit to a deal one day before a big announcement,” said Neil Murray, portfolio manager at Scottish Widows Investment Partnership.The judgment against Philip Morris USA is known as the Price “lights” case. The Illinois Supreme Court is considering an appeal against a $10.1bn damages award that was granted after a judge ruled Philip Morris had deceived consumers into thinking that “light”, or low-tar, cigarettes were safer than regular-tar ones."

The shares have lost 14 per cent of their value since the beginning of the month and 42 per cent since the start of the year amid mounting concerns over GM’s financial problems and fears that a strike at Delphi, its main supplier, could bankrupt it.GM’s woes weighed on the rest of the sector, with parts maker Visteon off 1.1 per cent to $6.91.In the absence of major economic data, earnings provided much of the direction elsewhere in the market.Contact lens maker Cooper Companies fell 20.55 per cent to $51.50 after it lowered its fiscal fourth quarter revenue and earnings estimates. Sentiment was further dented after Citigroup cut its rating on the stock.Tech Data had a better day, surging 10.2 per cent to $38.42 after third-quarter earnings fell less than expected. The company, which distributes technology products, is widely considered to be a good thermometer for demand in the sector.Chipmakers Micron Technology and Intel were in high demand after the two announced a joint venture to manufacture Nand flash memory chips in an effort to tap into one of the chip industry’s fastest-growing segments. Micron rose 3.3 per cent to $14.67 while Intel gained 3.6 per cent to $26.16.
307;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;A brew of South African realism;;"At the headquarters of Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee, 60 or so buildings have sprung up around a site where Frederick Miller first brewed the company’s amber-coloured ale in 1855.But it was not until last year that employees could enjoy the company’s flagship beers – Miller Lite, Miller High Life and Genuine Draft – after work without heading home or to a bar downtown.Shortly after his arrival in the US as the new chief executive of Miller in February 2003, Norman Adami insisted that a bar be built at company headquarters.“This could have been any corporate headquarters in America,” says Mike Hennick, Miller’s director of communications. “Norman didn’t really sense a beer culture.”Fred’s Pub, as it is known, is one of the more visible changes that Miller’s new owner, South African Breweries, has wrought on America’s second largest brewer after decades of falling market share, low morale and damaged relations with distributors.SABMiller’s turnround of Miller is arguably the most significant test of a foreign company’s ability to change the fortunes of an American corporate icon since Daimler-Benz’s ultimately successful transformation of Chrysler.In 1998 – the year of Daimler’s takeover – many questioned whether German business practices could be grafted on to a company with an entrenched American union culture and problems endemic to the US car market. The exercise eventually succeeded after careful handling of the union relationship and cost efficiency gains.For Mr Adami, a 26-year veteran of the South African brewer, the acquisition of Miller in 2002 has required a massive turnround to justify the acquisition premium associated with SABMiller’s $5.5bn purchase from Philip Morris, the tobacco group since renamed Altria.It has involved everything from the beer culture at the company’s headquarters to the brewer’s plan to tackle its larger competitor, Anheuser-Busch, as well as Miller’s approach to advertising, business plans, staff accountability and distributor relations.South African-born Mr Adami appears to be combining a willingness to engage with vested interests with
a determination to push
for change where needed.Jim Doney, president of Chicago Beverage Systems, one of the largest Miller distributors, says: “He listens but he is still very forceful in making sure he gets his message across.” Indeed, with the company’s distributors – arguably the most important constituency for any brewer – Mr Adami faced one of his biggest challenges. Before SABMiller’s arrival, Miller was still clinging to a “command and control” system for distributors, the legacy of a time when most Miller distributors sold only Miller beers. Yet many distributors, keen to diversify their revenues away from a failing Miller, had long since begun selling beers from Coors, its smaller rival.“We were caught in this Catch-22 situation, where Miller for years was saying that distributors weren’t playing their part, and the distributors on the other hand were saying that Miller wasn’t playing its part,” Mr Adami says over lunch at Miller’s headquarters. “We deliberately called for a new relationship, spelled out what the principles of this new relationship were, what our obligations were as we saw them and what the reciprocal obligations were, as we saw them.”Mr Doney says Miller is now “listening”. “They are taking the time to understand our business, they are working with us on the ­planning stages with more input than in the past. It is more of a team.” Within Miller, Mr Adami took some easy steps – witness Fred’s Pub – but was also faced with hard decisions.Astudy by SABMiller’s human resources department found that in 2001, one of Miller’s worst years in terms of market share, 61 per cent of managers received “excellent” or “superior” performance ratings.Sales and earnings targets were “not taken seriously” and goals were “phrased as activities”, according to Denise Smith, senior vice-president of human resources.Mr Adami was more blunt. Miller’s compensation culture had so little to do with performance that in 2003 he dubbed the company “the socialist republic of Miller”.SABMiller cut 20 per cent of jobs at Miller’s headquarters and introduced systems of accountability that the South African brewer had used at home and at its other global operations.But Mr Adami says it was not a case of forcing a South African management model on its new US subsidiary. “One thing SABMiller has learned is that you don’t just take a package and suite of protocols and dump it on a company in a country and say ‘get on with it’.”At the same time, there was the pressing question of how to tackle Anheuser-Busch, Miller’s rival.For SABMiller, buying Miller gave it access to the US, the largest beer “profit pool” in the world. SABMiller also wanted to use its US foothold to expand sales of its South African beers, such as Castle, and global brands, such as Pilsner Urquell and Peroni, the Italian beer.“The success of Miller was inextricably linked to the success of SABMiller and vice-versa,” says Mr Adami. “There was a sense of urgency, with no alternative options.” That was because Miller’s market share had collapsed to 17-18 per cent in 2002 from 22.6 per cent in 1995 as it took a battering from Anheuser.The giant of US brewing, known in industry circles as “AB”, used its clout with distributors and marketing muscle to maintain a market share of around 50 per cent, and to set a benchmark for beer industry pricing. All Miller and the number three brewer, Coors, could do was follow Anheuser’s lead. Mr Adami concedes Anheuser was “growing at will”, while Philip Morris was “prudently managing a decline”.“We knew that the only way to re-engage and compete with AB effectively was to adopt what we call this ‘able challenger’ approach, and that is essentially to compete on terms that are favourable to us, not to be a follower of AB, not to try and emulate AB,” he says.The first sign of this came with a new series of advertisements. For years, image had been the sole focus for Anheuser and Miller, dividing beer drinkers in the US between Bud and Miller loyalists respectively. With Anheuser generally able to out-spend Miller, the smaller brewer usually lost.Mr Adami says: “Brands were not differentiated in any way, people started to believe that in fact all beers were the same. That was one thing that struck me when I arrived here. People didn’t talk about their product
differences.”The new advertising confronted Anheuser’s Bud Light directly on the ingredients and taste of Miller for the first time. Ads claimed that Miller Lite had “half the carbs” of Bud Light – a theme that resonated at the time of the “low carb” craze among consumers.By the summer of 2004 sales of Miller Lite, which delivers more than half of the company’s earnings, had rebounded, stemming Mil-ler’s overall market share decline. Yet the increasingly troubled state of the US beer industry means that Miller still has a long way to go.Beer is falling out of favour with drinkers as they turn to wine and spirits. Overall US beer sales are falling, while steep discounting by Anheuser in a bid to preserve market share has started to place downward pressure on beer prices.Benj Steinman, editor of Beer Marketers Insights, says Miller has made progress improving the company financially and the health of the Miller Lite brand. “Yet at the end of the day there is still a lot to be done because the rest of the [product] portfolio is still declining and the total enterprise is not making any great headway in terms of market share,” he says.Mr Adami says: “We have engaged in the consumer dialogue, the industry dialogue and we are back in consideration with the consumer. That doesn’t mean we have got to where we want to be. But our turnround is on schedule.”HOW SABMILLER STAYED DOMINANT AT HOME WHILE AIM FOR GLOBALLike South Africa’s other globally minded companies, SABMiller is keen to emphasise its local roots, writes John Reed. The tie is more than sentimental: South Africa generates about one-third of the company’s profits, more than any other country.With seven breweries and nine beer brands, South African Breweries Ltd claims a crushing 97 per cent share of the beer market, and 60 per cent of the overall market for liquor. SAB also owns ABI, southern Africa’s largest Coca-Cola bottler, giving the company 60 per cent of South Africa’s market for carbonated soft drinks.Scale has played a big role in SAB’s dominance of its home market. During apartheid, foreign-exchange controls restricted its ability to invest abroad, prompting the company to build capacity at home. Today, it is South Africa’s only brewer that can offer a bottle return system, a key draw for its customers but a daunting obstacle to would-be rivals.SAB is not shy about defending its market dominance aggressively. In the late 1970s when it caught wind of a rival company’s plan to launch Colt 45 beer in South Africa, it countered with Stallion 54, a brand it retired after pre-empting the competition. When Diageo launched Smirnoff Ice in 1999, SAB quickly developed Brutal Fruit, now one of South Africa’s best-selling flavoured alcoholic drinks.The trend among big companies to seek primary listings abroad remains politically sensitive in South Africa. SAB has duly sought to stress its commitment to affirmative action, social responsibility and other corporate mantras of the post-apartheid era.It suffered embarrassment earlier this year when it lost a trademark infringement case in South Africa’s highest court. The constitutional court upheld the right of Justin Nurse, Cape Town entrepreneur, to print T-shirts reading “Black Labour, White Guilt” in a spoof of SAB’s Carling Black Label beer brand. Local media championed Mr Nurse’s cause, and SAB came off looking like an aggressive corporate juggernaut.Even with its head office in London, SABMiller still has a strong South African flavour. Six out of eight members of its executive committee are South African nationals, as is Graham Mackay, the company’s chief executive. Observers say that may need to change as the company becomes more global. “Going forward, they will have to evolve culturally,” says Julian Wentzel, head of research with First South Securities. “There are very few outsiders at the senior level in the business.”BREWING A CHANGEAfter taking over Miller, SAB needed to reverse falling market share and low employee morale at the US brewer. Actions included:■revisiting key relations with distributors.■a new employee incentive system, with greater accountability.■a marketing drive based on taste and ingredients, rather than general brand image.Read other turnround articles at www.ft.com/turnround"
308;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2005-10-19T14:02:57Z;Marlboro sales boost Altria;;Altria, the tobacco and food group, saw its market share of the US tobacco business rise above 50 per cent in the third quarter, as strong cigarette sales offset weakness at its Kraft Foods subsidiary.The company, which owns the Phillip Morris tobacco companies, reported an 9.3 per cent increase in net earnngs from continuing operations to $2.88bn, or $1.38 a share, against the same period last year, ahead of Wall Street’s expectations.The company also narrowed its earnings guidance for 2005, to $5.05 to $5.10, from $5.00 to $5.10 previously. Louis Camilleri, chief executive, said the year “is shaping up to be a year of robust progress”.“During the third quarter, particularly strong results in our tobacco businesses were partially offset by continuing challenges at Kraft,” he said.Altria’s Kraft Foods, which trades separately as a public company, on Tuesday cut its full-year earnings forecast as it succumbed to persistently high energy and commodity costs, reducing its third-quarter earnings by 11 per cent.The maker of Oreos and DiGiorno frozen pizzas highlighted the rising cost of PET resin, used in plastic packaging, which was up “substantially”.Plastic-related costs are Kraft’s second-largest input cost after cheese.Kraft’s energy and commodity costs rose by $200m in the third quarter, with year-to-date costs up by $600m.The company’s Philip Morris USA unit shipped 47.9bn cigarettes in the quarter, down 0.9 percent from a year earlier. But market share for its top-selling Marlboro brand rose to 40.1 percent from 39.6 percent, and the company’s overall market share increased to 50.1 per cent from 49.9 per cent previously.Philip Morris International shipped 217bn cigarettes, up 9 percent. The volue of sales in Asia increased 40.4 per cent, which the company said was primarily because of the acquisition of Sampoerna in Indonesia, as well as gains in the Philippines. Excluding Sampoerna, volume was up 0.8 per cent. Philip Morris International achieved a 26.7 per cent share in Indonesia in the third quarter following the acquisition of Sampoerna..
309;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2005-10-17T15:10:54Z;Supreme Court rejects tobacco ruling appeal;;Altria moved a crucial step closer to breaking itself apart after the US Supreme Court rejected government efforts to use racketeering laws to fine the tobacco industry $280bn.The court's refusal to hear a last-ditch government appeal lifts the spectre of bankruptcy from much of the industry and helps pave the way for Altria, the largest US cigarette maker, to try to unlock shareholder value by spinning its Kraft Foods and Philip Morris subsidiaries into separate companies.Several multi-billion-dollar court cases remain outstanding, but the failure of prosecutors to use organised crime laws in pursuit of record-breaking fines against Big Tobacco begins to clear a cloud that has overshadowed the industry for much of the last two decades.“This is the big one,” said Wesley Moultrie, an analyst with Fitch Ratings. “It removes once and for all the potential of a fine that would have crippled the industry.”Altria shares surged in Monday morning trading - rising eight per cent to an all time high - as did those of other companies affected such as RJ Reynolds and BAT.The case, which began under the Clinton administartion, went to trial between September 2004 and June 2005 and sought the so-called $280bn “disgorgement” against companies as remedy for years of alleged fraud in promoting smoking despite knowledge of the health risks.A judge has still to rule on the case itself and the US Justice Department is department is separately seeking $10 billion to fund a five-year smoking cessation plan and $4 billion for a separate public education campaign.The industry is already banned from advertising cigarettes on billboards and displaying brand logos on ball caps and other merchandise under a 1998 settlement with 46 US states.The US Chamber of Commerce welcomed the decision to rule out the larger disgorgement yesterday, saying it could help to protect businesses well beyond the tobacco industry.Though the court gave no reason for its decision not to hear the case, the fact that it refused a government request to intervene suggests that the justices want to discourage “an unauthorized and unprecedented expansion of the RICO [rackateering] statute”, according to Robin Conrad of the Chamber's litigation arm, the National Chamber Litigation Center. “This should be a strong signal to the government not to pursue this remedy against any other industry,” she said.But William Corr, director of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an anti-smoking advocacy group, yesterday called on the government to pursue strong remedies against the tobacco companies, despite yesterday's setback to their case.The government “should not use the Supreme Court's decision as an excuse to let the tobacco companies off the hook with a weak settlement,” he said in a statement, noting that the court could still require the industry to pay tens of billions of dollars to fund smoking cessation and public education programmes, or impose other remedies.William Ohlemeyer, associate general counsel for Altria, said: ”Philip Morris USA believe the US Supreme Court appropriately denied the Government's petition to review the February 2005 opinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That opinion concluded disgorgement was not an available remedy under the civil RICO statute used in this case.”
310;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2005-10-16T23:25:08Z;Takeover activity in Asia at record high;;Takeover activity in Asia has reached record levels more than two months before the end of the year, increasing the chances that 2005 will be a bumper year for investment banks in the region.The volume of mergers and acquisitions in Asia excluding Japan has already surpassed the previous record set in 2000, reaching $156bn thanks to strong growth in China, according tofigures from the research firm Dealogic.“The large volume of deals in China and Korea and the acquisition of [Indonesia's cigarette maker] Sampoerna by Philip Morris helped to propel M&A activity to levels never seen before,” said Colin Banfield, head of M&A in Asia excluding Japan at Credit Suisse First Boston.The volume of deals, which took place mostly in the financial services, telecommunications and utilities sectors, is already more than 57 per cent above the activity for the whole of 2004 widely regarded as a strong year for Asian M&A.Investment banks do not disclose advisory fees but Dealogic estimates total potential revenues from M&A in the year to date at more than $400m about 29 per cent higher than at the same time in 2004.Coupled with strong capital markets activity including several large initial public offerings the sharp rise in the volume of deals should ensure that investment banks follow last year's robust performance with another year of high profits in Asia.The region has traditionally been a tough market for international financial firms because fees tend to be lower and competition fiercer than in the west. However, bankers say that after several loss-making years, Asia's contribution to their firms' global balance sheets has been steadily increasing.“Last year was our best year ever in Asia and this year we will beat it by a significant amount,” said the regional chief executive of a Wall Street investment bank.Goldman Sachs leads the regional M&A league table, followed by arch-rival Morgan Stanley, with JPMorgan third and Merrill Lynch and UBS taking up the other top five spots, according to Dealogic.
311;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Two more directors leave Morgan Stanley;;Morgan Stanley on Friday said two more independent directors had resigned, making room for John Mack, the Wall Street bank’s new chairman and chief executive, to retool the board.Charles Knight, chairman emeritus of Emerson Electric, and John Jacob, executive vice-president at Anheuser-Busch, resigned, effective immediately. They joined Michael Miles, former chief executive of Philip Morris, who resigned earlier this week. These men had been strong supporters of Philip Purcell, who was ousted as head of Morgan Stanley in June following a three month battle over his leadership.Morgan Stanley’s now has 11 directors. Others could still resign, eager to end the job after being sharply criticized for the way they handled the leadership battle.Mr Knight led the committee responsible for replacing Mr Purcell. When Mr Purcell’s resignation was announced, Mr Knight ruled out Mr Mack and others as potential candidates, angering employees and investors. Once the search was kicked off, several parties, including a leading candidate, asked the board why Mr Mack wasn’t being considered. Mr Knight and the lead director then met with Mr Mack and offered him the job. But Mr Knight shocked members of his board, as well as investors, by telling the media that Mr Mack was still not a candidate while he was considering the offer.In his defense, some insiders said he was worried acknowledging Mr Mack’s candidacy would turn other candidates away, making it difficult should Mr Mack not accept the job. But others said Mr Knight had not come to grips with the fact his friend would be replaced by a man Mr Purcell had pushed out of Morgan Stanley. Mr Mack was president of Morgan Stanley until 2001, when he lost a power struggle with Mr Purcell.
312;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2005-09-06T20:28:15Z;Morgan Stanley director resigns;;Morgan Stanley on Tuesday announced the first resignation of an independent director following the power struggle that resulted in the ousting of Philip Purcell, chairman and chief executive.Others are expected to follow in the coming months as longtime supporters of Mr Purcell make way for a new regime under the leadership of John Mack.Michael Miles, the former chief executive of Philip Morris, resigned effective immediately. Three new directors were elected in August and the board should receive more fresh faces as other directors resign. Edward Brennan, former chairman and CEO of Sears, cannot stand for reelection at the next annual meeting in March because of age restrictions. Others could also resign or signal their decision not stand for re-election.Morgan Stanley’s board has been sharply criticised by investors, employees and corporate governance experts for its handling of the public battle over the leadership of Morgan Stanley, which resulted in Mr Purcell’s departure in June. One pension fund filed a lawsuit against the directors alleging breach of fiduciary duty because of the board’s decision to offer guaranteed pay packages to some senior executives as well as the handling of other tough spots.Mr Miles and others on the board have said they supported Mr Purcell during the crisis because they felt that the attacks on him were personal rather than related to performance.Mr Mack has said he plans to spend a great deal of time working with and shaping the board. He became chairman and chief executive on June 30. His appointment marked a return to Morgan Stanley, where he worked for 29 years until 2001 when he lost a power struggle with Mr Purcell. Mr Miles was among the directors on the board who decided Mr Mack should leave Morgan Stanley.In his resignation letter, Mr Miles said to Mr Mack: “I’m confident that your return as CEO will help ensure the continued success of the Firm in the years ahead. At the same time, I believe there is always a need for change and refreshment in any organisation.”Mr Mack thanked him for more than a decade of service and commitment. Mr Marsh had served on the board of Mr Purcell’s Dean Witter before it merged with Morgan Stanley in 1997.With the resignation of Mr Miles, the board has 13 directors. Eleven are independent.
313;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2005-08-09T22:59:25Z;Tobacco groups advertise more but sell less;;"The five biggest tobacco companies spent $15.2bn on US advertising and promotion of cigarettes in 2003, an increase of more than 20 per cent from a year earlier and the highest figure ever reported to the Federal Trade Commission.A report issued on Tuesday by the Washington regulator said the five tobacco giants nevertheless sold 19.8bn fewer cigarettes in 2003 a 5 per cent decline in sales in spite of the advertising and marketing push.Tobacco companies opted to increase the marketing of cigarettes even as they began to roll back their campaigns in order to reduce youth smoking, the report found.Cigarette manufacturers in 2003 spent $72.9m on ads intended to reduce smoking directed towards youth or their parents, a decline of 1.8 per cent from the previous year.The annual report also shows tobacco companies have more than doubled their marketing campaigns since 1998, the year the tobacco industry reached a landmark $206bn settlement with the US states. The report is based on information released to the FTC by Altria, the parent of Philip Morris; Reynolds American; Houchens Industries, parent of Commonwealth Brands; and other tobacco companies.Anti-tobacco lobbyists said the marketing figures underscored that the tobacco industry has done little to “change its ways” in recent years, in spite of promises to curb advertisements directed at youth.“The main thing is the staggering amount that is spent marketing a product that kills half the people that use it,” said Danny McGoldrick, director of research at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The FTC said price discounts paid to retailers and wholesalers to reduce the price of cigarettes represented the biggest category of expenditures, accounting for nearly $11bn in spending in 2003.The next two largest spending categories were “retail-value-added” promotions involving free cigarettes and coupons."

315;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2005-06-28T18:55:49Z;Court weighs fines on tobacco groups;;"The US government's six- year court battle against the tobacco industry reached its climax on Tuesday as the Department of Justice demanded $14bn (€12bn, £8bn) in fines on tobacco companies to pay for smoking prevention campaigns.In its first formal proposal before a US district court for Washington DC, the government said companies including Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds and British American Tobacco should be forced to pay the fines should the court rule in the government's favour.Its demands fall well short of its original threat of penalties of up to $280bn.Cigarette makers said the government's demands still went far beyond what was allowed under the law and were likely to be rejected by the judge. In February a Washington appeals court dealt a blow to the government's case when it limited it to “forward-looking” remedies that prevent future violations of the law, rather than punishing past conduct.Nevertheless, the department, which is using a racketeering law designed to pursue the mafia for organised crime, has persisted in its demands for far-reaching changes to the way the industry markets cigarettes.On top of the public health campaigns, the department is calling on the judge to make companies sell research and development arms aimed at developing safer cigarettes; stop all motor-racing sponsorship; meet targets for cutting youth smoking; and pay for newspaper advertisements “correcting” their past health messages.It also called for the appointment of an “investigations officer” who could demand to attend any meeting of senior management held by the defendants. Companies would also have to appoint their own internal compliance officer."
316;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Tobacco debate inflamed by cut in penalties;;The US Justice Department's decision to reduce radically the penalties it was seeking in a landmark case against tobacco companies from an expected $130bn (£71bn) to $10bn prompted the federal judge overseeing the case to question the government's motives on Wednesday.Gladys Kessler, a US district judge, said of the change: “Perhaps there are some additional influences being brought to bear on the government's position in this case.”This week an attorney for the Justice Department, Stephen Brody, surprised both tobacco company executives and anti-tobacco lobbyists when he called for tobacco companies to pay $10bn an “initial request” over the next five years to fund an anti-smoking campaign. Michael Fiore, a government witness and medical professor, had suggested the companies pay $130bn over 25 years in an earlier phase of the trial.The decision prompted outrage among Democratic lawmakers. Senator Edward Kennedy and others called on the inspector-general to investigate the Justice Department's request and accused the Bush administration of pandering to the powerful tobacco lobby.The long-running case, filed in 1999, centres on the government's allegation that the leading tobacco companies, including Altria's Philip Morris, Loews's Lorillard Tobacco, and Reynolds, among others, conspired to promote smoking and misled the public on its dangers. Ted Wells, an attorney for Philip Morris, maintained yesterday that the government's proposed sanction whether it cost the industry $10bn or $130bn was “a fatally flawed programme”.The Justice Department's case was dealt a severe blow in April when a federal appeals court declined to reconsider a ruling that prevented the government from seeking $280bn in past profits from cigarette makers.The department on Wednesday night said: “The government's suggested cessation programme is only an initial requirement…the court can extend and expand the programme to exceed the $10bn/five-year programme proposed in order to prevent and restrain the continuation of fraudulent activities by the tobacco companies.”
317;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Reynolds American doubles Q1 profits;;First quarter profits more than doubled at Reynolds American, the tobacco company formed by the merger of RJ Reynolds and British American Tobacco's Brown & Williamson, because of cost savings and higher prices.The number two US cigarette maker said net income rose 130 per cent to $281m, or $1.90 a share, from $122m, or $1.43, a year ago, beating analysts' estimates.Sales rose 60.7 per cent to $1.96bn from $1.2bn, as increased pricing and incremental revenues from the combination of companies helped the top line.On a pro-forma basis, assuming the two companies were combined last year, sales fell 3 per cent as Reynolds shifted marketing support to its higher-priced Kool and Camel brands. In February the company outlined a new brand strategy focused on three categories: investment brands, selective support brands and non-support brands.Reynolds said it would boost marketing spending for Camel, its largest and fastest-growing full-price brand, and Kool, a menthol brand. These two investment brands are now the company's highest-priority brands and receive 80 per cent of its marketing dollars.Camel competes with Philip Morris's Marlboro, the leading US cigarette brand.Reynolds reaffirmed it expects to earn $6.55-$6.95 a share for 2005.RJ Reynolds and Brown & Williamson are defendants in the government's ongoing civil racketeering case against the tobacco industry. The lawsuit, filed in 1999, accuses cigarette makers of conspiring for five decades to mislead people about the dangers of smoking. The companies deny fraud or conspiracy and say they did not hide smoking's health risks.Last week the liability phase of the case ended after seven months of testimony. Next week the trial moves into its final stage with Judge Gladys Kessler scheduled to hear several weeks of testimony on potential remedies should the Justice Department win its case.Charles Blixt, Reynolds's general counsel, on Wednesday told analysts the liability phase of the trial “went very well” and “any objective fact finder should find in our favour”. The government's case, he added, focused on “ancient history”.
318;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Cigarette companies win in court;;A federal appeals court on Wednesday declined to reconsider a recent ruling that prevented the US government from seeking $280bn in past profits from cigarette makers.The 3-3 vote by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit leaves standing a three-judge panel’s rejection of “disgorgement” as a remedy in the civil racketeering case against the industry.The lawsuit, filed in 1999, is aimed at Altria Group and its Philip Morris USA unit, among others. The decision is a blow to the Justice Department’s case and a big victory for the tobacco industry. It came on the same day Altria reported an 18.3 per cent rise in first-quarter profits, helped by strong cigarette sales and improvements at Kraft Foods.The US conglomerate that owns the Philip Morris tobacco group and 85 per cent of Kraft said net income rose to $2.6bn from $2.19bn a year ago. Earnings from continuing operations, including one-off items, were $1.24 a share, a penny better than forecasts. Revenue rose 8.7 per cent to $23.6bn from $21.7bn.“Philip Morris USA delivered another quarterly increase in retail share, driven by Marlboro, and strong income growth,” said Louis Camilleri, the chairman and chief executive. “In another difficult quarter for the entire cigarette industry in western Europe, Philip Morris International posted widespread share gains and a 13.1 per cent increase in income, which was enhanced by favourable currency and a one-time inventory sale to its new distributor in Italy.”During the quarter PM USA, Altria’s domestic tobacco arm, shipped 42.8bn cigarettes, down 0.7 per cent from a year ago but flat when adjusted for an extra shipping day in the first quarter of 2004 and the timing of promotional shipments.PM USA’s share of the US market improved in the first quarter of 2005, driven by sales of Marlboro cigarettes, Altria said.PMI, Altria’s overseas tobacco arm, shipped 200.9bn units, up 2.1 per cent. The rise reflected higher volume in Italy as a result of a one-off inventory sale to PMI’s new distributor, continued strong recovery in France and gains in many other markets in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Asia, partially offset by lower shipments in Germany, the company said.On Tuesday, Kraft reported a 27 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings on lower restructuring costs and a tax boost. However, it lowered its full-year earnings estimate by 2 cents a share to $1.73-$1.78 a share because of higher than expected restructuring charges..
319;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2005-03-20T22:01:47Z;Indonesia to raise cigarette tax;;Indonesia plans to increase cigarette taxes, just days after Philip Morris announced the biggest takeover in the country's history the proposed US$5.2bn acquisition of local producer HM Sampoerna.In an interview with the Financial Times, Jusuf Kalla, Indonesian vice-president, praised the investment by Philip Morris International part of Altria, the world's largest tobacco group as an act of ?very big confidence? in the Indonesian economy.But he warned that the government was working on a plan to increase excise taxes on cigarettes, a move he said was necessary to increase government revenues and ?for health?.Altria's proposed acquisition follows years of declining foreign direct investment in south-east Asia's biggest economy amid concern over the country's high levels of corruption and regulatory risk.Jakarta has been reluctant to raise cigarette taxes because of pressure from a powerful indigenous clove cigarette industry which Altria is now seeking to join by acquiring Sampoerna, the number three producer.Anti-tobacco activists argue that reluctance to raise taxes or impose other restrictions has helped make Indonesia one of the most smoking-friendly countries in the world, with 217bn cigarettes expected to be sold there this year.According to the World Bank, taxes now make up just 33 per cent of the average retail price of cigarettes in Indonesia, compared with 75 per cent or more in many developed countries.Mr Kalla said the government of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, which took office last October, planned to change that, although it had yet to determine a time frame for any cigarette tax increases and planned to make any changes ?step by step? and ?not dramatically?.It was also still considering how it could sign on to the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which took effect this month and has 58 signatory countries. The convention calls for strict limits on advertising and prominent health warnings on cigarette packs.Jakarta's decision is unlikely to affect Altria's interest in Indonesia, one of the few growing cigarette markets worldwide.After announcing the deal last Monday, the company said it expected taxes eventually to increase. But Mr Kalla's announcement caught the company off-guard with a spokeswoman for Philip Morris Inter-national saying: ?We are not aware of any planned increases.?Altria's acquisition is seen as remarkable in Indonesia because it has the blessing of the family that has controlled Sampoerna for almost a century.As in many parts of Asia, the country's family-owned conglomerates have traditionally been reluctant to cede control to outsiders.The US company has already acquired 40 per cent of Sampoerna, mostly from the family, and has made a tender offer for remaining shares.
320;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2005-02-27T20:47:26Z;Treaty to curb tobacco use comes into force;;A landmark international pact to curb tobacco use, the world's first-ever public health treaty, came into force on Sunday amid concerns by anti-smoking activists that tobacco industry lobbying and lack of resources will weaken its implementation.The World Health Organisation says the treaty, endorsed by its 192 member states in 2003, could save millions of lives. Tobacco is the second leading cause of death worldwide, killing nearly 5m people a year, and on current trends may kill double that number by 2020, 70 per cent of them in developing countries.Known as the framework convention on tobacco control, the treaty has been ratified by 57 countries, representing 2.3bn people, and signed by 167 nations and the European Commission.It requires governments to ban or severely restrict all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, ensure large explicit health warnings on cigarette packets and outlaw misleading terms such as ?light? or ?mild?.Other provisions are designed to curb smuggling, prevent sales to children, raise cigarette prices and protect people from second-hand smoke.But anti-tobacco groups and WHO officials accuse the tobacco industry, which lobbied against the treaty during the negotiations, of trying to delay ratifications and water down domestic legislation intended to translate the convention into national law.Corporate Accountability International, a US non-governmental organisation, says leading tobacco companies such as Philip Morris (Altria), British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are using ?dirty tricks? in a bid to derail the treaty. The group claims that BAT last year paid for a beach weekend for 75 Kenyan members of parliament, intended to influence their consideration of a tobacco control bill now before the legislature.Vera da Costa e Silva, director of WHO's tobacco-free initiative, also accuses tobacco companies of working to discourage countries from ratifying the convention. She cites Brazil as an example, where the industry has enlisted the support of influential tobacco farmers.Another concern is the waning interest of the international community and declining funding for tobacco control in the face of the huge financial clout of the industry. Combined revenues for the ?big three? tobacco companies amounted to nearly $150bn (?113bn, ?78bn) in 2003.Derek Yach, professor of global public health at Yale University in the US and previously the top WHO official responsible for the treaty negotiations, says other health priorities such as Aids have elbowed tobacco out of the limelight and many leading donors have stopped supporting tobacco control.Work on additional protocols to the treaty needs to start urgently, he says, noting that in 2003 Altria and BAT spent over $500m on developing new tobacco products.www.who.int/tobacco
321;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2005-02-15T19:27:06Z;Questions remain as smoke clears;;"In tobacco land, everyone is watching for smoke signals.Now a federal appeals court has thrown out the possibility of a $280bn penalty against the tobacco industry as part of the government's civil racketeering suit, there are two key questions left.Will the government pursue a settlement with the cigarette companies? And when could Altria Group, the US conglomerate that owns the Philip Morris tobacco units and 84 per cent of Kraft Foods, be in a position to spin off the rest of its food subsidiary?If the industry opts tosettle, as some think it might, analysts said that the amount involved would be small and would belikely to go towards funding stop-smoking or public education programmes.Judy Hong, US food and tobacco analyst at Goldman Sachs, does not expect the tobacco companies to agree to a settlement involving any “meaningful” financial sum. “However, a settlement involving marketing restrictions could be possible,”she said in a report.The Federal Appeals Court ruling this month is a serious blow to the US government's case - now in its fifth month - because it essentially leaves only non-monetary remedies, such as further restrictions on advertising and marketing, if the government wins the racketeering case.But for the tobacco industry, it was a major victory. Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Smith Barney, said the industry “is in the driving seat and has the leverage” and a settlement may be a way for the tobacco companies to resolve some of the legal uncertainty.Morgan Stanley said a settlement might now be more likely given that the ruling “is likely to cause a drastic reduction in the DOJ's assessment of the case's value”. Also, given thatthe industry would probably still prefer to avoid therisk of an adverse rulingby Judge Gladys Kessler, who is hearing the racketeering case, “there is probably increased incentive to reach a settlement beforethe end of the trial”.Investors, the firm noted, would view a “‘reasonable' settlement, perhaps with extra marketing restrictions and some concessions on regulation, favourably”.The government will on Wednesday file a brief laying out the non-monetary remedies it is seeking from the industry.Speculation over the outcome of the racketeering case in which the government alleges that tobacco makers defrauded consumers by denying the dangers of smoking and second-hand cigarette smoke comes as Altria is positioning itself for a possible restructuring.Louis Camilleri, Altria's chairman and chief executive, has worked hard to reduce litigation threats against Philip Morris USA but the company still has big hurdles to overcome before it can attempt a break-up.Doing so before three outstanding litigation issues are resolved the DoJ suit and two pending multi-billion-dollar appeals could open it to charges of “fraudulent conveyance”, or disposing of assets to protect them from being used to pay damages.In November, when Mr Camilleri announced that Altria was considering splitting into two or three separate entities, he said it was “beginning to make the necessary preparations to assure execution readiness” once litigation risks subsided but added: “I need to stress that continuing improvements in the litigation environment are a prerequisite to consideration of such action by the board.”Mr Camilleri specified three big ongoing lawsuits as hurdles to restructuring: the DoJ case; Engle; and Price “lights”.In the Engle class-action case, the Florida Supreme Court is considering whether to reinstate a $145bn damages award against tobacco makers of which Altria's share is $74bn. The award had been thrown out by an appeals court.In the Price class-action claim, the Illinois Supreme Court is considering an appeal against a $10.1bn damages award that was granted after a judge ruled Philip Morris USA had deceived consumers into thinking that “light” or low-tar cigarettes were safer than regular ones.Analysts expect decisions on both class-action cases to be handed down during the first half of 2005, or early in the third quarter.Given the timing of the expected rulings, a further announcement on Altria's restructuring is seen as unlikely before the second half of the year. And if the government appeals the recent disgorgement ruling to the US Supreme Court would that scuttle Altria's restructuring plans?Ms Herzog said while there was a “decent” chance - 60 per cent, she reckons - the government would appeal, there is also a chance the industry decides to settle.“Although there is a higher chance that the government pursues an appeal …we do not believe this will prevent a break-up of Altria Group,” she said."
322;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2005-01-06T18:39:45Z;The burning tobacco question;;"A 65-year-old man at a small table in a laboratory at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, asks for his twelfth cigarette in less than eight hours. A researcher is happy to oblige. As the man lights up, technicians swarm around him to take a blood sample, make him exhale into a sensor and administer cognitive tests.The experiment, led by neuroscientist Jed Rose, focuses on the volunteer's response to Quest, a cigarette made from tobacco genetically engineered to contain less nicotine. Dr Rose directs the university's Center for Nicotine and Smoking Cessation Research, which helps smokers kick the habit. He sees the Quest study as important because it indicates that smokers of this new product inhale less deeply than smokers of an earlier ""reduced-harm"" product - the low-tar cigarette - and may therefore cut their dependence on tobacco.But the work is controversial. Quest's maker, the Vector Tobacco Company of Re- search Triangle Park, North Carolina, paid for the study, and tobacco giant Philip Morris funds the centre.Since the late 1990s the tobacco industry has provided university researchers with millions of dollars to help develop a new class of reduced-harm products - including modified cigarettes such as Quest, tobacco lozenges and nicotine inhalation devices-ostensibly to reduce the hazards of smoking. Advocates say the industry is now serious about improving the safety of its products. But critics, who cite its efforts to manipulate science over the past 50 years, see nothing but the same old smoke and mirrors.Despite the efforts of anti-smoking activists, tobacco industry funding is flourishing, igniting a debate on some campuses over whether universities should ban tobacco money and whether grant organisations should deny funding to individuals or schools that take it.Ken Warner, a public health expert at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and president of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, concedes the tobacco industry was guilty of misconduct in the past but worries about restricting research.Dr Rose thinks the tobacco industry's new focus on harm reduction may usher in a new era of tobacco-sponsored research. This research is ""high quality, innovative and unique,"" he says, and ""very different from the abuses of the past"".Dr Rose, a co-inventor of the nicotine patch, says: ""The real enemy is the death and disease smokers suffer. If we can use tobacco money to help people lead healthier lives, why shouldn't we?""Stephen Rennard, a pulmonary physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha who has also received tobacco industry support, agrees. ""People are going to continue to smoke, and we need to make them as safe as we can. The tobacco industry needs university research to develop a safer product.""One of Dr Rennard's projects, funded by RJ Reynolds, evaluated Eclipse - a cigarette made by the company that heats rather than burns tobacco, theoretically producing less harmful smoke. Dr Rennard later used Philip Morris money to determine how much smoke the average cigarette user is exposed to. The findings may help the company design a cigarette that cuts the levels of inhaled smoke.Dr Rennard says taking industry money required soul searching. ""But in the end I realised that this research should be funded by tobacco companies. NIH resources should not be used to improve cigarettes. It would be like the government subsidising the development of a better laundry detergent.""Others think academic researchers should just say no. Simon Chapman, editor of the journal Tobacco Control and a professor of public health at the University of Sydney in Australia, says the tobacco companies in fact have little interest in public health. ""They fund this research to buy respectability and ward off litigation,"" he says. Some worry that reduced-harm products are just a ploy to keep smokers addicted.For many critics of mixing tobacco money with university research, the industry's history speaks for itself. For example, as the link between smoking and disease became clearer in the early 1950s, the world's largest tobacco companies established the Tobacco Industry Research Committee - later the Council for Tobacco Research - to fund research into health effects of smoking. But its main goal, internal documents reveal, was to obfuscate risks and few of the studies it funded addressed the hazards of cigarettes.The industry also lost credibility with its previous attempts at harm reduction when it touted low-tar and filtered cigarettes as ""safer"", says Dr Chapman, while suppressing evidence that smokers drew harder on these cigarettes, thereby increasing their intake of carcinogens.While scientists debate the merits of taking tobacco money, other authorities may take the decision out of their hands. Over the past decade, a number of institutions - including the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of Glasgow - have banned researchers from applying for tobacco industry grants. Organisations such as Cancer Research UK and the Wellcome Trust no longer fund researchers who take tobacco money. The American Cancer Society, one of the largest private funders of cancer research, plans to adopt a similar policy this month. Ohio State University, Columbus, was in the eye of the storm in 2003 when Philip Morris offered a medical school researcher a $590,000 grant at the same time a state foundation offered a nursing school researcher a $540,000 grant. But the terms of the state grant would have prohibited all other university researchers from taking tobacco money, so the school could not accept both. ""There was a very heated debate among the faculty,"" says Tom Rosol, the university's senior associate vice president for research, who ultimately decided to take the Philip Morris grant. ""It came down to the issue of academic freedom,"" he says. ""We didn't want to accept a grant that would have placed restrictions on our investigators.""The decision sparked a backlash, and several departments, including the Comprehensive Cancer Center and the School of Public Health, enacted bans on researchers from taking tobacco money.A resolution approved by the University of California's Academic Senate this summer would have the opposite effect. A proposal that ""no special encumbrances should be placed on a faculty member's ability to solicit or accept awards based on the source of funds"" would prevent institutions in the UC system banning tobacco funding. UC president Robert Dynes describes such bans as ""a violation of the faculty's academic freedom"".Not everyone believes this argument. ""The university should be a role model,"" says Joanna Cohen, an expert on university tobacco policies at the University of Toronto. ""Academic freedom should not override its ethical responsibilities.""Dr Rennard, who made himself ineligible for state money by accepting tobacco industry funds, says: ""Political positions should not determine scientific agendas. If we restrict research on moral grounds, should we ban grant money from pharmaceutical companies or industries that pollute the environment? Where do you draw the line?""As public funding gets tighter, more universities may have to confront this question. The tobacco industry is poised to fill the financial void, but pressure on schools to shun this money is likely to increase. In the end, institutions will have to decide whether to overlook the source of this funding or take the moral high ground and watch it go up in smoke.This article was provided by AAAS and Science, its international journal. www.aaas.org:www.scienceonline.orgNO CONSENSUS ON TAKING CIGARETTE CASH• Harvard School of Public Health and the University of Glasgow have already banned researchers from applying for tobacco industry grants.Cancer Research UK and the Wellcome Trust no longer fund researchers who take tobacco money.

Advocates argue it is now serious about safety, while critics say it is manipulating science.• A ban on accepting funds represents a restriction on academic freedom for some university researchers: “Where do you draw the line?”, asks one.In 2003, Ohio State University turned down money from a donor that wanted to restrict tobacco funding.

323;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2004-11-05T00:23:01Z;Lex: Altria;;The hinting is over. Instead of the usual health warnings, Louis Camilleri on Thursday stuck a clear health improvement plan on to Altria. The tobacco and food group’s chief executive said that he was looking into a possible break-up.In reality, that is little surprise. Altria which owns both Philip Morris and Kraft has long traded at a steep discount to its sum-of-the parts. Altria’s business diversification has not reduced the risk for investors. Instead, the scale of the tobacco litigation danger has simply tainted the food business as well. In the unlikely event that Philip Morris was hit with a legal liability it could not meet, lawyers could try going after Kraft.A break-up should add significant value. Kraft, which already has a small listed free float, would be cut free. Ideally, Philip Morris would also be split into separately listed international and US businesses. That would leave any future US litigation risk focused on just one business. After Thursday’s rally, the shares trade at $54. Using peer group multiples as a base to value each Altria business can yield over $70 a share.Life is not quite so simple. Before such a move would be allowed, much of the litigation risk would have to disappear. That, by itself, would light up Altria’s shares. A break-up would then add to the momentum. Investors can position themselves now. But they will have to wait many months for the smoke hanging over Altria from its three biggest legal threats to clear.
324;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2004-09-27T12:31:19Z;Lex: Tobacco litigation;;"There is no smoke without fire. That is the view of bond markets, which have marked down the value of US tobacco company debt since last week's start of a major trial. This is in contrast to the equity market's lack of reaction to the case, in which the Department of Justice is seeking $280bn in ""ill-gotten gains"" from tobacco companies.The different responses are justified. For bond investors, what matters is credit ratings. If the Department of Justice wins, tobacco companies will need to pay $280bn - enough to effectively bankrupt the entire industry. This seems unlikely, but there may be outcomes which do not threaten company survival but do lower creditworthiness.The most affected would be Altria, formerly Philip Morris, with the biggest US market share. Rated in the triple-B investment grade category, its bonds are trading in line with junk bonds. This reflects the fact that US cigarette companies would have trouble passing on the costs of a sizeable settlement to smokers. Moreover, the companies' financial flexibility is constrained - Altria's US tobacco subsidiary, for example, has over $8bn tied up in bonding arrangements with various courts.An important point in the trial will come around the end of November, with hearings on the issue of disgorgement, or forfeiting, of profits. If the tide turns against the companies, shareholders would need to be even more cautious. Until then, bond investors look set to remain the only ones reading the smoke signals."
325;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
326;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2004-09-23T11:41:15Z;Philippines? tax move to hurt Philip Morris;;Less than two years after Altria?s Philip Morris invested $300m in a new factory in the Philippines, the world?s biggest cigarette maker is finding that its hopes for healthy market growth is about to be dashed by Manila?s plan to raise taxes on the industry.President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo last month said the Philippines was ?in the midst of a fiscal crisis? and proposed legislation increasing taxes on cigarettes, beer and alcohol as a priority measure to boost government revenue.The finance department is now asking Congress to raise taxes on the so-called ?sin products? by a third and reclassify some low-priced brands into the higher-priced categories where they will be subject to higher tax rates.The twin moves would double the government?s tax take from cigarettes from 19bn pesos ($337m) to 37bn pesos.That is worrying cigarette makers such as Philip Morris which is banking on continued domestic market growth to recoup its investment in a new factory that began commercial operations in January 2003. Before that, the company?s brands were made and distributed in the Philippines by a licensee.Chris Nelson, managing director of Philip Morris? Philippine unit, told lawmakers during a congressional hearing this week that a big jump in tax rates in a short period of time could price cigarettes beyond what smokers could afford and cause a drop in tobacco consumption.?That?s what happened in France and Germany, where they increased the tax rates very fast and the market contracted? he said.Since Philip Morris started building its factory in the Philippines in 2001, cigarette consumption in the country had been rising by an average of 7.6 per cent per year, more than double its long-term growth rate of 2.6 per cent.With four of every 10 adult Filipino puffing an average of 13 sticks a day, the Philippines now ranks as the world?s 12th largest cigarette market, according to Philip Morris.?Clearly, the Philippines is a growing market compared to other markets which are in decline,? said Mr Nelson.Philip Morris is urging lawmakers to increase taxes by a fixed amount of 50 centavos ($0.09) per pack gradually over the next five years, as an alternative to the finance department?s plan to raise tax rates by a third this year.The company argues its proposal will yield more revenues for the government, as it won?t force smokers to shift to lower-priced brands which are taxed at a rate that is a fifth of those on higher priced brands.
327;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2004-09-07T19:47:40Z;‘50 years of fraud';;"On December 15, 1953, presidents of several of America's largest tobacco companies gathered at New York's Plaza Hotel for an unusual meeting. Under discussion were growing health concerns about smoking's health risks. Five epidemiological studies had already suggested links between smoking and cancer - and the press was picking up the story.In one of the hotel's baroque meeting rooms, the heads of American Tobacco, Benson & Hedges, Philip Morris and US Tobacco took the first step in creating what would become a unified strategy to reassure the public that there was no evidence that smoking was harmful.Over the next 50 years, US tobacco companies would conspire to defraud consumers by denying the dangers of smoking and second-hand cigarette smoke. They would fund sympathetic scientists to carry out research to cloud the issue. They would manipulate nicotine levels to keep smokers hooked, and deliberately market cigarettes to youth. Much of that time, however, they knew there was a causal link between smoking and disease.That, at least, is what the US Department of Justice will attempt to prove - in the face of vehement industry denials - in a court case due to begin on September 21. Testimony from the government's opening witnesses is due to be published next Monday. The case may be the biggest judicial assault ever launched by a government on a legal industry.The essence of the case is similar to arguments heard in lawsuits brought by US states and in class actions and individual smokers' suits (see right). But this trial will differ from anything seen in the courtrooms of Mississippi or Alabama.On one side is the US justice department, which - using incriminating documents leaked from inside the companies or uncovered in earlier cases or by its own investigations - has spent five years putting together the most comprehensive anti-tobacco industry case yet assembled. On the other are the combined resources of the industry's biggest companies and their phalanxes of top-flight lawyers.The government says the defendants should “disgorge”, or forfeit, $280bn of “ill-gotten gains” - more than enough to bankrupt them. To bring that about, however, it will have to prove - to a single judge, not a jury - not only that the cigarette companies were guilty of fraud in the past, but that they are likely to continue to offend in the future, a high barrier. The government will also have to justify the size of its $280bn demand.The reason is that this is not the kind of product liability suit, alleging that its products injured a particular smoker or group of smokers, that the industry typically faces. It is being brought instead under the 1970 Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organisations (RICO) Act, designed to fight organised crime.“The government's primary allegation is that the US tobacco industry was essentially an illegal enterprise, just like the mafia,” says Martin Feldman, tobacco analyst at Merrill Lynch.The industry denies past wrongdoing and says it believes the government will never persuade the judge, Gladys Kessler, that it is likely to violate RICO laws in the future. Moreover, it says, restrictions on cigarette marketing that the government is demanding alongside its $280bn claim largely duplicate those put in place by the Master Settlement Agreement of 1998. That was the deal in which tobacco companies agreed to pay $246bn over 25 years to the 50 US states. It ended the states' litigation - and inspired the federal government to bring its own legal assault (see below).“When [the federal government's] lawsuit was filed in 1999, we said we didn't think it was right on the law, on the facts or on the policy, and nothing has changed,” says William Ohlemeyer, associate general counsel at Philip Morris, the biggest US tobacco maker.Philip Morris, together with its parent group, Altria, is one of six corporate defendants. Others are RJ Reynolds, the US number two tobacco company; Brown & Williamson, the number three; Loews Corporation's Lorillard; Vector Group's Liggett; and British American Tobacco (Investments), a unit of the UK's British American Tobacco. Two now-defunct trade organisations are also on trial.The allegations in the US government's latest proposed findings of fact, published in July, are damning:● Cigarette companies “have engaged in and executed - and continue to engage in and execute - a massive 50-year scheme to defraud the public”.● Working with the two industry organisations, the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research, they waged a public relations campaign to deny the harms of smoking and generate controversy around the scientific research. The campaign kicked off shortly after the Plaza Hotel meeting with the “Frank Statement to Smokers”, a signed full-page announcement by the companies in 448 US newspapers. “We believe the products we make are not injurious to health,” it stated, but promised to conduct research to establish the truth.● The defendants, through the CTR, funded scientists willing to generate information that would bolster the industry's litigation defences, and cast doubt on evidence that smoking caused cancer - while acknowledging internally that it did.● They collectively agreed not to develop or market “safer” cigarettes, for fear it could undermine the claim that regular cigarettes were not harmful.● They “engaged in a global effort to fraudulently deny and distort the harms” of second-hand cigarette smoke.● They manipulated nicotine levels in cigarettes to “create and sustain nicotine addiction” in smokers, while denying nicotine or smoking was addictive.● They promoted the health benefits of “light” or low-tar cigarettes, knowing these were no safer than regular cigarettes (many smokers compensate for the lower tar content by inhaling more deeply, or smoking more).● The defendants “intentionally marketed cigarettes to youth under the legal smoking age while falsely denying they have done and continue to do so”.● They destroyed and concealed documents to cover up these activities.The industry rejects all those claims, saying there was no fraud. A central plank of its defence will be that from 1966 - two years after a US Surgeon General's report stated unequivocally that smoking caused cancer - cigarette packets carried a federally-mandated health warning that cigarettes could harm health. How could the companies have deceived anyone?“When the cancer link was established, Congress had to decide whether to ban cigarettes, or provide warnings and information so people could make an informed decision,” says William Ohlemeyer, associate general counsel at Philip Morris, the biggest US tobacco maker. “They decided not to ban them, but to provide warnings.”There was, the companies add, no conspiracy. The meeting in the Plaza Hotel said to have spawned the whole scheme was never even secret: it was notified to the Department of Justice to avoid violating an antitrust decree prohibiting meetings between the companies, and reported in several newspapers. The subsequent “Frank Statement to Smokers” reflected the scientific consensus at the time.The shape of the industry has also changed radically in 50 years - which the companies say reflects dynamic competition inconsistent with the idea of a conspiracy. Philip Morris has gone from the number five player to number one; American Tobacco lost the number one slot it occupied in the 1950s and later became part of British American Tobacco's Brown & Williamson - which recently merged into RJ Reynolds.The companies add that both the Tobacco Institute and Council for Tobacco Research were disbanded after the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement. The former, they add, was a legitimate trade organisation. The latter produced high-quality research on tobacco cited repeatedly in US Surgeon General's reports, and often funded research jointly with government organisations or bodies such as the American Cancer Society.On safer and low-tar cigarettes, Bob McDermott, a lawyer with Jones Day who is lead trial counsel for RJ Reynolds, says there is an incongruity in the government's case. Why would the companies market low-tar cigarettes as safer, knowing they were not, but deliberately not develop cigarettes that were genuinely safer?And companies did develop safer or “reduced-risk” cigarettes, he adds. RJ Reynolds developed two - Premier in 1988, and the “smokeless” Eclipse in 1994 - though neither was a hit with smokers. Low-tar cigarettes, on the other hand, were developed with the encouragement of the government, and it was the government, not the industry, that marketed them as safer. Claims of manipulating nicotine and youth marketing are also denied.The industry may go on the offensive by highlighting the long ties between the US government and tobacco - and the billions the government makes in corporate and excise taxes from tobacco products. “The government makes more money when Philip Morris sells a pack of cigarettes than Philip Morris does,” the company says.Tobacco companies are confident the defence honed in dozens of cases will prevail. “It is the exact same evidence that juries look at in other cases, and for the most part, they return defence verdicts,” says Mr Ohlemeyer.But Dick Daynard, a long-time tobacco industry foe and chairman of Northeastern University's Tobacco Products Liability Project, which encourages tobacco litigation, says that claim is disingenuous. In some cases, he says, the most incriminating industry documents were not introduced into trials, because judges directed that they were not directly relevant to establishing whether smoking had caused a smoker's cancer. In others, Mr Daynard says, juries decided tobacco companies had engaged in wrongdoing but could not be held responsible for an individual's decision to smoke.In this case, no such linkage needs to be found; it is all about the companies' conduct. And the most damaging documents will be presented.Since the government has chosen to bring the case under civil rather than criminal RICO statutes, the case must be proven only on “a preponderance of the evidence” rather than beyond reasonable doubt.“When a jury looks at this evidence, they say, ‘These guys committed one humongous and extended fraud',” Mr Daynard says. “I think there is almost no chance that Judge Kessler isn't going to come to the same conclusion.”Even if she does, however, under the RICO statute the government will have to persuade her that this shows the companies will continue to commit fraud.The tobacco industry argues that the restrictions put in place by the MSA already make future violations virtually impossible. These include bans on marketing to youth, most outdoor advertising, paid-for product placements in films or TV shows, and branded merchandise such as clothing, as well as a ban on any material misrepresentation of fact on smoking's health risks. The agreement is policed by the 50 states' attorneys-general.Mr Daynard disagrees. “The MSA is a very mild restriction on what they do,” he says. “There has been a long history of either outright violations of the MSA, or treating it as basically a marketing challenge.”But winning the argument that only “disgorging” $280bn will prevent the industry from offending again may be the government's biggest challenge. For a start, the industry says, the word disgorgement does not appear in the RICO statute.An appeals court ruled in the so-called Carson case in 1995 that disgorgement could be used to “prevent or restrain” future fraud. But it had to be limited to ill-gotten gains that “are being used to fund or promote the illegal conduct, or constitute capital available for that purpose”. That means the justice department must prove that all the $280bn it seeks is ill-gotten, and that the companies have it to hand.The industry charges that the government has made no attempt to separate ill-gotten from fair gains. Its claim is based on an estimate that cigarette makers made $75bn from selling cigarettes between 1971 and 2000 to smokers who were smoking at least five cigarettes a day by age 21 - what it terms a “youth-addicted population”. Having the use of that $75bn over nearly 30 years enabled the defendants to earn another $205bn.“The government takes the position that if anyone began smoking before the age of 21, that is solely attributable to industry misconduct,” says Mr McDermott, counsel for RJ Reynolds. He says it also ignores the fact that cigarette companies have paid out billions in taxes, and dividends to shareholders. “The government acts as if these so-called ill-gotten gains were all in a piggy bank,” he says.Mr Feldman of Merrill Lynch believes the government's case will ultimately fail, either at the trial stage or on appeal, not least because its disgorgement claim is poorly founded. A similar assumption among investors, he says, explains why the market is not panicking about the case - despite the potentially cataclysmic results if the government won its claim in full and the judgment was upheld by the appeals court and US Supreme Court.Such an outcome, however remote a possibility, could potentially be double-edged. The companies say that, since they do not have $280bn, the government would in effect end up owning them - and would have to decide what to do with them. If the big manufacturers disappeared, thousands of jobs would be lost and the industry would be in the hands of hundreds of small, discount cigarette manufacturers that have sprung up since the MSA - many of whom are not regulated by it.For long-time anti-tobacco campaigners such as Mr Daynard, the outcome is less important than the mere fact of seeing the companies on trial in such a high-profile case. “Whatever the result, I think it will be a very damning indictment of the behaviour of this industry over 50 years,” he says.Case pursued from Clinton to AshcroftWhy is a Republican administration, the traditional friend of the tobacco industry, about to sue it for $280bn? Many on both sides of the case are surprised it has made it this far.The case originated in the late 1990s when the Master Settlement Agreement was being negotiated between cigarette makers and the 50 US states who were attempting to recoup money they had spent through Medicaid, the healthcare programme for the poor, on treating sick smokers.Some lawyers involved, such as Mike Moore, attorney-general of Mississippi, the first state to sue the tobacco companies, and Dick Scruggs, the lawyer who represented Mississippi, tried to persuade the federal government it should do likewise.The government was not convinced. Janet Reno, then attorney general, told a Congressional hearing in 1997 that she thought the federal government “did not have an independent cause of action” against tobacco manufacturers.Yet in January 1999, President Bill Clinton announced in his State of the Union address that the justice department would sue tobacco companies. The aim was to recoup some of the billions spent by the federally-funded Medicare programme, which provides healthcare for the elderly, military veterans and federal employees, on smoking-related illnesses.Judge Gladys Kessler, assigned to handle the case, threw out its medical cost reimbursement elements in 2000. But she allowed an anti-racketeering element of the government's case, under the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organisations statute, to proceed.When George W. Bush became president the case was widely expected to be dropped. He had criticised it during his campaign, and John Ashcroft, his attorney general, had been one of the senators most responsible for blocking legislation in 1998 that would have strengthened federal regulation of the industry.Six months into Mr Bush's term, Mr Ashcroft said he had named a team of lawyers to explore a settlement of the suit. But no deal was reached, apparently because the two sides were so far apart.John Coale, a lawyer who brought class action suits against tobacco companies in the 1990s, suspects the Bush administration concluded dropping the case would be unpopular with voters. “Maybe they polled focus groups and decided it was politically not advantageous for them to settle this, so the Democrats would not have an issue against them,” he says.The tobacco industry remained convinced it could get the case thrown out, or limit its scope. But Judge Kessler has ruled against a series of pre-trial motions from the defendants aimed at doing that.Their best hope of defanging the case may be an appeal, due to be heard in November, over Judge Kessler's rejection of their motion challenging the size of the government's $280bn claim for “disgorgement” of ill-gotten gains. But that appeal is not due to be heard until November - when the main case will be two months old.Key dates in tobacco litigation● Jun 1988 Family of deceased smoker Rose Cipollone wins $400,000 damages against Liggett Myers, which is the first plaintiff’s verdict in a tobacco case.

328;PM;Philip Morris International Inc;2004-08-25T11:42:33Z;Japan Tobacco lashes back at Quebec tax bill;;Japan Tobacco on Wednesday lashed out against Quebec tax officials who have demanded the cigarette maker?s Canadian arm pay C$1.36bn (US$1bn) in damages related to allegations of cigarettes smuggling during the 1990s.?The notice …was totally unexpected, issued without any supporting facts, and is extraordinary given that the ministry demanded almost immediate payment,? JT said. ?We are disappointed by this action and it is simply not acceptable.?JTI-Macdonald, Japan Tobacco?s wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, filed for court protection from its creditors this week in a bid to avoid bankruptcy.Wednesday?s the notice, issued by the Quebec ministry of revenue, demanded that JTI-Macdonald pay the amount in full by August 23. Failure to do so would result in the seizure of JTI-Macdonald?s assets.JT, the manufacturer of Winston and Camel cigarettes outside the US, said filing for court protection was by no means an admission to guilt and the company denied any involvement in the smuggling operation.JT said it was in continued discussions with the court and is considering its options, including taking legal action to ensure that its business remains intact.Tax investigators allege the smuggling took place between 1990 and 1998, which involved shipping Canadian-made cigarettes to the US and routing them back to Canada in order to evade high taxes.The alleged contraband activities took place before JT acquired RJR International?s assets in 1999, which included the RJR-Macdonald Canadian unit.The Quebec government?s C$1.36bn fine is more than 10 times JTI-Macdonald?s operating income of C$123m last year.?According to the invoice we received, it was not clear how the amount was calculated,? said a JT spokesman. ?We received a debit note with an amount attached. There was no other explanation.?Meanwhile, JT has said it is not in negotiations with the European Union, despite Philip Morris?s landmark $1.25bn settlement with the EU to fight the trade in contraband cigarettes. In return, the EU dropped smuggling charges against Philip Morris.JT?s shares in Tokyo closed down 0.7 per cent at Y880,000.
