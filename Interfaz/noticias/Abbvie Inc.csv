0;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;AbbVie drops patent rights for Kaletra antiviral treatment;Combination drug is being studied in several trials as a coronavirus treatment;AbbVie is giving up its patents on a combination drug that is being studied as a coronavirus treatment, becoming the first major drugmaker to drop its rights to make money from a drug that might be used during the pandemic.The US drugmaker will no longer enforce patents relating to Kaletra anywhere in the world for all formulations, according to the Medicines Patent Pool, a UN-backed non-governmental organisation.The company gave notice of the change last week, according to a document seen by the Financial Times, after Israel moved to issue a compulsory licence for the drug combination’s use against the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus that is spreading worldwide.Kaletra is a combination of two antivirals — lopinavir and ritonavir — and is usually used to treat HIV. But some doctors have turned to it for treating patients with coronavirus, and its efficacy is being studied in several clinical trials, including one by the World Health Organization.Stat News, a trade publication, reported last week that the company would allow Israel to purchase generic versions of the drug. AbbVie declined to comment.The company had already donated a supply to the Chinese health authorities in January.What AbbVie has chosen to do “isn’t terribly common, certainly not globally”, said Ellen ‘t Hoen, director of Medicines Law & Policy, a non-governmental organisation. Kaletra has patent protection until at least 2026 in certain territories, according to MedsPaL, a database.The pandemic has caused 12,000 deaths so far and infected nearly 300,000. There are no approved treatments.A Chinese study of Kaletra, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week, showed disappointing results, with no effect on the progression of the disease.But for patients who started the drugs less than 12 days after their first symptoms, the mortality rate was 15 per cent, compared with 27 per cent over all, and the authors suggested it may work better if combined with other antiviral agents.Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop treatments and vaccines for the virus. So far, scientists have most hope for remdesivir, a drug developed by Gilead as a potential treatment for Ebola. Hospitals in the US are also stockpiling generic antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have shown some positive impact in small studies.“AbbVie did the right thing,” said Ms ‘t Hoen. “But it foremost shows the power of the measure. Benefits will be immediate for people living with HIV, because generic supply is now possible everywhere in the world. The usefulness for Covid-19 still needs to be demonstrated and trials have started.”
1;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-02-07T17:38:21Z;AbbVie boosts outlook despite competition from generic drugs;Quarterly earnings beat expectations as cancer drug sales jump;Soaring sales of cancer drugs are helping AbbVie compensate for tougher than expected competition outside the US to its blockbuster drug Humira, leading the drugmaker to increase its guidance for the full year. Richard Gonzalez, Abbvie’s chief executive, on Friday said rivals selling alternatives to Humira, its anti-inflammation drug, had been “more aggressive than we had anticipated”. But the company beat earnings expectations in the fourth quarter.The Illinois-based drugmaker has been grappling with a patent-cliff outside the US for Humira, which was the world’s best-selling drug in 2018. As competition from biosimilars — generic alternatives to biologic drugs — began, sales of Humira dropped more than 30 per cent in international markets in 2019.The company has enjoyed robust growth in Humira sales in the US, however, where the drug’s patent is still protected — they were up 8.6 per cent to $14.9bn for the full year — and sales of treatments for blood cancers rose 39 per cent year-on-year to $5.5bn to fill in some of the gap from disappointing international sales.Abbvie’s $63bn deal to acquire Allergan, the maker of Botox, is also part of a plan to bolster the company’s pipeline of new drugs before it loses exclusivity on Humira in the US in 2023, when it expects seven rivals to enter the market. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter. It announced agreements to divest two assets — one to AstraZeneca, another to Nestlé — at the end of last month. The terms of the transactions were not disclosed. Mr Gonzalez said the combined company will be “underpinned by tremendous cash flow” and boast six recently launched products. These include Abbvie’s Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which treat the same inflammatory conditions that Humira did, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.The company expects the two drugs to contribute revenues of $1.7bn in 2020. As US drugmakers come under political pressure to curtail price rises, Mr Gonzalez said AbbVie will have a diversified portfolio of customers and so not be heavily reliant on either US government healthcare programmes or uninsured individuals who pay for their own drugs. “It’ll be a business driven by volume, not by price. And that’s important,” Mr Gonzalez said. AbbVie significantly raised its guidance for 2020, sending shares up 5 per cent to more than $91 in mid-morning trading in New York. AbbVie expects non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year of between $9.61 and $9.71, higher than the consensus forecast of $9.48, which would be an increase of about 8 per cent year-on-year at the midpoint. The guidance includes one-off expenses related to the transaction but is not a forecast for the combined businesses, which the company will issue when the deal closes.In the fourth quarter, revenue rose 5.3 per cent to $8.7bn, in line with Wall Street expectations, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.21, higher than consensus forecasts for $2.19. Net income was $2.8bn. 
2;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2019-11-28T16:22:16Z;Why some corporate bond investors see higher risk in higher ratings;Fund managers look for companies committed to protecting their balance sheet;"A topsy-turvy thesis is gaining traction among debt investors, with some fund managers arguing that the supposed safety of buying the highest-rated US corporate bonds is an illusion.Instead, the argument goes, buying much-maligned triple B rated bonds — which sit just above the threshold of junk — is a better, possibly even safer, bet.Triple B debt is typically seen as a potential breaking point in a long-overdue reckoning in the corporate debt markets. If the cheap money era implodes, this could be where the first cracks form.But the case in their favour begins with big companies like AT&T, Verizon, or most recently AbbVie, each of which has deliberately loaded up on cheap debt to fund large takeovers, taking a hit to their credit ratings in the process.AbbVie borrowed $30bn from investors this month to fund its takeover of rival pharmaceutical company Allergan. In response, rating agency S&P Global said it expects to lower AbbVie’s sole single A minus rating to triple B plus when the deal closes in the first quarter.That doesn’t sound too positive but AbbVie, like others, is now committed to reducing its debt, which now stands at $90bn, trimming its balance sheet in a bid to maintain its investment-grade rating.Investors say that over time, this represents a good bet; if the quality of the company improves, so too should the value of its bonds.In contrast, companies rated single A or above still have room to go through the same punishment as AbbVie, if they decide to take advantage of low borrowing costs to fund acquisitions or buy back their own stock.“Triple Bs get all the airplay but if you take a step back . . . people are probably underappreciating the risk of A-rated companies getting downgraded to triple B,” said Josh Lohmeier, head of North American investment grade credit at Aviva Investors.Investors like Mr Lohmeier are nervous that they could find themselves paying up to buy debt right before a company is downgraded. One potential example highlighted by investors is tech company Oracle. In September, it said it would increase its efforts to buy back its own stock and signalled that it remains open to acquisitions — both of which could threaten its single A rating. Investors also point to tech company 3M, which increased its stock buyback plans a year ago.Instead, some favour betting on companies already committed to more prudent balance sheet management, especially given that the end of the current economic cycle is thought to be near.“You have a lot of very large triple-Bs that are trying to pay down debt. That has not changed,” said Hans Mikkelson, a credit strategist at Bank of America. “What has changed is the companies that have more capacity — like single-A’s and double-A’s — have added more debt. I would be concerned buying single and double-A’s. The risk is those bonds will get downgraded.”It seems taking more risk might actually be less risky.joe.rennison@ft.com"
3;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2019-11-15T04:00:28Z;Credit market fears of downgrades have not materialised;More supportive central bank policy has provided a prop as leveraged companies hold back;"Like a lapsing gym membership, companies’ commitments to go on a debt diet this year have been showing signs of waning.This week, pharmaceutical company AbbVie borrowed $30bn from bond investors to help fund its $83bn acquisition of Allergan, pushing its total debt outstanding close to $100bn and making it one of the most indebted companies in the world.After the deal was lapped up by investors, chatter on trading desks turned to speculation surrounding a possible buyout of drugstore Walgreens Boots Alliance by private equity firm KKR — a deal that could involve another borrowing splurge.What do the two companies have in common? Both AbbVie and Walgreens are rated at the lower rungs of the investment-grade ladder — a group of borrowers classified as triple-B that has ballooned in recent years as companies have taken advantage of low borrowing costs and loaded up on cheap debt.Last year, nervous attention focused on the expanding universe of debt clinging on to investment-grade ratings, as concerns over slowing global growth fanned fears that a potential downturn in the US economy could lead to a series of downgrades.As corporate bonds slip from the investment grade market, they could lose the support of investors bound by mandates to buy only higher quality debt. Instead, those so-called fallen angels end up relying on demand from the much smaller high-yield bond market, typically pushing borrowing costs higher.Some fret that an unexpected tightening of monetary conditions or an economic downturn could hit this sector hard. “If the economy falters, it gets scary quickly,"" said Peter Tchir, chief macro strategist at Academy Securities. But those fears are now easing. A shift to more supportive central bank policy has provided a prop for credit markets and the few downgrades that have emerged have done little to derail the recent rally.Analysts at Bank of America noted this week that gross leverage among investment-grade companies increased in the third quarter, propelled by a blowout September that proved to be the heaviest month of issuance on record. But that rise in leverage has been small.That is because, as the bank’s analysts point out, much of the new borrowing stems either from refinancing activity or from companies that had previously been more restrained. Optimists argue that this makes sense in a cheap money environment.AbbVie is in that category despite its bumper bond. It still holds a single-A credit rating from Standard & Poor’s, despite being dragged down by both Fitch and Moody’s rating the company at the upper end of triple-B. Meanwhile, companies that have already ratcheted up their outstanding debt, such as AT&T, have reiterated commitments to reduce leverage.All this suggests that leveraged companies are sticking to plans to cut debt, but less leveraged companies are indulging in more borrowing. Perhaps those debt diets are not so far off-track after all.Joe Rennison@ft.com"
4;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2019-11-12T23:46:13Z;AbbVie sells $30bn of bonds to finance Allergan takeover;Corporate issuance set to be among largest on record in US;The US pharmaceuticals group AbbVie sealed one of the largest US corporate bond deals on record on Tuesday to finance its $83bn takeover of rival Allergan.AbbVie borrowed $30bn from investors clamouring for investment-grade debt, in a bond offering split across 10 different maturities from 18 months to 30 years.The deal was the biggest bond offering since the healthcare and drugstore operator CVS raised $40bn in March last year to fund its takeover of the insurer Aetna. It ranked as the fourth-largest bond sale ever completed, also trailing a $46bn offering from the brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev in 2016 and the record $49bn raised by Verizon in 2013 to buy the stake in its wireless unit it did not already own.Hearty demand for the AbbVie offering underscored investor appetite for the riskiest, highest-yielding bonds in the investment-grade category. Orders came in for more than twice the total on offer, according to people familiar with the sale.High demand also allowed AbbVie’s bankers to reduce the company’s likely borrowing costs versus initial guidance. Its 10-year note carried a premium above US Treasury bonds of just 130 basis points, down from the 150bp originally mooted.Mark Jackson, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management, said the demand showed investors were “starved” of yield. “There are clearly some risks but it’s a good quality company with cash flow to pay down debt,” he said.Despite the hefty borrowing, AbbVie is expected to cling on to its investment-grade bond rating. The company has committed to cut its leverage from 3.4 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation to 2.5 times by the end of 2021, according to people familiar with the company’s plans.The borrowing lifts Abbvie’s total debt to about $90bn, making it one of the most indebted companies in the world and further increasing the size of the market for triple-B rated bonds, which sit just above junk status.Andrew Forsyth, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said investors were of the view that AbbVie would cut its debt over time. “On a megadeal it really depends on the prospects for the companies that are combining. In this case it’s reasonably positive,” he said.Richard Gonzalez, chief executive of AbbVie, is working to shift the drug giant away from its blockbuster inflammatory treatment Humira, which generated more than 60 per cent of the company’s $33bn of revenues last year but is now facing competition from new generic medications.Mr Gonzalez told analysts earlier this year that “Humira is essentially buying the assets that replace it over the long term”.With Allergan, AbbVie will add Botox as well as a host of drugs that are used in eyecare, gastroenterology and to treat the central nervous system to its portfolio.
5;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2019-08-13T17:04:25Z;JPMorgan Chase set to scoop record fee for Allergan sale;AbbVie’s planned $63bn purchase of the Botox-maker will earn $123m for bank;JPMorgan Chase is poised to collect the largest individual fee to a bank for selling a company, earning $123m for advising Botox-maker Allergan on a planned $63bn sale to US pharmaceutical group AbbVie.Assuming the deal completes, the fee would be the largest ever disclosed, surpassing the $120m paid to Morgan Stanley for advising US agribusiness Monsanto on its $66bn sale to Germany’s Bayer in 2016, according to data from Dealogic.The details of the fee arrangement were disclosed by Allergan this week as it prepares for a shareholder vote on its sale to Chicago-based AbbVie.The documents released by Allergan detail the relatively hasty negotiations which led to the transaction on June 25. AbbVie is betting the acquisition will diversify its business and reduce its reliance on income from its inflammatory disease treatment, Humira, the world’s best selling drug.The bulk of the $123m fee will be paid only if the deal completes but $12.5m has already been disbursed. The payments shine a light on the lucrative work of bankers who spend years building relationships with companies to cash in on big takeovers, regardless of the consequences for the buyer.Bayer, for instance, has struggled since digesting its Monsanto purchase, with its market value falling by more than $45bn since the deal.. The acquiring company bears the cost of the fees paid by target companies to their advisers because they are ultimately buying the business that is making the payments.There have been a number of blockbuster takeovers this year, including Bristol-Myers Squibb’s purchase of biotech company Celgene for $90bn. JPMorgan advised Celgene on that deal and received $100m for its work, alongside a payment of $67m by Celgene to Citigroup. That transaction rivalled records for the largest gross sellside fees to a group of banks on a takeover.There has been $2.6tn of global mergers and acquisitions so far this year, according to Dealogic data. More than half occurred in the US, with $1.4tn worth of deals agreed. The pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors have been among the most active with $479bn worth of transactions announced.JPMorgan sits in second place in global league table rankings for the total value of announced M&A deals it has worked on this year, behind perennial leader Goldman Sachs.AbbVie chief executive Rick Gonzalez first approached his counterpart Brent Saunders at Allergan in mid-March and later in April before talks between the two companies sped up in May. In late May, Mr Saunders disclosed the roles of his advisers at JPMorgan and law firm Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz.AbbVie agreed to pay Allergan $188 per share, with two-thirds of the consideration coming in cash and the remainder in stock. Shares in AbbVie, which was advised by Morgan Stanley, have fallen 16.4 per cent since the deal was unveiled on June 25, reducing the value of the stock portion of its offer.The documents show that in its initial range AbbVie offered between $174-$178.50 per Allergan share, eventually bumping the number to the $188 figure after a series of discussions between Mr Gonzalez and Mr Saunders.According to people with knowledge of the negotiations with AbbVie, the dealmaker most closely involved from JPMorgan was Steve Frank, chairman of healthcare investment banking, who has a longstanding relationship with Mr Saunders from Allergan. The deal marks the second-time in four years that Allergan has agreed to be acquired and worked with JPMorgan.A planned takeover of Allergan by US drugmaker Pfizer in 2015 fell through a year later when Barack Obama’s administration took steps to scupper a deal which was designed to help Pfizer escape paying US taxes by capturing Allergan’s Irish tax incorporation.That deal valued shares in Allergan at $363.63 or roughly double what AbbVie agreed to pay four years later, reflecting the difficulties the company faced from a tumbling share price and attacks from a hedge fund pushing to divide his chief executive and chairman roles.“Steve Frank and his JPM team in healthcare are a force of nature and have worked for years with Allergan on the strategic combinations that helped make the company what it is. That relationship banking over time yields high reward and should,” said James Woolery, veteran dealmaker and head of M&A corporate at law firm King & Spalding.A former member of Mr Frank’s team, Henry Gosebruch, joined AbbVie in 2015 and is its head of strategy.*This story has been updated to clarify that Mr Saunders, not Mr Gonzalez, was advised by JPMorgan and Wachtell. It has also been corrected to make clear that Pfizer’s offer was roughly double the AbbVie offer.
6;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2019-07-26T12:27:17Z;AbbVie raises guidance as cancer treatments boost sales;Chicago-based pharmaceutical company reported better than expected earnings and revenue;AbbVie reported better than expected earnings and revenue while raising its guidance, as sales of cancer treatments helped the Chicago-based pharmaceutical company which is suffering from the loss of exclusivity of its blockbuster drug Humira in Europe.AbbVie said it now expects adjusted earnings per share to be between $8.82 and $8.92 for the full year, up from its previous guidance of from $8.73 to $8.83.AbbVie announced in June that it plans to acquire Botox maker Allergan for $63bn, as it tries to replenish its pipeline ahead of losing exclusivity on its key drug Humira, for inflammatory diseases, in the US. The announcement of the deal sent the stock plummeting 15 per cent.In the second quarter, AbbVie reported earnings per share of $2.26, above the average analyst estimate of $2.21, and up from $2.00 for the same quarter the year before. Net earnings were $741m, compared with $2bn the year before, primarily due to an increase in the fair value contingent consideration for the psoriasis drug Skyrizi, part of a collaboration with German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim, after it received approval.Sales of $8.3bn were higher than the consensus forecast for revenue of $8.1bn in the quarter but down 0.3 per cent year-on-year on a gaap basis. Revenue from Humira, the world’ bestselling drug, dropped 35 per cent internationally, as biosimilar competition entered the market. In the US, where AbbVie still has exclusivity, sales increased 7.7 per cent.But sales of drugs in AbbVie’s hematologic oncology portfolio, which treat blood cancers, soared 29 per cent to $1.3bn.Shares in AbbVie, which have fallen 29 per cent in the last year, added 2.3 per cent to $68.18 in pre-market trading in New York.
7;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2019-06-26T03:00:26Z;AbbVie hopes Botox-maker Allergan can iron out its wrinkles;Pipeline failures and drugs coming off patent lead to tie-up of pharma companies;Two months ago, AbbVie chief executive Rick Gonzalez approached his counterpart at Allergan, Brent Saunders, with a proposition he believed could solve a series of problems facing their respective drug companies.The discussion culminated on Tuesday with the second blockbuster acquisition in the drug industry this year: AbbVie would buy Allergan in a cash-and-stock deal that valued its shares at $63bn before the addition of about $20bn in net debt.For Mr Saunders, a serial dealmaker who had pieced together Allergan through a succession of takeovers, the deal provided relief from a tumbling share price and attacks from a hedge fund pushing to divide his chief executive and chairman roles.Once the darling of stock market investors, Allergan’s fall from grace meant that the sale at an enterprise value of $83bn equates to roughly half the value of its previously agreed deal to sell itself to Pfizer back in late 2015.That transaction, which was worth $160bn, would have allowed Pfizer to redomicile to Ireland by merging into Allergan and allow the US drugmaker to escape US taxes. The move was blocked by changes in tax policy by the Obama administration and in hindsight marked the high-water mark of Mr Saunders tenure.Since then, Allergan — best known for its cosmetic drug Botox — has been struggling to keep pace with Wall Street’s thirst for growth. The business was pummelled by a series of pipeline failures that pushed shares to multiyear lows, leading to calls for the company to consider a break-up. The 45 per cent premium paid by AbbVie only values Allergan at levels it was trading at last August.For Mr Gonzalez, whose shares plunged 15 per cent after the deal was announced, the threat to AbbVie had been clear for years. Its blockbuster drug, Humira, which treats autoimmune diseases, has allowed company to print money — but for a finite period.Accounting for 60 per cent of AbbVie’s $33bn in annual sales, it will go off patent in the US in 2023, all the while facing increased competition from rivals who are developing generic versions. How to find sources to replenish those sales once the tick lower was a source of constant consternation.“Humira is essentially buying the assets that replace it over the long term,” Mr Gonzalez said in a call with analysts on Tuesday.Another person close to the talks said: “This gives the company an insurance policy and Humira itself will pay down the debt.”The new group, which would sit close to rivals Pfizer and Novartis in terms of revenues, will retain an important presence in immunology — with Humira and Skyrizi — hematologic oncology — with Imbruvica and Venclexta — and virology — with drugs used to treat hepatitis C — among other areas.Humira, whose sales AbbVie projects will stay stable at $19bn a year, will generate cash flow that will be used to pay down the enormous debt that is required to fund the deal. It will also help AbbVie try to mine Allergan’s own pipeline of drugs for new products. AbbVie hopes that its global sales force will also help bolster Botox revenues.The deal is only the latest tactic from Abbvie to offset the end of the Humira cash machine. After having its own deal to move to Ireland — through a 2014 takeover of Shire — blocked by policy changes from the Obama administration, the Chicago-based company has looked elsewhere.It spent $21bn on Pharmacyclics in 2015, and then bought Stemcentrix for just under $10bn.The rise of Allergan, meanwhile, was masterminded by Mr Saunders. A former Bausch & Lomb executive, the 49-year-old built Allergan through a succession of deals that began in 2013 when the company he ran, then called Actavis, bought Ireland-headquartered Warner Chilcott.That deal paved the way for the company to relocate its tax base away from the US and led ultimately to the $66bn takeover of Allergan, where Mr Saunders adopted the target’s name and remained in charge.However, pressure on the company eventually led Wall Street analysts to discuss the possibility of a break-up. The company floated plans to sell its women’s health and infectious diseases businesses in a bid to raise $6bn. It is likely the company was on the radar of potential acquirers for a while because of the expected longevity of its aesthetics business, analysts at Credit Suisse said.There could also be a fiscal motivation behind the acquisition. The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 gave incentives for the tax-efficient repatriation of cash that had previously been piling up offshore, said Michael Levesque at Moody’s, including for debt repayment. Moody’s projects $18bn and $20bn of cash flow from operations in 2020 and 2021, respectively, substantially all of which can be repatriated and used for debt reduction and shareholder dividends.“Allergan, with its well-­known Botox, is being used to smooth the wrinkles this time not of a face but of a company,” said analysts at Wells Fargo. They cautioned they weren’t convinced the deal would be a better long-term alternative for investors looking past the loss of exclusivity for Humira.Mr Gonzalez’s challenge at AbbVie is proving wrong both the analysts and the investors who wiped nearly $20bn off his company’s market capitalisation on Tuesday.
8;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2019-06-25T17:42:10Z;AbbVie/Allergan: not looking good;Even desperate companies cannot count on shareholder support;Botox can fill even the most obstinate wrinkles but the botulinum toxin contained in injections can cause unexpected sagging too. On Tuesday, pharma giant AbbVie announced that it was acquiring Allergan, best known as the maker of Botox, at an enterprise value of $85bn. AbbVie has been desperate to fill in the gap for its blockbuster arthritis drug Humira, which loses patent protection in 2023. Allergan fits the bill.Unfortunately, AbbVie’s shareholders are not impressed by the 45 per cent premium it is paying — in spite of an aggressive synergy target. AbbVie’s shares fell 15 per cent on Tuesday morning.Big Pharma is plagued by social pressure on drug prices and fading drug portfolios. Both create pressure for blockbuster dealmaking. The conundrum is that shareholders hate the risk associated with bet-the-company transactions.Yet even with a massive premium, Allergan is being acquired at a price just above half its 2015 peak. It was once a Wall Street darling, executing an inversion deal with Actavis and other aggressive acquisitions. As its growth prospects slowed, investors grew restless. Appaloosa Management has been waging an activist campaign. There was a chance the company would split itself in two between aesthetic products like Botox and the remaining portfolio.Given its challenges, a premium offer from AbbVie feels like a small miracle for shareholders. Yet AbbVie claims to believe it is getting Allergan cheaply, noting the premium is modest relative to comparable deals. Moreover, it has a plan to achieve a staggering $2bn in annual efficiencies by whacking at combined R&D and overhead costs. The $2bn figure represents around 40 per cent of Allergan’s annual spend in those areas. AbbVie says it can boost its earnings per share by a fifth.Pharma investors have grown to ignore such earnings accretion calculations. Earlier this year, Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired fading biotech star Celgene while promising a massive near-term boost in profits per share. That deal was so poorly received several Bristol shareholders organised against it.AbbVie has learnt that lesson. It has limited the amount of stock it is issuing to Allergan shareholders so that its own investors will not have a vote. But with shares off so sharply, investors are making their views clear anyway.
9;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Allergan’s stock climbed 27 per cent to $163.94.AbbVie is betting the acquisition will improve its offering as Humira, the world’s best-selling treatment for inflammatory diseases, is set to face competition from generic versions as the drug goes off patent in the US.Allergan’s portfolio is best known for Botox, a wildly popular non-surgical cosmetic treatment, but the company also makes drugs that are used in eyecare, gastroenterology and to treat the central nervous system.The deal will see AbbVie pay $188.24 for each share of Allergan, made up of $120.30 in the form of cash and the rest in stock, the companies said on Tuesday. The offer values Allergan at a 45 per cent premium to its closing price a day earlier. Including about $20bn of Allergan debt, the enterprise value of the deal is $83bn.Bristol-Myers Squibb’s $90bn takeover of Celgene, struck in the first few days of January, helped unleash a wave of pharma deals this year. It was followed by Pfizer’s $11.4bn purchase of oncology specialist Array BioPharma and Eli Lilly’s $8bn buyout of Loxo Oncology.“With our enhanced growth platform to fuel industry-leading growth, this strategy allows us to diversify AbbVie’s business while sustaining our focus on innovative science and the advancement of our industry-leading pipeline well into the future,” said Richard Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive at AbbVie.Even before striking the deal for Allergan, AbbVie had spent $21bn on biopharmaceutical company Pharmacyclics in 2015 in a bid to bolster its drug pipeline. A year later it agreed to pay as much as $10bn for Stemcentrx.AbbVie and Allergan will have combined sales of more than $48bn and generate operating cash flow of more than $19bn, which AbbVie said would be used to pay down the hefty amounts of debt required to fund the transaction.As part of the deal, two directors at Allergan including its chairman and chief executive, Brent Saunders, will join AbbVie’s board. Mr Saunders, who joined Allergan in 2014, has led the group through a difficult period that has seen a sale to Pfizer collapse and its stock fall more than 60 per cent from its 2015 peak.More recently, Allergan has faced a challenge from hedge fund Appaloosa that called for the chairman and chief executive roles held by Mr Saunders to be split.AbbVie plans to fund the transaction with debt and cash on its balance sheet. Morgan Stanley and its Japanese partner MUFG have committed $38bn to finance the transaction, in one of the biggest bridge loans on record.The borrowings will saddle AbbVie with debt, and the pharmaceutical group said it would be focused on reducing leverage in the coming years. The companies hope to wring at least $2bn of costs out of the combined group through job cuts and reductions in their research and development programmes.
11;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2019-04-25T12:34:23Z;AbbVie raises forecasts despite pressure on Humira;Blockbuster drug’s revenue outside US takes hit from new competition;AbbVie beat expectations on earnings and raised its forecasts despite suffering a 28 per cent drop in international sales of Humira, its blockbuster drug for inflammatory diseases, due to competition outside the US. The Illinois-based pharmaceutical company guided to adjusted earnings per share for the full year of between $8.73 to $8.83, from a range of $8.65 to $8.75.Richard Gonzalez, chief executive, said the year was off to an “excellent start” and that he felt “comfortable” with the rate that biosimilars — generic competition for biologics — were moving on to Humira’s territory. He said Biogen and Amgen had been the most aggressive competitors so far in Europe. AbbVie also celebrated the recent approval of Skyrizi, a drug for the treatment of the skin disease psoriasis, which afflicts 8m Americans. Mr Gonzalez said it represented a “significant long-term opportunity” with the potential for multibillion-dollar sales at its peak. “Skyrizi is our 12th new product or major indication approval in the last five years demonstrating the productivity of our R&D investment,” he said.He acknowledged that the drug might eventually eat into sales of Humira to treat psoriasis, a concern of many analysts. Humira is used to treat many other inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. AbbVie reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, higher than the average analyst estimate for $2.06 and up 14.4 per cent year on year. Excluding adjustments, net earnings fell 11 per cent to $2.5bn in the first quarter. Total sales fell 1.3 per cent to $7.8bn, in line with expectations, dragged down by the fall in sales of Humira. Humira was the world’s best-selling drug last year and delivered almost two-thirds of AbbVie’s revenue in 2018. But AbbVie now faces huge challenges from biosimilar competition, after its patent expired in Europe late last year. Rivals entering the market include Amgen, Sandoz, Biogen, Samsung Bioepis and Mylan. In the first quarter, Humira represented 56 per cent of revenue at $4.4bn. Sales in the US continued to rise, up 7.1 per cent to $3.2bn year on year, but international sales were down 28 per cent, or 23 per cent on a constant currency basis, to $1.2bn. Drugmakers have been under political pressure from both Republicans and Democrats in the US, as patients suffer from higher out-of-pocket costs for their prescriptions.Mr Gonzalez said AbbVie supported the rebate reform proposal of President Donald Trump’s administration, which would allow patients to get discounts at the pharmacy, rather than distributing them throughout the supply chain. But he criticised “Medicare-for-All” proposals floated by many Democratic presidential contenders, saying that if patients left commercial programmes for Medicare Part D, the drug programme, their costs might go up. “The way the Part D programme works right now, the co-pay out-of-pocket is going to go up dramatically and I don’t think that’s something they would necessarily like,” he said on the earnings call. The pharmaceutical company, which benefited significantly last year from the US tax reform, continued to pay a low rate in the first quarter. AbbVie paid a tax rate of 3.5 per cent on a GAAP basis, or 7.9 per cent when adjusted.AbbVie shares, which had fallen 11 per cent so far this year, dropped 0.9 per cent in Thursday trading to $77.96.
12;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2019-02-26T19:22:07Z;US drugmakers defend pricing under fire in Senate;Some companies pledge to lower costs if government reforms rebate system;US senators accused large pharmaceuticals groups of “stonewalling” and “finger-pointing” rather than taking responsibility for high drug prices, as some companies pledged to lower list prices for medicines if the federal government reforms the rebate system.In a Senate hearing on Tuesday, seven executives from some of the world’s largest pharma groups said they backed the Trump administration’s proposal to remove rebates from the healthcare system. The drugmakers blame pharmacy benefit managers, which administer drugs for insurance plans, of keeping the cash rather than passing on savings to patients.Chuck Grassley, Republican chair of the Senate finance committee, opened the hearing by saying it was not about “scapegoating”. “We’ve all seen the finger pointing. Every link in the supply chain has gotten skilled at finger-pointing,” he said. Senator Grassley added that he understood that drug pricing was a complex issue. “But we have to ask whether it’s too complex or if it should be so complex,” he said.Ron Wyden, the Democratic ranking member of the committee, said drugs did not become “outrageously expensive by accident”. “Drug prices are astronomically high because that’s where pharmaceutical companies and their investors want them,” he said.Senator Wyden added that it was “morally repugnant” that some patients had to choose between drugs and food, while companies treated them as “ATMs”. “I think you and others in the industry are stonewalling on the key issue: reducing list prices,” he said.If you can turn a profit in a country with dramatically lower prices . . . how is that not gouging the American consumer with high prices?Albert Bourla, the new chief executive of Pfizer, said the company would “not keep a single dollar” from the rebate reforms, while Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, said removing the rebates would “definitely reduce list prices”.But others stopped short of a complete endorsement. Jennifer Taubert, Johnson & Johnson’s executive vice-president, said she would like to ensure additional fees were not added to compensate for the loss of rebates. Olivier Brandicourt, chief executive of Sanofi, said that lower list prices must be linked to better access and affordability for the public. Kenneth Frazier, chief executive of Merck, said prices would come down if the system was changed so that no one company faced a disadvantage.Mr Frazier said no company could “unilaterally lower list prices”, because they would be punished financially by the supply chain, but everyone needed to work to change the system. “We have a system where the poorest and the sickest are subsidising others,” he said.The seven pharmaceuticals companies backed legislation to try to ensure that generic drugmakers have access to the samples they need to make the equivalent unbranded drugs.But the pharma executives pushed back against a proposal from the Trump administration to peg US drug prices to an international price index, based on the prices paid by a selection of developed countries. They argued US patients often had access to innovative medicines long before those in other countries and the companies relied on US prices to fund research and development.Mr Bourla accused other developed countries of “free riding on American innovation”.The drugmakers were split on a Democratic proposal that would force them to justify price increases before they raised the list price significantly, with Pfizer, Merck and Sanofi supporting it — but J&J saying it could cause problems in the supply chain.Richard González, AbbVie’s chief executive, was forced to defend the company’s pricing of Humira, its blockbuster arthritis drug, and its efforts to keep the drug exclusive, rather than allowing biosimilars, the equivalent of generic drugs, to be sold in the US.Senator Wyden said the price of Humira had doubled in six years and accused AbbVie of guarding the exclusivity of Humira “like Gollum with his ring”. He pointed out that a portion of Mr González’s bonus had been directly tied to sales of Humira.Biosimilars for Humira are now available in Europe, but will not be available in the US until 2023. Senator Wyden accused AbbVie of “hosing the American consumer and giving breaks to people overseas”.Asked whether AbbVie makes a profit on drugs that it sells in Germany and France, Mr González said it does. Senator Wyden responded: “If you can turn a profit in a country with dramatically lower prices . . . how is that not gouging the American consumer with high prices?”Mr González said the price of Humira in the US played an “important role” in funding the company’s R&D. He added that the company had issued licences to several biosimilar makers to produce Humira.Shares in AbbVie edged up slightly in midday trading in New York in an overall rising market, adding 0.4 per cent to $80.63.
13;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2019-02-24T08:00:24Z;Drugmakers face Senate over drug pricing;Politicians to grill pharma executives over what is fast becoming a key election issue;"When seven executives from the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies appear in front of Congress this week, they will face a rare united front in US politics: both Republicans and Democrats agree that the price of drugs is just too high.The six chief executives from Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, AbbVie, Sanofi, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, plus an executive president from Johnson & Johnson, will face tough questions on Tuesday on what is fast becoming a key election issue for 2020.As more and more Americans are covered by “high deductible” health insurance plans that see them paying a greater proportion of drug prices from their own pockets, politicians are eager to show they are just as shocked as patients at high costs.David Friend, co-founder of the BDO Center for Healthcare Excellence and Innovation, said the hearing will be “political theatre”.“While the Democrats and Republicans have different approaches, they would both like to be seen as champions of lower drug prices,” he said.Dramatic drug price rises — including the notorious case of Martin Shkreli hiking the price of Aids drug Daraprim by almost 5,000 per cent, and aggressive increases from Valeant, have made headlines in recent years, stirring patient anger against the pharma industry.There seems to be a feeding frenzy among the Democrats who are running for president to go after the drug industry, to outdo each other with nonsensical proposalsBut many people are more likely to be hit by the creeping steady rise of popular drugs and high price tags for innovative treatments, such as new therapies for cancer. Spending on pharmaceutical drugs is forecast to rise an average of 6.3 per cent a year from 2017 to 2026, according to the US government’s Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The total bill for retail prescription drugs in 2017 was $333bn.President Trump vowed to lower “unfair” drug prices in his State of the Union speech this month, saying he will tackle the problem of “global freeloading” — countries with lower prices benefiting from research by US drugmakers — and deliver “price transparency”.The administration’s most concrete proposal so far came last month when Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, proposed a rule to push rebates from manufacturers directly to consumers, rather than languishing with middlemen in an opaque system.But the Democrats favour even more extensive regulation, with five presidential candidates — senators Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren — supporting three sweeping bills to shake up the pharmaceutical market.The bills would peg the price of prescription drugs in the US to the median price in five major countries — the UK, Canada, France, Germany and Japan — allow patients and pharmacists to import safe, affordable medicine from Canada and other countries and instruct Medicare, the government-subsidised health plans for seniors, to negotiate lower drug prices collectively.Joe Panetta, chief executive of Biocom, California’s biotech trade association, said he hopes the hearing does not focus on “demeaning and chastising the industry” that has contributed so much to the quality of life and health of patients.“There seems to be a feeding frenzy among the Democrats who are running for president to go after the drug industry, to outdo each other with nonsensical proposals,” he added.While US lawmakers vie to be the people’s champion, the pharma executives appearing before the Senate finance committee on Tuesday are likely to do two things, according to Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, which develops software for employers and health insurers to help cut prescription drug costs: say sorry and point fingers at others.“They will push back against the idea that drug price hikes really go to their bottom line. They will argue that it's a very complex system and lots of other people have their hands in the cookie jar,” he said.“They’ll also try to distance themselves from bad behaviour — smaller companies raising prices 50 or 100 per cent — although, in reality, 10 per cent hikes are still four times inflation and a lot of dollars for some of the mass-market drugs.”Pascal Soriot, chief executive of UK-based AstraZeneca, will try to make the case that pharma can play a role in reducing costs for the health system overall. Speaking to reporters after releasing the company’s fourth-quarter results this month, Mr Soriot said he intended to tell the lawmakers that “pharmaceuticals can be part of the solution, as opposed to part of the problem, if we start looking at healthcare costs in their totality”.One area of questioning the committee is likely to focus on is whether rebates — the discounts that drug companies offer to insurers — are pushing up costs for consumers, who often have to pay a proportion of the list price of a drug rather than the discounted price.Speaking before the hearings, Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the committee, said: “Nobody seems to know exactly how you arrive at a price and why do you have rebates — [both] in the sense of how big [the rebates] are and who benefits from a rebate, whether the consumer benefits or if someone in between benefits.”Many are likely to point the finger at pharmacy benefit managers, the companies that administer drug programmes for insurers. Drugmakers have welcomed Mr Azar’s proposal to bring transparency to the rebate system, arguing the PBMs should be passing more of them to patients.As diabetic patients have shared horror stories about not being able to afford insulin, Sanofi and rivals Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have come under fire for price increases on the essential medicine.But Adam Gluck, head of external affairs for Sanofi, said the net price for its insulins had declined by 25 per cent since 2012 because of competition, but that had not been passed on to consumers.“We know there’s a lot of anger among the patient community about why their costs continue to go up, and we share their frustration that declining net prices in insulin have not translated into lower costs for patients,” he said.Mr Panetta said it was “only fair” that every part of the industry should be discussing how to bring down prices. “Why aren’t the PBMs being brought to the Hill? Why aren’t the insurance companies being brought to the Hill?” he asked.Under fire, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, the trade body for PBMs, recently launched an advertising campaign to demonstrate how they are “advocates for consumers in the fight to lower prescription drug costs”.But others believe technology will disrupt the PBMs’ business models, so regulators do not have to.John Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple who now leads RXAdvance, a PBM cloud platform, said companies like his — and Amazon, which bought online pharmacy PillPack last year — will introduce transparency into the market.“Amazon is going to be a big player in this industry,” he said. “It is a problem better solved by the private sector.”The seven executives will push back hard on proposals that will directly target their businesses, from setting prices based on those in other countries and allowing imports from abroad, to pushing Medicare to negotiate lower prices and measures to encourage more generic competition.The pharma groups will tout the vital research and development for the whole world — and each drug costs an average of $2.6bn to create, according to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development.They will also explain how they are innovating with new payment models such as value-based pricing, where insurers only pay for drugs which are proven to be effective. There are now more than 40 such contracts for medicines, according to industry association PHRMA.Mr Soriot has cited Brilinta, a drug to treat cardiovascular disease, where AstraZeneca has made a commitment that no more than a certain percentage of patients prescribed the medicine would suffer a second heart attack, saving money on hospitalisation.Mr Friend said the pharma companies know they have to take action.“They are aware at the growing anger in the US over drug pricing,” he said. “If they don’t do something, they could have price controls shoved down their throat.”Cristie Felix cannot forget a trip to her local CVS in North Carolina this time last year.She was picking up Temodor, a Merck-made drug for her stage IV brain cancer, that usually cost her $75. But as her husband’s insurance had recently switched from Cigna to United, the bill had jumped: her insurance would now pay only $1,100 of the $7,000 price tag.“Think about that: $5,900 a month after the insurance kicks in,” she said.Ms Felix had already experienced an adverse reaction to the generic alternative, which made her “super super sick”.“I have brain cancer. It’s not like I have a cold, it’s not like I had any other option; this was the only drug I could take that would help shrink my brain tumour,” she said.She feels lucky that her husband’s employer hired a mediator to help them reduce the cost — and eventually she was enrolled on a programme run by Merck to receive it free of charge.But like many US patients struggling to navigate the complex and expensive healthcare system while they are sick, Ms Felix holds both the government and the drug companies responsible for high prices.“It’s almost like they combined forces to make this so difficult,” she said.Democrats’ drugs price plan will boost retailers / From Jeremiah Norris, Washington, DC, US"
14;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;AbbVie/arthritis drugs: copycat flap;Pharm group’s patent loss will be the gain of healthcare funders;Tumbling over a patent cliff can be traumatic. For the world’s best selling drug, the prospect is particularly daunting. AbbVie, US maker of immune disease treatment Humira, unveiled strong third-quarter results on Friday. But the competition unleashed by last month’s expiry of Humira’s European patent could be tougher than expected.Rivals have not lost time making inroads into a $4bn market. Amgen, Sandoz, Mylan, and Samsung Bioepis launched copycat drugs in Europe two weeks ago. Prices differ between markets but are between 10 and 80 per cent cheaper. Humira’s sales outside the US could drop by a quarter in 2019.AbbVie’s loss will be the gain of healthcare funders. Humira was a breakthrough drug that reduces the pain and disability caused by diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. One of its pioneers won the Nobel Prize last month. But it is pricey. A filled syringe costs nearly $3000 on average, more than treble a decade ago. Increasingly it is the cost of treatment, rather than the disease itself, that cripples patients.AbbVie investors were already braced for falling sales of Humira, now accounting for over 60 per cent of turnover. The shares have dropped nearly a fifth this year and are trading at less than 10 times next year’s earnings. That is despite a promising pipeline and the success of drugs such as cancer blockbuster Imbruvica.AbbVie can expect a few more good years from its wonder drug. Even when competitors arrive, patients might stick with its version. Copies of drugs like Humira — huge molecules that are biologically engineered using hamster cells — are not exact replicas.The crunch will come in 2023, when AbbVie will no longer be able to fend off US competition. AbbVie’s new products are unlikely to grow quickly enough to offset any decline from Humira. AbbVie hopes to break its fall post patent expiry. Shareholders will still feel the pain along the way.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Sign up at ft.com/newsletters.
15;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Rivals line up to take on world’s best-selling drug;As the European patent on AbbVie’s Humira expires, biosimilars are ready to target $20bn market;"In the world of biologic drugs, there is no bigger opportunity.On Tuesday, the patent that for 15 years has protected Humira, the world’s best-selling prescription drug, from generic competition expires in Europe — triggering a tussle among a string of the most prominent names in the pharmaceuticals industry to secure a slice of a near $20bn global market.The development will turn a spotlight on the developing threat posed by the rise of biosimilars — and open up a new frontier in the industry’s attempt to secure an adequate return on its investment, as cash-strapped payers seize on this new wave of copycat drugs as a way to cut costs.The numbers tell the story. Worldwide sales of Humira, developed by US group AbbVie, last year stood at $18.43bn, according to data provider EvaluatePharma. In 2024, this will have fallen to $14.19bn it forecasts.Among big name companies poised to enter the market with their versions of the drug are Japan’s Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics, which has granted Mylan an exclusive licence to commercialise Hulio in Europe; Amgen; Sandoz; Biogen; and Samsung Bioepis. All have won European regulatory approval for their Humira substitutes.Another company, Boehringer Ingelheim of Germany, remains in patent litigation with AbbVie and has no plans for a European launch, despite its medicine being approved for sale in the EU.Tony Mauro, chief commercial officer of Mylan, pointed out that Europe, where the company is already firming up its launch plans, is “a $4bn marketplace”, with the UK alone spending $635m a year on Humira, which treats a range of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn’s disease.“There’s certainly a mutual excitement from the market because usually this product is one of the top spends, if not the number one spend” by many governments and health systems, he added.For AbbVie, however, the looming patent expiry is a significant threat. Humira accounted for 66.4 per cent of its sales in 2017, a figure that is expected to dwindle to 39.2 per cent in six years, according to Evaluate. The company has fought to protect its patent through the US courts, aiming to delay the launch of the medicine in its biggest market until 2023.In a statement the company, which declined a request for interview, said it “welcomes the introduction of biosimilars that have demonstrated they are as safe and efficacious as their reference products.”However, it argued that “patients who are stable on their existing biologic therapy should not be switched to another product for non-medical reasons”.AbbVie was building on the foundation of Humira, to develop “an extensive immunology portfolio” that would “help us maintain our therapeutic leadership, drive continued growth and make an ongoing impact on patients’ lives”, it said.But, as credit rating agency Moody’s pointed out this month in a report on the biosimilars market, competition from biosimilar drugs, or follow-on versions of complex biotech drugs, represented “a rising threat for branded pharmaceutical companies”.Driving the shift is the imperative, shared by health systems around the globe, to cut the cost of caring for a growing and ageing population.Europe is ahead of the rest of the world in adoption of biosimilars, and the UK’s taxpayer-funded National Health Service is in the vanguard,having already shifted 80 per cent of eligible patients on to a biosimilar version of Rituximab, a blood cancer drug made by Roche.An NHS commissioning document giving guidance on the market for Humira biosimilars, seen by the Financial Times, stated: “Our aim is that at least 90 per cent of new patients will be prescribed the best value biological medicine within three months of launch of a biosimilar medicine, and at least 80 per cent of existing patients within 12 months, or sooner if possible.”To achieve this, the NHS has hit on a novel approach: while the most “competitively priced suppliers” will win a bigger share of the market “all suppliers will get access to at least some of the market upon receipt of a compliant bid to avoid dominance”, according to a second document issued last week.Warwick Smith, director of the British Generic Manufacturers Association, said: “It is all about making sure there are multiple suppliers in the market . . . it won’t be ‘lowest price company gets all’.”Sandoz, the generics arm of Swiss drugmaker Novartis, announced “a global resolution of all intellectual property-related litigation with AbbVie” over its biosimilar, Hyrimoz, just last week. Its biosimilar is now ready for launch on Tuesday.Tim de Gavre, UK head of Sandoz, said: “Rituximab has just gone like a train . . . the NHS has Humira in focus and I’m thinking this could be one of the most successful biosimilars for the NHS in terms of driving uptake and savings.”A perennial worry for biosimilar manufacturers, however, is that they will be pressed into steeper discounts than they can sustain. Biosimilars can take up to nine years to bring to market and consume up to $200m of investment; in contrast a “small molecule” generic drug generally takes a maximum of three years and costs only a few million to develop.Rajiv Malik, president of Mylan, suggested that quality and continuity of supply, not simply price, must be a factor in payers’ commissioning decisions. “You cannot just drive the cost down to a point that business doesn’t make sense just from the cost point of view,” he said.Chad Pettit, executive director for global value access and policy for Amgen’s biosimilars business unit, said its Humira biosimilar, Amjevita, would be launched in all 28 EU member states as well as Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein.While emphasising he could not comment on Amjen’s own pricing strategy, he said that “the savings for biosimilars will be less than the savings achieved from traditional generics since biosimilars are more challenging and expensive to develop”. “If you look at pricing, it’s really going to depend on the market dynamics and vary by region and country,” he added.Nonetheless, Mr Pettit concluded, “high-quality, reliably supplied biosimilars” will offer “the potential for increased access, cost savings for patients, to payers, to hospitals, health systems. They’re going to have an impact.While excitement about the advent of biosimilar versions of Humira is building in Europe, it will be some time before US patients are prescribed these medicines.Part of the reason is specific to the drug. Amgen led the way in reaching an agreement with AbbVie that it would not launch its Humira substitute in the US until 2023, and Mylan, Samsung Bioepis and Sandoz have followed suit.Boehringer Ingelheim is the only company with an FDA-approved biosimilar that has not settled with AbbVie in the US and aims to launch its Humira substitute there “as early as legally possible . . . and certainly before 2023”, it said.While it had planned to bring its biosimilar, Cyltezo, to European patients, “due to the patent litigation with AbbVie in the US, we will not commercialise our biosimilar in the EU”, it added.But the broader climate is also far less hospitable to biosimilars across the Atlantic.In a report this month, credit rating agency Moody’s said that in the US “adoption of biosimilar drugs has so far been slow due mainly to patent protections on many large biotech drugs and also reimbursement challenges”.Pfizer is taking legal action against Johnson & Johnson, alleging it has violated US antitrust laws by hampering uptake of its biosimilar version of Remicade, a J&J drug.The outcome may help to determine the speed and extent of biosimilar penetration in the US, experts say.Pfizer, Biogen, Novartis, Amgen and Mylan have already launched other biosimilar drugs and are expected to bring additional products to market in the next two years, Moody’s noted.“Both branded and generic drug manufacturers are targeting biosimilars as a source of future revenue growth, while more companies are seeking to enter the market driven by a second wave of biologic drugs losing patent protection and expected lower development cost.”"
16;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2018-09-18T19:08:13Z;California sues AbbVie over alleged Humira kickbacks;;California has filed a lawsuit against AbbVie, alleging that the drugmaker gave illegal kickbacks to healthcare providers to prescribe Humira, its blockbuster arthritis treatment.The state’s insurance department claimed the company gave cash, gifts and trips to doctors to induce them to write Humira prescriptions, while employing nurses to downplay the risks to patients.“AbbVie spent millions convincing patients and healthcare professionals that AbbVie Ambassadors were patient advocates — in fact, the Ambassadors were HUMIRA advocates hired to do one thing, keep patients on a dangerous drug at any cost,” said Dave Jones, insurance commissioner, in a statement.The lawsuit alleged that private insurers had paid out $1.2bn in Humira-related pharmacy claims, which the department said made the case the largest health insurance fraud case in its history. Humira is the world’s best selling drug, generating $18.2bn in sales for AbbVie last year.The company allegedly gave doctors “classic kickbacks”, like cash, in addition to more sophisticated gifts like professional goods and services including management software.In addition to the alleged kickbacks, AbbVie sent registered nurses, called “Ambassadors”, to the homes of patients who had been prescribed Humira to “tout the drug” while avoiding, as per their training, direct answers to questions about the risks of the treatment, according to the insurance regulator.It said that the nurses were trained to send patient complaints directly to AbbVie, rather than to the doctors treating them. A whistleblower who worked as an AbbVie ambassador in Florida brought the alleged conduct to the attention of the regulator.The lawsuit seeks an end to the kickbacks, compensation of three times the amount of every Humira-related insurance contract in California resulting from the kickbacks and civil penalties of $10,000 for each fraudulent Humira claim in the state.AbbVie shares were down 2.6 per cent in afternoon trading following the announcement.AbbVie said in a statement that the allegations were “withouth merit.”“AbbVie operates in compliance with the many state and federal laws that govern interactions with healthcare providers and patients,” it said. “AbbVie provides a number of support services for patients, once they are prescribed Humira, that both educate and assist patients with their therapy, including nursing support, and these resources are beneficial to patients dealing with a chronic condition.

18;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2018-04-04T15:49:42Z;Investors smart at ailing pharma deals;Doubts hang over acquisitions struck when the industry was in the grip of an M&A frenzy;In the highly unpredictable world of pharmaceuticals, there is but one certainty: all drugs will lose patent protection in the end.This explains why pharma executives are engaged in a perpetual hunt for new medicines to replenish their pipelines and replace revenues from drugs that fall off the “patent cliff”. As Big Pharma has cut back investment in internal research and development in recent years, the search has tended to focus on acquiring smaller biotech companies with promising drugs. Such deals can transform a company’s fortunes. Gilead’s $11.2bn purchase of Pharmasset, a hepatitis C biotech, in 2012, brought with it one of the most lucrative drug franchises. And Bristol-Myers Squibb’s $2.4bn acquisition of Medarex in 2009 turned it into a leader in the hot field of cancer immunotherapy. Not all transactions stand the test of time, however. There is particular concern among investors over a crop of deals done in 2015 and 2016, when the industry was in the grip of a mergers and acquisitions frenzy. Questions over the merits of one such deal — AbbVie’s purchase of Stemcentrx for $5.8bn in 2016 — resulted in a sharp sell-off of its shares late last month, amid concerns the lung cancer medicine it acquired via the acquisition will be a flop. Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at Leerink, said the poor performance of some acquisitions is dissuading drugmakers from agreeing new deals. “There’s a lot of buyer’s remorse out there, and that is part of the reason we’re not seeing people pull the trigger on transactions,” he said.The Financial Times looks at some of the large biotech companies acquired by Big Pharma in 2015 and 2016, and evaluates whether the deals are turning out as planned.Alexion Pharmaceuticals paid a huge premium to acquire Synageva. At the time, then chief executive David Hallal described the deal as a “beautiful fit” and insisted the value was “appropriate” given the potential for Syangeva’s main medicine, Kanuma, to generate $2bn a year in peak sales. But Alexion has struggled to find enough patients for the drug, which treats lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, a rare inherited disease. Mr Porges forecasts peak sales somewhere in the region of $200m a year. Mr Hallal has since left Alexion, as have several other executives and directors, after investors turned sour on the acquisition, which was compounded by accounting irregularities at the company.“The deal was bad enough that the CEO, the entire management team, and a good proportion of the board of directors left,” said Mr Porges. “The pall has lingered over the company for several years.”As recently as October, AbbVie was predicting up to $5bn annual sales for Rova-T, the lead drug it acquired when it bought privately held Stemcentrx. But data published last month from trial of patients with a type of lung cancer suggest the drug is no better than existing treatments. Shares of AbbVie have lost 20 per cent of their value since the data were published, and the scale of the sell-off indicates that investors are worried about more than a single failed medication. AbbVie is highly reliant on Humira, the world’s top-selling medicine, which generated $18.4bn of sales last year and accounts for roughly two-thirds of revenue: the company desperately needs new products to offset the looming introduction of generic versions of the anti-inflammatory drug. Stemcentrx’s drug development platform, which tries to use stem cell technology to discover cancer medicines with a high chance of success, had been touted by AbbVie as an opportunity to push into the lucrative oncology market.But the data “do not instil confidence in the future of the product or the platform”, said Vamil Divan, analyst at Credit Suisse.Somewhat ironically, the failure of the Stemcentrx deal makes AbbVie more — not less — likely to do further acquisitions, because it still needs products to prepare for the Humira patent cliff.“Pharma companies know their products will disappear,” said one lawyer who has advised on several large healthcare transactions. “Either they have to shut off the lights, develop products themselves — which many of them can’t do — or buy them.” Celgene has been doing deals at a frenetic pace as it prepares for the loss of patent protection on Revlimid, a cancer medicine that accounts for 63 per cent of revenue. Some deals have been welcomed by shareholders, like its recent $9bn acquisition of Juno, a leader in the pioneering field of cell therapies for blood cancers.But the deal for Receptos, which Celgene bought to gain a foothold in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s, is not working out as planned. The US Food and Drug Administration recently refused to accept an application to approve the company’s lead medicine, Ozanimod, in patients with a type of multiple sclerosis, leading to concern over its potential.Scott Smith, who had been promoted from head of its inflammation and immunology unit, stepped down as chief operating officer and president on Monday.However, some bankers argued it is unfair to judge companies on individual deals. Drug development is inherently risky with very poor odds of success, they said.“It makes more sense to look at a series of transactions, as if they were in a portfolio of a venture capitalist, and then assess the outcome of those deals in an aggregated manner,” said one healthcare banker. Still, Celgene could have placed a bet on Receptos for much less: it came within touching distance of buying the group in 2013, when its market capitalisation was just $550m.Pfizer acquired Medivation, a cancer biotech group, after a closely fought contest with rivals including Sanofi and Gilead. Medivation already had a drug on the market when it was acquired, a prostate cancer treatment called Xtandi, which meant it attracted a lot of interest. However, it did not take long for investors to turn sour on the deal, as sales of Xtandi fell short of expectations, prompting concern that Pfizer had overpaid.Andy Schmeltz, Pfizer’s global president of oncology, insisted that the merits of the acquisition will become apparent, as the company wins approval to market the drug for patients whose disease is at an earlier stage. “Everything is tracking as we had aspired and we’re very confident this is a good deal, not only for cancer patients, but also for Pfizer shareholders,” he said. One large Pfizer investor said sentiment towards the deal has improved somewhat in recent months, as the company publishes clinical trial data that support its strategy of broadening the number of patients who can receive Xtandi. The person said they would prefer Pfizer to buy medicines that were already approved, such as Xtandi, rather than a drug in late-stage trials that looks like a sure thing but turns out to be a flop.However, some advisers are counselling clients to take care when bidding in overheated auctions. “Some competitive processes are not great,” said one M&A lawyer. “You get rushed on your diligence and it can be hard to resist bidding up.” No auction was more hotly contested than that of Pharmacyclics, which made a single drug, Imbruvica, for blood cancer. More than any other deal, it embodied the M&A frenzy of 2015 and 2016, and the pressures that Big Pharma face to secure new assets. AbbVie eventually won a three-way fight with a mega offer that stole the group away from Johnson & Johnson, which had a longstanding partnership with Pharmacyclics and was confident it would win.Some advisers also suggested AbbVie ended up valuing the whole of Pharmacyclics at roughly $40bn — given that it still has to share a significant chunk of Imbruvica profits with J&J, it is a huge sum for a company making a single medicine. Other investors warn of competition from new drugs that work in a similar way — known as BTK inhibitors — such as AstraZeneca’s Calquence, which launched late last year. “It has been the only BTK on the market until recently,” said Brad Loncar, founder of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy Index. “The question will be how quickly more competition comes, how much it impacts sales and whether others can actually be superior versions.”AstraZeneca managed to snag its BTK medicine for much less than AbbVie, after purchasing a majority stake in Acerta, a Netherlands-based biotech, for $4bn.AbbVie said in 2015 that it expected Imbruvica to generate peak annual revenues in excess of $7bn, but it generated $2.6bn sales last year.However, Mr Porges pointed out that “even though Pharmacyclics was ridiculously expensive, it left them with a good drug”, adding: “I think they would do that deal again today.” *Premiums are calculated based on the difference between the agreed sale price and the undisturbed stock market price of the target

They should not take management credibility down with them. The loss of $24bn in market value at AbbVie hints at just such a loss of shareholder faith.On Thursday, the biotech titan, said it would not seek accelerated approval for Rova-T, a treatment for small cell lung cancer, after poor trial results. The drug, acquired via the $5.8bn purchase of Stemcentrx two years ago, was forecast to make a few billion a year in revenue. That would have helped offset the impact of looming patent expiry on Humira, Abbvie’s blockbuster arthritis treatment and the pillar of its near-$200bn market value.Humira generates roughly $20bn a year in revenue. On a risk-adjusted basis AbbVie says that its non-Humira portfolio could generate $35bn annually by 2025. Oncology is perhaps its most crucial area of focus. Rova-T, a treatment for solid tumours, targets cancer stem cells. Experts say early trials results were not too promising but AbbVie still maintained its optimism generally in the area of stem cell targeting. And shareholders bought into the story. Since the start of 2017, AbbVie shares have nearly doubled.The company is a big beneficiary of the lower corporate tax rate and still expects its 2018 earnings to grow more than 30 per cent, year over year, given the premium prices of the drugs when they eventually reach the market,AbbVie is hardly the only titan to make big wagers in niche cancer treatments. Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck and Pfizer have also done so. Cancer, for so long seen as intractable, is losing some of its long-held aura of invulnerability. But AbbVie offered a level of hype that was not supported by clinical evidence.The value loss on Thursday was mostly driven by a calculation of the fall in net present value of Rova-T. But the company’s valuation multiple should take a hit too. Its public pronouncements carry less weight now.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Sign up at ft.com/newsletters.

22;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2018-01-31T19:53:00Z;Sell-off causes little concern unless Treasuries rise further;If these stock moves can be called a correction, it is a minor one;Stock markets started this week with their worst two days since last May. It was a sharp reverse after a phenomenal start to the year. How much should we care? So far, not at all.First, to be clear, this cannot yet be described as a correction. In the current context we need to look at the trend. Over the past five years, US stocks have followed a remarkably steady upward trend, always trading within a narrow band. There are only two exceptions. The first came during 2015 as China’s growth problems — and particularly its difficulties managing its currency — scared investors across the world and appeared to be tipping stocks into a bear market. Since China managed to reassure investors that it was in control of the situation, in early 2016, the upward trend survived the transition from Obama to Trump and many political scares without incident — until this year when stocks broke above the trend.At this point, just to get back within the established trend would require falling about another 100 S&P points (as of the morning on January 31) to 2,720. Dropping below the lower edge of the established trend, implying something more than a correction, would require a further fall of some 12 per cent, to break the level of 2,515. So far, if this sell-off can even be called a correction, it is as minor and as healthy as one is possible to imagine.Indeed, the lack of even a minor pullback was beginning to look bizarre. Tuesday’s 1.09 per cent move in the S&P was equivalent to the median daily move in the S&P for the crisis year of 2008. In half of the trading days that fateful year, the index moved by more than 1.09 per cent.And the streak of calm was beginning to challenge the laws of probability. On Monday, we saw the end of a postwar record 99-trading day streak without a daily fall of 0.6 per cent or more.Tuesday’s second consecutive fall of 0.5 per cent or more broke a streak of 310 days without such an event. That was more than double the previous longest stretch without consecutive 0.5 per cent declines since the inception of the S&P in 1928, according to Bespoke Investment.In theory, if you toss a coin and it keeps coming up heads, the odds that it comes up tails next time do not rise. But such a stretch of low volatility looks like a historic freak.This still begs the question of how the market came to take off this year, and the best guess is that traders are still having difficulty processing the tax cut announced at the end of 2017. It was always likely that long and complex legislation would contain some surprises that were not at first apparent. Thus there was a shocked response to AbbVie’s announcement last week that its effective tax rate would fall to 9 per cent, not the expected 20 per cent. Boeing helped the market take off on Wednesday morning with a surprise on how much it expected the tax change to help.Backward-looking earnings for the fourth quarter are healthily ahead of expectations so far, which always eggs on the stock market. According to Thomson Reuters, S&P earnings are on course for 13.7 per cent growth on the back of 7.4 per cent revenue growth.And of course the weakness in the dollar should be a direct boon, flattering US companies. The eye-catching performance of US stocks this month is almost identical to the FTSE index for the rest of the world, in dollar terms — it looks as though currency moves are in the diving seat.Why, then, the sell-off? As health stocks led the selling, having headed the new year rally, some of this can be put down to overexuberance at the effect of the tax reform. We can also, of course, blame Amazon. Monday’s announcement of the company’s entrance to healthcare scared that sector far more than it boosted the internet retailer. A falling oil price this week brought energy stocks back.Most significantly, bond yields broke an important level of resistance on Monday, opening the possibility that they have entered a secular uptrend. For the year so far, the sectors most negatively impacted by rising rates — real estate, telecoms and utilities — had their share prices fall. The sell-off following the scary development in the bond market on Monday caught up every sector. So while this sell-off is not, as yet, anything in particular to worry about, further rises in Treasuries might turn it into something more alarming.john.authers@ft.com
23;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2018-01-26T23:23:03Z;US equities have strongest start to year since 1987;Tax reform and tech earnings send S&P 500 to its best one-day gain in almost a year;US stock markets enjoyed their strongest trading day in almost a year on Friday, continuing an explosive rally that has now seen the S&P 500 log its strongest start to a year since 1987.The one-day gain of 1.18 per cent, the strongest since the 1.37 per cent rise on March 1 last year after President Donald Trump’s first speech to Congress, came despite the publication of figures on US economic growth that were significantly lower than most had hoped, and despite a rise in 10-year bond yields.Instead, the announcement by the drugmaker AbbVie that its effective tax rate would drop to 9 per cent, far below the previously expected 20 per cent, sparked hopes that the effects of the corporate tax cut signed into law by the president last month had still not been priced into stocks.Goldman Sachs’ index of the S&P 500 companies that previously had the highest effective tax rates, and should therefore benefit most from a tax cut, has outperformed the S&P by 6.5 per cent since November 15, when traders first gained confidence that the tax cut would be passed into law.A presidential speech also helped the market’s latest rally. In Davos, Mr Trump failed to lay out the aggressive protectionist agenda the market had previously feared he might.JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said investors had taken cheer from the president’s “conciliatory” tone on Friday. “What he said today is a very reasonable, businesslike point of view,” he said.Traders also cited a further weakening in the dollar, which raised hopes for stronger earnings by US multinationals. Also in Davos, Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the Bank of Japan, commented that Japanese inflation was “finally close” to his target of 2 per cent, in comments widely interpreted to mean that the BoJ’s policy of asset purchases might end sooner than expected. This strengthened the yen and sent the dollar to fresh three-year lows against a basket of major currencies.Gains were led by healthcare companies, which have underperformed in recent months, and by technology groups, after earnings reports prompted widespread sectoral buying.Investors have shown increasing enthusiasm for stocks, adding more than $33bn to global equity funds in the week to January 24 — a record weekly sum — according to EPFR. US stock funds have proven a beneficiary, attracting nearly $20bn over the past three weeks.Yet investors remained aware of the risks. Many noted that this is now likely to be the strongest January since 1987, the year of the “Black Monday” October crash. There is also a widespread belief that stocks have grown too expensive.Lee Ferridge, head of multi-asset strategy in the Americas for State Street, drew attentions to valuations and “the view that they can’t go down, which we know historically is not the case . . . One way traffic is always dangerous”.He added: “Now that most people are getting close to fully invested, or won’t be before too long, where does the next buyer come from?”
24;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2018-01-26T18:04:20Z;Drugmaker emerges as big winner from Trump tax bill;AbbVie’s 9% tax rate reveals how law is a boon companies that keep their IP overseas;AbbVie, the maker of the world’s best-selling drug, issued what analysts described as a “jaw dropping” profit forecast after Donald Trump’s reforms helped the pharma company slash its tax rate to just 9 per cent.The new earnings guidance sent shares in the maker of Humira, a drug used for arthritis and many other inflammatory conditions, soaring 10 per cent to a record high on Friday, giving the group a market value of $190bn.“The company’s tax rate for 2018 is an astonishing 9 per cent compared to an expected 20 per cent, which is the most important contributor to their guidance increase,” said Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at Leerink.Mr Porges said AbbVie would enjoy such low rates because it books almost all of its profits overseas, where they will be subject to a new 13 per cent tax on earnings from patents and other intellectual property.Chicago-based AbbVie said it expects to generate adjusted earnings of between $7.33 and $7.43 per share this year, versus the Wall Street consensus of $6.66. It said the 9 per cent tax rate would increase gradually to hit 13 per cent over the next five years — well below the 18.9 per cent it paid last year.That new 13 per cent GILTI tax is expected to be a boon for technology and pharma groups that have located their IP in foreign jurisdictions, something that could jar with the Trump administration’s insistence the reforms have been designed to benefit the US.We expected an upward 2018 guidance revision, but not of this magnitudeHoneywell, the US industrial conglomerate, and Norfolk Southern, the railway group, are among the companies that have also said they expect their tax rates to fall this year, but they will save significantly less than AbbVie, underscoring how the new law benefits those companies with overseas IP.Like other companies, AbbVie tried to demonstrate that the lower tax rate would boost the US economy. It said it planned to invest $2.5bn in the US within five years and was evaluating the expansion of its domestic facilities.The drugmaker also said it would enhance pay for non-executive employees this year and put a further $750m towards pensions, while making a one-time charitable contribution to select causes, such as efforts to rebuild Hurricane-stricken Puerto Rico.Jeffrey Holford, analyst at Jefferies, described the company’s 2018 forecast as “jaw dropping”, adding: “we expected an upward 2018 guidance revision, but not of this magnitude”.Mr Porges predicted AbbVie would put some of its extra firepower towards dealmaking, boosting a healthcare mergers and acquisitions market that has made its strongest start to a year in more than a decade.He said: “With this tax rate, and the company’s revenue growth and margin performance, we expect a significant increase in free cash flow in 2018 . . . thus setting the stage for more active business development activity from yet another industry behemoth.”

The consensus among Wall Street analysts had been $6.66.Its shares added 8.7 per cent to trade at a record high of $117.67, giving it a market value of $187.6bn.“We expected an upward 2018 guidance revision, but not of this magnitude,” said Jeffrey Holford, analyst at Jefferies, who described the forecast as “jaw dropping”.“Wow,” added Geoff Porges of Leerink, who said lower taxes were the “most important contributor to their guidance increase”.AbbVie expects its effective tax rate to be 9 per cent in 2018, versus the consensus expectation of around 20 per cent.The group also beat analyst expectations for the third quarter, posting adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 on revenues of $7.74bn.The consensus Wall Street forecast was $1.45 and $7.51bn.
26;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2018-01-16T05:00:29Z;Big Pharma efforts on Alzheimer’s tested by Pfizer exit;Most of the biggest names in the field say they are committed to fighting the disease;It has been 15 years since a new drug for Alzheimer’s was launched, reflecting one of the longest and most expensive losing streaks for Big Pharma. But the sector continues to plough billions of dollars into finding a medicine that can arrest the disease, tempted by the economics of a product that could help the roughly 44m sufferers worldwide.Now some in the industry are starting to question how long that commitment can last, after Pfizer announced last week it was pulling out of neuroscience research. Its decision means the race to find the first medicine to slow or halt Alzheimer’s must now proceed without one of the biggest forces in drug development. John LaMattina, a former head of research and development at Pfizer, interprets the decision as a portent of things to come, and predicts other large drugmakers will eventually follow suit.“I think others will pull out,” says Mr LaMattina, adding that the US government agency for medical research, the National Institutes of Health, might have to step in to plug the funding gap as private companies vacate the space. Alzheimer’s research is extremely expensive, in large part because the disease progresses slowly, meaning a study must last for several years for a drug to show it works. The cost of a late-stage “Phase III” trial can run to between $600m and $1bn. “You can’t run several programmes of that size, even with a budget like Pfizer’s,” says Mr LaMattina. “You can only take one shot, and if you devote a billion dollars to it you’re eating up a large chunk.”He adds: “How many times can these companies take another shot when other parts of science like gene therapy are exploding, and when there’s a desperate need for new drugs to replace opioids? There are many more areas where you can see the goal lines.”However, in interviews with the Financial Times at the JPMorgan healthcare conference in San Francisco, most of the biggest names in Alzheimer’s development said they remained committed to the disease, including Biogen, Eli Lilly, Merck, Roche, Novartis and Takeda Pharmaceuticals. “Taking care of Alzheimer’s patients is a huge economic cost to society and now is not the time to give up,” says Dan Skovronsky, the top scientist at Eli Lilly, which suffered a big setback in 2016 when its most advanced Alzheimer’s drug flunked a large trial. Dr Skovronsky insists progress is being made behind the relentless drumbeat of failure. “The truth is we’re closer than ever and the science has advanced tremendously,” he says. “Unfortunately it’s advanced on the back of failed trials, which is a painful way to advance, but it would be absurd to throw away everything that the field has learnt.” One such lesson is that patients should have a brain scan before being given a place on a trial to ensure they are suffering from the disease. Many of the failed studies did not do this, meaning some participants had a different type of dementia that would not have responded to a medicine targeting Alzheimer’s. There is also a growing belief that patients are being treated only after they have passed the point of no return, prompting some drugmakers to trial medicines in people who are genetically predisposed to Alzheimer’s but do not yet exhibit symptoms. “We believe fundamentally that all the other Alzheimer’s trials in the industry are intervening too late,” says Vas Narasimhan, chief executive-elect of Novartis, which is studying its medicine in healthy people who carry a genetic risk. “By the time you’ve seen any real symptoms, you’re actually quite far along.”Rob Davis, chief financial officer of Merck, says his company also hopes treating patients earlier might work. A large trial of one of its medicines was stopped early last year when external experts concluded the effort was futile. A second study of the medicine in “prodromal” patients — those who are just starting to exhibit memory loss — should yield results next year. “I wouldn’t read Pfizer’s actions as necessarily indicative of how we see our own programmes,” says Mr Davis. However, investors will not let drugmakers throw good money after bad forever, especially if experiments continue to fail. For many, much hinges on a large study of a Biogen medicine, known as aducanumab, which is in Phase III trials with data expected next year. Aducanumab is seen as the best test so far of the amyloid hypothesis, which holds that the disease is caused by the build-up of plaques on the brain. The drug appears to be effective at clearing those plaques, so the hypothesis would take a big hit if the forthcoming data do not show it can also reduce the rate at which patients decline. Dr Skovronsky says if this study fails, Eli Lilly might be forced to reconsider whether to keep developing one of its own plaque-clearing medicines. “If they have complete plaque clearance and patients are still progressing same as placebo, then that would give us pause — we’d want to understand that disconnect,” he says. Some rivals attribute Pfizer’s exit to a lack of scale in Alzheimer’s, pointing out the company had already dramatically reduced its presence to the point where it was running just four small studies. “This space is so complex — the central nervous system is what we know the least about — and it’s difficult for a company with a wide level of diversification to perform when you need full dedication,” says Michel Vounatsos, chief executive of Biogen, a large biotech group that focuses on neuroscience. Join the FT’s deputy editor Roula Khalaf for a panel discussion on the future of Alzheimer’s on January 18 in LondonSome analysts believe the real breakthrough will not come from within the ranks of Big Pharma, but rather from smaller and more focused biotech groups, as has been the case with many of the recent advances in cancer. “Neurological research in general has an extremely high failure rate, led by Alzheimer’s,” says Amit Roy, analyst at Foveal. “We may need to wait for smaller firms willing to take the risk to develop a validated target before several large-caps get involved again.” But Sabah Oney, vice-president at Alector, a San Francisco biotech focused on Alzheimer’s, argues companies like his need support from Big Pharma groups to fund and manage large clinical trials. Mr Oney, whose company recently signed a partnership with AbbVie, says if a smaller company does find a medicine that works, it will also need the commercial muscle of a Big Pharma group to manage what is likely to be one of the largest drug launches ever. “If you are successful, then the commercialisation of these drugs is going to be like nothing we’ve ever seen before,” he says. The next big hope for Alzheimer’s sufferers is a drug being developed by Biogen, known as aducanumab, which is being studied in two large trials of patients with the disease in the early stages.For investors in Biogen, one of the biggest questions surrounding the company’s share price is when the market will first learn of the results. Analysts reckon that top-line results — which will reveal whether the drug has been a success or not — will come out in 2019, when one of the studies is scheduled to finish data collection. But Biogen could take an early peek at the results this year, before the trial is complete, in what is known as an “interim look”. If the data appear to be strong enough, it would give the company a head start in commercialising the medicine. Early success would dramatically change Wall Street’s earnings estimates and probably spur a big spike in Biogen shares, leading to significant gains for event-driven hedge funds that have snapped up the stock. But there are reasons for being cautious. Taking an interim looks means the data would ultimately have to clear a higher statistical bar, which could mark the difference between success and failure. It is Biogen’s policy not to comment on whether it plans to take an interim look. But in an interview with the Financial Times, Michel Vounatsos, chief executive, makes it clear the company will not do anything that could harm its chances of success. “We don’t want to damage the asset, it is so critical,” he says. “There has been a graveyard of failures. It was very sad to listen to the results.”Ronny Gal, analyst at Bernstein, said his meetings with management had left him with the impression that the company will not take the risk, arguing that a mis-step could force some executives to resign. “Management cares less about the stock price than presumably keeping their jobs and helping patients,” he says. “Why would you do an interim look because of a bunch of whiny hedge funds that want you to.”
27;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2017-10-27T11:59:22Z;AbbVie tops estimates, predicts Humira sales to hit $21bn by 2020;;AbbVie, the maker of the world’s top-grossing drug, posted third quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations and announced bullish financial targets.The pharmaceuticals group posted adjusted earnings of $1.41 per share, around 3 cents ahead of expectations, while revenues of $6.96bn were in line with consensus.Shares in the group were virtually unchanged in early trading in New York.The results underscored the enduring power of the world’s most lucrative drug, Humira, which generated revenues of $13.5bn in the first nine months of the year. The anti-inflammatory medicine is used to treat a variety of conditions including arthritis and psoriasis.AbbVie raised its guidance for full-year adjusted earnings to between $5.53 and $5.55 per share versus its earlier range of $5.44 to $5.54.It added it was on track to “meet or exceed” long-term targets first announced in 2015.The group now expects Humira sales to “approach” $21bn in 2020 compared to its prior estimate of $18bn, while it said it expected adjusted earnings in the range of $6.37 to $6.57 next year.AbbVie also said it would increase its cash dividend from 64 cents per share each quarter to 71 cents starting from February 2018.Richard Gonzalez, chief executive, said: “We are pleased with the significant progress we have made with our strategic priorities… and the significant advancement with our late-stage pipeline of innovative products.“We remain confident in our ability to continue to successfully execute on our long-term strategy and fuel sustainable industry leading performance.”
28;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2017-10-24T11:03:21Z;Alzheimer’s immunotherapy boosted by AbbVie deal;Tie-up with Alector to explore whether immune system can halt destruction of brain cells;AbbVie has signed a deal with a biotech company to develop medicines that encourage the immune system to fight Alzheimer’s, as the drugmaker seeks to replicate an approach that has proven successful in treating cancer.The Chicago-based pharmaceuticals group is paying an upfront fee of $205m to Alector in exchange for an option to develop and commercialise two of its experimental medicines. AbbVie could also make a $20m equity investment in the privately held biotech group at a later date.“Our hypothesis is that Alzheimer’s is allowed to occur because the immune system is not functioning well,” said Arnon Rosenthal, chief executive of San Francisco-based Alector.The deal is a sign that drugmakers such as AbbVie hope to bring rapid advances made in cancer immunotherapy to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s by encouraging the immune system to halt the destruction of brain cells.For decades, the field of cancer immunotherapy was dismissed as a dead-end by most drugmakers until the remarkable success of “checkpoint inhibitor” drugs, such as Merck’s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, which release brakes in the immune system so it can spot and kill cancer.Analysts have predicted blockbuster revenues for these cancer drugs — with EvaluatePharma forecasting more than $200bn of sales for the top four checkpoints between 2017 and 2022 — prompting the pharma industry to investigate whether a similar approach could work in other disease areas such as neurodegeneration.Mr Rosenthal said he believed that stimulating parts of the brain’s immune system would prove more effective at tackling Alzheimer’s than other approaches being tested, such as medicines that focus on clearing sticky plaques known as a-beta.One such a-beta medicine, Eli Lilly’s Solanezumab, was scrapped after it failed a large trial last year, while another, Biogen’s Aducanumab, is in the final stages of testing.“In Alzheimer’s, the immune system does not provide a sufficient amount of nourishment for nerve cells,” said Mr Rosenthal. “We want to rejuvenate the immune system so it is able to clear a-beta and other debris, and to control nerve protection.”Mr Rosenthal said recent developments in the understanding of the genetics underpinning Alzheimer’s suggested the immune system plays a much bigger role in the disease than previously thought.Dr Mary Sano, director of the Mount Sinai Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, said: “The immune system is a hot topic as a potential target for improving outcomes in Alzheimer’s and there is potential in the biology for believing it.”However, she cautioned that the approach was “not so novel” and pointed to several fruitless attempts to manipulate the immune system to tackle the disease. “So far, nothing has worked, so I’m not sure it’s anything more than a next guess,” she added.The drugs being developed by Alector are at an early stage — with human testing not expected to start until next year — and the record of drugmakers developing Alzheimer’s drugs is woeful.Most recently, a medicine being developed by Axovant, a New York biotech group, flunked a late-stage trial, extending a 14-year losing streak for the field.Jim Sullivan, vice-president of pharmaceutical discovery at AbbVie, said: “Alector’s unique approach to engaging the immune system to combat neurodegeneration reflects our commitment to target this epidemic in new ways.”The deal with Alector comes as AbbVie tries to fill its drug pipeline with scores of experimental medicines that it hopes will plug the gap when it loses patent protection on Humira, an anti-inflammatory treatment for arthritis and several other illnesses.Humira generated $16.1bn of revenues for AbbVie last year, making it the world’s best-selling drug by revenue, but it is expected to face competition from cheaper rivals from 2018, when competitors are likely to start selling “biosimilar” versions in Europe.
29;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2017-09-28T14:58:39Z;AbbVie makes peace with Amgen over Humira patents;;The legal clash between AbbVie and Amgen over Humira — one of the world’s top-grossing drugs — is finally over, sending both drugmakers’ shares higher.The companies said on Thursday that they had reached a global resolution ending all of their intellectual property-related litigation over the drug. As part of that, Chicago-based AbbVie will grant licenses to California-based Amgen to launch a copycat version of the blockbuster drug on a country-by-country basis.Amgen said it expects to launch a version called Amgevita in Europe on October 16, 2018, and in the US, where it will be sold under the name Amjevita, on January 31, 2023.AbbVie, which was spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013, saw its shares up more than 6 per cent in Thursday morning trading. Amgen shares were also up 1 per cent.Amgen’s vice-president and general manager of biosimilars, Scott Foraker, said in a statement: “We look forward to leveraging our existing biologics capabilities to bring high-quality biosimilars to patients worldwide. Amgevita will be one of our first biosimilar launches, and this agreement will allow us to secure a strong foothold in the $4bn European adalimumab market.”AbbVie executive vice-president and general counsel Laura Schumacher said that in the agreement, the company “achieved the balance between protecting investment in innovation and providing access to biosimilars, which will play an important role in our healthcare system. We will continue to defend our intellectual property and to reinvest in further advancements in medicine to bring choices to patients in need.”Investors have been closely watching the fight over Humira, which raked in more than $16bn in global sales last year and accounted for 63 per cent of AbbVie’s total 2016 revenues, according to a regulatory filing.The anti-inflammatory treatment, approved to treat conditions from arthritis to Crohn’s disease, has enjoyed 15 years of market exclusivity so far and was one of the earliest approved “biologic” drugs — made by harvesting living cells, and therefore more difficult to replicate in a so-called “biosimilar.”Last year, a US Food and Drug Administration panel had recommended the approval of Amgen’s biosimilar.
30;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;AbbVie dips after two patient deaths in rheumatoid arthritis study;;AbbVie said two patients had died during clinical trials of its experimental drug for arthritis, sending shares in the company down slightly in early trading.The company said one patient had died from heart failure while the other cause of death was unknown.However, the company said the drug, Upadacitinib, did bring about “low disease activity” in more than half of patients after 24 weeks.AbbVie is testing the medicine in a “difficult to treat” group of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who do not respond to established therapies like its own medicine Humira.Michael Severino, chief scientific officer, said: “Particularly exciting is the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission by week 12 and 24, despite having inadequate responses with previous biologic therapies.”Shares in AbbVie, up by more than 35 per cent since the start of the year, dipped 0.3 per cent in morning trade.
31;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2017-06-12T04:00:42Z;Big US pharma dealmaking plunges to five-year low;Trump’s failure to overhaul American tax code takes toll on M&A  ;"Big dealmaking in the US pharmaceuticals sector has sunk to its lowest level in five years, as companies shy away from large takeovers following President Donald Trump’s failure to move ahead with overhauling the American tax code . At the beginning of the year drugmakers had been preparing for a deals bonanza after Mr Trump pledged to quickly pass reforms to allow large companies to repatriate billions of dollars in cash from overseas without incurring a 35 per cent tax bill. But this year there have been just two takeovers of a US target company worth more than $5bn, according to figures prepared by Dealogic for the Financial Times — Thermo Fisher’s $7.2bn deal for drug ingredients maker Patheon, and Takeda’s $5.4bn takeover of cancer specialist Ariad. At less than $13bn, the total value of large US deals announced this year is the lowest since 2012. The biggest industry acquisition in 2017 is Johnson & Johnson’s $30bn takeover of Actelion, a Swiss biotech company, a deal which allowed J&J to use its foreign cash hoard without paying US taxes. Mega deals include job losses. This is becoming a bigger consideration for US-based businesses compared to years past given the increased socio-political focus on jobsThe drop-off in dealmaking shows the extent to which the pharmaceuticals industry has been hit by the difficulties Mr Trump has faced advancing his agenda, with tax reform held up by the fight to repeal Obamacare and the allegations over his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia. Drugmakers provided investment bankers with a steady stream of work and fees in recent years as they engaged in a frenzy of dealmaking aimed at restocking drug pipelines with new medicines to offset patent expiries on older blockbuster medicines. Dealmakers also complain that Mr Trump’s pledge to crack down on high drug prices has had a chilling effect on takeover activity, because it has become much harder to work out the value of a target company without knowing how much ìt could charge for its drugs. Punit Mehta, global co-head of healthcare at Credit Suisse, said the slowdown in deal activity had been exacerbated by concerns about extracting cost synergies that may lead to job losses. “Mega deals, which often rely on cost-saving synergies, include job losses. This is becoming a bigger consideration for US-based businesses compared to years past given the increased socio-political focus on jobs,” he said. Investor appetite for large deals, a staple of the M&A frenzy of 2014 and 2015, had diminished, he added. “Some of the recent deals have been pricey and not performed as expected, leading investors and companies to be cautious.”The essential guide for decision makers in health — straight to your inbox every FridayHowever, Mr Mehta believes big-ticket deal activity will pick up because of structural reasons. “Large companies have over $500bn of firepower to deploy; they are not going to sit on it forever whether tax reform happens or not.”Thomas Sheehan, head of global healthcare at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said despite the slowdown the fundamentals for dealmaking remained unchanged and activity was bound to pick up again. “Large pharma players consistently search for innovation-driven growth and raising cash remains historically cheap, and so the overall environment remains positive for a pick-up in deal activity over the next 12 months.”David Gluckman, global co-head of healthcare at Lazard, said if one large deal was announced, it might lead to others. He said: “There could be a domino effect …it’s hard to predict exactly when this will happen, but it could play out this way.”"
32;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2017-05-16T23:25:38Z;AbbVie shares dip after it loses round in Humira patent fight;;"Drugmaker AbbVie saw its shares fall in after-hours trading after a US patent agency dealt it a setback in a legal challenge to one of the patents underpinning its blockbuster arthritis drug Humira.The US Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeals Board ruled on Tuesday in favour of a challenge from Coherus BioScience to one of the patents covering Humira, which accounted for 63 per cent of AbbVie’s total net revenues in 2016.AbbVie said in a statement:We are disappointed by the ruling from the PTAB. Humira represents true innovation in the field of biologics and is protected by a vast portfolio of intellectual property. We intend to appeal this decision.Coherus, which has been seeking to launch a copycat version of the drug, did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday evening.AbbVie shares initially dropped more than 4 per cent in after-hours trading on the news before trimming those gains to trade down 1.7 per cent. Coherus shares, meanwhile, rose more than 6 per cent before giving up some of the gains to trade up 3.4 per cent.Humira has been a keystone of AbbVie’s portfolio, and the company has come under pressure from similar versions sold overseas even as it scrambles to protect the rights to the drug in the US, where imminent expiration of Humira patents have opened it to challenges from Coherus and Amgen, another would-be rival.
Citi analyst Andrew Baum noted that if AbbVie prevailed in the patent challenge it “would likely translate into a material re-rating of the stock to reflect a timing of biosimilar entry in mid-2020s rather than our 2020 base case.” In the meantime, however, AbbVie shares are “likely range bound until resolution of ongoing Humira legal cases”, he wrote."
33;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;AbbVie shares surge after it wins round in Humira patent war;;Drugmaker AbbVie saw its shares leap 6 per cent on Monday after a US patent agency dealt a setback to would-be rival Coherus BioSciences in its bid to sell a copycat version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug Humira.In a ruling on Monday, the US Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board said that Coherus “has not established a reasonable likelihood that it would prevail” in a petition seeking to challenge a patent related to Humira.Coherus, which has been seeking to launch a biosimilar version of the blockbuster Humira, saw its shares sink 17 per cent on the news. Coherus chief executive Denny Lanfear said in a statement, that while the company was disappointed with the adverse decision, “there are additional scientific and legal approaches available” to overcome the intellectual-property hurdles to launching a version of Humira, he added.Coherus is just one of the companies seeking to topple AbbVie’s dominant drug, which has been approved to treat arthritis and Crohn’s disease among other conditions and was the second best-selling drug in the world in 2015, according to data from IMS Health. Last year, Humira raked in $14bn and made up 61 per cent of AbbVie’s revenues.AbbVie is facing pressure from similar versions of Humira overseas, and is scrambling to protect the rights to the drug in the US, where the imminent expiration of its Humira patent has opened it to challenges from Coherus and another would-be rival, Amgen.In September, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Amgen’s version of Humira, although Amgen recently said that it now does not expect to launch that drug in the US next year due to the “pace of litigation” brought by AbbVie.
34;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2016-08-22T17:24:11Z;Pfizer makes $14bn bet on cancer drugmaker Medivation;World’s second-biggest pharmaceuticals company aims to become leading player in oncology;Pfizer unveiled its biggest takeover of a cancer company in its 167-year history on Monday — the $14bn acquisition of Californian biotech Medivation — following a hotly-contested auction of the sought-after drugmaker.The deal comes as the world’s second largest drugmaker by value tries to turn itself into a leading player in oncology, able to capitalise on rapid scientific advances that have led to the discovery of a string of revolutionary cancer medicines that command high prices.Ian Read, chief executive, said he wanted to build a “leadership position in oncology with flagship products” during a call to discuss the deal with analysts.Pfizer said it would pay roughly $81.50 in cash for each share in Medivation, which was founded in 2004, giving the company an enterprise value of more than $14bn.The price represents a premium of 120 per cent over Medivation’s stock price at the end of March, when the company said it had hired bankers to defend itself against a hostile bidder, which turned out to be Sanofi, the French drugmaker. In February, Medivation shares were changing hands for as little as $27.32 each.Medivation shares jumped by a fifth to $80.42 by lunchtime in New York. Pfizer slipped 0.25 per cent to $34.90.Sanofi, which had given up on a hostile takeover of Medivation to enter friendly talks with the company, on Monday said it had “appreciated the opportunity to have engaged constructively,” but that it was “first and foremost a disciplined acquirer”.Merck, Gilead and Celgene also held talks with Medivation, according to people familiar with the negotiations.“While Pfizer is described as having ‘beaten’ other companies in this competitive bid, is this something to be proud of,” asked Tim Anderson, an analyst at Bernstein.“At first pass, paying $80-plus per share for a stock that was trading in the $30s just a few months ago feels pricey,” he added.Mr Read said: “The process was efficient and competitive and we think we tied a fair price to the asset.”Mr Read had been preparing investors for a large deal to grow the part of Pfizer that develops innovative medicines since April, when his attempt to buy Dublin-based Allergan for $160bn was thwarted by the Obama administration, which wanted to stop the company relocating to low-tax Ireland.San Francisco-based Medivation makes the world’s best-selling prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, which is forecast to generate $5.7bn in annual revenues by 2020. It is also developing an experimental drug called Talazoparib, designed to stop tumour cells from multiplying by damaging their DNA, and Pidilizumab, a medicine that could help patients suffering from lymphoma.Pfizer is best known for selling drugs prescribed by family doctors, such as Lipitor, the cholesterol-lowering statin, and Viagra, the male impotence pill, but in recent years it has started building a large oncology franchise, which has been buoyed by the success of Ibrance, a blockbuster cancer drug.Last year it lost out in the race to buy Pharmacyclics, the maker of a best-selling drug for a type of blood cancer, which was eventually taken over by AbbVie for $21bn.
35;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Pfizer chief plays down prospect of split;Ian Read says case for drugmaker’s break-up has become ‘more complicated’ in recent months;Pfizer’s chief executive appeared to play down the prospect of splitting the drugmaker into two discrete companies, arguing the case for a break-up had become “more complicated” in recent months.Pfizer has been examining a potential break-up for several years and has already implemented an internal division into two units — Pfizer Innovative Health and Pfizer Essential Health. The company had spent $600m preparing for a possible split, Frank D’Amelio, chief financial officer, said on Tuesday.However, it delayed a final decision after agreeing an ill-fated $160bn takeover of Dublin-based Allergan, a deal that was thwarted by the Obama administration, which wanted to stop the company avoiding billions of dollars of US taxes by relocating to Ireland.“I think investors are also frustrated that it is taking so long to decide,” said Jami Rubin, analyst at Goldman Sachs.Ian Read, Pfizer chief executive, insisted a final decision had not yet been taken on whether to break the company into two drugmakers — one focused on innovative medicines and another on older products — and reiterated his commitment to “make that call by the end of the year”.However, he said the question of whether any “trapped value” could be unlocked by such a break-up was more difficult following the appreciation in the company’s shares, which have gained roughly 20 per cent in the last six months, versus about 10 per cent for the New York Stock Exchange Arca Pharmaceutical Index.Mr Read also noted there had been a decline in the valuations of the types of drugmakers that the discrete Pfizer companies would have to compete with following a break-up.Shares in Pfizer were down 2.5 per cent by lunchtime in New York.Mr Read was careful not to rule out a split, but he made several remarks that suggested he was minded to keep the company together for now.In May, he said the company would examine whether a split would allow it to reduce its US tax bill, but on Tuesday he said: “I don’t see a separation as being a quick route to improving the tax situation.”He said he was optimistic that Washington would pursue comprehensive tax reform following the election of a new president, potentially bringing down the headline rate of corporation tax, which is higher in the US than some other developed countries.Mr Read also sought to distance Pfizer from other companies that have been broken up in recent years, such as Abbott Laboratories, which spun out its branded drugs business as AbbVie, and Baxter Health, which hived off Baxalta.“Were they invested in equally? I don’t think they were,” he said. “Or getting the same amount of management attention? I don’t think they were. In our particular case we are investing in both segments heavily.”Mr Read added that the separate businesses would be more limited in the sorts of investments and acquisitions they could make.“You don’t have the same opportunities for deployment of cash if you’re two companies as you do if you are one — you have less choices,” he said.Mr Read’s remarks came as Pfizer reported adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share on revenues of $13.1bn for the second quarter, ahead of the average Wall Street forecast of 62 cents and $13bn.
36;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2016-07-14T08:48:58Z;Biosimilars set to compete with two of world’s biggest drug franchises;Makers of medicines with $22bn sales a year expected to fight hard to delay rivals’ introduction;The world’s top grossing drug, Humira, generated $14bn in global sales last year for AbbVie, the Chicago-based pharmaceuticals group that owns the medicine.The anti-inflammatory treatment, used for conditions from arthritis to Crohn’s disease, has enjoyed 14 years of market exclusivity, unburdened by the kind of copycat medicines that tend to push drugmakers over the patent cliff.Now AbbVie must contemplate the end of the party, after advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration recommended this week that the drug regulator approve a copycat version of the medicine.Analysts say the agency is all but certain to rubber-stamp their recommendation in September.The FDA’s advisers recommended the agency also approve a knock-off rival to Amgen’s Enbrel, another anti-inflammatory, which was first approved in 1998 and generated revenues of $8.7bn last year.Many patients will ask why it has taken so long for a competitor to launch a cheaper version of Humira, which costs roughly $4,000 for two injections, or Enbrel, which is priced at $3,800 for a pack of four shots.The medicines have benefited from their status as two of the earliest “biologic” drugs, which are made by harvesting living cells rather than producing chemical pills.The very nature of biologic medicines means it is impossible to create an exact replica, as happens when a generic drugmaker produces a knock-off tablet. Instead, competing companies must try to manufacture a drug that is virtually the same — a so-called biosimilar.The introduction of biosimilars in the US has been hampered by years of wrangling among drugmakers, politicians and regulators, but the decision by the FDA’s advisers on Humira and Enbrel copycats this week has been hailed as an important step in speeding up their introduction.The regulator has given the green light to a couple of biosimilars before, although those were in part seen as test cases, while its European counterpart has been much more aggressive in approving the medicines.But this week’s events in the US threaten for the first time to topple two of the world’s biggest drug franchises, which together account for more than $22bn in annual sales.“The agency is getting the hang of this,” says Ronny Gal, an analyst at Bernstein. “This is the start of the path forward for Humira biosimilars.”Analysts note that the FDA advisers recommended approval for the Humira and Enbrel copycats not just for arthritis, but for all the illnesses treated by the originals — a process known as “indication extrapolation”.Some biologic drugmakers had argued that approvals should be limited to one illness at a time, meaning biosimilar companies could only chip away at drugs such as Humira, rather than competing head on.One issue that has yet to be resolved, though, is whether pharmacists can dispense a biosimilar to a patient if their doctor has written the brand name — Humira — on the prescription, rather than the generic Adalimumab.Biologic patent expiries likely won’t present as large of a threat to sales as [chemical] drugsSome drugmakers have lobbied against such “substitutability” — even though pharmacists regularly do this with chemical pills — claiming that biosimilars might not be as safe as the original drug and that doctors’ wishes should be respected.Heather Bresch, chief executive of Mylan, says the tactics are exactly the same ones used to try to hinder the introduction of generic drugs in the 1980s. “It’s déjà vu — the brands said generics are unsafe, that they were made in a bathtub, blah, blah, but now generics account for 88 per cent of all US prescriptions.”Regulatory approval is of course important, but most in the pharmaceuticals industry expect the introduction of a Humira biosimilar to be delayed by years of courtroom battles.AbbVie has said it can stave off a rival until 2022, having built a wall of more than 70 patents around Humira, governing areas from how it is manufactured to the auto-injector used to deliver the medicine.Once biosimilars gain traction the biggest beneficiaries will be patients and taxpayers. Their introduction is expected to slash US spending on biologic medicines by $44bn over the next decade, according to the Rand Corporation, an independent think-tank.But others say biosimilars will struggle, as the makers of branded drugs fight tooth and nail to delay their introduction. “Biologic patent expiries likely won’t present as large of a threat to sales as [chemical] drugs,” says Bob Kirby of Fitch, the rating agency. He says branded drugmakers will have to contend with a “patent slope”, rather than a cliff.There is also disagreement among executives over how much cheaper biosimilars will be, with discount estimates ranging from a third to 75 per cent. Either way, they will not offer the same sort of savings as traditional generic drugs.Nor is it clear which companies will benefit from the advent of biosimilars, which are much harder to manufacture than simple chemical pills. The drugs are cultivated in huge fermenters located in highly regulated factories, an expensive endeavour that could prove a barrier to the kind of low-cost entrants that have pushed down the price of pills.Ironically, it is the biggest branded drug companies that are using their knowledge and equipment to produce biosimilars.Amgen, for instance, is trying to launch the first biosimilar of Humira, while simultaneously fighting the introduction of a copycat version of its drug, Enbrel, by Novartis, the Swiss pharma group.And many of the best-known companies are dabbling in biosimilars to hedge their bets, including Pfizer, Merck of the US and Biogen, as big pharma seeks to occupy the role not just of gamekeeper — but poacher too.There are sure to be countless legal battles as drugmakers fight to prevent the introduction of new biosimilars, but few will end up in the US Supreme Court.Yet the highest court in the US is considering whether to take up the closely watched case of Amgen versus Sandoz, and its decision could have big ramifications for the adoption of biosimilars.Sandoz, a division of Novartis, makes a biosimilar version of Amgen’s drug Neupogen, which is used to boost white blood cell production in cancer patients.The case hinges on the 180-day notice period that biosimilar makers such as Sandoz are required to give to branded makers such as Amgen before they launch the copycat product.The Federal Circuit ruled that Sandoz could only fire the starting gun on the waiting period after it had received approval from the Food and Drug Administration — in effect granting Amgen a further six months of market exclusivity.Sandoz is appealing against the decision to the Supreme Court, which has not yet decided whether to hear the case.Six months might not sound like a lot of time when one considers that biologic drugs already enjoy 12 years of exclusivity. But Scott Cunning, an intellectual property partner in corporate law firm Haynes and Boone, says it is more important than it might seem.“When you’re talking about franchises that are worth billions of dollars, six months can be lucrative,” he says.“It also gives them the time to get their ducks in a row so that they have their patent challenges lined up.”
37;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2016-06-05T13:12:36Z;New cancer drugs target deadliest forms of the disease;Pharma groups unveil encouraging research that fuels hopes for patients who have run out of options;"Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and other large pharmaceutical companies on Sunday unveiled research showing that their drugs can improve the prospects of patients suffering from the deadliest forms of cancer, generating excitement at the world’s largest meeting of oncologists. About 35,000 doctors and scientists gathered in Chicago at the weekend for the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco), where the results of more than 5,000 clinical trials were published.The data from some studies fuelled hopes that drugmakers are on the cusp of a breakthrough in treating patients who have run out of options. A large clinical trial of Darzalex, a drug being co-developed by J&J, showed the medicine improved outcomes dramatically for patients suffering from multiple myeloma, an incurable bone marrow cancer that kills half its victims within five years. Combining the J&J drug with another two medicines commonly given to multiple myeloma patients reduced the risk of a patient’s cancer becoming worse by about 70 per cent, according to a trial of almost 500 participants. A fifth of patients on the Darzalex cocktail experienced a “complete response”, which means their cancer disappeared entirely, while a further 60 per cent had substantial tumour shrinkage. The combination was about twice as effective as the other two medicines alone.“These results are unprecedented in this cancer,” said Dr Antonio Palumbo, an oncologist at the University of Torino in Italy, who led the study. The Darzalex combination would soon become the most common medicine given to multiple myeloma sufferers, he predicted. Dr Alan Worsley of Cancer Research UK said the results of the study were “remarkable for this form of the disease, which is one of the most difficult to treat”.The trial is the latest in a string of successful studies of Darzalex, which J&J is co-developing with Danish biotech group Genmab, prompting Jefferies analyst Peter Welford to estimate that the drug would generate $7bn in peak annual sales.This was a trial of very sick patients who have had the kitchen sink thrown at them, so getting response rates like this is impressiveA smaller trial of an experimental drug recently acquired by AbbVie was also shown to improve the chances of people suffering from another of the deadliest cancers, small-cell lung cancer, which tends to affect smokers.This type of lung cancer spreads throughout the body quickly, rarely responds to treatment, and claims the lives of more than 250,000 people a year. Just 3 per cent of patients survive for at least five years following diagnosis.The drug, known as Rova-T, halted tumour growth in almost 90 per cent of patients with high levels of a specific protein, and shrank tumours in 39 per cent of sufferers, according to the study of about 71 participants, all of whom had failed to respond to other treatments.However, these patients on average survived for about six months after starting therapy, just one month longer that doctors would typically expect. Rova-T adopts a novel approach whereby a toxic agent is delivered directly into the tumour cell so it can kill the cancer without destroying healthy tissues as well. The method allows patients to be given larger doses of toxins than they would otherwise be able to tolerate.AbbVie acquired the drug in April when it bought Stemcentrx, the San Francisco biotech which discovered it, in a deal worth up to $10bn.“This is another example of a new wave of highly-targeted treatments, which deliver anticancer drugs even more precisely to where they are needed,” said Dr Gregory Masters, an oncologist at the Helen F Graham cancer centre in Delaware.Dr Worsley said: “This was a trial of very sick patients who have had the kitchen sink thrown at them, so getting response rates like this is impressive.”However, he cautioned that the trial was small and said larger studies would be needed to determine whether the findings could be replicated.The studies of the AbbVie and J&J drugs were among 20 that were identified by Asco’s organisers as being the most impressive. Other drugs in this category included Tecentriq, a Roche medicine that helped patients with cancer of the urinary system; and an experimental treatment from Ganymed, a private German group, which benefited those suffering from a type of stomach cancer."
38;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;M&A back on the table as ‘big pharma’ targets smaller rivals;US groups ready to move after raising more than $50bn in debt this year;After a start to the year marred by an accounting scandal at Valeant, the collapse of Pfizer’s $160bn merger with Allergan and a plunge in biotech stocks, few advisers to healthcare companies were expecting to be called back into boardrooms to plot a fresh wave of acquisitions.In recent years, a lot of dealmaking was driven by “specialty pharma” groups which had grown largely through acquisitions rather than by in-house drug research. But the downfall of Valeant, once the largest proponent of this strategy, has sent these companies into retreat.Yet deal activity in other parts of the sector, which last year generated a record of $724bn of transactions, is proving to be crisis resistant.Three factors alone make mergers and acquisitions attractive for many traditional “big pharma” groups, according to dealmakers. First, executives at companies such as J&J, Pfizer and Merck are seeking growth as the broader economy expands at a snail’s pace. Second, despite the possibility of an interest rate rise this summer, financing costs remain low. And third, there is pressure on some smaller companies being squeezed for cash to seek a lifeline from a bigger rival.“There has been a dramatic shift in the market,” said Chris Hite, global head of healthcare at Citi’s investment bank. “The key M&A trends in 2014 and 2015 were specialty pharma companies acquiring revenue and cutting costs using cheap debt. That has disappeared. At the same time, big pharma and big biotech are coming back to the table, aggressively pursuing innovation and buying attractive biotech firms that are now trading at more reasonable valuations.”US pharma companies have raised more than $50bn in debt since the beginning of the year, the second-highest amount in two decades, indicating they are gearing up to strike fresh deals.Pfizer is expected to be one of the leading consolidators. After failing to acquire AstraZeneca for $119bn in 2014 and Allergan for $160bn earlier this year, the New York-based group wasted little time before pursuing a fresh deal — last month it spent $5.2bn on Anacor, a Silicon Valley biotech group developing a drug for eczema that Pfizer believes has blockbuster potential.Most big pharma companies are focusing on acquiring smaller biotechs developing innovative drugs to fight cancer and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, as they seek to gain an edge in illnesses that will become more prevalent as the global population ages.AbbVie recently acquired Stemcentrx — a biotech focusing on drugs to target cancer stem cells — for $5.8bn. Separately, Sanofi is leading a bidding war to acquire Medivation, a $10bn company involved in breast and blood cancers.Biotech groups have become an attractive buy, as they have been trading on average more than 30 per cent lower than at their peak in July. The Nasdaq Biotech Index is down about 20 per cent since the beginning of the year, adding pressure on some running out of cash to do a deal.David Gluckman, co-head of global healthcare at Lazard, said that for some biotechs “M&A becomes the only viable option, or to partner certain rights away while keeping a strategic and economic interest in a product or technology for long-term growth”.But Thomas Sheehan, global head of healthcare at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said that not all biotech companies were in need of fresh funding.“Many biotechs took advantage of the strong market conditions back in 2015 to raise capital, and some of these companies will still want to partner with large pharma to introduce their drugs to a global market,” said Mr Sheehan. “Large pharma has the reach and capabilities that can help the biotechs grow internationally.”Large pharma has the reach and capabilities that can help the biotechs grow internationallyMr Hite at Citi said that biotechs that were reluctant to be sold were now more likely to pursue partnerships. “Biotech companies get to keep some control while benefiting from being part of the big pharma’s global network, while the big guys get top-line growth and a foot in the door for a possible future deal,” he said.However, some healthcare bankers believe big pharma companies like Pfizer are still considering megadeals that “will move the needle” as they seek to cut costs, having been warned by Washington politicians that they will not be allowed to rely on price increases for growth.“When margins were strong for pharma companies costs were not the primary concern. But now that pricing in the industry has come under scrutiny, pharma companies are realising that cutting costs will be an important part of their business model,” said Punit Mehta, head of healthcare investment banking at Credit Suisse. “This is a significant change and will drive consolidation among the largest players.”
39;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2016-06-01T13:08:24Z;Cancer doctors face next drug challenge;Delegates at world’s largest gathering of oncologists to address how to help more victims;More than 30,000 doctors and scientists will gather in Chicago this weekend for the biggest annual meeting of cancer experts, organised by the American Society of Clinical Oncologists (Asco). They will be joined by healthcare investors and pharmaceuticals executives from the largest companies — such as Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer — to smaller biotech groups, to hear the results from more than 5,000 clinical trials.The sheer amount of research on display this year underscores a recent renaissance in developing drugs for cancer, after pharmaceuticals companies and their investors poured billions of dollars into finding new ways to tackle the disease.At last year’s event, a new generation of drugs that turn the body’s immune system into a weapon against tumours established themselves as the most important advance in cancer treatment in decades.These “immunotherapies” have radically altered the odds of surviving cancer for some patients. About 40 per cent of melanoma sufferers taking Keytruda, made by American group Merck, are still alive after three years, according to data from a large trial that will be presented in full at Asco this weekend.That is a remarkable turnround for an illness that has tended to result in a swift death for almost all of its victims.But for all the excitement, the immunotherapies on the market only work in a minority of patients and tumour types.This year, delegates will have to confront some difficult questions: can the benefits of these drugs be extended to help more sufferers, including those with the deadliest types of cancer?And, if so, will cash-strapped healthcare systems be able to afford the medicines, which command price tags well in excess of $100,000 per patient per year.COMBINATION THERAPIESScientists hope that adding existing immunotherapies to more established treatments such as chemotherapy could result in a higher success rate, and several companies have been testing this approach in clinical trials.Investors are awaiting the results of a study that combined Johnson & Johnson’s Daratumumab with chemotherapy in patients suffering from multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells. Ganymed Pharmaceuticals, a private German group, is also trialling a drug with chemo in patients with gastric cancer.Data from both studies have been held back by Asco’s organisers to be discussed in “late breaker” sessions this weekend, in a sign they deem the results to be promising.Other companies are trying to combine two novel immunotherapies, such as Pfizer, which will unveil data from a trial of Merck’s Keytruda with its own drug, known as 4-1BB. The former is designed to remove brakes in the immune system that stop it from attacking tumours, while the latter aims to speed up the body’s response.“Last year, immunotherapies established themselves as having real promise, but now we are asking how you can mix and match them,” says Dr Alan Worsley of Cancer Research UK.Some scientists warn that too much manipulation of the immune system could lead to intolerable and harmful side effects.“When you’re dealing with agents that are going to stimulate the body, you have to be careful,” says Dr Steven Stein, chief medical officer at Incyte, a biotech focused on cancer drugs. “You do not want to get to a point where there is an ‘autoimmune response’,” he adds, referring to a condition where the body’s immune system attacks healthy cells.HARD TO TREAT CANCERSSome cancers are worse than others, and doctors will be looking for data that show progress in tackling the deadliest forms of the disease.Investors are watching for data from a trial of a drug made by Immunomedics, a New Jersey-based biotech. The drug is designed to carry chemotherapy directly into the tumour cells of patients with triple negative breast cancer — one of the hardest cancers to treat — enabling them to take a type of chemo that would prove too toxic if delivered normally.Small cell lung cancer, which tends to affect smokers, is also notoriously difficult to tackle and can spread very quickly. Stemcentrx, recently acquired by AbbVie for $5.8bn, will present data from a study of its drug, Rova-T. In a smaller clinical trial, 44 per cent of patients with high levels of a certain protein saw their cancer disappear completely after taking Rova-T.PRICE AND VALUEDelegates at Asco have traditionally paid little attention to the price of drugs, preferring to focus on science. But that position has become untenable as concerns grow that the cost of the latest generation of medicines will cause patients and healthcare systems to buckle under the strain.“We have to think about fairness,” says Dr Julie Vose, president of Asco. “We’re trying wherever it’s suitable to talk about value and cost.”A study comparing the price of 23 major cancer drugs in different countries could spark a debate when it is published at the conference, she says.We have to think about fairness. We’re trying wherever it’s suitable to talk about value and costOne of the problems with the latest generation of cancer drugs is that they are biologic medicines made from living cells rather than chemical compounds, making it harder for generic manufacturers to make cheaper copycat versions.Instead, generic manufacturers must try to make biosimilar versions of the drug that are not direct copies, and some big pharma companies are warning these might not be as good as the “real thing”.Mylan, one of the largest generic drugmakers, is publishing data from a large study of its biosimilar version of Roche’s Herceptin, a breast cancer drug with annual sales of $6.6bn. If the medicine works as well as the branded version, it could offer a much cheaper alternative for patients.@bydavidcrow
40;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;AbbVie slips as patent office to review Humira;;AbbVie shares could use a shot in the arm.Shares in the US drugmaker fell by as much as 6.3 per cent — the most in more than three months — after a rival company said it had received a “favourable decision” from the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) on its petition challenging a dosing patent tied to Humira, AbbVie’s top selling drug to treat rhumatoid arthritis.News that the PTAB would accept the case from Coherus BioSciences comes as a blow to AbbVie given that the anti inflammatory drug accounts for 60 per cent of its overall revenue.The agency is considering other petitions that Coherus has filed on Humira patents and a decision on the dosing patent isn’t expected till May 2017.But Denny Lanfear, chief executive of Coherus, said of the decision:We will continue to aggressively press forward with the development and commercialization of our Humira biosimilar consistent with our corporate strategy.US drugmaker AbbVie agreed to buy cancer drugmaker Stemcentrx in a $5.8bn cash and stock deal last month as it seeks to stave off competition from rivals.Coherus shares jumped 14 per cent to $18.77.

Volatile markets have meant that it has taken issuance several months to warm up, writes Gavin Jackson. Banks on the deal will be carrying out investor meetings tomorrow.The news of the bond sale comes as corporate bond markets gear up for a bumper week of issuance with Airbus, AstraZeneca and Shell all selling big euro-denominated bonds and AbbVie and Chevron launching big debt sales in the US dollar market.Hybrid bond structures vary but can include features like the ability to suspend coupons or making holders of hybrid bonds wait in line behind other creditors to be paid back in the event of a bankruptcy.A big motivation for companies to issue hybrid bonds is to protect their credit ratings. They are not treated as pure debt by rating agencies but are given ‘equity credit’.S&P’s decision last October over how to rate several of these bonds effectively transformed $12bn of debt into equity overnight and raised questions over the future of the asset class.Because they carry higher risks they usually pay lenders more interest and so are attractive to yield hungry investors: sales of hybrid bonds reached a record of $45bn in 2014 and $26bn were sold in 2015 before S&P’s decision.Hybrid bonds are not eligible for the European Central Bank’s program of corporate bond buying scheduled to begin this summer. However, outstanding hybrid debt has rallied alongside ‘vanilla bonds’, as debt investors looked to find other means of making a return.

Out of the ether, $60bn worth of global M&A deals were announced on Thursday (why wait for merger Monday?), including three blockbuster healthcare deals involving corporations on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr Lew’s third crackdown on tax inversion tie-ups immediately scuttled Pfizer’s migration to Europe earlier this month. The frenzy this week reminds us that, yes, deals can have a sincere strategic rationale.Overall, first quarter global M&A volume had fallen off by a fifth, year over year, according to Dealogic data. Bankers blamed the extreme volatility in the equity markets for spooking boardrooms. Yet they insisted the core factors behind the 2015 bonanza were intact: low interest rates, and steady if unspectacular economic growth.The type of deals on Thursday seem to confirm the return of corporate confidence. The union of medical device makers Abbott Laboratories and St Jude Medical was rumoured last year. Sanofi felt good enough to make a $9bn hostile bid for biotech upstart Medivation. AbbVie, a spin-off from Abbott, said it would acquire cancer treatment start-up Stemcentrx for $6bn despite the deal reducing this year’s earnings by 6 per cent.Importantly, the buying spree comes from big, cash-rich corporations rather than private equity companies, who are perhaps constrained by the wobbly junk bond market.

43;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Three pharma deals worth $45bn reignite M&A boom;Abbott, AbbVie and Sanofi announce separate purchases, taking 2016 transactions to $121bn;"A trio of deals worth a combined $45bn breathed fresh life into the healthcare mergers and acquisitions boom on Thursday as Abbott Laboratories, AbbVie and Sanofi all went shopping for assets.The largest was Abbott’s $30bn agreed takeover of St Jude Medical in a cash-and-stock deal that would bring together two of the leading US manufacturers of heart-related medical devices.Two San Francisco-based cancer drug developers were the targets for AbbVie and Sanofi, meanwhile, in a sign that the two-year surge in pharmaceuticals dealmaking has not yet run out of steam.AbbVie, the US drugs company spun out of Abbott three years ago, agreed to buy Stemcentrx for $5.8bn in cash and stock, while France’s Sanofi launched a $9.3bn unsolicited all-cash offer for Medivation.The latter deal looked to be the most contentious of the three as Sanofi went public with its $52.50 per share bid for the maker of Xtandi, a prostate cancer drug, after its private approaches were stonewalled.Sanofi and AbbVie have both targeted oncology as an area for expansion as they seek to reduce dependence on their best-selling products — Lantus for diabetes and Humira for inflammatory diseases, respectively.Thursday’s proposed deals lift the total value of healthcare transactions launched in 2016 to $121bn, according to data from Dealogic.This marks the lowest level at this point in the year since 2013, signalling a slowdown from the record M&A volumes of the past two years as drug and medical device companies hunted fresh sources of growth.The downfall of acquisitive roll-up companies such as Valeant and the collapse this month of Pfizer’s $160bn tax-saving merger with Ireland-based Allergan led some commentators to declare an end to the boom.“Equity market volatility brought a brief pause to M&A, but now that the market has stabilised, I expect we will continue to see a steady stream of deals,” said Jeff Stute, global head of healthcare investment banking at JPMorgan. “There are a lot of big pharma companies with very strong balance sheets that are thinking about doing deals to continue growing.”Investors, however, have become more cautious about M&A; shares in Sanofi fell 2 per cent after announcing its Medivation offer, while Abbott was down nearly 6 per cent in early trading and AbbVie’s share price was unchanged.Abbott’s $85-per-share offer for St Jude represented a 37 per cent premium over the latter’s closing price on Wednesday. In addition to the $25bn offer, Abbott would assume $5bn of net debt held by St Jude, according to Dealogic.Sanofi said its offer was at a 50 per cent premium to the two-month volume-weighted average for Medivation shares before takeover rumours surfaced.There are a lot of big pharma companies with very strong balance sheets that are thinking about doing deals to continue growingHowever, it was only modestly above the US company’s $52.05 closing price on Wednesday. Analysts predicted that Paris-based Sanofi would have to raise its bid to coax Medivation and its shareholders into a deal — and could yet face competition from rival bidders.Medivation hired bankers last month to defend against a takeover.AbbVie found a more willing seller in privately-held Stemcentrx, which has a treatment for small cell lung cancer in late-stage development.Sanofi has been open about its desire for deals since Olivier Brandicourt took over as chief executive last year as the French group scrambles to offset decline in its diabetes business after Lantus lost patent protection. AbbVie faces similar pressure as Humira, the world’s best-selling drug, enters its last few years of patent protection.The Stemcentrx acquisition marks a second big oncology deal for Rick Gonzalez, AbbVie chief executive, in just over a year. In March 2015, he fought off stiff competition from Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer to acquire Pharmacyclics, the maker of a blockbuster drug for blood cancers, for $21bn.Bankers predicted more healthcare M&A ahead, pointing out that most large players had plentiful cash in hand. “It’s not that healthcare is back,” said one New York-based adviser. “It never went away, we just took a break after a year [2015] that was literally crazy.”"

Abbott Healthcare, which AbbVie was spun out of in 2013, said it would buy St Jude, a medical device group, for $25bn, while France’s Sanofi launched an unsolicited $9.3bn bid for San Francisco-based Medivation.Stemcentrx’s most advanced drug is Rova-T, which targets a tumour cell protein that is found in more than 80 per cent of those suffering from a type of lung cancer known as “small cell”. In small clinical trials, 44 per cent of patients with high levels of the protein saw their cancer disappear completely after taking the drug.AbbVie said it aimed to start selling the medicine in 2018, and predicted it would generate several billion dollars in global sales at its peak. The company plans to test the medicine in a range of other tumours, including brain cancer, skin cancer and thyroid cancer.For Rick González, AbbVie chief executive, it is the second big deal in oncology in just over a year. In March 2015, he fought off stiff competition from Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer to seal the $21bn purchase of Pharmacyclics, the maker of a blockbuster drug for blood cancers.AbbVie is trying to diversify its portfolio as its anti-inflammatory drug, Humira, faces increasing pressure from cheaper generic versions. Humira, which is used to treat illnesses including arthritis and Crohn's disease, generated $3.6bn of sales in the first quarter, accounting for more than 60 per cent of total revenue.The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, and to wipe roughly 20 cents from Abbvie’s full-year earnings per share in 2016. The company said it intended to buy $4bn of its shares back from investors upon completing the deal.AbbVie also posted first-quarter earnings on Thursday. It generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.15, about a cent ahead of the level Wall Street analysts were typically expecting, on sales of $5.96bn, which were in line with consensus.

Stemcentrx shareholders will also be eligible for up to $4bn in cash if the company achieves other regulatory and clinical milestones, writes Mamta Badkar in New York.The Illinois-based company lowered its 2016 earnings forecast to between $4.62 to $4.82 per share, reflecting the Stemcentrx acquisition, down from its previous estimates for earnings in the range of $4.82 to $5.02 a share.The news comes as AbbVie’s biggest seller Humira, an anti-inflammatory drug, faces competition from competitors.Richard Gonzalez, chief executive of Abbvie, said:The addition of Stemcentrx and its late-stage compound Rova-T provide AbbVie with a unique platform in solid tumor therapeutics and complement our leadership position in hematologic oncology.AbbVie was previously forced to abandon a $55bn takeover of Ireland-based Shire as the US stepped up its efforts to crack down on so-called tax inversion deals, that see US companies move to more tax friendly jurisdictions.The news came alongside better-than-expected first quarter profits. AbbVie said profits rose to $1.35bn or 83 cents a share in the three months ended in March, compared with $1bn or 63 cents a share in the year ago period. Adjusting for one-off items, earnings of $1.15 a share topped analysts’ estimates for $1.13 a share. Sales jumped 18 per cent to $6bn.US pharmaceutical Abbott Laboratories also on Thursday announced a $25bn deal for St Jude Medical, while France’s Sanofi earlier today went public with the details of an unsolicited bid for San Francisco-based Medivation.
46;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;M&A deals worth $370bn torpedoed by Obama administration;Corporate America dismayed by latest government intervention to block takeovers;"US companies have abandoned $370bn of large deals since President Barack Obama came into power in 2009, after regulators in his administration blocked an unprecedented number of transactions to protect competition, jobs and the US tax base.Corporate America responded with dismay on Tuesday after the US Treasury proposed new rules that torpedoed Pfizer’s takeover of Dublin-based Allergan, worth $160bn, or $190bn including debt, in an attempt to stop the drugmaker moving its headquarters to Ireland so it could avoid billions of dollars in US taxes. It was the latest in a series of interventions by branches of the Obama administration, which has thwarted more big-ticket mergers and acquisitions than were blocked during the Clinton and Bush eras put together, according to an FT analysis of abandoned deals worth more than $10bn.In 2014, AbbVie pulled the plug on its $55bn takeover of Ireland-based Shire — another “inversion” that would have enabled it to slash its US tax bill — following a similar putative rule change by the US Treasury. The administration has also blocked several big telecoms deals in an attempt to protect competition. Comcast withdrew its $71bn takeover of Time Warner Cable last year, after the Department of Justice signalled it would try to stop the deal, which drew widespread opposition from campaigners who said it would create a broadband monopoly and hurt “net neutrality”. AT&T dropped its $39bn bid for T-Mobile US in 2011 after the DoJ sued to block the deal, while Nasdaq’s $11bn attempt to take over the New York Stock Exchange was thwarted by antitrust concerns. In contrast, the George W Bush administration blocked just one large deal — the $27bn takeover of Hughes Electronic by EchoStar, the satellite TV group. Two big M&A transactions were torpedoed under Bill Clinton: the $12bn takeover of military supplier Northrop Grumman by its larger rival Lockheed Martin, and MCI WorldCom’s $125bn bid for Sprint, the mobile phone network. The interventionist posture has provoked anger on Wall Street. One large life sciences investor with holdings in Pfizer, Allergan and AbbVie said the administration was building an “artificial prison for pharmaceutical companies, rather than dealing with the underlying issue” of relatively high taxes for US companies. An investment banker said the deal highlighted how the White House had succumbed to a “leftist rhetoric” that had its roots in the aftermath of the financial crisis and which has since been embodied by Bernie Sanders’ campaign for the presidency.However, administration officials argue that the Obama era has coincided not only with a series of tax inversions, but also with an unprecedented level of dealmaking. They believe some sectors are in danger of becoming uncompetitive after decades of consolidation. In a speech on Wednesday night, Loretta Lynch, US attorney-general, said the DoJ would “not allow management to increase investor value at the expense of the individual consumer"".She added: “Consolidation among major competitors — especially in already concentrated industries — raises serious concerns about higher prices, lower output, diminished quality and flagging innovation.” The US government cited antitrust concerns this week when it filed a lawsuit to block the proposed $25bn takeover by oil services group Halliburton of its rival Baker Hughes.Debbie Feinstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission’s competition bureau, told the Financial Times: “There’s no question that we’re going to be aggressive against conduct or mergers that are going to harm competition or consumers. That’s our job and we take it very seriously and we’re going to do it very carefully. We’re not afraid to litigate.”Additional reporting by James Fontanella-KhanTax inversions are adjustments to competitive reality / From George Nastas III"
47;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Shire confident of ‘strong results’ this year;;Shire, fresh from its $32bn takeover of Baxalta last month, has announced better-than-expected full-year results and forecast further strong growth in 2016.The UK-listed drugmaker generated revenues of $6.4bn in the 12 months to December 31, up 7 per cent from $6.02bn in 2014, or 11 per cent when adjusted for currency fluctuations, writes Andrew Ward.Earnings per share were $11.68, up 10 per cent from $10.60 in the prior year, or 14 per cent on a currency adjusted basis.Analysts had expected, on average, revenues of $6.31bn and earnings per share of $11.40.However net profits were down sharply at $1.3bn from $3.4bn in 2014, when results were boosted by a $1.6bn break fee stemming from the collapse of a proposed takeover by AbbVie.Shire predicted “strong results” for 2016, anticipating “double digit topline growth and a 7 to 10 per cent increase earnings per share, excluding any contribution from Baxalta”.The Dublin-based company has been trying to re-brand itself as an innovative biotech company focused on high-value rare disease treatments –a strategy which will be boosted by the addition of Baxalta’s treatments for hemophilia and other blood diseases.Yet much of Shire’s sales and growth still comes from treating (mostly) American youths for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Sales of Shire’s Vyvanse ADHD drug increased by 19 per cent to $1.77bn, helped by the go ahead from US regulators for the medicine to also be used as a remedy for another behavioural condition called binge-eating disorder.Shire was for several years among one the best performers in the FTSE 100 but that has swung into reverse since a collapse in biotech stocks last summer. Its shares are down almost 27 per cent in the past year.The company is hoping for a boost later this year from the potential launch of its Lifitegrast treatment for dry eye disease – a product tipped by analysts for blockbuster sales. Shire resubmitted its application for US regulatory approval of the drug this month.Flemming Ornskov, Shire chief executive, predicted the Baxalta deal would close in the middle of this year and said progress towards this was going “very well”.

He is a veteran Slaughter and May lawyer, having started as a trainee solicitor there in 1982.As head of the firm’s M&A practice, Mr Cooke recently led the team advising Hikma Pharmaceuticals on its $2.65bn acquisition of Roxane from Boehringer Ingelheim, and Shire on its proposed merger with AbbVie in 2014. He also advised Autonomy in its takeover by Hewlett-Packard, Cadbury in its hostile takeover by Kraft, British Airways in its merger with Iberia, and Cazenove on the merger of its investment banking business with JPMorgan.He will continue to practise part-time in addition to managing the firm.Mr Cooke’s election follows the appointment of new management at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Linklaters, while Allen & Overy partners will vote in February on replacements for David Morley, its senior partner who is retiring, and Wim Dejonghe, its managing partner.Candidates at A & O for senior partner are Mr Dejonghe, Tim House, Stephen Kensell and Michael Struys, while managing partner possibilities include Andrew Ballheimer, Simon Black, Michael Castle and Andrew Trahair.The simultaneous moves are partly coincidental — various appointment terms happen to expire at the same time. But they also come as the legal market in Britain grows ever more crowded as more US law firms seek to establish stronger footings in London.US firms generally offer higher salaries and slimmer management structures, giving them an advantage in luring British lawyers. However, they are still perceived as harder places to work because of hourly billing expectations.British firms have responded to the competition and continued pressure from clients to keep billing rates down by hiring more managers to oversee projects and ensure work is being done efficiently, and opening lower-cost centres in places like India, Belfast and Manchester.At Freshfields, Edward Braham, a top deal lawyer who has advised Kingfisher, Betfair Group and Anheuser Bush, took over as senior partner from Will Lawes on January 1. London litigation partner Chris Pugh and Cologne tax partner Stephan Eilers became joint managing partners, while Michael Lacovara in New York was appointed executive partner, an operations role.At Linklaters, Gideon Moore was elected as the firm’s managing partner in November for a four-year term, succeeding Simon Davies. Mr Davies had held the post since 2008 and is joining Lloyds Banking Group.

Further payments of up to $1.35bn may come from royalties and profit sharing if the product reaches the market.For Gilead, the partnership promises to strengthen its position in treatments for inflammatory diseases as it seeks new sources of growth after its success in hepatitis C and HIV.Onno van de Stolpe, Galapagos’s chief executive, said he was still disappointed about the way AbbVie announced its exit from their partnership without consulting the company first. But he added he was happy to have a new partner committed to putting filgotinib at the centre of its inflammation franchise.Galapagos held talks with eight potential investors after AbbVie’s withdrawal, Mr van de Stolpe told the Financial Times. Gilead was felt to be the best fit because of its greater nimbleness compared with bigger pharma groups.“Gilead has built its HIV and [hepatitis C] franchises into a fantastic company with quite a small footprint of only 7,500 people,” he said. “The culture fits extremely well with Galapagos.”Shares in Galapagos rose 11 per cent following the announcement to an all-time high of €58.55 — more than recovering the sharp losses they suffered after AbbVie’s exit. This gave it a market capitalisation of €2.3bn.Mr van de Stolpe said another appeal of Gilead was its willingness to share marketing rights in some European countries and work together on development — supporting his aim to build Galapagos into one of Europe’s first big biotech groups.$725mUpfront payment from Gilead in return for 15% stake in Galapagos and licence to co-develop and commercialise filgotinib“It’s about time Europe built something substantial in biotech,” he said. “That is something that has been lacking because companies have been acquired too early rather than being given the time and capital needed to grow.”Gilead’s Galapagos deal marks the second boost for European biotech within weeks after Genmab of Denmark won approval from US regulators for the Darzalex blood cancer drug it is developing with Johnson & Johnson.Genmab is ranked second in terms of market capitalisation among European biotech companies, at about $8bn, behind Actelion of Switzerland at $15.5bn.However, they remain just a fraction of the size of US biotech groups such as Celgene, Biogen and Gilead, whose $147bn market valuation is greater than all but two of Europe’s traditional pharma groups.Galapagos said it planned to start late-stage trials of filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease next year and would fund 20 per cent of the development costs, with Gilead paying the rest.Mr van de Stolpe said he was convinced filgotinib was a safer product than AbbVie’s ABT-494, but their relative efficacy was still to be determined. Analysts have forecast annual peak sales in excess of $3bn for filgotinib, which Galapagos hopes will reach market in 2019.
50;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-12-17T09:41:52Z;AstraZeneca adds 55% Acerta Pharma stake to swath of deals;UK drugmaker has option to buy remainder of US-Dutch biotech company for about $7bn;"AstraZeneca has agreed to buy a majority stake in Acerta Pharma with an option to take full control for up to $7bn, capping an intense period of dealmaking for the UK group as it races to refill its drugs portfolio.Acerta is a US-Dutch biotech company developing a promising blood cancer drug that would, if it reaches market, be a direct challenger to the Imbruvica treatment which prompted AbbVie to buy Pharmacyclics for $21bn in March.AstraZeneca will pay an initial $2.5bn for 55 per cent of privately-owned Acerta, with a further $1.5bn by the end of 2018 and an option to buy the remainder of the company at any time for a further sum of approximately $3bn.The investment came a day after AstraZeneca agreed to pay Takeda of Japan $575m for a portfolio of respiratory medicines and a month after it bought ZS Pharma, a US biotech company, for $2.7bn.Pascal Soriot, chief executive, said the deals were complementary to the group’s in-house research and development as it seeks replacements for several old medicines where patent protection has lapsed or will do so soon.Some analysts and investors are sceptical of his target — set during the successful battle to fend off a $100bn takeover by Pfizer last year — to increase revenues by three-quarters to $45bn by 2023.However, Mr Soriot said on Thursday that he remained confident of hitting the goal and said the Acerta deal and other recent acquisitions would lift AstraZeneca's potential further. “These deals are not substitutive, they are additional,” he said. “We look forward to demonstrating to the sceptics that our forecast can be achieved.” Three products that accounted for almost 40 per cent of total revenues last year — Nexium for heartburn, Crestor for high cholesterol and Seroquel for schizophrenia — will have lost market exclusivity by the end of 2017.Efforts to renew the product portfolio received a boost last month when US regulators approved a new lung cancer treatment, called Tagrisso, and several other promising therapies are approaching market.The Acerta deal would strengthen the group’s position in haematological cancers — an area it has previously acknowledged to be a weakness. In early stage trials, Acerta’s drug, known as acalabrutinib or ACP-196, showed a 95 per cent response rate in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the most prevalent form of adult leukaemia. Late-stage trials are under way, as well as early-stage studies in solid tumours.AstraZeneca said it believed acalabrutinib had advantages over Imbruvica that made it a potentially best-in-class medicine for a range of blood cancers that could generate peak annual sales in excess of $5bn. AbbVie, which co-owns Imbruvica with Johnson & Johnson, has forecast peak sales of at least $7bn for its drug.People close to the situation said AstraZeneca had faced competition for the asset, with other interested parties including Merck & Co and Amgen. Acalabrutinib was inherited by Merck when it bought Schering-Plough in 2009 but it later disposed of the drug.Alistair Campbell, analyst at Berenberg, said it looked like a good deal at a good price for AstraZeneca, highlighting the 1.4 multiple of forecast peak sales it was paying compared with the 2.8 paid by AbbVie for Imbruvica. He said trial data suggested acalabrutinib had a ""major safety advantage"" over Imbruvica.Some analysts have questioned why AstraZeneca has made a sudden dash into haematology less than a year after deciding to put one of its most promising drugs into a partnership with Celgene to target blood cancers.Analysts at Natixis investment research said this left a “confused message” now that AstraZeneca appeared to be building its own in-house capabilities.However, Mr Soriot insisted the deals were complementary and said Celgene was helping advance its MEDI4736 immunotherapy in blood cancers much quicker than it could have done alone.Acerta is 40 per cent-owned by Wayne Rothbaum, a veteran US biotech investor and founder of Quogue Capital, a venture fund. The company was advised by Goldman Sachs."
51;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-12-14T20:17:32Z;AstraZeneca: in search of a blockbuster;Cancer drugs are not certain to ensure the pharma group’s share price recaptures past glories;"Jimmy Carter can tell you why AstraZeneca is contemplating paying $5bn for an unquoted Dutch biotech company with a single product in phase III trials. The former US president recently declared himself cancer-free following treatment with pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug marketed by Merck & Co. Its UK rival is trying to bulk up in the same sector — and with good reason.The object of Astra’s attention, Acerta, is developing a treatment for certain types of leukaemia. Analysts think it could ultimately generate more than $2bn a year in sales. An existing rival product, Imbruvica, is forecast to become a blockbuster (a drug that generates more than $1bn a year in sales) in 2016; AbbVie paid about $21bn to buy the company that developed it. The Acerta product may work better but trials will not be complete until 2018.Oncology is the smallest of Astra’s therapy areas by sales but the company wants to build a portfolio that can replace the revenues from blockbuster products that are losing their patent protection. It has had some successes this year: Tagrisso, a treatment for lung cancer, was approved earlier than expected while Lynparza, for ovarian cancer, was recently cleared for use by the UK’s National Health Service.This progress has made it easier for Pascal Soriot, Astra’s chief executive, to justify rejecting Pfizer’s £55 a share bid for the company last year. Its share price, at £43, is little changed from the day Pfizer withdrew; GlaxoSmithKline has fallen over the same period.Yet risks remain, not least over the timing. Astra’s statutory earnings have not covered its dividends for the past two years, and the squeeze will get worse in 2016.According to consensus forecasts, none of its cancer drugs will be a blockbuster even by 2018. Oncology is also increasingly competitive; cancer drugs account for almost a third of the assets in the pipelines of the top 12 pharma groups, says Deloitte.Mr Soriot may well achieve his target of bringing six cancer drugs to market by 2020. It is less certain whether their revenues will recapture past glories — or return Astra’s shares to the level of past takeover bids.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
52;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-12-14T15:46:40Z;AstraZeneca weighing up Acerta bid to secure blood cancer drug;UK-based group seeking to reinforce research and development pipeline before patents lapse;"AstraZeneca is weighing a direct challenge against AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson with a potential bid for a Dutch biotech company developing a competitor to the US groups’ Imbruvica blood cancer drug.The UK-based group said it was “exploring potential strategic options” with privately owned Acerta Pharma, whose rival treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is in late-stage trials.An acquisition would mark the latest effort by AstraZeneca to refill its research and development pipeline as it braces for the loss of patent protection next year on its blockbuster Crestor anti-cholesterol pill.It would also strengthen the group’s capabilities against haematological cancers — an area it has previously acknowledged to be a weakness.Analysts said speculation about a $5bn valuation for Acerta sounded attractive compared with the $21bn paid by AbbVie to buy Pharmacyclics in March — giving it a half share in Imbruvica alongside co-owner J&J.Sachin Jain, analyst at BofA Merrill Lynch, said encouraging data from early stage trials suggested Acerta’s product, known as ACP-196, could generate peak annual sales in excess of $2bn. AbbVie has predicted peak sales of $7bn for Imbruvica.However, Jo Walton, analyst at Credit Suisse, foresaw “significant interest from multiple other bidders” if Acerta was for sale, suggesting that AstraZeneca risked being drawn into a bidding contest.In a statement reacting to a report about the potential deal in the Wall Street Journal, the UK group said there was “no certainty that any transaction will ultimately be entered into, or as to the terms of any transaction”.A deal, should it happen, would be the latest of many bolt-on deals and partnerships by AstraZeneca as Pascal Soriot, chief executive, reshapes the business in response to declining sales of older drugs.Three products that accounted for almost 40 per cent of total revenues last year — Nexium for heartburn, Seroquel for schizophrenia, and Crestor — will have lost market exclusivity by the end of 2017.AstraZeneca last month agreed to buy ZS Pharma, a US biotech company with a drug in late-stage development for a condition associated with kidney and heart failure.However, Mr Soriot is staking his greatest hopes on the group’s own R&D pipeline, including its Tagrisso lung cancer drug approved by US regulators last month.AstraZeneca is aiming for a return to sales growth in 2017 after a dip next year, with a long-term goal of increasing revenues by three-quarters to $45bn by 2023. This latter target was set by Mr Soriot during the group’s successful battle to resist a £69.4bn takeover by Pfizer last year.Some analysts and investors remain sceptical; AstraZeneca’s shares have fallen almost 5 per cent this year and were unchanged on Monday at £43.33, well below Pfizer’s offer of £55 a share.However, Mr Jain at BofA Merrill Lynch said AstraZeneca had “a broad and under-appreciated pipeline”, which had the potential to outperform the wider pharma sector from 2017 onwards."
53;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-09-24T18:14:22Z;Pharmaceuticals: Value over volume;Outcry over a 5,000% price rise has rattled stocks and hardened opinion for change on pricing models;It was probably the most expensive tweet in history. A 21-word missive from Hillary Clinton on Monday wiped more than $40bn off the value of US pharmaceutical and biotech stocks.The Democratic presidential frontrunner decried as “outrageous” the “price gouging” by some drugmakers and promised action to stamp it out. The next day she announced a package of measures designed to rein in pharmaceuticals “profiteering”.Her intervention coincided with an outcry over a 5,000 per cent price increase levied on an anti-infective drug used by Aids and cancer patients. The company — Turing Pharmaceuticals — is run by a 32-year-old fast-talking former hedge fund manager, Martin Shkreli, who instantly became the unapologetic face of an industry accused of putting profits over public health.Mr Shkreli responded to the ensuing media storm with a tweet linking to an expletive-filled Eminem song, “The Way I Am”, containing the lyrics: “I’m tired of all you, I don’t mean to be mean. But that’s all I can be is just me.”This tale of two tweets has thrust drug pricing to the centre of the US presidential campaign and sent investors fleeing in fear of a clampdown on one of the world’s biggest and most profitable industries.While the furore reflects the unique excesses of the US drug market, it also feeds into a broader global debate about the cost of medicines. From restrictions on pricey cancer treatments in Britain’s cash-strapped National Health Service to reforms of the way drugs are procured in Chinese hospitals, the industry is under pressure around the world as societies battle to contain the rising cost of healthcare for ageing populations and growing middle classes.Until recently, the US has seemed immune from such forces. Drug prices have been rising at an annual rate of at least 10 per cent since 2010 even as they stagnated in Europe. The sustainability of this growth is being called into question as the showdown between Mrs Clinton and Mr Shkreli heaps scrutiny on why America’s drugs bill is rising so fast.Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, says Mr Shkreli’s aggressive approach is the natural consequence of a US system that allows drugmakers to charge what the market will bear for products essential to human health. “This guy just happened to get caught in a perfect storm but it had been brewing for some time.”A market out of control?The US has long been an outlier from the regulated pricing and controlled market access in other developed countries. This has made America by far the most lucrative place to sell medicines, accounting for about 40 per cent of global sales. Annual US per-capita spending on pharmaceuticals almost doubled between 2000 and 2012 to $1,010, compared with the $498 average among OECD members. Any move to rein in the US market, therefore, would shake the industry to its foundations.Mrs Clinton’s proposals include opening the market to cheap imports from Canada, mandating pharma companies to spend a minimum proportion of sales on research and development and allowing the government to negotiate prices paid by the public Medicare health insurance programme. The latter measure has for years been resisted by drugmakers and their Republican allies, who fear a slippery slope towards the rationing of care commonplace in socialised European health systems.Yet the absence of government leverage over drug pricing is one of the main reasons why Americans pay so much more for their medicines than the rest of the world. US prices are typically 20-40 per cent higher than in Europe and sometimes more. Novartis’s Gleevec cancer drug costs $106,322 a year in the US but only $31,867 in the UK, according to researchers at the University of Liverpool.Is this all about to change? Mrs Clinton’s attack appeared driven in large part by campaign politics as she battles to neutralise the threat posed by Bernie Sanders, her leftwing rival for the Democratic nomination who had already promised action on drug prices.Andrew Baum, an analyst at Citigroup, describes Mrs Clinton’s plan as “more fiction than future”, noting that even if she were elected to the White House next year the measures would probably founder if Republicans kept control of Congress. Yet, while radical reform seems unlikely in the near term, Mr Baum says this week’s controversy shows that “political pressure on drug pricing in the US is high and will continue to rise”.Tensions over pricing have been growing for more than a year since Gilead Sciences launched a breakthrough medicine called Sovaldi, which cures most cases of hepatitis C within weeks — at a cost of $84,000. This weighed heavily on insurers and public health providers because of the large number of people — 3.2m in the US — with the disease. Spending by Medicare on hepatitis C increased 15-fold in 2014 from the year before to $4.5bn. The price has since fallen after the introduction of a rival product from AbbVie. But the case demonstrated the unfettered pricing power held by pharma groups in the US when no competition exists.Mr Shkreli exploited this freedom to raise the price of its Daraprim brand from $13.50 to $750 per pill after buying the product, the only one of its kind, for $55m from another small drugmaker last month. But he backed down on Tuesday with a promise to reduce the increase by an unspecified amount.Even fellow drugmakers joined the criticism, alarmed at the damage being caused to the industry’s already shaky reputation by one renegade company. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the main US industry trade group, briefly broke from condemning Mrs Clinton’s proposals to tweet that Turing “does not represent the values” of its members.Controversy over drug pricing is hardly new. The industry faced opprobrium in the 1990s when it was accused of keeping HIV drugs out of reach of the poor. Pharma leaders have always defended their right to make a return on heavy investment in research and development. But, in a series of interviews with the Financial Times before this week’s events, executives acknowledged that business models must adapt to an era of constrained health budgets.“We need to make sure we are taking the choices for long-term acceptability by society,” says Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline. “If we don’t, society is going to react through regulation or some other pendulum shift.”Wider benefitsThere is increasing consensus that a clearer connection must be made between the price charged for a medicine and the measurable benefit it delivers to patients and society. Sir Andrew and his peers want to shift the focus from the cost of medicines to the value they create, for example by allowing someone to return to work earlier or keeping them out of hospital.This may sound like an uncontroversial idea but the concept of “value-based pricing” marks a departure from traditional practices. The big pharma business model was built by dispatching armies of sales reps to push the largest possible quantity of pills at the highest possible price without looking back to see whether the medicine worked. Joe Jimenez, Novartis chief executive, says those days are coming to an end. “The industry has to shift over time from what is today a transactional approach to an outcomes-based approach.”He cites Novartis’s new Entresto heart drug as an example. The medicine, launched in July, was shown in clinical trials to reduce hospitalisation by over 20 per cent. But the Swiss group faces a challenge to persuade customers to adopt it over older drugs that are less effective but much cheaper. It is trying to do this by offering the medicine at a discount with the potential for bonus payments if it succeeds in cutting rates of costly hospitalisation.Other companies are experimenting with similar pay-for-performance models, harnessing big data to measure the “real world” impact of medicines rather than relying on the results of clinical trials. “If companies can show that they are producing real value they will be able to sustain reasonable prices,” says Chris Stirling, head of life sciences at KPMG, the consultancy. “But they are going to have to put in more effort than before. Having a big sales force is no longer going to be enough.”Demonstrating value, however, is only half the problem. Gilead’s Sovaldi might be cost-effective over the long term by curing patients whose hepatitis would otherwise have imposed a prolonged burden on health systems. The cost of a liver transplant — the fate of some hepatitis C patients — is several times higher than the cost of Sovaldi. Yet this potential future saving is of little comfort to the healthcare managers whose budgets have been overwhelmed by the upfront cost of the drug.Preoccupied with profitsThis problem is prompting a radical rethink. James Wilson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school, says annuity-style payments over a number of years would provide a sustainable way to reward investment in one-off curative treatments that produce big long-term benefits.Others propose a simpler solution: companies should lower their price expectations. The 10 biggest drugmakers had an average net profit margin of 19 per cent in 2013 — similar to banking and double the level of the oil and gas sector. Andrew Hill, an expert on drug pricing at the University of Liverpool, says pharma could afford to charge less while still making ample profit.This is disputed by Yevgeniy Feyman, fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative US think-tank, who says margins are comparable with other research-intensive sectors such as technology. High-risk drug development must reap high rewards, he says, “otherwise investors would direct their money to the next Snapchat instead of an Alzheimer’s cure”.Mr Feyman says the fixation on prices is perverse when the almost $300bn spent annually on prescription medicines in the US is dwarfed by the $1tn on hospital care. Similar ratios apply in Europe, where pharma executives lament that it is easier for politicians to squeeze drug budgets than to restructure inefficient health infrastructure.There are signs that the US may be starting to rein in its bloated healthcare spending. At 18 per cent of GDP, that is by far the highest in the developed world yet outcomes are inferior compared with some countries that spend less. President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms included incentives to increase efficiency, while consolidation among care providers and insurers is increasing economies of scale.In the long run these trends could help drugmakers if they create more headroom for spending on medicines and reward products that reduce long-term care costs. The most immediate effect, however, has been a more aggressive approach to price negotiations by the healthcare “payers” who buy drugs. GSK, for example, has been forced to sharply cut the price of its best-selling Advair asthma drug.“For years in Europe we have had price cuts and restrictions in availability of new products and we’re beginning to see the same in America,” says Sir Andrew. “It’s not going to be exactly the same as Europe but the direction of travel is similar.”Mr Baum agrees that the most competitive fields such as respiratory and diabetes drugs will face pressure. But he predicts that medicines offering a clear improvement over existing treatments will maintain pricing power — citing the new class of cancer “immunotherapies”.This pressure to innovate helps explain the record wave of mergers and acquisitions that has swept the sector over the past two years as drugmakers have vied to strengthen their R&D pipelines. Mrs Clinton has fuelled questions over whether the high valuations paid for many of these assets will be justified if pricing comes under attack.Severin Schwan, chief executive of Roche, admits there will be “tough negotiations” ahead. “It’s a market-driven system. But I think the US will continue to reward innovation — I’m absolutely sure of it.”
54;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-07-28T19:41:24Z;Pfizer chief executive has ‘sufficient courage’ to pursue deals;Speculation over plans for its $17bn cash pile has grown as rivals have consolidated;Pfizer is scouting for acquisition targets and has “sufficient courage” to spend its cash on another company, its chief executive said on Tuesday, signalling its intention to participate in an avalanche of dealmaking that is reshaping the global pharmaceuticals industry.“There are always opportunities and we stand ready . . . I’m optimistic that we have sufficient courage to find those opportunities in the marketplace,” Ian Read, Pfizer’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts.Speculation over how Pfizer will deploy its $17bn of cash has mounted amid the frenetic pace of consolidation in the healthcare sector, where $390bn-worth of deals has been announced since January, according to Thomson Reuters.Mr Read dismissed suggestions that Pfizer, which announced the $17bn purchase of Hospira earlier this year, had missed out on other attractive deals. “I don’t think we’ve lost out on any opportunities that would have made sense to our shareholders,” he said.Pfizer has been on the hunt for targets since its botched takeover attempt of AstraZeneca in 2014. Earlier this year, it missed out in a three-way auction for Pharmacyclics, a maker of blood cancer drugs that eventually went to AbbVie for $21bn, according to people involved in the transaction.“Additional deals will likely make the stock go higher, as this is what investors seem to want,” said Timothy Anderson, an analyst at Bernstein Research.On Monday, Teva said it would purchase Allergan’s generic drugs unit for $40.5bn, a deal that analysts suggested could make Allergan, the maker of Botox, the popular cosmetic treatment, a more attractive target for Pfizer’s established products division.However, Mr Read said that deal had not “changed the landscape for Pfizer in any material way”.He added: “Our inclination would be to do something in the innovative space rather than the established space.”As the drugs watchdog in the US declares painkiller abuse to be a national epidemic, pharma companies are seeking to develop tamper-resistant pills. David Crow finds this search has led to a surge in the recruitment of drug users to test the new opioids and talks to Brandon, one of the human guinea pigs.Pfizer is effectively running its business as two separate companies — one focused on innovative drugs, the other on slower-growing medicines that are no longer patent-protected. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company will make a decision on whether to implement a full-scale split.Mr Read repeated his calls for Washington to implement corporate tax reform that would allow it to repatriate cash trapped overseas to the US, and give it a tax rate that would put it on a level footing with rivals based in Europe.“I do think I am heartened by the conversations that are occurring and the acknowledgment in Washington that something has to be done to allow global US corporations to become competitive given the nature of the US tax system,” he said.Mr Read’s comments came as Pfizer announced strong second-quarter earnings thanks to strong sales of Prevnar, its pneumonia vaccine, and Ibrance, a recently-approved drug for a type of breast cancer.Vamil Divan, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said: “Overall, we expect investors to view the performance this quarter as a positive, but still expect much of the focus to be driven by . . . further business development efforts and views on a potential future split of the company.”Pfizer reported earnings per share of 56 cents on revenues of $11.9bn in the second quarter, beating the 52 cents and $11.4bn consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts. The company’s shares rose 2.9 per cent to $35.36 by close of trading in New York.
55;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-07-14T15:25:58Z;Johnson & Johnson sales hit by ‘biosimilar’ competition;New kind of copycat drugs pose threat to big pharma;International sales of Johnson & Johnson’s blockbuster anti-inflammatory drug fell more than 25 per cent in the second quarter, as the medicine became one of the first to face sustained competition from new “biosimilar” copycats.Remicade, used to treat immune disorders including arthritis and Crohn’s disease, is J&J’s top-selling drug, pulling in $3.3bn of revenues in the first six months of the year.Unlike traditional chemical pills, it is a “biologic” medicine formed out of proteins grown from live cells, making it impossible for generic drugmakers to replicate it precisely.However, the approval in Europe of a “biosimilar” version made by Celltrion, a South Korean group, had a dramatic impact on sales outside the US in the second quarter, which fell to $580m compared with $783m a year ago.Celltrion is seeking US approval for the drug along with its partner Hospira, which is being bought by Pfizer.The threat of biosimilars has started to stalk the big pharma companies, which are hoping that newer biologic medicines will be harder to copy.The industry is only just starting to recover from the so-called patent cliff, the huge loss of revenue as a whole generation of top-selling drugs became subject to generic competition.There is still a significant debate over whether biosimilar drugs will have the same impact as traditional generic drugs, because they can only make equivalent versions of the original medicine, rather than direct copies.“Remember, biosimilars are not generics,” Alex Gorsky, Johnson & Johnson chief executive, said on a call with analysts. “We expect biosimilars to be applied differently than the generic.”He added: “More than 2.2m people have been treated with Remicade and 70 per cent of the current patients are receiving sustained and effective treatment, so we believe their doctors are very unlikely to switch them off with that level of success.”Mr Gorsky also noted the company had a US patent covering Remicade that does not expire until September 2018. “You can be sure we will continue to vigorously defend [it],” he said.Remicade sales in Europe were also hit by a weaker euro, which combined with a stronger dollar against other currencies to crimp second-quarter revenues across the company. Johnson & Johnson generates roughly half of its revenues outside the US.Johnson & Johnson, the world’s largest healthcare company, had already warned that foreign exchange movements would hurt sales and profitability this year and lowered its full-year earnings guidance when it unveiled first-quarter results in April.This time, the company nudged up its guidance for full-year adjusted earnings per share to between $6.10 and $6.20 compared with an earlier range of $6.04 to $6.19.Second-quarter revenues were down roughly 9 per cent on a year earlier at $17.8bn, in line with the typical estimate from Wall Street analysts. Adjusted earning per share were roughly 4 per cent lower at $1.71, slightly ahead of consensus expectations of $1.69.Shares fell slightly in New York trading to $99.76, giving the company a market capitalisation of roughly $277bn.A stronger than expected performance in J&J’s pharmaceuticals division helped offset weakness at its medical devices and diagnostics business, which suffered from strong competition and pricing pressure, as healthcare systems try to push down the cost of replacement hips and equipment.Sales of Invokana, its new type-2 diabetes drug, jumped by almost a third to $472m while sales of Xarelto, an anti-clotting medicine, were up to $1.65bn compared with $1.38bn last year.Imbruvica, the cancer drug that J&J sells in partnership with Pharmacyclics, also did well, with its share of sales jumping from $42m a year earlier to $154m. Analysts said the performance bodes well for AbbVie, which beat J&J in a race to buy the blood cancer specialist for $21bn earlier this year.Overall, pharmaceutical sales were down 6.6 per cent at $7.9bn, mainly because of currency movements and a collapse in US sales of Olysio, its hepatitis C medicine that has been superseded by drugs which can practically cure the illness.Sales for J&J’s consumer business, including allergy remedy Zyrtec and Tylenol painkillers, were down 7 per cent compared with a year earlier at roughly $3.5bn. Medical device revenues were 12.2 per cent lower at $6.4bn.
56;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-06-15T09:03:47Z;US companies regain their appetite for tax inversion deals;Push for deals increases in spite of White House crackdown on controversial foreign takeovers;US companies have regained their appetite for controversial foreign takeovers that allow them to move overseas and escape US taxes, in spite of a White House crackdown to restrict so-called tax inversions last year.According to several senior corporate advisers in the US and Europe, demand for such deals has picked up significantly in recent months and set the expectation that more transactions will be announced this year.The largest attempted tax inversion in more than a year was revealed last week when it emerged that Monsanto, the US agribusiness company, had structured its unsolicited $45bn takeover of Switzerland’s Syngenta as an inversion that would allow it to move its domicile to the UK, where corporate tax rates are lower. Syngenta has refused to engage with Monsanto and rebuffed its takeover approaches so far.The desire for inversion deals comes amid feverish deal activity led by the US, as companies look to use cheap debt and high share prices to squeeze every possible synergy, including tax benefits, out of potential takeovers.But the attempted inversions fly in the face of the US government, which moved last year to reduce the attractiveness of these deals after a flurry of transactions in 2014. US President Barack Obama has labelled the practice “unpatriotic”.The US Treasury took specific actions in September designed to limit the benefits of inversions after at least 15 US companies struck such transactions last year. A number of others, including drugmakers Pfizer and AbbVie, launched ultimately failed bids at tax inversion deals.“For some companies considering mergers, today’s action will mean that inversions no longer make economic sense,” the Treasury said at the time.The measures were designed to prevent an inverted US company from using various structures to access its deferred overseas earnings without paying US taxes. The Treasury also homed in on transactions where the target company’s shareholders would only own between 20 and 40 per cent of the newly formed company, by strengthening the requirements on the US company seeking the inversion.“Initially executives were shocked by the decision taken by the government and decided that they didn’t want to hear about inversions any more,” said one banker who helps with tax structuring on mergers and acquisitions.However, he said that corporate boards were looking at tax inversion proposals at a pace that was nearly the same as before the US government clamped down on the move. “They are willing to take more risk and structure deals in a way that goes around the new rules not against them,” the banker said.Why does Monsanto, the agricultural seeds and chemicals group, want to buy rival Syngenta? One of the main answers is Roundup. Continue readingIn addition to lower future corporate tax rates, other benefits to would-be inverters include their ability to access future non-US earnings — as opposed to their existing cash piles — free of US tax, and their ability to take generous tax deductions on loans between different parts of their business.At least three tax inversion deals have been reached since the US Treasury action: medical equipment maker Steris said it would buy the UK’s Synergy Healthcare for $1.9bn, Cyberonics took over Italy’s Sorin for close to $3bn, and US networking equipment maker Arris agreed to acquire the UK’s Pace for $2.1bn.“The simple answer is that transatlantic M&A involving healthcare and pharma companies is coming back. Those kinds of businesses in particular lend themselves to inversion, because they already have tax planning constructs within them,” one international M&A lawyer said.When asked in April about the possibility of Pfizer seeking another tax inversion deal after its unsuccessful attempts to buy the UK’s AstraZeneca last year, the company said it was focused on reducing its expenses, including tax.Ian Read, Pfizer’s chief executive, said: “The new rules — or not the new rules, the new proposed rule change — does make it more difficult to immediately realise any benefits from being redomiciled. But it really depends upon the target.”Additional reporting by Barney Jopson and Megan Murphy
57;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-06-11T11:01:36Z;Gaps in drugs pipelines spark a flurry of takeover activity;The threat of a flood of generic drugs sparks a spending spree;The pharmaceuticals sector has been gripped by a mergers and acquisitions frenzy for the best part of two years, with some of the biggest names in the industry fighting over hot new drugs.Last year was a record for dealmaking in the sector and 2015 is also off to a strong start, with healthcare transactions worth $193.9bn announced since the beginning of January, according to Thomson Reuters.As the value of deals has shot up, so has the premium that buyers are willing to pay to secure novel and potentially lucrative medicines. In March, Pharmacyclics, a biotech company that makes a single blood cancer drug, was bought by AbbVie for $21bn, a premium of nearly 50 per cent over what the California-based group was worth before it emerged it was up for sale.This month, Alexion, a rare-disease drug developer, agreed to acquire smaller rival Synageva Bio-Pharma for $8.4bn, a 139 per cent premium on its market value before the deal was announced.For many, it was another sign that valuations in the sector are spiralling out of control. One of the main reasons companies are paying such big premiums is because they are facing the loss of exclusivity on some of their best-selling drugs. Since 2011, many of the biggest pharmaceutical companies have been faced with a “patent cliff”, prompting them to buy drugs to fill gaps in their pipelines of treatments under development. For instance, AbbVie’s main drug, Humira, which accounts for more than half its sales, will start losing patent protection by the end of 2016, partly explaining why it was willing to pay so much for Imbruvica, the drug made by Pharmacyclics.Deals are not the only way of protecting a drug’s revenue base: some companies have also adopted a more vigorous approach to managing their intellectual property (IP). However, they are encountering fierce resistance from those who fund healthcare systems, who often see “copycat” generic medicines as one of their best weapons in the fight against rising drug costs.Once a patent expires and a drug loses its exclusivity, the market is usually flooded with a wave of generic versions. The makers of these generic drugs are allowed to bring their medicines to market without putting them through lengthy and expensive clinical trials, enabling them to undercut the price of the original version.Actavis, the US pharma group, had hoped to lessen the impact of the introduction of a generic version of Namenda, its Alzheimer’s drug, by securing a so-called “hard switch”. It tried to remove its twice-a-day Namenda IR from pharmacy shelves and move patients to a newer once-daily version, Namenda XR, which has a longer patent.Companies that are expanding patents by simply changing the dosage are going to get kneecappedIf patients and doctors had become used to the newer drug, they would be less likely to move to the generic, which is due to launch in July — or so the theory went. However, Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney-general, this year secured an injunction that prevented Actavis from pulling Namenda IR off the market.“A drug company manipulating vulnerable patients and forcing physicians to alter treatment plans unnecessarily simply to protect corporate profits is unethical and illegal,” he said.Actavis appealed, but at the end of May a US appeals court upheld the decision. According to Ronny Gal, an analyst at Bernstein, the research and brokerage company, the ruling does not bode well for other drugmakers seeking to emulate Actavis’ strategy.What is an inventor’s greatest challenge? How do you protect ideas and turn them into money?Join the chat using #FTinvent on Thursday 11 June 5-6pm London time (6-7pm Paris)“The direction set by the district and appeals court suggests it would be increasingly difficult to ‘hard switch’ products,” says Mr Gal. “Companies will probably have to demonstrate no hardship for patients and a business rationale, which differs from attempting to force the market to accept their new product.”Policy makers are not the only ones targeting drugmakers’ IP. Kyle Bass, a hedge fund manager who runs Hayman Capital Management, has started challenging what he sees as spurious drug patents, while simultaneously betting against or “shorting” the stock of the company that makes the medicine.Mr Bass has created the Coalition for Affordable Drugs and plans to target about 15 companies with a combined market capitalisation of $450bn using the Inter Partes Review process, introduced by the US government in 2012 to allow fast-track patent challenges.He has promised to focus on hard switching and another type of patent management known as “evergreening”, where a company secures a new patent by making a minor change to a drug.Mr Bass told investors: “Companies that are expanding patents by simply changing the dosage or the way they are packaged are going to get kneecapped”.
58;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-05-15T03:50:01Z;The drugs to watch in fight against cancer;‘Immunotherapy’ treatments turn the body’s immune system into a weapon against disease;About 30,000 doctors and scientists will arrive in Chicago in two weeks for the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco), where they will pore over data from thousands of clinical trials. With many of the largest drugs groups in a race to develop the next wave of cancer treatments, the event offers them a chance to jockey for position with doctors and investors.Exciting clinical data have been held back to make a splash during late-breaking sessions at the conference, but summaries of most of the trials have now been published. They offer a tantalising glimpse of the new drugs — or drug combinations — being tested. Most of them are “immunotherapy” treatments, a new approach that tries to turn the immune system into a weapon against cancer.Here are five drugs to watch, along with the biggest disappointment of the “abstract drop”.1. Opdivo and Yervoy (Bristol-Myers Squibb)In March, Opdivo became the first immunotherapy treatment to be approved for lung cancer, and it is already approved for melanoma.Known as a “PD-1 inhibitor”, it blocks a protein called programmed death receptor 1, which stops immune cells from attacking healthy tissues. Cancer can escape destruction by tricking the body and latching on to this protein, but Opdivo puts a brake on the process and unleashes the immune system as a weapon.We already know that Opdivo works for some lung cancer and melanoma patients, but there is still a big question mark over how many people will benefit.Some research has suggested that only those with certain molecular traits will respond to PD-1 therapies, and the debate over the importance of these “biomarkers” has become the biggest in immunotherapy: the commercial opportunity will be much smaller if the drugs are only given to a subset of patients.However, a large and late-stage trial found that Opdivo benefited even those patients with low expressions of PD-1. The full results of the study, which looked at patients with a type of advanced lung cancer, will be published at the Asco meeting.Overall, the percentage of patients on Opdivo who survived for at least a year was 42 per cent versus 24 per cent for patients on Docetaxel, the control drug.Most doctors and investors are waiting for a series of “big reveals” which have been held back for the meeting, including a trial of Opdivo in liver cancer patients, and a study that combines the drug with Yervoy, another immunotherapy made by Bristol-Myers.These should go some way to answering two big questions. What sort of results will oncologists get if they combine two or more immunotherapy drugs? And can these treatments succeed in tumours besides melanoma and lung cancer?After Bristol-Myers, Merck & Co has the most advanced PD-1 inhibitor: Keytruda. It also has one of the biggest clinical trial programmes, with more than 85 studies in 30 different tumour types, and it too is holding back much of its exciting data for a series of big announcements at Asco.Investors are keenly awaiting news on whether Keytruda works in a range of cancers, including oesophageal, ovarian, kidney, and small-cell lung cancer.An abstract released ahead of the conference showed that Keytruda, combined with Bristol-Myers’ Yervoy, managed to shrink patients’ tumours and, in one instance, eliminate them entirely. The early-stage trial tested the combo in 11 patients with a type of advanced lung cancer that had not responded to other treatments.In one patient, the cancer disappeared entirely, while five had a “partial response”, meaning their tumours shrunk by at least 30 per cent. The disease progressed as doctors would have expected in the remaining five patients.While small, the study adds to a body of research that suggests combining immunotherapy agents could become the holy grail for some cancer sufferers. That is good news for patients, but it will worry those who have to pay for the drugs, which command prices in excess of $100,000 a year.3. Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (AstraZeneca)Compared to Bristol-Myers and Merck, AstraZeneca is a laggard in this race. However, it believes it can pull ahead by combining its own immunotherapy agent, a PD-L1 inhibitor that has a different mechanism to PD-1 drugs, with another of its medicines, Tremelimumab.Tremelimumab inhibits a protein known as CTLA-4, which also prevents the body from attacking cancer. The theory is that removing two brakes on the immune system at the same time will produce even better results than a PDL-1 inhibitor alone, although previous studies of similar drugs have warned the combo could be so toxic as to actually harm patients.According to an early-stage study of 30 patients, AstraZeneca’s combo therapy reduced tumour size by at least 30 per cent in roughly one in three being treated for a type of advanced lung cancer. More importantly, researchers concluded the treatment had “a manageable safety profile”.4. Avelumab & 4-1BB (Partnership between Pfizer and Merck KGaA)Much to the frustration of its executives, Pfizer is also well behind in the immunotherapy race: it does not even have its own PD-1 drug. In an attempt to get ahead, it has partnered with Germany’s Merck to develop its PD-L1 contender, Avelumab.At this stage, Pfizer and Merck KGaA just have to prove they are in the race, although there is nothing in the abstract drop that suggests they are about to pull ahead.An early stage trial suggests the PDL-1 inhibitor is less effective at treating lung cancer than rival therapies, although another study suggested it could work for some patients with ovarian tumours.More intriguing is Pfizer’s experimental drug, part of a class of medicines known as 4-1BB. While PD-1 and PDL-1 inhibitors remove brakes on the immune system, a 4-1BB is designed to accelerate the body’s response.5. Elotuzumab (Partnership between Bristol-Myers and AbbVie)Elotuzumab has not garnered as much attention as Bristol-Myers’ other cancer drugs. However, a trial suggests many doctors could end up using it in combination with Revlimid to treat patients with myeloma, a blood cancer.On average, patients taking a combination of both drugs survived 19.4 months, compared with 14.9 months for those using Revlimid alone, according to a late-stage study of patients whose cancer had returned or who did not respond to other treatments.There were high hopes for Neratinib, a breast cancer drug that some analysts thought would achieve peak annual sales of $6bn.However, shares in Puma, the small-cap US biotech group that makes the drug, closed down 18 per cent on Thursday, after disappointing data from a late-stage clinical trial.The drug was given to patients with a type of early stage breast cancer that had already been treated with Herceptin, the blockbuster drug from Roche. After two years, the proportion of patients who had survived without any sign of the disease returning was 93.9 per cent.That might sound high, but these were early-stage patients who had already responded to treatment. Indeed patients on Neratinib performed only a couple of percentage points better than those on a placebo.It might be the first casualty of the Asco meeting. But it is unlikely to be the last.The first and third charts in this article have been rebased so the y axis begins at zero
59;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-05-10T10:36:28Z;Top 50 US boardroom hoarders sit on $1tn in cash;Taxes and tepid economy stop companies from repatriating dollars;Just five US companies are hoarding nearly half a trillion dollars as the country’s tax code and a tepid global economy deter businesses from spending their overseas cash piles.Apple, Microsoft, Google, Pfizer and Cisco are sitting on $439bn of cash — accounting for more than a quarter of the total $1.73tn being held by US groups, according to Moody’s Investor Services. The top 50 together hold almost $1.1tn, with the iPhone maker alone accounting for more than a 10th of the cash reserves.The Moody’s analysis showed 4 per cent growth in the cash on corporate balance sheets of the companies it covers, excluding the financial sector, over the past year. The growing cash piles underline the reluctance of boardrooms to repatriate money held abroad even as they tap debt markets to fund record spending on dividends, buybacks and acquisitions. Moody’s estimated that 64 per cent of the cash, or about $1.1tn, was held overseas, up from $950bn or 57 per cent a year ago.“There has been little progress toward corporate tax reform that would incentivise US companies to permanently repatriate funds held overseas,” said Richard Lane of Moody’s. Economists with Goldman Sachs said they saw such reform as “unlikely” to happen this year or next.Cheap borrowing costs have kept companies from dipping into foreign cash, as executives seek to avoid a tax bill on profits earned abroad. Instead, Oracle, AT&T, AbbVie and Microsoft have completed multibillion-dollar debt issuances ahead of a recent sell-off in Treasury markets, as investors prepare for the Federal Reserve to lift rates.That could change if borrowing costs rise. Activist shareholders continue to press companies to return cash — in the form of buybacks and dividends — on which S&P 500 constituents are set to spend $1tn this year.Boom in buybacks and dividend payments spurred by Apple and General ElectricContinue readingExecutives’ desire to buy into faster growing business areas has unleashed a wave of M&A activity, with total announced deals up 26 per cent to $1.4tn since the start of 2015, according to Dealogic.Capital spending has also climbed, up nearly 8 per cent to $937bn last year at non-financial companies rated by Moody’s. However, strategists say that growth will probably reverse, as energy companies slash spending after a rout in oil prices to protect shareholder returns and financial liquidity.Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, US equity strategist with JPMorgan, noted that the technology and healthcare sectors had the highest cash balances abroad, adding that the status quo was “likely to prevail” as the odds of a deal being reached in Washington were quite low.“We believe US corporates continue to grow earnings at a high-single-digit rate with increasing corporate actions including higher buyback and M&A activity with or without repatriated cash,” he said.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
60;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
61;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Global spending on cancer drugs surges to $100bn;Global record comes as industry prepares to launch new treatments that could add to costs;Global annual spending on cancer drugs has hit $100bn for the first time as the pharmaceuticals industry prepares to launch a fresh generation of treatments that promise to push costs even higher.The record 2014 figure marks a 10 per cent increase from a year earlier, largely due to rising drug prices and increased incidence of cancer.The data — from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, a respected US research organisation — comes at a time of growing excitement among medics and investors over new cancer drugs heralded as the biggest step forward in oncology for decades.Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and AstraZeneca are among those developing so-called cancer immunotherapies that harness the body’s immune system to fight tumours.The earliest of these have been launched in the US in recent months at prices amounting to about $150,000 a year — generating fresh optimism around the pharmaceuticals industry after a decade of sluggish growth.However, the expected surge of expensive new cancer drugs has raised questions over their affordability for healthcare systems already struggling with the rising cost of caring for an ageing world population.“Earlier diagnosis, longer treatment duration and increased effectiveness of drug therapies are contributing to rising levels of spending on medicines for cancer,” said the IMS report.The compound annual growth rate in cancer drug spending increased to 6.5 per cent over the past five years and this was forecast by IMS to rise further to 6-8 per cent between now and 2018 as new treatments arrive.“New therapeutic classes and combination therapies will change the cancer landscape over the next several years,” the report said.A scramble for high-margin cancer assets has been a factor in the mergers and acquisitions boom across the pharmaceuticals sector, including AbbVie’s $21bn takeover in March of Pharmacyclics, maker of a fast-growing blood cancer drug.IMS said rising prices would be mitigated by increased competition — particularly in immunotherapies as dozens of pharma groups and smaller biotech companies vie for position in the nascent market.“The strong pipeline of medicines in clinical development . . . suggests that direct competition will increase in the next five years,” said IMS. “Certain tumours, such as non-small cell lung cancer, will become battlegrounds, with multiple classes and multiple products within classes competing.”Since the start of last year, pharmaceuticals companies have agreed $462bn of mergers and acquisitions — greater than the gross domestic product of Austria.Continue readingBiosimilars — lower-cost copies of complex biological drugs — would also act as a pressure valve on costs as patent expiries loom for several best-selling oncology drugs, such as Roche’s Herceptin breast cancer treatment.The US accounted for 42.2 per cent of the oncology market in 2014, well ahead of Europe. But cancer drugs accounted for a bigger share of total drug spending in the top five European markets at almost 14.7 per cent, compared with 11.3 per cent in the US. This proportion increased in all regions of the world in the past five years.Average per capita spending on cancer drugs was highest in the US at $99 in 2014, up from $71 in 2010, but the biggest increase was in the UK where it rose 67 per cent over the period to just over $40. Britain’s National Health Service has this year cut access to several cancer drugs deemed insufficiently cost-effective in order to rein in spending.Rising incidence of cancer poses a big policy challenge for global health systems as populations age — exposing more people to the biggest risk factor behind the disease: old age.The number of over-65s on the planet is projected almost to triple between 2010 and 2050 to 1.5bn, according to the UN. This, in turn, will spur a 70 per cent increase in cancer incidence over the next 20 years, according to the World Health Organisation.
62;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Biotech: Making sense of the science;As big pharma bets huge sums on the next breakthrough drugs, some investors fear another bubble;"It was supposed to be a wonder drug. Provenge promised to turn the body’s immune system into a weapon against disease, offering fresh hope to the one in seven men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Known as an “immunotherapy”, it was one of the first treatments of its kind to win approval from US health regulators. When the Food and Drug Administration gave Provenge the green light in 2010, investors piled into shares of Dendreon, the company that made the treatment, sending its market capitalisation to almost $8bn.Analysts hailed a new blockbuster, forecasting peak revenues in excess of $4bn a year. But late last year, Dendreon went bankrupt. Provenge was a flop. Annual sales of just $300m had been hamstrung by its price tag — $93,000 a treatment — and the emergence of better alternatives. The company’s shares, which hit a high of $54 in 2010, ended up being worth a few cents; its assets fetched less than $500m in a fire sale in February.The demise of Dendreon served as a reminder that many companies working on revolutionary drugs fail, but it has done little to calm market excitement surrounding the biotech industry, the subject of intense takeover activity in the past 12 months. The companies in the sector offer to harness two decades of huge advances in genetic science to create new drugs for some of the deadliest diseases. If they succeed they will save countless lives and deliver a windfall for the investors who have been piling into the sector for the past two years.When it comes to funding, the biotech industry has never had it so good. Investors are flooding the sector with money. The New York Stock Exchange Arca biotech index has risen by over 200 per cent since the start of 2011 to 4,131 points, easily outpacing the S&P 500, which has grown 64 per cent. At this rate, it will not be long before the cumulative market capitalisation of US biotech companies tops $1tn.Big pharma groups, facing the loss of exclusivity on many of their drugs and big gaps in their pipelines, have been busy buying biotechs at hefty premiums. Younger companies are able to raise funding with relative ease, first from venture capitalists and then from the public markets: there were 82 initial public offerings of biotech companies in 2014, according to Credit Suisse, eclipsing the record of 67 set in 2000.Adding substanceFor some, the exuberance is eerily familiar to the bull market that preceded the biotech crash of 2000. Yet many investors, analysts and executives say it is different this time. Then, investors were betting on the promise of genomic science, which, much like the dotcom boom of the same period, failed to immediately live up to the hype. Now, however, they are investing in more advanced treatments as the scientific breakthroughs of the past decade reach commercialisation.“We are in a different era. Unlike past bubbles, where there was not a lot of substance, we have terrific science . . . leading to breakthrough therapies,” says Ron Renaud, chief executive of Rana Therapeutics, a Massachusetts-based biotech group.If the bulls are wrong, the consequences would be devastating for investors, who stand to lose hundreds of billions of dollars, but also for patients. Should markets take fright, the industry would struggle to secure the funding, hampering its attempts to discover the next breakthrough drug.It took over a decade for the biotech sector to recover after the 2000 bubble burst. Some fear any similar fall today would leave the genetic medicine revolution moving back into the slow lane.Investors are already jittery. Last month, Gilead, the California-based maker of a $1,000-a-day hepatitis-C pill, prompted a sharp sell-off across the sector by warning its treatments should not be used in combination with a particular type of heart drug. Mixing the two had led to abnormally slow heartbeats in nine patients, one of whom had died of cardiac arrest.Analysts were sanguine about the impact on Gilead, let alone other biotech companies, but that did not stop the correction erasing all of the March gains on the NYSE Arca biotech index. It was the third time in six months that investors ditched biotech stocks because of problems at Gilead, the largest biotech group with a market capitalisation of $150.9bn at the end of last week.Yet some bulls point to the very existence of large-cap biotechs as a sign that bubble fears are overdone. In 2001, the cumulative market capitalisation of the top five biotech groups was $82bn. Now Gilead, Amgen, Biogen, Celgene and Regeneron are worth over $500bn combined. Gilead is bigger than many of the best-known names in pharma, including GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb, while Biogen is larger than AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly.The success of these groups, all of which were founded in the late 1970s or 1980s, shows the biotech model is scaleable and long-lasting, according to Ravi Mehrotra, biotech analyst at Credit Suisse. That is propitious for some of the groups that recently completed IPOs, such as Bluebird Bio, a specialist in rare diseases, which has seen its market capitalisation surge by almost 400 per cent to $4bn since its IPO in 2013.“The financial markets for the first time know that successful biotechs can attain greater than a $100bn market cap . . . and thus it is logical for them to pay more for present day small and mid-cap companies that may be the bellwethers of the future,” he says.Others argue that a big leap forward in genetic science is now producing effective drugs marking a clear difference to the 2000 bubble. “Before the 1990s we only had a crude understanding of genomic science — it was a black box,” recalls Kevin Starr, a partner at Third Rock Ventures, which has raised $1.3bn to invest in biotech and life sciences companies. “Circa 2000, we had the human genome and there were suddenly lots of investments in companies trying to understand genomics. But they weren’t applying the science to anything investible.”Mr Starr, who worked at biotech group Millennium between 1998 and 2003, recalls how the initial euphoria surrounding genetic science was replaced by the realisation that many of their discoveries were not “druggable”.“We thought if you found the gene that caused a disease you would simply be able to ‘drug it’. The technology had great promise, but then we realised it would take decades.”But, says Mr Starr, better scientific knowledge is now coinciding with a big data revolution that makes it easier to crunch laboratory data, while advances in automation and miniaturisation have made drug development cheaper.‘Not amazing enough’Genomic science is producing revolutionary new drugs, from a cure for hepatitis-C to immunotherapy treatments. Yet some believe that the companies’ prospects do not justify their stratospheric valuations.“My gut reaction is that biotech valuations are always too high,” says Amit Roy, a pharmaceuticals analyst at the independent Foveal research group. “We need to think about which patients are going to get given the drug. The same mistake is always made: the drug is amazing, but it is not amazing enough.”Mr Roy accuses some analysts of “double counting” in their sales forecasts. When a new drug is close to getting regulatory approval, some incorrectly assume the drug will be given to all the patients who would benefit. But when a rival therapy is approved, they perform the same calculation — although the two drugs are chasing the same set of patients.Even bullish analysts admit it is a stretch to set current biotech valuations using traditional metrics. “When I look at valuations, the old way I used . . . no longer works,” says Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum. “Almost all the stocks I cover . . . trade above, in many cases double-digit percentage points, their base case DCFs,” he adds, referring to a common valuation method known as discounted cash flow. “You can get to current stock prices if you assume greater R & D productivity going forward than has been the case over the very long term,” says Mr Schoenebaum.Competitive fieldIan Read, chief executive of Pfizer, admitted recently that he was concerned by “buoyant” valuations of biotech stocks. Yet Pfizer was one of the companies involved in a three-way bidding war last month for Pharmacyclics, the maker of a drug for blood cancers. It offered $19.8bn for the group, according to people who worked on its offer, but was trumped by AbbVie, which ended up sealing a deal for $21bn.Richard Gonzalez, chief executive of AbbVie, described the takeover battle as “one of the most competitive I’ve ever seen”. But for some, the $21bn price tag for a company that makes just one drug was proof that the sector is overheating.Mr Gonzalez’s estimates imply the drug will achieve annual peak sales of $11.5bn, compared to the typical Wall Street estimate of around $6bn. A recent straw poll of over 300 analysts found almost 90 per cent thought AbbVie had overpaid for Pharmacyclics.“Are there valuations that are out of proportion to reality? There probably are,” says Brent Saunders, the chief executive of Actavis who engineered the biggest takeover of 2014 — the $70.5bn acquisition of Botox maker Allergan. “There are certain areas where there are arms races,” says Mr Saunders.He puts hepatitis-C, where there are two companies offering an effective cure with a third soon to join the fray, in that category. Some investors fret the drugs will not be able to command high prices with so much competition.Some lawyers and bankers say high prices could make it harder for big pharma groups to justify takeovers to shareholders. Geoffrey Levin, partner at legal firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, says high valuations and a healthy market for IPOs are prompting some big pharma groups to target smaller, often privately held, biotech groups, where the early stage science is riskier, but the potential rewards are far larger.Yet few believe the large-cap pharma groups will stop doing big-ticket biotech deals any time soon because they desperately need new products to fill their own drug pipelines, depleted by years of under-investment and R & D failures. Barely a day goes by without a spike in the shares of a biotech group. Names that are often mentioned as takeover targets include Receptos, the Californian maker of drugs for autoimmune disorders including multiple sclerosis and BioMarin, which develops treatments for rare genetic diseases.“Since most big pharma R & D pipelines are not producing new products with as much revenue as they need to replace drugs going off patent, these companies are willing to pay a premium for new therapies that have received, or are close to receiving, [regulatory] approval,” says Frank Aquila, an attorney at Sullivan & Cromwell. “Today, more times than not, they will be biotech products.”If anything, a large correction in biotech stocks could be helpful for big pharma, allowing companies to pick up promising assets at depressed valuations. It would be a problem, though, for nascent biotech groups or for the venture capital groups they turn to for their first rounds of funding.“I’m worried that a few high-profile failures could tar others with the same brush, which would have some blowback for the rest of the industry,” warns Mr Starr. “Whenever you get success, you see a herd mentality.”As home to pioneers such as Alexander Fleming and Louis Pasteur, Europe has a rich history of medical science. Yet the region’s investors have struggled to match the enthusiasm of US counterparts for helping push innovation from the laboratory bench to the hospital bed. While Europe boasts several of the world’s biggest pharmaceuticals groups, such as Roche, Novartis and Sanofi, it has relatively fewer of the young biotech companies that keep the US life sciences sector in a constant state of renewal.With a market capitalisation of SFr13.5bn ($13.8bn), the biggest homegrown European biotech group — Actelion of Switzerland — is a fraction of the size of top US counterparts such as Gilead and Biogen.European biotech entrepreneurs bemoan a lack of risk appetite and specialist investment funds of the kind that have fuelled the US boom. This leads to a more conservative approach by European start-ups, according to Adi Hoess, chief executive of Germany’s Affimed. “If you see €40m on a US biotech’s balance sheet you are worried because it means they need to raise more. If you see a European company with that much money you do not need to worry for at least two years.”The greater pool of capital available in the US has led several European companies to cross the Atlantic in search of funding. Adaptimmune of the UK this month became the latest to announce plans for a Nasdaq initial public offering.At the same time US companies are looking at European deals, with Bristol-Myers Squibb agreeing to invest $100m in Uniqure, a Dutch gene therapy company. This US interest has combined with signs of a revival in local appetite to boost companies such as Genmab of Denmark, Sobi of Sweden and Galápagos of Belgium, which have seen strong share price rises in the past 12 months. But only when some of these begin emulating the likes of Gilead by making serious profits are European investors likely to embrace this riskiest of sectors. Andrew Ward"
63;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-04-08T17:20:22Z;Biosimilar drugs: spot the difference;The market’s view on the impact of biosimilars is sanguine, but this may be wrong;"Big pharma groups crushed by patent expirations in the first decade of this century spent the second rushing into biotech. Biotech medicines — proteins grown from live cells — had effectively infinite patents. There was no regulatory route to market for copies of drugs with expired patents. In the US, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 set up a path. And finally, last month, the US authorities approved a biosimilar of Amgen’s Neupogen, a drug with more than $1bn in annual sales.There are still hard questions for regulators, health insurers and doctors. The drugs are complex; the original and the biosimilar are not identical. It is not perfectly clear if the differences matter. So should biosimilars of the same drug from different manufacturers have different names? Should pharmacies fill prescriptions for the original with its biosimilar? If a biosimilar is approved for one condition treated by the original, does the approval cover the other conditions, too?Given these ambiguities — and the fact that biosimilars are tricky and expensive to become approved and to produce — the market has been sanguine about the impact of biosimilar competition on originators’ profits. Shares in groups reliant on biomedicines with patents near expiry (AbbVie and Roche, say) appear unperturbed.This relaxed view may be mistaken. Big companies with lots of biotech experience — Amgen, Pfizer, Biogen Idec — are committing piles of capital to biosimilars. In Europe (where these have been taking hold, slowly, since 2007) a biosimilar for Merck’s blockbuster Remicade is starting to hit sales hard. Biosimilars will grow gradually, but the issue is less about market share than how a cheap alternative affects the original’s price.There is much work ahead. And originator companies will fight hard. But if the biosimilars work perfectly well (so far, they seem to) the economic pressure on all health systems will probably carry the day, in time. Liberum, a rare research house that takes biosimilars seriously, thinks these will keep Roche’s margins flat for the next five years. Consensus calls for a big margin expansion. The next decade will be interesting.This note has been amended since original publication to correct a reference to PfizerEmail the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
64;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Healthcare sector leads feverish M&A activity;‘Eat or be eaten’ mindset to drive more deals as groups try to replace sales lost when patents expire;On March 2, the chief executives of Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and AbbVie all rushed to California to make one last pitch to Pharmacyclics, a cancer drugmaker with just one product to its name.All three were bidding to buy the company and, two days later, AbbVie prevailed in a fiercely contested auction, splashing $21bn on a cash-and-shares deal. It valued Pharmacyclics at a 60 per cent premium to its share price in early February — and exemplified the competition for pharmaceuticals assets that has driven global dealmaking.In the first three months of 2015, the total value of healthcare deals reached $95.3bn, accounting for 12 per cent of all merger and acquisition activity this year, and a 70 per cent increase on the same period a year ago.This feverish M&A activity has been led by drugmakers seeking new treatments that can replace the billions of dollars in sales they will lose when their existing patents expire.In addition to AbbVie’s takeover of Pharmacyclics, three other healthcare deals rank in the top 10 for the quarter.Drugmaker Pfizer acquired medical diagnostics company Hospira for $16.8bn, deal hungry Valeant snapped up Salix Pharmaceuticals for $15.8bn, and, on Monday, pharmacy benefits manager UnitedHealth bought Catamaran for $12.8bn.Analysts say the ‘eat or be eaten’ mindset will drive further deal activity in the coming months, as smaller drug companies such as Endo Pharmaceuticals and Mallinckrodt look to challenge their larger rivals for other assets.Stephen Sands, global co-head of healthcare at Lazard, says: “Big pharma companies have lived through the crucible of their portfolios losing patent exclusivity and are individually making decisions with a very defined set of targets in mind . . . Companies are doing deals to secure strategic assets. Even as valuations have become pricey, investors have been supportive of deals.”Elsewhere, telecoms and cable companies remained active, even as some of last year’s biggest deals — such as Comcast’s takeover of Time Warner Cable and AT&T’s acquisition of DirecTV — awaited approval from US regulators.Hutchison Whampoa, the conglomerate that is controlled by Li Ka-shing and owns the European mobile operator Three, proved a principal actor. Hutchison announced a $45bn deal to combine with Mr Li’s other vehicle Cheung Kong Holding. Hutchison’s Three then struck a deal to buy the UK business of Spain’s Telefónica for $15.4bn.Jean Abergel, global co-head of media and communications at Morgan Stanley, says: “One of the fundamental drivers of increased M&A in the telecoms and cable sector is the capital intensity of this industry and benefits one can derive from economies of scale.”Companies such as France’s Altice and Liberty Global, the cable company controlled by billionaire US entrepreneur John Malone, are expected to be active in Europe in the coming months.However, in value terms, European dealmaking languished in the first quarter. Monetary policies measures designed by the European Central Bank to stimulate the eurozone, boosted stock prices and devalued the euro but failed to prompt transactions.Europe experienced a 4 per cent drop in M&A activity, with just $168bn worth of deals announced.Nevertheless, several cross-border deals into Europe gave bankers cause for optimism. These included the $8.6bn takeover of the UK’s Rexam by rival US can maker Ball and the proposed $7.9bn acquisition of Italian tyremaker Pirelli by ChemChina.Not long ago, it made corporate executives quake. Now, the big leveraged buyout looks like an endangered species after the flow of deals hit a six-year low.Continue readingHenrik Aslaksen, global head of M&A at Deutsche Bank, says: “The weakening euro has encouraged overseas acquirers to take a deeper look at Europe. In particular, we are seeing Chinese corporates examine opportunities across a broad range of sectors.”Another area where activity is expected to pick up is in energy sector, where the falling oil price has made it difficult for companies to strike large deals.Manolo Falco, Citigroup’s head of corporate and investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, says: “We think there will be more energy deals but that will be a factor later in the year. For stronger global resources companies, there will be a big opportunity to buy in the US if energy prices come down as we think they will.”Activists investors continued to contribute to dealmaking volumes — and US activist fund Starboard Value stood out. Its campaigns led Yahoo, the US search company, to spin off its $40bn stake in China’s ecommerce giant Alibaba, the packaging companies MeadWestvaco and RockTenn to combine in a $16bn merger, and US stationery retailer Staples to buy Office Depot in a $6.3bn deal .The largest US health insurer is to spend almost $13bn to buy a company that manages prescription medicines for 35m patients, the biggest in a series of healthcare deals announced on Monday as consolidation in the industry continues at a blistering pace. Continue readingGregg Lemkau, global co-head of M&A at Goldman Sachs, says shareholder activism will continue to be important factor influencing M&A.The quarter’s most significant unsolicited bid came from Simon Property Group, which is attempting to buy rival US landlord Macerich for $21bn.Steve Wolitzer, vice-chairman of banking at Barclays, says he expects an increase in unsolicited bidding wars.He says: “Historically, hostile deals are high risk, only around 20 per cent of them end up to be successful, so executives tend to avoid them as they can be distracting. But given the current conditions of cheap financing and a shrinking pool of quality assets we do still expect to see more of these situations.”
65;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Pharmacyclics chief to receive $3.6bn from takeover;AbbVie $21bn bid delivers almost $4bn to executives;Executives and directors at Pharmacyclics are set to share almost $4bn from the sale of the company for $21bn to AbbVie, which won a three-way bidding war for the Californian biotech group this month.Robert Duggan, Pharmacyclics chief executive, is in line to receive the lion’s share of the payout — about $3.55bn for his 18 per cent stake — while Mahkam Zanganeh, chief operating officer, would pocket $225m for her shares and outstanding options.Nine other executives and directors will get an average payout of $23m each, according to a securities filing.The sale will crystallise a return of more than seventy-fold for Mr Duggan, who amassed much of his stake in 2009 when the company was in difficulties and its share price was languishing at about $1.The filing also shows that AbbVie dug deep to outbid Johnson & Johnson and a third unidentified bidder. Its bid of $261.25 a share, comprising 58 per cent cash and the remainder in shares, was almost $900m higher than the other final offers, which were both pitched at $250 a share.In total, five companies approached Pharmacyclics about taking over the group, which makes just one drug — the cancer treatment Imbruvica — providing fresh evidence for those who fear big pharma is paying too much for biotech groups.Around $70bn worth of mergers and acquisitions have been announced in the pharma and biotech industries so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters — more than double the same point in 2014 and the strongest start to a year in more than a decade.When the deal was announced earlier this month, Richard González, AbbVie chief executive, said: “I’ve been through a lot of these [deals], and I’d say this was probably one of the most competitive ones I’ve seen.”AbbVie’s shares fell about 8 per cent in the three days following the announcement of the deal. However they have since recovered, in part because two late-stage studies showed that Imbruvica improved survival rates for those suffering from a type of leukaemia and lymphoma when used in combination with other drugs.The shares are still down about 7 per cent so far this year, making them one of the worst performers in the pharmaceuticals sector.Pharmacyclics decided to put itself up for sale in part because the board was concerned about who would succeed Mr Duggan, aged 70, as chief executive. It also felt it would benefit from the infrastructure and expertise of a larger pharma group, according to the filing.The company first approached Johnson & Johnson, which has had a partnership with Pharmacyclics since 2011, to ask if it would be interested in buying the group, before instructing its bankers to engage interested partners.The final three bidders were told that Pharmacyclics wanted a bid with a big stock component so its executives could benefit from the future success of Imbruvica. Usually, most investors prefer all-cash deals because they offer a clear exit.However, the best and final $250 a share offer from J&J, identified as “Party A”, was comprised entirely of cash, according to the filing. Party B’s offer was also pitched at the $250 mark, but was comprised of 40 per cent shares and the remainder in cash.
66;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-03-06T19:12:21Z;Going the extra mile to win a $21bn deal;How AbbVie came out on top in pharma’s most competitive auction;The Pharmacyclics executives could hardly believe the turn of events.As they gathered on Wednesday at the drugmaker’s law firm in Palo Alto, they knew they were at the end of one of the most competitive auctions in recent corporate history.The tussle over Pharmacyclics had become a fierce battle in the war between the world’s biggest pharmaceutical groups to find growth by buying promising drugs, and was about to culminate in a winning bid that valued their company at $21bn — more than double its market value just two months earlier.As a cancer drug developer, Pharmacyclics had attracted the interest of several huge drug companies but by the start of this week just three remained in contention: AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer.Pharmacyclics has only one drug to its name but it had become such a prized asset that the chief executives of the three bidders had each travelled to California on Monday to make personal appeals to Robert Duggan, its chief executive. A follower of Scientology, who started building a position in the company in 2004 when its shares traded at about $10 each, Mr Duggan took over as CEO in 2008, with the share price near $1, and presided over a dramatic recovery.Now the owner of 18.1 per cent of the company, he was about to deliver shareholders an enormous payout in one of the biggest deals in a dizzying string of mergers and acquisitions. With three competing buyers, the winning bid for Pharmacyclics was expected to be about $20bn.To believers in the biotech boom, the fact that three CEOs were willing to travel thousands of miles to offer such sums was confirmation of the high-value innovation that has led to a doubling in the Nasdaq Biotech index in the past two years.To sceptics, the sky-high premium about to be paid for a company with sales of just $730m was another warning of a bubble, as smaller biotech companies are targeted by bigger groups hunting for growth.Pharmacyclics had been seen as an attractive target since winning regulatory approval in 2013 for Imbruvica, a drug that offered a breakthrough in combating hard-to-treat forms of leukaemia. Each treatment sells at a US price of about $130,000 a year.In the hands of a company with greater resources and marketing clout, the drug stood a greater chance of maximising its potential — analysts forecast it could reach $6bn in sales annually — and expanded to earlier-stage patients and across a broader range of cancer types.Pharmacyclics received its first approach about a takeover in early January. The company turned to bankers at Centerview Partners and JPMorgan Chase to contact other drugmakers that might be interested in participating in a formal auction. All parties involved declined to comment.Most people in the process saw Johnson & Johnson, the health products maker that had a market value of $282bn, as the frontrunner given its longstanding relationship with Pharmacyclics. J&J had signed an agreement with the company to jointly develop its cancer compound, then known by the code name PCI-32765, for an upfront payment of $150m and a series of “milestone” payments that would take its total outlay to about $1bn. As the years passed, and the approvals rolled in, J&J became increasingly impressed with the results.Working with advisers from Goldman Sachs, J&J was quietly confident it would prevail with a generous but disciplined offer given its close partnership as the auction culminated this week. “J&J was seen and believed to be the obvious buyer but they had no special right over Pharmacyclics,” said one insider.The three competing drug companies had continued to refine their proposals until, they were asked to make final offers on Wednesday.Hours before the deal was announced on Wednesday night, the Financial Times reported that J&J was nearing a deal with Pharmacyclics, while Bloomberg and the New York Times said a deal had been agreed.But, as the dealmakers huddled at the law firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati discovered, J&J was now facing stiff competition from AbbVie.Executives from the Illinois-based drug company had spent the past month quickly getting to know Pharmacyclics. AbbVie faced a burning need to acquire a new product to reduce its dependence on Humira, the rheumatoid arthritis drug that accounts for 60 per cent of group sales but loses patent protection next year.AbbVie’s chief executive, Richard Gonzalez, was under pressure to explain what life after Humira would look like, following his botched attempt to buy the UK’s Shire for £32bn — a deal that was torpedoed by a White House crackdown on tax inversions.Pfizer, too, was on the prowl after failing to acquire the UK’s AstraZeneca last year. It had made a $17bn deal to buy Hospira, a medical devices company, in February and was still searching for more assets to buy.As the envelopes were opened, it became clear that one party had trumped all expectations. AbbVie offered $261.25 a share, a bid that valued Pharmacyclics at $21bn — a 60 per cent premium to the level the company was trading at in early February.Mr Gonzalez said “all three players were within a relatively narrow range”. He added: “I’ve been through a lot of these [deals], and I’d say this was probably one of the most competitive ones I’ve seen.”Another person remarked: “In many years of my career I have seen a lot of competitive bids but this one was another level, probably the most competitive I’ve ever participated in.”Back at AbbVie’s Chicago headquarters, Mr Gonzalez asked his communications team to draft a press release, and asked some employees to work through the night to prepare for a round of calls with investors, analysts and the media on Thursday morning. Just before 11pm in New York and 4am in London, AbbVie declared victory.Its shares have fallen 7 per cent since the deal was announced. Mr Gonzalez must now defend his purchase and prove the industry is not in a bubble.Additional reporting by David Crow and Andrew Ward
67;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;AbbVie joins the pharma chain reaction;Latest wave of deals has targeted biotechs in a bid to replenish R&D pipelines as patents expire;As executives from Johnson & Johnson huddled with their advisers, including Goldman Sachs, late on Wednesday, there was cautious optimism that they had done enough to secure one of the most attractive assets in the US biotech sector.Yet J&J’s offer for Pharmacyclics had been trumped by a higher $21bn offer from AbbVie as the year-long wave of dealmaking in the pharmaceuticals sector reached a new peak.It was, said Rick Gonzalez, AbbVie chief executive, one of the most competitive bidding wars he had ever seen, with a third unknown company also vying for the California-based maker of the Imbruvica leukaemia drug.“There were multiple companies competing [and] multiple rounds for this asset,” said Mr Gonzalez. “Three companies stayed in till the end and bid against each other . . . We won.”Big Pharma’s cost of doing business is rising. So are share prices. Can this go on?Continue readingThe deal adds to the more than $300bn of M&A activity among drugmakers in the past year. This represents a record level for the industry — higher even than the megamergers of the late 1990s and early 2000s that created many of today’s pharma giants.The frenzy began when Actavis bought Forest Laboratories for $25bn early last year and has continued ever since, involving almost every big drugmaker and many supporting actors from the biotech and medical devices sectors.“Companies are under pressure if they’re not doing deals,” says one senior healthcare banker. “Once somebody does a transaction it sets off a chain reaction where that company’s competitors suddenly feel under pressure to respond.”This marks a dramatic reversal in investor attitudes from the scepticism that had set in towards large-scale pharmaceuticals M&A over previous years. Megamergers such as Pfizer’s $90bn takeover of Warner-Lambert in 1999 and SmithKline’s $72bn merger with Glaxo had struggled to produce growth. Some critics argued that such deals destroyed value and disrupted research and development.What has changed? The main difference is that the deals of the past year have in the most part been smaller and more targeted. Many have involved big drugmakers buying smaller biotech companies to replenish their R&D pipelines. AbbVie’s acquisition of Pharmacyclics is the latest example of this.There have been exceptions, such as the $66bn takeover of Allergan by Actavis last November. Pfizer’s failed $110bn offer for AstraZeneca also showed that mergers among the biggest groups cannot be ruled out altogether. But more typical of prevailing thinking was the $20bn asset swap completed this week between GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.Perhaps in the past, Sir Andrew Witty, GSK chief executive, and his Novartis counterpart, Joe Jimenez, would have looked to combine the two groups when they entered talks on a range of assets last year. Instead, GSK traded its cancer drugs business for the Swiss group’s vaccines business and the pair set up a joint-venture in consumer healthcare.Glen Giovannetti, head of global life sciences for EY, the consultancy, says this deal reflected a shift towards greater specialisation by big pharma groups. “Companies are asking: what businesses do we want to be in? Where do we have a competitive advantage? They are picking a few therapeutic areas and focusing on them.”This greater willingness to make clear choices about strategic priorities has been evident in deals such as Bayer’s $14.2bn acquisition of Merck’s consumer healthcare division last year — a transaction that greatly increased the German company’s scale in over-the-counter medicines while leaving the US company to focus on innovative pharmaceuticals.Structural changes in the industry have also spurred more M&A as big pharma groups battle to increase productivity. Cuts in R&D spending have left the industry more dependent on young and nimble biotech companies to come up with new drugs. Of the 41 new medicines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration last year, about half came from outside the top 20 drug companies.For AbbVie, buying Pharmacyclics will provide some of the fresh growth it urgently needs to reduce dependence on its Humira rheumatoid arthritis treatment which loses patent protection at the end of next year. Similar factors were behind deals such as Roche’s $8.3bn takeover of InterMune and Merck’s acquisition of Cubist and Idenix in two further multibillion-dollar transactions last year.Analysts and bankers predict more to come, with US companies such as Puma, Juno and Kite at the forefront of a wave of medical innovation. This combination of scientific advances and M&A is fuelling a boom in US biotech stocks. The Nasdaq biotechnology index has more than doubled since the start of 2013.AbbVie paid a 50 per cent premium over Pharmacyclics’s share price just weeks earlier. The 4 per cent decline in AbbVie’s stock after the deal was announced suggests investors may be starting to ask tougher questions about valuations as the M&A boom rolls on.Additional reporting by David Crow and James Fontanella-KhanBack to the top of the page
68;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-03-05T19:32:30Z;AbbVie wins three-way fight over Pharmacyclics;Value of healthcare deals in past 15 months reaches nearly $500bn;A late-night bidding war for a Californian biotech company has taken the value of healthcare deals in the past 15 months to nearly half a trillion dollars in a fresh sign that sky-high valuations have not slowed the pace of pharmaceuticals dealmaking.AbbVie won the three-way fight over Pharmacyclics, a biotech company that makes a single cancer drug, with a $21bn offer that hinged on the opening of three envelopes, according to a person involved in the final discussions.Wednesday night’s winning bid from AbbVie caught Johnson & Johnson by surprise. J&J has had a partnership with Pharmacyclics since 2011, and as late as Wednesday evening it was confident that it would win one of the most competitive bidding wars for years.I’ve been through a lot of these [deals], and I’d say this was probably one of the most competitive ones I’ve seenAbbVie on Thursday unveiled the details of its $261.25-a-share winning bid, which narrowly beat both J&J and a third unidentified bidder.The $21bn deal — funded 58 per cent in cash with the remainder in shares — values the 18.1 per cent stake held by Robert Duggan, Pharmacyclics’ chief executive and largest shareholder, at $3.5bn.The deal, valued at more than double the level at which Pharmacyclics shares were trading in early January, will provide further evidence for those who fear that big pharma groups are paying too much for new drugs in the face of a looming “patent cliff” and stiff competition from cheaper generic rivals.Almost $70bn of mergers and acquisitions have been announced in pharma and biotech so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters — more than double the level of activity seen by the same point in 2014 and the strongest start to a year in over a decade. Since the start of 2014, the global healthcare sector has seen $475bn of deals.Big Pharma’s cost of doing business is rising. So are share prices. Can this go on?Continue readingSo far this year, Valeant has acquired gastrointestinal drugmaker Salix for $14.5bn, Pfizer bought Hospira for $17bn and Shire picked up NPS Pharma for $5.2bn.“I’ve been through a lot of these [deals], and I’d say this was probably one of the most competitive ones I’ve seen,” said Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie chief executive, a sentiment echoed by several others working on the deal.Most recent deals have boosted the acquirer’s share price, but shares in AbbVie closed down 5.66 per cent in New York trading as some analysts questioned whether AbbVie had paid too much.Vamil Divan, a Credit Suisse analyst, said the deal was “strategically positive” but that “the lofty price tag leaves us with some questions”.On a call with investors, Mr Gonzalez predicted that Pharmacyclics’ Imbruvica drug, which is used to treat certain blood cancers, would achieve peak sales of $7bn, and that the deal would boost earnings by 60 cents a share in 2017.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Gonzalez dismissed suggestions AbbVie had overpaid. He said that once the rival bids had been disclosed, people would “conclude that all three players were within a relatively narrow range”.However, AbbVie’s sales forecasts for Imbruvica are built on the assumption that the drug will be approved for patients with earlier stage blood cancers, as well as those with different kinds of cancers such as melanoma and solid tumours.“The valuation seems to imply some degree of success for Imbruvica in other indications where there is limited human clinical data,” said Mr Divan.The acquisition marks a return to big-ticket dealmaking for Mr Gonzalez following AbbVie’s botched attempt to buy Shire of the UK in October for £32bn, which he abandoned after a White House crackdown on tax inversions made it much less attractive.Some investors are privately critical of how Mr Gonzalez handled that bid and have expressed concern about the extent to which AbbVie is reliant on sales of its blockbuster drug Humira, an arthritis treatment that is expected to face fierce competition from copycat “biosimilar” versions when it goes off patent next year.A person close to the deal said J&J had made a “good strong bid that just didn’t prevail”. They added that the company’s partnership had given it the benefit “of years of due diligence”, which underpinned the thinking behind its lower offer.
69;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-03-05T17:14:00Z;Centerview builds record on pharma deals;Investment bank builds on consumer products role;"Best known for its work with large global consumer companies, boutique investment bank Centerview Partners can now boast of having a leading healthcare advisory business.The New York-based firm notched up its fifth high-profile sale of a biotechnology company in the last two years, as AbbVie splashed $21bn for Pharmacyclics.The red-hot environment for pharma dealmaking has been a profitable area for investment banks. Centerview and JPMorgan Chase are expected to take home up to $40m each for advising Pharmacyclics.Morgan Stanley could receive almost $50m for working with AbbVie, estimate Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting.Yet missing out also has its consequences. Johnson & Johnson’s advisers, which included Goldman Sachs, people familiar with the matter said, walk away empty-handed after losing the Pharmacyclics auction.Centerview, launched in 2006, is run by ex-UBS banker Blair Effron, and Robert Pruzan, former head of investment banking at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.With a formidable presence in consumer products advisory, Centerview ranked 12th among all investment banks last year on total value of deals advised on — ahead of BNP Paribas and RBC Capital Markets.Its healthcare team is led by a trio of former Bank of America Merrill Lynch bankers who decamped for Centerview in 2009.They include Alan Hartman, a Harvard lawyer who practised at transaction-focused law firm Skadden Arps and later rose to become head of Americas M&A at BofA. Mark Robinson, who is based in San Francisco, is noted for having an enviable list of biotech clients on the west coast, where many research labs are based.Richard Girling, who has advanced degrees in biochemistry and was global co-head of healthcare investment banking at BofA with Mr Robinson, is based in London.The musical chairs among large global banks that battle to win roles on blockbuster transactions has also helped Centerview gain momentum as clients are promised a more independent, focused and less conflicted adviser.JPMorgan, which was also advising Pharmacyclics, had only just last year been leading AbbVie’s £32bn deal to buy Shire of the UK, which eventually collapsed. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley is acting for AbbVie on the Pharmacyclics deal, just months after it served as part of the team defending Shire from the US drugmaker.Centerview’s other high-profile pharmaceuticals deals in the last two years include Salix’s $14.5bn sale to Valeant; Intermune’s $8.3bn sale to Roche; Idenix’s $3.85bn sale to Merck & Co last year; and Onyx’s $10.4bn sale to Amgen in 2013. Centerview was also instrumental in advising Alliance Boots on its two-part takeover by US rival Walgreens."

Best of all from a commercial point of view, it is a small-molecule drug taken as a pill rather than a costly to make and hard to administer injectable biologic.Effective small-molecule drugs for major cancer types are rare. Gleevec, Novartis’ pill for chronic myeloid leukaemia, is one example.Since its approval in 2001, Gleevec has brought in revenues of $42bn. Pharmacyclics has rights to half of the US profits from Imbruvica; J&J gets the other half, along with the profits from the rest of the world.Even so, analysts are looking for peak US sales of above $5bn (its US sales last year, its first on the market, were about $500m). The net profit margin for Imbruvica could be 50 per cent, implying roughly $1.5bn in annual profit for Pharmacyclics (once royalties from J&J are taken into account).So the price does not look outrageous relative to peak profits, but bear two things in mind. First, many things can happen on the road to peak profits. Second, there is a time limit: the key patents on Imbruvica run out in 2026. Before merger talk started, the shares were at $170 — and analysts were downgrading on valuation.Drugs companies are betting that drugs providing unique benefits to very sick patients will be best placed to resist the pricing pressure imposed by governments and health insurers. So the price of those assets is rising, fast. To put it another way: big pharma’s cost of doing business is rising significantly. At the same time, pharma shares have outperformed over the past few years; and valuations of big pharma companies are rising. This is an odd response to a sharp rise in the investments they have to make.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
71;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-03-05T10:49:50Z;Q&A: why AbbVie had to strike $21bn Pharmacyclics deal;The $21bn dramatic deal that raised stakes sector M&A spree;"AbbVie has taken another spin on the drug industry’s mergers and acquisitions merry-go-round with a $21bn swoop for Pharmacyclics, snatching the much-sought after asset from Johnson & Johnson just as the bigger US healthcare group had been preparing to strike a deal.The takeover is the latest example of the frenetic M&A activity that has been sweeping the pharmaceuticals sector for more than a year as drug companies tap cheap credit and plentiful cash to buy assets that will boost growth and replenish drugs pipelines.Why was Pharmacyclics such a prized asset?The California-based company owns one of the hottest new drugs in the industry: a leukaemia medicine called Imbruvica which generated $730m of sales during its first year on the market in 2014 and is forecast to become a multibillion-dollar blockbuster. The drug has provided a breakthrough for patients with hard-to-treat chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; in clinical trials, almost 90 per cent saw no deterioration in their disease after six months, compared with 65 per cent for the best existing treatment. A further 13 trials of the drug are at an advanced stage, holding the potential for Imbruvica to to be extended into a range of other blood cancers.Why did AbbVie prevail over Johnson & Johnson?As a standalone pharmaceuticals company, AbbVie is more dependent on keeping a rich pipeline of new drugs than Johnson & Johnson, whose diversified healthcare portfolio ranges from knee implants to baby oil. J&J was in pole position because it already has a deal to co-market Imbruvica with Pharmacyclics. But AbbVie was willing to pay more because its need for the drug was greater. The Chicago-based company drew 60 per cent of its $20bn in revenues last year from a single product: the Humira rheumatoid arthritis treatment that counts as one of the world’s best-selling drugs. Rick Gonzalez, AbbVie chief executive, has been scrambling to reduce dependence on Humira before its US patent expires at the end of next year. He tried to buy Shire, the UK-listed rare disease specialist, but the $50bn deal collapsed last October. This left him on the hunt for growth assets — and willing to trump J&J’s best offer.Can AbbVie justify paying such a high premium?The $261.25 a share cash-and-equity offer represents a premium of nearly 50 per cent over where Pharmacyclics was trading before it emerged last month that the company was for sale. This highlights the inflation in valuations across the biotech sector as bigger pharmaceuticals groups compete for the best assets. For the deal to pay off, AbbVie will be relying on successful clinical trials to expand Imbruvica into other disease areas and strong uptake at a price — about $130,000 per year — that places it among the most costly new cancer drugs on the market. Pharmaceuticals companies have traditionally enjoyed strong pricing power in oncology but the industry is beginning to face tougher scrutiny over the cost of drugs, even in the hitherto laissez-faire US market.Is this deal evidence of a bubble in the US biotech sector?New York’s NASDAQ biotechnology index has more than doubled since the start of 2013. This deal could further inflame enthusiasm as investors look for the next company to be snapped up at a hefty premium. Shares in Pharmacyclics have climbed two-thirds in the past year and 15-fold since the start of 2012, demonstrating the riches that can be made from betting early on potential future blockbuster drugs. InterMune bought by Roche for $8.3bn and Cubist acquired for $9.5bn by Merck are other examples of big pharma delivering big paydays to biotech investors in the past year. Some say the surge in valuations is justified by advances in medical science that have unleashed a new wave of high-value breakthrough products. But the sector remains among the most risky in the investment universe and there are plenty of bears who question how long it can keep rising. Only about 7 per cent of experimental drugs in early-stage trials reach the market and by the time it becomes clear a product, such as Imbruvica, is destined for success, investors and big pharma are being asked to pay an increasingly high price for a share of the spoils."
72;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-03-05T06:35:36Z;AbbVie in $21bn swoop on Pharmacyclics;Company trumps J&J to acquire US cancer drugmaker;AbbVie has agreed to acquire Pharmacyclics for $21bn in what people involved in the negotiations described as one of the most competitive bids for a biopharmaceutical target in recent history.Chicago-based AbbVie made a late swoop to outbid Johnson & Johnson and a third rival with an offer of $261.25 per share in Pharmacyclics. AbbVie said the $21bn deal would be paid roughly 58 per cent in cash and the remainder in its shares. It remains unclear who the third suitor was.The fierce bidding war for a biotech company highlights the pressure pharmaceutical companies are under to replenish their pipelines as patents expire on blockbuster drugs and competition from generic drugmakers intensifies. It will also raise fresh concerns that the biotech industry is overheating.The takeover is the latest example of the frenetic M&A activity that has been sweeping the pharmaceuticals sector for more than a year as drug companies tap cheap credit and plentiful cash to buy assetsContinue readingThe $21bn pricetag represents a premium of nearly 50 per cent over what the market cap of the California-based group was before it emerged that it was up for sale late in February. Shares in Pharmacyclics rose 6.3 per cent to $230.48 on Wednesday, giving it a market cap of $17.5bn.The battle was to gain control of Pharmacyclics’ Imbruvica, a cancer drug that analysts have referred to as having “blockbuster potential”.The pill,which helps fight a rare form of cancer that begins in the body’s immune system, has won expanded approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to treat different types of cancers. It also has been approved in more than 40 other countries, the company said.“The acquisition of Pharmacyclics is a strategically compelling opportunity. The addition of Pharmacyclics’ talented and innovative team will add enormous value to AbbVie,” said Richard A Gonzalez, AbbVie’s chairman and chief executive.The drug “is not only complementary to AbbVie’s oncology pipeline, it has demonstrated strong clinical efficacy across a broad range of hematologic malignancies and raised the standard of care for patients”.The acquisition marks a return to big-ticket dealmaking for Mr Gonzales after a botched attempt to buy Shire of the UK in October for £32bn, a deal he abandoned after a White House crackdown on tax inversions made it much less attractive.Some investors are privately critical of how Mr Gonzales handled that bid and have expressed concern about the extent to which AbbVie is reliant on sales of its blockbuster drug Humira. The arthritis treatment is expected to face fierce competition from copycat “biosimilar” versions when it goes off-patent next year.Imbruvica could achieve annual peak sales of as much as $6bn before the drug goes off-patent in 2026, according to Morningstar, as it expands its label from second-line to additional types of cancers and to first-line patients.Pharmacyclics’ recent fourth-quarter results showed that Imbruvica’s sales grew 31 per cent to $185m, accounting for about two-thirds of the company’s total revenues.J&J, the world’s largest maker of healthcare products, had been thought to be the frontrunner to secure a deal as it has been collaborating for years with Pharmacyclics to develop Imbruvica.According to one person familiar with the situation, J&J will continue working with AbbVie in spite of failing to win control of the Californian company.Venture capitalist came to pharma industry via tragedyContinue readingPharmacyclics, with roughly 625 employees, has undergone a period of extraordinary growth in recent years thanks to its successful research and development of cancer drugs.Shares in the company, founded in 1991, have risen nearly 90 per cent since the start of this year partly due to speculation it was weighing takeover interest from various suitors.Dealmaking in the pharmaceutical sector has been extremely active. Since the start of the year, Valeant has acquired gastrointestinal drugmaker Salix for $14.5bn, Pfizer bought medical device maker Hospira for $17bn and Shire picked up NPS Pharma for $5.2bn.Morgan Stanley and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised AbbVie.

73;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Monday interview: Flemming Ornskov, Shire CEO;Pharma boss says he is not bitter about withdrawal of $55bn bid;"One evening early last October, Flemming Ornskov, chief executive of Shire, had dinner with the man who was supposed to become his boss.As they discussed AbbVie’s plans for the UK-listed drugmaker after its proposed takeover by the larger US pharmaceuticals group, Rick Gonzalez gave no hint of any problems with the $55bn deal agreed three months earlier.“He flew home on Friday and on the Saturday morning I woke up to a very nice email from him talking about how enthusiastic he was,” recalls Mr Orns­kov, who had agreed to take charge of the new AbbVie division into which Shire’s rare disease treatments would fit.But just 10 days later the 57-year-old Dane received a phone call from Shire’s chairman, Susan Kilsby, to tell him the deal was off. AbbVie had been planning to use the acquisition to reduce its exposure to the high US corporation tax rate by moving its official headquarters to the UK. But a clampdown on these so-called tax inversions by President Barack Obama’s administration in September had put some of the potential savings out of reach. AbbVie took another look at the numbers and decided they no longer added up.“I was really dumbfounded,” says Mr Ornskov. “Even at their company it must have been a very small group of people that knew because our HR team was in Chicago [at AbbVie’s headquarters]. I was struggling to get hold of people after I was informed because they were in meetings about the integration.”The collapse of AbbVie’s takeover of Shire was one of the most dramatic episodes in a tumultuous year of dealmaking across the pharmaceuticals sector. But if Mr Ornskov was momentarily shocked by the about-face it did not take him long to recover his poise. Within days, he had revived Shire’s own expansion plans that had been put on hold when AbbVie came calling. This included the pursuit of US-based NPS which was finally captured last month for $5.2bn in a deal that reinforced Shire’s reputation — and that of its chief executive — as rising stars of the global pharma industry.Mr Ornskov says it was easy to get back on track because he had remained focused on his job even after the sale was agreed. “I said, ‘I’m not going to sit in integration meetings for three months. There were other people who could do that. So I spent time with the sales organisation; I visited different countries; I just tried to keep the business going and that’s my strong recommendation to anyone in a similar position because it ain’t over till it’s over.”Brought up in Esbjerg, a provincial port town on the west coast of Denmark, there was little in Mr Ornskov’s early life to suggest a future in big business and high science. His parents were hard-pressed shopkeepers whose struggles worsened when his father contracted tuberculosis and moved to a sanatorium. But this spurred their son’s interest in physiology that took him to medical school in Copenhagen and later into the pharmaceuticals industry via Harvard and an MBA from Insead in France. Today he leads a globe-trotting lifestyle between Shire’s main commercial and research base in Massachusetts and his family in Switzerland. But he has kept an informal, understated manner and remains close to the Esbjerg school friends he left behind.“I’m an avid postcard and letter writer so when I travel I send them a short note and I show up at their weddings and their parents’ funerals,” he says. “They don’t care what I do. One guy called me the other day and said, ‘Hey I saw your company bought something’. We spent 10 seconds on that and then talked about football.”His German wife, who works full-time as a management consultant, also keeps him grounded, demanding he does his share of household chores at the weekend and joins the children on excursions. “She says: ‘You’re not the CEO at home’.”Born 1958, Esbjerg, DenmarkEducation Graduates in medicine from University of Copenhagen; MBA from Insead; Masters of Public Health from HarvardCareer

2013: Appointed chief executive of ShireFamily Married, with two children aged four and eight; two grown-up children. Living in Zurich but planning to move to MassachusettsInterests Keen football fan; enjoys skiingWhen he was recruited by Shire in 2013, the appointment represented a risk for both sides. Mr Ornskov had held senior positions in big pharma and run biotech companies in the US and Denmark. But was he ready to take the helm of a FTSE 100 company? “People probably thought I was a bit of a long shot.”There were also reasons for him to be cautious about leaving his previous job as chief marketing officer for the pharmaceuticals division of Germany’s Bayer. Shire had come a long way from its origins in 1986 selling calcium supplements from above a shop in Basingstoke, in the south of England. But it remained a junior league player compared with GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, Britain’s biggest drugmakers.Through a series of acquisitions, Shire had built a portfolio of speciality medicines increasingly focused on the US. Foremost among these were two of the leading treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Adderall and Vyvanse. Medicating restless American youths has proved a lucrative business for Shire, worth $1.8bn in 2014. But it also exposed the company to simmering controversy over alleged over-prescription of ADHD pills, as articulated in an Esquire article last year entitled ‘The Drugging of the American Boy’.Mr Ornskov defends the clinical value of the products but has made it his top priority to reduce Shire’s dependence on them. He has done this by expanding into treatments for rare diseases — defined as conditions affecting fewer than one in 2,000 people. This is among the hottest areas of drug development because of the high prices commanded by breakthrough therapies for hitherto untreatable and often life-threatening ailments. Once the NPS deal is completed, Shire’s medicines for obscure conditions such as hereditary angioedema and hypoparathyroidism will for the first time account for a majority of group revenues.As a child, Flemming Ornskov talked about becoming a dentist or a doctor when he grew up. “He was very intelligent and hard working,” recalls his school friend Allan Christensen. “He was also a good athlete and soccer player.”The pair remain close friends five decades later, talking regularly by phone and occasionally attending football games together, especially to see Mr Ornskov’s favourite team, Bayern Munich.Mr Christensen, a postman, says: “We are like brothers. He has a very big heart and never forgets his background.”Mr Ornskov says he has drawn more from his medical training than his MBA while charting this new path. “I always think, if I was a physician, how would I look at this product?” he says. “When we acquired NPS I spent an enormous amount of time reading about hypoparathyroidism and short bowel syndrome.”Recruitment has been another management focus as the company rapidly expands. Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg’s book How Google Works is cited as a source of inspiration. “The emphasis Google put on hiring the right people, hiring people who are smarter than you and have skills that you don’t have; that’s what we’re trying to do here on a smaller scale.”While he will not admit as much, it is hard to avoid the impression that Mr Ornskov was relieved when AbbVie walked away. Shire may become a target again. But, with the share price well over double the level it was at when he took over, the company is increasingly viewed as predator rather than prey. Mr Ornskov says he is eyeing further deals in his quest to match the success of US biotech companies such as Gilead Sciences and Biogen Idec which have broken into the ranks of big pharma. He has pledged to double annual revenues to $10bn by 2020. “Maybe I’m a bit overambitious but I feel that we have a real shot at being a significant player.”As for AbbVie, Mr Ornskov has not spoken with Mr Gonzalez since the deal collapsed but he sent him a year-end message congratulating him on his recent engagement to be married. “I have absolutely no hard feelings,” he says. “This is business.”"
74;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-02-12T19:21:14Z;Shire says $1.6bn windfall from AbbVie is tax-free;Irish authorities yet to rule on drugmaker’s $1.6bn ‘break fee’ from abortive merger;Shire has been advised that the $1.6bn “break fee” received from AbbVie after the collapse of their abortive merger is not taxable — exposing the Dublin-based, UK-listed drugmaker to fresh scrutiny over its tax affairs.The windfall — one of the biggest of its kind — was paid by AbbVie last October after the US drugmaker pulled out of its agreed £32bn takeover of Shire.Shire said: “The company has obtained advice that the break fee should not be taxable in Ireland . . . [and] has therefore concluded that no tax liability should arise.”However, it cautioned that “this has not been agreed with the tax authorities”.Jeff Poulton, interim chief financial officer, told the Financial Times that the company was in the early stages of dialogue with Irish tax authorities on the matter.The Irish Revenue said that as a matter of policy it would not comment on individual cases.Shire has already committed the break fee to help finance its $5.2bn acquisition of US-based NPS Pharmaceuticals, agreed last month, as it resumes its expansion as a standalone company focused on speciality medicines and rare-disease drugs.International tax experts said break fees would be taxable in most cases in the US and the UK but acknowledged it was a complex area and that Shire’s case would depend on Irish tax law.Irish tax experts said that compensation-type payments were generally taxable in Ireland, but that it may depend on the circumstances in which they were received.Peter Vale, tax partner at Grant Thornton in Dublin, said: “Payments such as this would often be subject to tax, but there may be circumstances where it falls out of the tax net.”The prospect of Shire’s windfall remaining tax-free adds a further twist to a saga that has shone a spotlight on corporate tax policies on both sides of the Atlantic.Ireland last year abolished the Double Irish, a tax loophole for multinationals. But it looks set to reassert its appeal to tax-thrifty globalisers by sparing drugs group Shire about $310m in tax on a $1.6bn break fee, writes Jonathan Guthrie.Continue readingAbbVie wanted to buy Shire in part to reduce its heavy US corporate tax burden by moving its official headquarters to the UK. The deal collapsed after President Barack Obama’s administration tightened US tax rules to make these so-called “inversions” less attractive.Shire’s tax affairs have been a source of controversy since it moved its headquarters from the UK to Ireland in 2008 to take advantage of the latter’s lower corporate rate. More recently, it has been among the companies attacked by MPs in the UK for using complex tax structures in Luxembourg.Flemming Ornskov, chief executive, said Shire met all its tax obligations around the world and tried to behave in a responsible manner. He acknowledged that it used “complex structures” to increase its tax efficiency but said this helped maximise resources not just for shareholders but also for investment in new medicines.The advice on the AbbVie break fee came to light in Shire’s fourth-quarter financial results. The company reported a better than expected 19 per cent increase in revenues to $1.58bn and earnings per share of $2.63, up 17 per cent.
75;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;M&A helps lift US healthcare stocks;Rising profits blunt concerns that the sector is overvalued;Gilead Sciences, the biotech behemoth that has seen its market valuation soar to a cool $145bn, has put in a strong performance over the past 14 months with its shares rising more than 30 per cent.The gain, however, is seemingly modest compared with many of Gilead’s compatriots, several of which doubled over the same period. A dozen of its S&P 500 peers have climbed more than 40 per cent.US healthcare stocks have staged a vibrant rally over the past six years, buoyed by novel drug treatments, an ageing population and industry-wide consolidation. Rising profits have blunted concerns that the sector is overvalued and equity strategists on Wall Street continue to recommend that clients invest in the industry.Since the start of 2014, the S&P 500 healthcare index has advanced 26 per cent, including gains of more than 100 per cent by Hospira, Mallinckrodt and Allergan — two of which agreed to takeovers — while the Nasdaq biotech index has climbed 40 per cent. The wider S&P 500 has risen 11.5 per cent over the same period.“More than any other sector, healthcare is benefiting from strong demographic and secular trends: ageing population, expanding insurance coverage, growing middle-class around the world, new product launches,” says Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, equity strategist with JPMorgan.The fourth-quarter earnings season added to Mr Lakos-Bujas’s confidence. “Healthcare companies reported the strongest organic growth of all sectors — 11 per cent revenue growth and 22 per cent earnings growth — and ranked the highest on beats,” he says.That trend is likely to continue. S&P 500 healthcare earnings per share are expected to climb 8.9 per cent from a year earlier in 2015, outpacing forecasts for a 1.7 per cent rise in the broader blue-chip index, data from S&P Capital IQ show. The industry’s sales growth, projected at 7.1 per cent this year, is thought to only trail the tech sector’s 9.1 per cent year-on-year gain.The brisk pace of growth has made valuations more palatable, says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. Mr Ablin points to metrics including the price-to-sales ratio, which stands at 1.84 times 2015 results for the S&P 500 healthcare sector, in line with the blue-chip index and below that of the technology complex.“In general, we like cheap sectors that are moving in the right direction and healthcare has been cheap relative to its peers pretty consistently for the last six years,” he says.Strategists with Barclays note the biotech sector has fuelled much of the earnings growth within the healthcare industry, as companies like Gilead bring new products to market. The California-based company’s revenues more than doubled in 2014 to $24.9bn, while its profits rose nearly fourfold to $12.1bn. Analysts on Wall Street expect sales of the company’s blockbuster Harvoni and Sovaldi hepatitis C treatments to top $61bn between 2015 and the end of 2018.“Our conviction level is high on the industry given what we believe will be another strong year for biotech innovation and a differentiated earnings growth profile versus the broader markets,” says Geoffrey Meacham, an analyst with Barclays.Portfolio managers have increased exposure to the sector through new issues, with healthcare companies raising more than $10bn through initial public offerings in 2014, the highest level in at least two decades, according to Dealogic.Merger and acquisition activity has also buoyed valuations, with $10bn-plus deals announced between Allergan and Actavis, Covidien and Medtronic, Hospira and Pfizer as well as CareFusion and Becton Dickinson. The prospect of further consolidation has acted as a floor on share prices, and bankers and investors on Wall Street broadly expect the pace of deals to continue.“There were three things driving M&A over the past year, and two of the three are intact,” says Marshall Gordon, senior healthcare analyst at ClearBridge Investments, which has $115bn assets under management. “The first, big companies still need more products, their growth is somewhat uneven and some still need a help in the shorter term. Secondly, financing continues to be extremely inexpensive.”Our conviction level is high on the industry given what we believe will be another strong year for biotech innovation and a differentiated earnings growth profile versus the broader marketsBut the third driver fizzled when the US Treasury Department clamped down on tax inversions last autumn, killing AbbVie’s $55bn merger with Shire. A deal in Washington to tax overseas cash piles, remove certain credits or to introduce a tax on foreign earnings, none certain to pass, could also weigh on the sector — a point Citi has highlighted as it rates the sector underweight.“Individual companies though could experience major shifts, especially if certain deductions would be removed like R&D tax credits which benefit technology, biotech, drug and med-tech companies the most,” says Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist with Citi.Morgan Stanley recently cooled on the healthcare sector, shifting to a market-weight rating after four years in the overweight camp in December. The sector came under pressure in early February after Gilead warned it would cut the price of its $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pill as insurers and pharmacy benefit managers angled for greater discounts. The reverberations were clear: payers were pushing back.For Morgan Stanley and Citi, another point sticks out: after six years of gains, valuations are not as attractive as they once were.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
76;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-02-10T19:06:20Z;Healthcare: The race to cure rising drug costs;Critics question whether big pharma’s premium pricing model can endure;"Since contracting hepatitis C 25 years ago, Lucinda Porter’s biggest fear has been that she would infect someone else with the deadly virus. “Whenever I cut myself and saw the smeared blood, I would panic,” she says.Within days of contracting the illness, Ms Porter was hit with severe fatigue, weakness and a loss of appetite. She spent most of the next two decades trapped in a “low-level brain fog”, unable to concentrate and prone to severe bouts of muscle-pain and fever.She tried two courses of treatment, both of which failed. By 2003, she had to face up to the possibility that she would die from hepatitis C, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.“I’ve seen people die from this . . . it is one of the worst deaths there is,” says Ms Porter, a nurse.Ten years later, she took part in a clinical trial for a new drug called Harvoni. Within days she knew the treatment was working and after three months doctors declared her effectively cured.Ms Porter is one of 140,000 Americans that have been treated by one of Gilead Science’s hepatitis C drugs since they were launched two years ago. Harvoni and Sovaldi, an older version of the pill, are seen as “miracle drugs”, offering cure rates of over 94 per cent.But Gilead has become the symbol of out-of-control drug prices in the US. A 12-week treatment costs $94,500, or $1,125 a pill, attracting unwanted attention from politicians and doctors, who identify the group as one of the most hated companies in pharmaceuticals.Peter Bach, a doctor and director at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, reflects the views of many in his profession when he accuses it of “corrupting behaviour”.“Gilead is a test case in the court of public opinion,” he says. “It has become the poster child for high drug prices.”The controversy has also highlighted the broader question of whether pharmaceutical companies can defend their premium pricing model in the world’s biggest healthcare market. The evidence of recent weeks suggests it is a battle that big pharma risks losing, raising questions over the economic model of an industry that relies heavily on US profits to reward investors and finance new drugs.After less than a year on the market, Gilead has faced a concerted push to lower the price of Harvoni. Seizing an opportunity created by the approval in December of a rival hepatitis C treatment from AbbVie, another US drugs group, the insurers and employers who fund US healthcare have forced deep discounts from both companies in return for access to patients.Such aggressive tactics had not been commonplace in the US, where patient choice has reigned supreme. Yet there are growing signs of similar behaviour in other areas, including treatments for asthma and diabetes, as the groups that fund US healthcare take a tougher approach to containing costs.“Without any doubt there is pressure on price in the US,” says Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, which has been in a price battle over respiratory drugs with its UK rival GlaxoSmithKline. “We’ve seen what has happened in [hepatitis C] and insulin, we see it in respiratory; it is going to be an issue in oncology. The market is . . . more challenging than it was five years ago.”Price pressuresDirect federal government intervention in drug prices is barred under US law – testament, critics say, to big pharma’s lobbying power on Capitol Hill. But President Barack Obama’s health reform – the Affordable Care Act – has created incentives to control costs, while consolidation among healthcare providers has also shifted bargaining power from drug companies to their customers.The combination of these forces could result in the US applying the brake to rising healthcare costs which, at 18 per cent of gross domestic product, far exceed those of any other nation.Prescription medicine prices account for about a tenth of these costs and rose almost 11 per cent last year, according to the Truveris National Drug Index. This makes drug companies a prime target for an efficiency drive that many experts see as long overdue.Without any doubt there is pressure on price in the US . . . The market is more challenging than it was five years agoGilead’s hepatitis C pills proved so controversial because they combined an expensive drug with a large patient population. A pill at $1,000 each is not unheard of but very expensive drugs are usually aimed at rare diseases, as the company has to charge more per patient to recoup its costs.The number of people with hepatitis C is huge, with more than 3m infected in the US alone. As soon as Gilead launched its new drugs, medical professionals warned that they risked busting the system. But the return for Gilead’s investors has been huge, as demonstrated by the company’s 2014 profits, which more than tripled to $13.3bn.Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, the largest of the pharmacy benefits managers which negotiate with drug companies, has had Gilead in his sights for more than a year after it refused to offer meaningful discounts.A self-styled scourge of high drug costs, he set out to engineer a price war as soon as AbbVie launched its rival Vikera drug in December. Dr Miller agreed to treat Express Scripts patients exclusively with Vikera in exchange for a hefty, but undisclosed, discount. The market reaction was swift: investors wiped more than $20bn off Gilead’s market value in a single day.Gilead then unveiled its own exclusive deals with many of Express Scripts’ rivals but this month it warned investors it was being forced to offer discounts of almost 50 per cent, a revelation that again sent its shares tumbling and prompted a sharp sell-off of other pharmaceutical stocks.GSK has been another victim of Dr Miller’s emboldened approach to negotiations. The UK group saw a sharp fall in revenues last year after its asthma drug, Advair, was taken off Express Scripts’ list of preferred medicines – effectively removing it from many insurance plans. It regained access this year after offering a discount.“You are going to see a lot more of this,” says Andrew Witty, chief executive of GSK. “I don’t particularly like it because I think patient choice is important but ultimately if a market is going to move in that direction we have to engage with it . . . it is definitely something which has moved dramatically over the past 18 months.”Confronting big pharmaExpress Scripts and its rivals say these skirmishes are only the start of a more confrontational relationship with big pharma. The next battleground is cancer drugs – one of the most profitable areas of the industry, with many treatments priced at more than $100,000 a year.If we take away too much decision-making from physicians, then we start to go down a slippery slope in healthcareYet Dr Miller admits it will be much harder to tame the cost of cancer drugs. In the case of hepatitis C, there was a competing product that also offered an effective cure, but “demonstrating the success of a cancer drug is much more ambiguous”, says Dr Miller. “If you have a tumour shrinkage but it doesn’t prolong survival, is that a good response or not?”Then there are several cancer drugs that do prolong survival, but not by very long, such as Eli Lilly’s Cyramza, which extends the life of patients with lung cancer by less than six weeks at a cost of around $24,000.John Lechleiter, Eli Lilly’s chief executive, dismisses as “hogwash” the idea that incremental improvements are not worth paying for. “If you go back to the mid-1990s, I think median survival times were nine months. But in these increments of one or two months, we’ve got to the point now of 16 or 18 months.”Also under fire are industry tactics that critics say keep drug prices artificially high. In December, Eric Schneiderman, New York’s attorney-general, won a preliminary injunction against Actavis, which prevented it from instigating a so-called “forced switch” on Namenda, its Alzheimer’s drug. Actavis had stopped selling the pill and told doctors to move patients to a newer version, Namenda XR.The patent on the older drug expires in July, at which point it will face competition from generic “copycat” versions, whereas the newer pill is protected
until 2025.“If we start to take away too much decision making from physicians to prescribe what they think their patients need, then we start to go down a slippery slope that is not good for healthcare,” says Brent Saunders, Actavis chief executive, of the injunction.Much of the drug price inflation is down to the structure of the US healthcare system, which lacks the kind of central government negotiator seen in many of the “single-payer” set-ups that are common in Europe. The Food and Drug Administration only has to consider whether a medicine is safe and effective, not whether it is good value for money.That decision is left up to individual insurance companies that have done a poor job of controlling prices – which cynics put down to the fact that higher drug prices are used to justify higher premiums.Medicare, a government programme that funds healthcare coverage for almost 50m, mostly senior, Americans, is banned from negotiating any discounts on drugs.Funding researchPharmaceutical executives say their ability to price drugs in the US according to what the market will bear allows them to cover the considerable cost of finding new, often revolutionary, treatments; the cost of developing and winning approval for a new drug now runs at $2.6bn, according to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, compared with $802m in 2003.If there is one thing that the pharma industry and those who foot the US healthcare bill agree on, it is that the US is paying too much relative to other western countries, especially Europe. With only 4.6 per cent of the world’s population, the US is responsible for 33 per cent of global drug spending.The rest of the world is hardly rushing to pick up a bigger share of the bill. Europe and Japan, faced with ageing populations and big fiscal challenges, are trying to contain rising healthcare costs. Developing economies such as China and Brazil also want to keep a tight lid on drug prices as they expand still-fragile health systems.In India, meanwhile, western drugmakers have faced aggressive patent challenges in an attempt to open their drugs to low-cost competition from local generic rivals.If the US price premium is reduced, it will have to come straight from industry margins. With average gross profit margins of about 67 per cent, critics argue big pharma can afford the hit. But industry executives warn that, with activist investors circling the industry in search of efficiency savings, any dent to earnings would inevitably put pressure on research and development.Such arguments fail to sway Dr Miller, who says the status quo is unsustainable. “The US worker is being gouged to fund innovation for everyone. America can no longer be solely responsible for all of pharma’s profits.”***Treatment: Specialist labs and big data aid focus on pricingHealthcare companies are experimenting with different ways of charging for treatment in an attempt to move ahead of the debate over the rising cost of drugs and therapies.Medtronic, a medical devices company, has started offering to treat patients with cardiac conditions at a single fixed price through its network of so-called “catheterisation laboratories”, where doctors can visualise a patient’s arteries and heart chambers and treat abnormalities.Omar Ishrak, Medtronic chief executive, says the company works out what a cath lab patient is costing the hospital, and then offers “to reduce that by X amount, depending on the situation inside the hospital”.“We commit to that fixed price. Any benefit beyond that we share with the customer in some way. Any underperformance we have to absorb,” says Mr Ishrak.Express Scripts is also using its trove of big data – it has claims records for 85m Americans – to guarantee that those patients deemed less likely to finish a course of treatment still take their medication.“We have predictive models that show us if a patient is going to be adherent to a drug before they even take their first dose,” says Steve Miller, chief medical officer. “If you let us fill the prescription, we will guarantee adherence and will refund the cost of any ‘wasted’ drugs.”Several of the companies that are developing expensive immunotherapy cancer drugs, which encourage a patient’s white blood cells to attack their tumours, are also developing diagnostic tests to ensure the treatment is only given to those who are likely to benefit.That would enable them to charge high prices but cut the overall cost to the healthcare system by reducing wastage.Genentech, for example, has a companion diagnostic test that determines whether a patient has the right “biomarker” to respond to a drug it is developing to treat bladder cancer."
77;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-02-04T00:43:37Z;Gilead to cut price of $1,000-a-day pill;US pharmacy groups had threatened to seek cheaper hepatitis medicine;Gilead warned investors on Tuesday that it would have to offer steep discounts on its controversial $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pill, after US pharmacy groups and insurers threatened to switch to a cheaper alternative.The biotech company said it would have to make a “gross to net adjustment” of 46 per cent on US sales of its Harvoni and Sovaldi pills in 2015, sending its shares down 5.5 per cent in after-hours trading. Most analysts and investors were working on the assumption that Gilead would have to offer discounts of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent.Groups that buy medication for US patients have been demanding bigger concessions after AbbVie launched its rival hepatitis C drug, Vikera Pak, at the end of last year, and the competitive pressure has weighed on Gilead’s share price.Express Scripts, the largest US pharmacy benefits manager, in December announced it would exclusively use AbbVie’s drug, wiping $20bn off Gilead’s market capitalisation in a single day and sparking a broad sell-off in the biotech sector.Since then, Gilead has unveiled its own exclusive deals with groups including CVS/Caremark and UnitedHealth, the largest US health insurer, although it is now clear it had to offer significant price cuts to win the business.Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, described the news as a “shock” because Gilead had been “fairly outspoken about its ability to maintain price due to its differentiated product and strong position with physicians”.Gilead’s once-a-day hepatitis C pills are extremely effective, with success rates of between 94 and 99 per cent, but their cost has sparked an outcry among doctors and health insurers and triggered questioning from senators. A 12-week treatment of Harvoni has a “sticker price” of $94,500 — or $1,125 a pill.AbbVie’s drug is just as effective but it requires the patient to take between three and six pills per day, making it a more cumbersome treatment. Merck has said it will file for approval of an alternative single-pill treatment later this year.If there is this much discounting when there are just two competitors in the market, everyone will be asking what happens when there are three“If there is this much discounting when there are just two competitors in the market, everyone will be asking what happens when there are three,” said Mr Porges.The company said the bigger discounts would be offset by higher volume and that it was “confident a substantially higher number of patients will be treated in 2015”.The discount warning came as Gilead unveiled fourth-quarter results that underlined the huge success of its hepatitis C franchise, which launched in 2013.Excluding one-off items, the company earned $2.43 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $0.47 a year earlier, on revenues of $7.3bn, compared to $3bn a year earlier. Analysts had typically expected $2.22 in earnings per share and revenues of $6.76bn.However, it said it expected product sales in 2015 to be between $26bn and $27bn, less than the $28bn typically forecast by analysts.Gilead said it would pay a maiden quarterly dividend of 43 cents a share starting in the second quarter of this year and announced a new $15bn share buyback programme.
78;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-02-02T05:05:36Z;Big pharmaceuticals groups faces biosimilars challenge;Drugs pipeline improves but report finds biological treatments are beginning to face competition;Global pharmaceuticals companies have seen an improvement in their drugs pipelines but the industry is facing a fresh challenge as the first generation of blockbuster biological drugs begins to face competition.Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly have the strongest late-stage pipelines relative to existing revenues, while AstraZeneca has shown the greatest improvement over the past two years, says a report by credit rating agency Moody’s.However, those same three companies also face the greatest exposure to patent expiries over the next three years, highlighting the perennial battle faced by drugmakers to develop new medicines as old ones lose market exclusivity.Eli Lilly is one of five companies, together with Novo Nordisk, Amgen, Pfizer and Merck & Co to have seen an increase in patent exposure since Moody’s previous study in 2013.Michael Levesque, the report’s author, said this reflected rising competition from biosimilars— drugs that aim to mimic biological medicines at a lower price.Pharmaceuticals companies have been gradually shifting from chemical-based pills to more complex biological therapies derived from living cells. Whereas traditional drugs typically face low-cost generic competition as soon as their patents expire, so-called biologics are much harder to replicate.This has allowed biological products such as Roche’s breast cancer treatment Herceptin to maintain market dominance even after their patents have begun to expire.Mr Levesque said biosimilars were still a long way from threatening the almost overnight collapse in price and market share faced by non-biological drugs when they go off-patent. But he noted they were gradually gaining acceptance from regulators. In December, an expert panel of the US Food and Drug Administration paved the way for the first US biosimilar when it recommended approval for a copy of Amgen’s Neupogen cancer medicine by Novartis of Switzerland.“Companies with strong emphasis on biotech such as Roche and Biogen Idec still have the greatest protection from patent exposure but competition from biosimilars will gradually increase,” he added.Overall, Moody’s study showed a strengthening in outlook for the pharmaceuticals industry in the last two years ago as drug-development pipelines have improved.The FDA last year approved 41 new medicines— the most for 18 years and its second-highest tally on record. One of these was Opdivo, a hotly-anticipated cancer drug whose $4bn of forecast annual peak sales helped secure Bristol-Myers Squibb top spot in Moody’s ranking of pipeline strength.Amgen and Merck & Co were among others of the 16 companies analysed to show pipeline improvement compared with 2013.Mr Levesque said the industry was showing steady rather than dramatic progress, forecasting that operating profits would grow, on average, in the low-single digits over the next three years.In addition to patent exposure, increased pricing pressure was another brake on growth, he said, highlighting the recent push by US insurers to force discounts from Gilead Sciences and AbbVie on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs.
79;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Gilead and AbbVie take hepatitis C battle to Europe;Competition for new drugs will be welcomed by public health systems in Europe;Europe is to become the next battleground between Gilead Sciences and AbbVie in their scramble to win share of the fast-growing market for hepatitis C drugs.The companies have been fighting a high-profile price war in the US over a new generation of blockbuster medicines that can cure most people with the virus within weeks.The pair are preparing to open a new front across the Atlantic after European regulators gave AbbVie’s hepatitis C treatment the green light on Friday.Competition will be welcomed by public-funded European health systems that have been rattled by the high cost of Gilead’s Sovaldi medicine, which is priced at £34,983 for a 12-week course in the UK.Rick Gonzalez, AbbVie chief executive, said the company was “committed to working with local governments and healthcare systems to support broad access” to its treatment.According to the World Health Organisation there are about 15m people infected with hepatitis C in Europe — about one in 50 of the population. The disease leads to potentially life-threatening liver cirrhosis in about a third of cases.It was announced last week that NHS England would delay full-scale introduction of Sovaldi by four months until the end of July to give it more time to prepare. Patient groups saw this as a cost-saving measure.Charles Gore, chief executive of the UK-based Hepatitis C Trust, urged European governments and health providers to use the arrival of AbbVie’s product as an opportunity to push for lower prices and wider access.He said: “Governments should say: ‘give us a better price and we will guarantee higher volumes’. Here we have a life-threatening infectious disease which is suddenly curable in most cases. So let’s find a way to give it to everyone.”The negotiating power of Europe’s single-payer health systems has already secured discounts from Gilead of more than 36 per cent over the US price of Sovaldi and the entry of AbbVie could drive deeper cuts.AbbVie launched its product in the US last month at a price of $83,319 for a 12-week course — just below the price of Sovaldi and sharply less than the $94,500 charged by Gilead for a new Sovaldi-based combination treatment called Harvoni.This has triggered a discounting battle as the pair compete to sell their medicines to rival US health insurance plans.Both companies declined to comment on their European pricing strategy.AbbVie’s treatment was approved on Friday by the European Medicines Agency for use in patients with the genotype 1 form of hepatitis C, which represent 60 per cent of cases.The market for hepatitis C drugs is forecast by Datamonitor Healthcare to increase from $2.9bn in 2013 to $19.2bn in 2016. Of this, the top five European markets — France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK — accounted for $872m in 2013, rising to a forecast $4bn next year.The medicines are replacing old interferon-based treatments that have much lower success rates and more unpleasant side effects.Gilead and AbbVie have sought to justify their high prices by arguing that curing the disease saves money in the long-run by avoiding the higher cost of liver transplants and other care.
80;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-01-11T18:50:41Z;Shire in $5.2bn deal for US biotech NPS;UK group to boost pipeline of standalone speciality drugs;Shire, Britain’s third-largest drugmaker by market value, has made its biggest ever acquisition with a $5.2bn deal for US biotechnology company NPS Pharmaceuticals, as the FTSE 100 group looks to build its pipeline of standalone speciality drugs.The all-cash deal comes just three months after Shire’s proposed $54bn sale to larger US rivalAbbVie collapsed as a consequence of US government efforts to limit the tax advantages of takeovers in which the acquirer uses the transaction to redomicile its tax base outside the US.Shire, which has its headquarters in Dublin, will pay $46 a share for New Jersey-based NPS, a 51 per cent premium to its share price on December 16 when news of Shire’s interest resurfaced. The Financial Times first reported that Shire was considering a takeover of NPS in May, but those plans were sidelined after it emerged that AbbVie was pursuing Shire and were reignited when that deal failed in October.Lossmaking NPS specialises in treatments for rare diseases and has one drug approved in the US, Germany and Sweden to treat Short Bowel Syndrome, a gastrointestinal disorder.NPS has also been seeking approval for a hormone replacement therapy that can be used to treat hypoparathyroidism, a rare disease affecting the endocrine system. The treatment is being reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration with a possible decision this month. Analysts have said that, if approved, it would significantly bolster the value of NPS.Flemming Ornskov, Shire chief executive, said: “Based on what we saw in the regulatory filings and with the correspondence with the FDA, we feel confident that it is a risk worth taking. What was absolutely key for us was to get in as early as possible.”Mr Ornskov added that the deal, which could close before the end of March, would help advance Shire’s strategy of becoming a leading biotechnology company and that it would continue to look at other deals.Shire, which has a market capitalisation of £28.1bn and trails only GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca by value on the UK stock market, will pay for the deal with cash from its balance sheet as well as by tapping two credit facilities worth almost $3bn.Shire received a break fee of $1.6bn from AbbVie when their deal faltered late last year. The move for NPS is the company’s largest on record, topping its $4.2bn takeover of ViroPharma, which also makes rare drugs, in November 2013.Shire received financial advice from Citigroup and Lazard and legal advice from Davis Polk and Slaughter and May. Financial advisers to NPS were Goldman Sachs and Leerink Partners, while Skadden Arps provided legal advice.The deal adds to the deluge of large transactions taking place in the pharmaceuticals sector and is the first major announcement with the annual JPMorgan Chase Healthcare conference starting in San Francisco on Monday.Drugmakers in search of fresh sources of growth have been striking large deals as they face patent expiry on many of their most valuable products. Last month US pharma group Merck & Co agreed the $9.5bn acquisition of Cubist, which develops medicines designed to tackle the spread of drug-resistant “superbugs”. Swiss drug company Roche bought InterMune, which focuses on pulmonary treatments, for $8.3bn in August.
81;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-01-07T13:12:33Z;Pharma takeover battles boost FTSE 100 performance;AstraZeneca and Shire were biggest contributors to index performance over 2014;Two companies at the centre of takeover battles had the biggest positive impact on the performance of the FTSE 100 last year, underlining the importance of renewed deal activity to the London market.The 2.7 per cent fall in the index over 2014, would have been almost half as deep again had it not been for the 1.3 percentage point contribution from pharmaceutical groups AstraZeneca and Shire.AstraZeneca’s share price rose more than one-quarter during the 12 months, hitting a peak in May when the company became the target of a £69.4bn bid from its larger US rival Pfizer.Shire experienced an even steeper rise of almost 60 per cent in its share price, after its board recommended a £32bn cash and shares bid from US group AbbVie in July.It is the first time this century that both the largest positive contributions to the FTSE 100 performance have come from takeover targets.However, neither of these takeovers reached completion. Pfizer abandoned its bid for AstraZeneca in May after the UK group rejected its offer. AbbVie walked away from the speciality pharma group after a US government clampdown on so-called inversion deals involving American companies moving their tax bases overseas.That same tax clampdown has made it less likely that Pfizer will renew its pursuit of AstraZeneca, even though the six-month period when UK takeover rules prevented it returning with a higher offer ended in late November.As the FTSE 100 index is weighted, the largest companies by market value are always most important. This makes it all the more striking that Shire was the second largest contributor last year, as its current market value of just under £28bn is less than half that of larger stocks such as HSBC, BP and Vodafone. It is the first time this century that Shire has been among the largest contributors.It also means that the UK index relies more heavily on the performance of a handful of the biggest groups compared with many indices elsewhere. Despite this, the performance of the FTSE 100 is still widely used as an indicator of how well the British economy or the City is doing.Financial Times analysis of data from the FTSE shows that after two years in which the resurgence of financial stocks has been a feature of the FTSE 100 — being two of the five biggest contributors in 2013 and four of the five in 2012 — not one of the top five contributors was financial last year.Instead, two defensive stocks — British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco — were among the other largest contributors, reflecting investors’ quest for stability and income.The largest negative contributions came from two companies hit by the fall in oil prices — BP and BG Group.Supermarket group Tesco, which suffered a disastrous year, had a negative impact of more than 60bp on the index as its share price dropped more than 40 per cent over the 12 months, hit by profit warnings, management changes and accounting errors.
82;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2015-01-05T23:09:08Z;Gilead hepatitis-C drug wins CVS/Caremark backing;Agreement follows withdrawal of Express Scripts support;One of the largest US pharmacy groups has said it will make a $1,000-a-day pill the exclusive treatment for hepatitis-C sufferers, boosting Gilead, the drug’s maker which recently lost the backing of America’s largest pharmacy benefits manager.CVS/Caremark, the number two pharmacy benefit manager, said that Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni pills would be the preferred treatment for sufferers of the disease, lifting Gilead shares by 2 per cent on Monday.CVS’s larger rival, Express Scripts, last month granted exclusivity to a competing drug made by AbbVie. That move wiped $20bn off Gilead’s market capitalisation in a single day and sparked a broader sell-off in the biotech sector, due to fears that healthcare groups would start forcing down the prices of expensive new drugs.Gilead’s once-a-day hepatitis-C pills are extremely effective, with success rates of between 94 and 99 per cent, but their cost has sparked an outcry among doctors and health insurers and triggered questioning from senators. A 12-week treatment of Harvoni costs $94,500 — or $1,125 a pill.Some pharmacy benefit managers, which manage prescription drug programmes on behalf of insurers, employers and other healthcare providers, had threatened to ditch Gilead’s drug when AbbVie started selling its rival hepatitis-C medicine, Viekira Pak.Express Scripts was the first to follow through last month, when it said it would make Viekira Pak the exclusive treatment for hepatitis-C sufferers among the 25m patients whose employers deal directly with the company. It said it would also encourage representatives of a further 65m patients to switch.Viekira Pak has a success rate of up to 96 per cent and carries a price tag of $83,319 for a 12 week treatment — although Express Scripts secured a big discount in exchange for granting the drug exclusivity.However, Abbvie’s drug requires the patient to take between three and six pills a day, compared to just one for Gilead’s Harvoni, making it a much more cumbersome treatment. Given that many hepatitis-C patients are either vulnerable or ageing, doctors say a complicated regimen could have a negative impact on success rates.A spokesperson for CVS/Caremark said it had decided to make Gilead’s drugs the preferred treatment from Wednesday following “a thorough evaluation of the existing and new hepatitis C therapies”.They added: “Our goal was to create the lowest net-cost solution for the entire population of patients with all genotypes of hepatitis C.”The company did not say what discount it had received from Gilead in exchange for exclusivity.Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said CVS/Caremark’s decision had removed an “overhang for Gilead as it achieves near-guaranteed access to a large [patient] population”. He also said the move reduced concerns that AbbVie would be better able to win significant market share by offering big discounts.Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, said he did not regret doing an exclusive deal with AbbVie. “There would be no discounts if we hadn’t done what we did,” he said.“We found a partner in AbbVie that changed the whole dynamic. Today’s decision from CVS is a natural extension of the good work that we’ve done.”Shares in AbbVie closed 1.9 per cent lower in New York trading.
83;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-12-22T18:47:56Z;Takeover volumes move to highest post-crisis levels;Global M&A volumes rise by almost half to top $3.3tn in 2014;Corporate takeover deals surged to their highest levels since the financial crisis this year, with merger and acquisition volumes rising 47 per cent to $3.34tn globally.In the busiest period since 2007, megadeals returned with a vengeance, as historically low borrowing rates, buoyant capital markets and inflated share prices prompted big transactions with the potential to remake industries — particularly in pharmaceuticals, technology and media.The thirst for deals is expected to pour into the new year, led by the US and UK, where growth prospects are rosier than in other developed economies.Wilhelm Schulz, head of M&A at Citigroup for Europe, Middle East and Africa, said: “A clear theme of this year has been the need for large European companies to make acquisitions outside their main markets. That outbound M&A is likely to persist in 2015.”But by number of deals, Thomson Reuters data show that M&A activity climbed just 5 per cent from a year ago, meaning that midsized and small companies have yet to join in.Henrik Aslaksen, global head of M&A at Deutsche Bank, said: “The large deals are masking subdued growth in M&A activity. The rate of growth of deal activity in the US is likely to normalise next year following a very strong 2014. However, we could see Emea activity pick-up from a comparatively low base.”Three deals this year, including Comcast’s $71bn acquisition of Time Warner Cable and AT&T’s $67.2bn takeover of DirecTV, ranked among the 10 largest of the past decade if debt on the target company’s balance sheet is added.The moves — which are reminiscent of the earlier dotcom days when AOL offered a stunning $164bn in stock for Time Warner — give the acquiring internet and media distributors greater purchasing power and scale.Content makers responded, punctuated by 21st Century Fox’s unsolicited and later abandoned $80bn approach for Time Warner, the parent company of HBO and Warner Brothers film studio.“What we’ve seen this year is not just large strategic deals that changed industry structures, but the speed with which consolidation happened,” said Michael Carr, head of Americas M&A at Goldman Sachs.That differentiates from the pre-crisis period, which was dominated by large buyouts. Advising on nearly $1tn worth of deals, Goldman Sachs ranked first among advisory banks.Energy was the busiest sector in the year to December 17, with oil services company Halliburton pouncing on smaller rival Baker Hughes last month in a $38.5bn deal that is seen as a prelude to further consolidation given the dramatic fall in oil prices. That trend continued last week with Spain’s Repsol acquiring Canada’s Talisman for $8.3bn. On Monday, UK-listed Afren said it had received an approach from Nigerian oil group Seplat.Dealmaking helped the pharmaceuticals industry tackle the boom in biotechnology and the rise of challengers with tax-friendly corporate domiciles — the latter pressuring the US’s Pfizer and AbbVie to unsuccessfully pursue European rivals AstraZeneca and Shire in failed efforts to lower their tax profile.Using its tax-efficient structure, Valeant became a household name with its dogged chase of Botox-maker Allergan, but it could not best a $66bn bid by rival deal-machine Actavis.In many instances, investors blessed these aggressive actions, sending up stocks of acquirers and emboldening boardrooms.
84;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
85;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Healthcare at heart of robust year in M&A;Controversial tax inversion deals carried sector to highest volumes since crisis;"Market wisdom has it that most takeovers destroy value in the long-run. But the world’s largest companies seem to have had little time for history lessons in 2014. In all, there were 96 deals worth more than $5bn completed over the past 12 months. Together, their value was around $1.2tn, or 37 per cent of the overall volume of corporate transactions.In what soon became the best year for dealmaking since the financial crisis — measured on a total volume of $3.34tn — the US led the way, spurred by favourable economic conditions and central bank monetary policy. But Europe and Asia finished the year strongly as well.Dealmaking zeal can also be gauged by the transactions that failed. So-called withdrawn mergers and acquisitions totalled $662bn — up from $285bn last year — in a sign of increased ambition on the part of acquirers.Healthcare, in particular, was a sector of intense activity in terms of deals done and attempted — until the US Treasury took steps in September to curb tax inversions, whereby US companies acquire foreign companies and their favourable tax domiciles.Tax inversions proved one of the year’s most controversial deal drivers. US government action to stop the practice ultimately scuppered the biggest agreed healthcare deal in spectacular fashion: US pharmaceutical company AbbVie dropped its planned $54bn tie-up with the UK’s Shire. That failed deal slowed the momentum behind inversion attempts. Medtronic’s $42bn acquisition of Covidien remains the largest of the tax inversions completed in 2014.“A lot of healthcare announced M&A value was inversion driven but the actual number of completed deals was far less, as a couple of the major deals did not get done,” says Stefan Jentzsch, partner at Perella Weinberg Partners. “It is hard to predict whether healthcare is going to have as big a year in 2015.”Investors, meanwhile, challenged the principle that deals destroyed value. In many cases, acquirers’ share prices soared when deals were announced. Shareholders appear to have grown weary of share buybacks and chose to reward companies using cheap financing to make acquisitions.Global private equity-backed deals accounted for $270bn of the M&A activity in 2014 — an increase of 8 per cent on the previous year but still well below the levels seen before the financial crisis in 2007See belowBut big was not always beautiful. Rising equity markets emboldened activist shareholders and corporate raiders. Many companies were forced to pre-empt or respond to pressure applied by demanding investors.Hewlett-Packard and eBay, two large technology businesses that had lost their edge in recent years, both revealed plans to break up in a matter of a few October days. Global miners BHP Billiton and Vale unveiled plans to spin off assets. Germany’s Eon, one of Europe’s largest electricity companies, also said it would it split into two. “We have seen a marked change in tone during the past few months,” says Colm Donlon, co-head of M&A for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Morgan Stanley. “Our clients are now very focused on portfolio clarity, only wanting to own or keep the best assets, and in moving ahead on larger strategic transactions that had previously been sidelined.”Activists such as Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb and Nelson Peltz persist. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square even listed a public vehicle in Europe to give his funds greater longevity. But attempts to transfer confrontational, US-style activism to Europe have not met with success.Tim Emmerson, partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, puts it down to UK and EU disclosure and insider dealing laws, and the passive culture of European shareholders. “We will definitely see US specialists continue to put effort into it, but the big question of 2015 will be who manages to make it work,” he says.Consolidation remained a core theme. Holcim and Lafarge, two European cement heavyweights, combined to form a powerhouse. Cigarette makers Lorillard and Reynolds, in which British American Tobacco owns a significant minority stake, struck a complicated four-party deal that also involved Imperial Tobacco. US cable giants Comcast and Time Warner Cable, which had been pursued by rival Charter Communications, tied the knot. Charter walked away with some of the deal’s disposals.However, the complexities involved in executing these sorts of deals should not be underestimated, bankers warn. Comcast is still fighting for clearance from regulators. “One takeaway from this year is that very large, industry transforming deals are more complex and take a longer time to execute than is appreciated, so expectations of further consolidations in parts of the consumer space are overstated,” says Alejandro Vicente, head of Emea consumer investment banking at JPMorgan Chase.Some European companies, particularly German groups, sought growth by snapping up US rivals this year. Merck, Siemens and ZF Friedrichshafen found US partners in three deals with values greater than $10bn. But Europe’s economic problems were not such that US companies avoided the region: General Electric acquired France’s industrial national champion Alstom.“Europe has such a large profit pool that, even with weaker economies, the cash flow from the region’s businesses are still stable,” argues Roland Phillips, partner at Centerview Partners. He expects similar interest in 2015.Among the M&A advisers, Goldman Sachs ranked first in both volumes and fees. Boutique investment banks such as Centerview Partners, Lazard, Evercore and London-based Robey Warshaw made outsized splashes.Yoel Zaoui, a former senior Goldman Sachs dealmaker who runs London-based Zaoui & Co with his brother Michael, says boutiques differ in size and focus. “The key is the quality, experience, drive and reputation of the senior people driving them. In that respect, you can have a small business in size that is a very relevant business in the industry.”My year in M&A: top dealmakers reflectNatalie Blyth

With more stability, it will be easier to agree on terms.”One sign of hope for private equity dealmaking next year came in mid-December, when BC Partners won a hotly contested auction for pet food company Petsmart, paying $8.7bn in the largest leveraged buyout of 2014. Dealmakers suggest it was reminiscent of “classic” buyouts, as it involved a business producing steady cash flows, which will generally be easier to lever up with borrowing.However, the big banks active in debt capital markets, including JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, did not take part in the financing for any of the auction bidders. “Tons of banks fell away,” says one banker involved in the transaction.Competition for new deals is expected to be more intense next year, as private equity investors seek uses for their cash. In 2014, they took advantage of favourable debt and stock market conditions to list companies, sell down stakes, and borrow at low rates to pay themselves generous dividends. In doing so, they returned over $500bn to their investors.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Today’s M&A deals add value in most cases / From Scott Moeller"
86;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-12-14T19:10:18Z;Bank traders lose big on AbbVie-Shire bets;Unease over whether banks are skirting a ban on making speculative bets with their own funds;City of London trading desks at several big investment banks lost money after the collapse of AbbVie’s $54bn takeover offer for Shire, raising fresh questions about whether banks are skirting a ban on making speculative bets with their own funds.Banks including Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Barclays and Goldman Sachs suffered losses from holding large positions in Shire stock when AbbVie withdrew its offer for the UK drug company in October, sending Shire shares tumbling in value.While investment banks are permitted under the so-called Volcker rule to hold inventories of shares to sell on to their clients, senior bankers said it was not typical to hold such a large exposure to a single company in a takeover situation solely for market making purposes.Citi lost in the region of $20m, and Credit Suisse about $6m, people familiar with the positions said. The other banks’ losses were unclear.“It is difficult to justify this sort of activity as normal market making,” said one senior investment banker in London. Barclays, Credit Suisse, Citi and Goldman Sachs all declined to comment.Betting on AbbVie’s offer for Shire being completed was one of the largest hedge fund trades of this year. Several of the biggest and most well-resourced hedge funds lost tens of millions of dollars when the deal fell apart amid pressure from the US government over AbbVie’s aim to relocate its tax domicile to the UK.Citi, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Barclays are all large market makers in Shire shares, meaning they regularly hold inventory of the company’s shares.Citi and Goldman Sachs’ corporate finance arms, which are separated from their trading desks by so-called Chinese walls, were also advising Shire on the approach from AbbVie.After investment banks relied on government support during the financial crisis, regulators introduced new rules in the US to prevent them from speculating using their own capital, a practice known as proprietary trading.Many banks have since said they no longer engage in any form of proprietary trading, and have spun off the once-sprawling divisions that used to trade in this way.The Volcker rule, named after former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and which bans banks from proprietary trading, was one of the centrepieces of the US Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers two years earlier.“This is a dirty secret in London,” said one hedge fund manager. “Everyone knows that the trading desks at the banks take positions in these sorts of deals through their market making operations.”Regulators have jousted with banks over where the line is drawn between legitimate market making, in which they buy and sell securities on behalf of clients, and proprietary trading. Banks argue that overly strict regulation would hinder their ability to serve their clients.The final version of the Volcker rule, which was delayed by four years as banks lobbied over its wording, gave market makers a greater amount of flexibility on activities that involve buying and selling shares and bonds on behalf of clients.
87;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-12-01T00:01:55Z;‘Milestone’ in fight against Aids as treatment outpaces infections;Treatment rates for the disease outpace new infections for the first time;The world has passed an important tipping point in the fight against Aids, according to data showing that more people gained access to HIV drugs last year than became infected with the virus.This marks the first time since antiretroviral medicines were introduced 27 years ago that treatment of HIV has expanded at a higher rate than incidence of the virus itself.“We’re not saying the end of Aids is near but we have reached an important milestone where, for the first time, we are getting ahead of the disease,” said Erin Hohlfelder, health policy director for One, the anti-poverty campaign group that highlighted the inflection point in a report to mark Monday’s World Aids Day.In 2013 – the most recent year for which data are available – 2.3m people were added to HIV treatment programmes compared with 2.1m new infections.This marked an improvement from the year before when 1.6m people gained access to medicines for the first time while 2.2m were newly infected.The data highlight the progress made by the multibillion-dollar international effort to curb the spread of HIV, with antiretroviral drugs now reaching 13.6m people around the world.However, this still represents less than half the estimated 35m people living with HIV and Ms Hohlfelder warned there was a long way to go before victory could be declared.“We’ve passed the tipping point globally but not all countries are there yet, and the gains made can easily stall or unravel.”Global funding for anti-HIV programmes reached an all-time high of $19.1bn last year but this is still below the annual $22bn-24bn that the UN says is needed.Ms Hohlfelder said middle-income countries were beginning to contribute more but the three leading donors – the US, France and Britain – were carrying an “unsustainable” share of the burden.“Many donor countries – such as Australia, Japan and some in the Middle East – really haven’t stepped up as much as we’d have liked.”Activists and health officials warn against the risk of complacency in an era when HIV is increasingly viewed in the developed world as a manageable chronic disease because of the potential for people to live an almost normal lifespan on the latest antiretroviral drugs.They say HIV remains one of the gravest health threats across much of the developing world, especially Africa, which has almost 70 per cent of cases.Further rapid gains may be hard to achieve as the virus becomes increasingly concentrated among hard-to-reach groups, such as sex workers and drug users, as well as gay people and youths who may shun testing and treatment.Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS, which leads the global response to HIV, says a big push is needed to meet a target to end the epidemic by 2030.“We have bent the trajectory of the epidemic. Now we have five years to break it for good or risk the epidemic rebounding out of control.”Pharmaceutical companies, once pilloried for keeping HIV drugs out of reach of the poor, have increasingly lent support to the effort by licensing their medicines for generic manufacturers to make on a low-cost basis in the developing world.AbbVie of the US on Monday became the fifth big pharma company to grant a licence for generic production to the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool, following Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Roche and ViiV Healthcare, a joint-venture between GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer.The agreement with AbbVie involves two antiretrovirals formulated for children and helps address a shortage of treatments suitable for the 3.2m children with HIV in the world.AbbVie’s lopinavir and ritonavir drugs will be available to generic producers in 102 countries where 99 per cent of children with HIV live.“This is a crucial licence for paediatric programmes in resource-limited countries,” said Greg Perry, executive director of the Medicines Patent Pool.The deal was welcomed by Aaron Motsoaledi, health minister of South Africa, who said: “Medicines are urgently needed to end the HIV paediatric crisis.”
88;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-10-31T19:06:07Z;Boardroom trades November 1;Latest directors’ deals at Shire, StatPro, SDL and Ocado;Matthew Emmens sold shares in Shire as he stepped down as chairman of the pharmaceutical group in March. The shares went adrift in the subsequent six weeks but bottomed out below £30 in April before news broke of the intended takeover by AbbVie in June. With the deal eventually faltering most of the summer gains were lost this month.Despite the collapse, shares remain above £40, doubling since 2012, having never traded close to that level before the AbbVie approach. This leaves Mr Emmens with a profit on the 38,000 shares he held on to.This week his successor Susan Kilsby indicated that she thinks the price is justified buying on market for the first time. No stranger to corporate acquisitions, she has spent her career in M&A advisory and acquired shares in lieu of her fee on numerous occasions during a three year spell on the board. Monday’s trade, though, was the first time she wrote a cheque. Flemming Ornskov also improved his stake this week as fallout over the collapsed deal continued.Sustained weakness at StatPro presents investors with a buying opportunity according to one broker – and chief executive Justin Wheatley appears to agree. Having spent over £100,000 on shares in the last three years he is out of pocket on all three trades as the stock has fallen 25 per cent since a November 2012 rights issue. With over 11 per cent of the free float Mr Wheatley has more to lose than most and his show of confidence did not stop shares hitting a new five-year low at 70p this month. Mark Adorian joined him in buying on Monday, investing one-third of the sum he put in when shares were at 80p a year ago.Elsewhere in the software sector Mark Lancaster celebrated a 6 per cent improvement in SDL since he invested in August, as the shares bucked a falling market. Last Friday’s trade restored his stake to 1.3m shares, the highest it has been for eight years when he banked substantive gains having founded the group in 1992.Ruth Anderson continued to chase her 2014 losses at Ocado last Thursday investing for the third time this year. At 237p, shares have halved since she bought in March, yet she remains in profit on the majority of her stake having bought during the first two years of her tenure which began in March 2010.Michael TindaleDirectorsdeals.com
89;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Shire and AstraZeneca show standalone strength;"Shire reports record results; AstraZeneca wins backing for new cancer drug";Britain’s number two and three drugmakers burnished their strength as independent companies on Friday when Shire reported record quarterly results and AstraZeneca won backing for an important new cancer drug.Shire’s 60 per cent jump in third-quarter profits came days after the collapse of its proposed £32bn merger with AbbVie, confounding fears that the company might have been distracted during the turbulent past few months.Meanwhile, European regulatory backing for AstraZeneca’s olaparib ovarian cancer medicine promised to increase confidence around the company’s standalone prospects after its rejection of £69.4bn takeover by Pfizer in May.Both companies look increasingly likely to remain independent after moves by President Barack Obama to make it harder for companies such as Pfizer and AbbVie to use foreign acquisitions as a way to lower their US tax burdens.“We are back,” Flemming Ornskov, Shire chief executive, told the Financial Times. “This shows that Shire is a very resilient company with dedicated employees who were able to deliver outstanding results in the midst of a challenging situation.”Mr Ornskov was due to head a new rare disease division for AbbVie had the deal gone through. But he said he had no difficulty refocusing on his existing role, adding: “I love my job”.He said Shire had already banked the $1.6bn break fee paid by AbbVie as a penalty for pulling out of the deal because of the clampdown on so-called inversion deals that involve US companies moving their tax base overseas.The cash injection has fuelled speculation that Shire could go on an acquisition hunt of its own, but Mr Ornskov said he was in no rush to spend the money. “We’ll look at opportunities but it’s not burning a hole in our pocket.”For AstraZeneca, recommendation of olaparib by a committee of the European Medicines Agency marks progress in efforts by Pascal Soriot, chief executive, to revive innovation after patent expiries on several important drugs.The company has forecast annual peak sales of $2bn for olaparib – part of Mr Soriot’s ambitious plan to raise revenues by more than three-quarters over the next decade.Olaparib has become a symbol of the Frenchman’s recovery drive because, soon after taking charge in 2012, he reversed a decision by the previous management to scrap the drug after concluding it had been jettisoned prematurely.Backing from the EMA committee does not guarantee EU approval but regulators usually follow such recommendations.Shares in AstraZeneca closed down less than 1 per cent at £43.27 – still well below the £55-a-share offer from Pfizer rejected in May. Shire shares rose almost 4 per cent to £40.41, compared with the £53.20-a-share deal agreed with AbbVie.Shire – traditionally dependent on treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but increasingly focused on rare diseases – raised its profit forecast for the third time this year after the forecast-beating quarterly results.The London-listed, Dublin-based company said third-quarter revenues rose almost a third to a new high of $1.6bn, compared with analysts’ consensus forecast for $1.5bn. Profits were $717m, or $2.93 a share excluding some exceptional items, compared with expectations of $2.49.While initially resisting AbbVie’s advances in June Mr Ornskov set a target to double annual sales to $10bn by 2020 – a goal he reiterated on Friday while acknowledging it was a “stretch”.
90;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-10-22T10:32:36Z;AbbVie and HP: corporate writing stinks and the CEO is to blame;Standards have fallen and chief executives are responsible for what goes out in their name;"AbbVie, the US drugs company, no longer wants to take over Shire, a UK counterpart. Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie’s chief executive, said: “Although the strategic rationale of combining our two companies remains strong, the agreed upon valuation is no longer supported as a result of the changes to our tax rules.”What an odd grammatical construction: “is no longer supported.”There is a peculiar phrase, too, in the announcement by Hewlett-Packard that it is splitting in two: “HP has reignited its innovation pipeline.” You do not have to think long about pipelines, real or metaphorical, to realise you shouldn’t ignite, let alone reignite, them.The rest of the HP press release is not much better. One half of the split group, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, will deal with storage, software and services. HP Inc, the other half, will deliver “innovations that will empower people to create, interact and inspire like never before”. Actually, it will sell personal computers and printers.HP once had writers who could hold our attention. In 1973, Bill Hewlett, one of the co-founders, wrote: “What is the HP way? I feel that in general terms it is the policies and actions that flow from the belief that men and women want to do a good job, a creative job, and that if they are providedthe proper environment they will do so.”Where (other than Warren Buffett) is the corporate leader today capable of such unadorned elegance? Why has corporate writing fallen so far since the HP founders’ time?One possibility is that bosses no longer have the skill. Two years after Hewlett wrote that, Newsweek published an article entitled “Why Johnny can’t write.” The article said: “Among teenagers, writing performance appears to be deteriorating at the most alarming rate.” National assessments showed that the essays of 13- and 17-year-olds were “awkward, incoherent and disorganised”. Those teenagers are in their 50s now, the age of our corporate leaders. Are we seeing the results of those early failures to learn?I do not think that is the entire answer. Chief executives do not need to be able to write; they just need to be able to hire people who can – and they haven’t completely disappeared.I think there are two other problems. First, much that companies write and put into their chief executives’ mouths fails to convince because it lacks conviction.Why did AbbVie abort the Shire takeover? Because its original aim was an “inversion” – a change to its legal base to lower its US tax rate. The administration has clamped down.Why not just say “in light of the tax changes, we can no longer justify the price” rather than the “valuation is no longer supported”? Because that would be to admit that the “strategic rationale” was not as strong as the company had claimed. The passive voice is often used to put responsibility elsewhere. (Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson, two psychologists, wrote a good book called Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me).)Similarly, the bland statement from Meg Whitman, HP’s chief executive – “Our work during the past three years has significantly strengthened our core businesses to the point where we can more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market” – ignores her previous insistence that the group’s parts were “better together”.Why not say “I’ve changed my mind”? Only Ms Whitman and those close to her can answer that, but you rarely see a corporate statement that admits what every one already knows.In many companies, there are people worrying about the risk of being open – the legal risk, the public relations risk.And this is the second problem with corporate writing: there are so many people involved, all wanting to show they are adding value, and all terrified of screwing up.Press releases have to go to “legal”, to marketing and to “comms” – public relations people both inside and out. I have been at meetings where four outside PR consultants have turned up to support the in-house lot. One speaks, one sums up, two take notes. Later, no doubt, one adds a depleted adjective to the release, another a mutilated metaphor. I imagine no one is happy with the result, but no one can chance unpicking it either.It is time for chief executives to write for themselves, or hire one decent writer, and tell it straight. It might not hurt as much as they think.michael.skapinker@ft.com

91;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-10-20T21:59:54Z;AbbVie hits at Treasury as Shire deal dies;González calls for comprehensive US tax reform as he attacks ‘unprecedented unilateral action’;The head of AbbVie, which last week dropped its support for a $55bn takeover of UK drugmaker Shire, slammed the US Treasury for destroying the deal as both sides took the final step to nullify the transaction.The Treasury’s moves to clamp down on so-called “tax inversion” deals had “reinterpreted longstanding tax principles in a uniquely selective manner designed specifically to destroy the financial benefits of these types of transactions,” an AbbVie statement said.Rick González, chairman and chief executive of the US based pharma company, criticised the “unprecedented unilateral action” by the US government, saying it had created an “environment of risk and uncertainty” that meant proceeding with the deal was not in shareholders’ best interests.The new rules had not resolved the need to reform the country’s “outdated” tax code, which he said was “putting global US-based companies at a disadvantage to foreign competitors in an area of critical importance, specifically investing in the United States.”Mr González, who had earlier hailed the strategic case for the deal and played down the role tax advantages had played, said: “Comprehensive tax reform is essential to create competitiveness and to stimulate investment in the economy.”His comments came as both companies took the formal steps to annul a deal that would have created one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world. The list of failed deals this year has reached a post-2008 record.Shire said in a separate statement that it believed there was no way of completing a deal with AbbVie after the latter changed its recommendation to shareholders, telling them to vote against the deal because the changed US rules had made the deal untenable.Under the rules guiding UK takeovers, Shire formally terminated its deal with AbbVie, which had been conditional to approval from AbbVie’s stockholders.Shire said AbbVie would pay it a $1.64bn break-fee, as agreed when the deal was struck in July. Despite this, AbbVie announced plans for a $5bn share buyback, and said it would increase its dividend to 49 cents from February 2015.The FTSE 100 company said it was well positioned to go ahead with an independent growth strategy.Susan Kilsby, Shire’s chairman, said: “Whilst we are disappointed that the offer will not now complete, we continue to enjoy excellent prospects as we execute our plan to double Shire’s product sales to $10 billion by 2020.”However, Shire lost its interim chief financial officer on Monday to Severn Trent, increasing the upheaval surrounding the drugmaker, where some executives had looked for new jobs in the expectation of the takeover going through.Additional reporting by Andrew Ward
92;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-10-19T16:26:39Z;M&A deal failure at highest since 2008;A total of $573bn worth of deals have been withdrawn so far, compared with $640bn in 2008;The value of deals that fail to complete has reached its highest level since 2008, in the latest sign that the best year for mergers and acquisitions since the financial crisis will also feature a number of high-profile failures.Three large deals collapsed last week, adding to the list of wrecked deals and coinciding with a sharp jump in equity market volatility that sapped confidence in stocks and put a chill on the market for initial public offerings.The biggest blow to dealmaking prospects came as US pharmaceutical group AbbVie unexpectedly dropped its support for a $55bn takeover of UK rival Shire. The sudden U-turn has undermined the prevailing belief among bankers that a US Treasury crackdown on deals that allow US companies to lower their tax obligations by moving abroad would have little impact.So-called tax inversions have featured prominently in this year’s resurgent M&A market accounting for at least a dozen deals. But the chances of Pfizer, the US pharma company, reviving its $120bn pursuit of the UK’s AstraZeneca have been greatly diminished as a result of AbbVie’s decision, several people close to the situation recently told the Financial Times, casting doubt on the year’s biggest withdrawn deal returning.Roy Kabla, head of technology, media and telecoms for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Nomura, said: “The companies getting hit on M&A right now are those doing heavily structured transactions, including tax-driven ones, or large-cap corporates seeking deals on the back of stable, high stock prices.”He said: “A decline in valuations will give private equity or entrepreneurs using the leveraged finance markets a chance to be very competitive again in the M&A market or vis-à-vis the IPO alternative.”Other deals to unravel last week included a $19bn attempt by French telecoms group Iliad to acquire a majority stake in Deutsche Telekom’s US subsidiary T-Mobile and a $27bn merger between fertiliser manufacturersYara International of Norway and CF Industries of the US.A total of $573bn worth of deals have been withdrawn, setting this year up to surpass the $640bn in deals that went uncompleted in 2008, according to Dealogic.Luis Vaz Pinto, deputy head of corporate finance at Société Générale, said the market conditions meant IPO markets were going to cool but that M&A activity should continue. “I don’t think M&A will be that impacted as large corporates are still flush with cash and financial sponsors can take advantage of lower valuations.”Stiletto-shoe maker Jimmy Choo became a rare example of a successful UK listing last week as others either dropped or delayed plans. Meanwhile, five IPOs priced in the US, raising $1.4bn.Bruce Embley, partner at Freshfields, said: “It’s slightly unusual to have an M&A cliff coming without also seeing an adverse impact on equity capital markets. So I wonder if we look back on this moment as an anomaly or whether it is the start of something more volatile.”
93;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-10-17T21:22:43Z;Pfizer’s AstraZeneca pursuit knocked by Shire deal collapse;Collapse of AbbVie’s bid for Shire diminishes chances of revised offer;The chances of Pfizer reviving its pursuit of AstraZeneca have been greatly diminished after the collapse of AbbVie’s £32bn acquisition of Shire, according to several people close to the situation.Pfizer, the biggest US drugmaker, would be free under UK Takeover Panel rules to make a new approach for AstraZeneca from next month when a mandatory cooling-off period ends following its failed £69.4bn bid in May.However, such a move has become much less likely after AbbVie, another US drugmaker, backed away from its deal with UK-listed Shire because of a White House clampdown on foreign takeovers that allow American companies to cut their US tax bills, these people said.Pfizer’s thinking could change after the US midterm elections next month if President Barack Obama – who has led the campaign against so-called tax inversions – loses support in Congress.But AbbVie’s U-turn on Shire has highlighted the increased obstacles facing inversion deals. The Chicago-based company said the new rules had “fundamentally changed” the economics of its proposed acquisition.Pfizer and AbbVie are among more than a dozen American companies that have sought deals this year to shift their tax domicile overseas to escape the 35 per cent US corporate tax rate – the highest in the developed world. Pfizer had hoped to cut its average tax rate from 27 per cent to 21 per cent by buying AstraZeneca and moving to the UK. The Treasury clampdown has made it harder for companies to use inversions to shield offshore cash from US taxes.After rejecting Pfizer’s £55-a-share offer in May, AstraZeneca said £58.50 was the minimum level at which it would have considered entering negotiations. Analysts said the Treasury measures had made it tougher for Pfizer to reach such a price.These analysts said that the chances of a Pfizer approach for Actavis, the Dublin-based generic and speciality drugmaker often touted as an alternative potential target for the US company, had also been reduced.If an inversion is ruled out, Ian Read, Pfizer’s chief executive, will be under pressure to come up with other ways to boost performance after a period of sluggish growth and lacklustre drug development.AstraZeneca faced criticism from some shareholders for rebuffing Pfizer. But people familiar with AstraZeneca’s thinking said the AbbVie-Shire collapse reinforced the company’s concern over the political risks involved in inversions.They pointed out the disruption that would have been caused to its business – particularly its research and development pipeline – if it had agreed a deal with Pfizer only for it subsequently to collapse.Shares in AstraZeneca, which peaked at £48.23 after Pfizer’s approach, have fallen back to £41.96.

The company is entitled to a $1.64bn break-fee should the deal collapse, but senior executives at Shire will miss out on $33m in bonus payments, including a $10m payment to chief executive Flemming Ornskov.Chicago-based AbbVie had previously issued a statement this week saying that it was reconsidering the deal amid the tightening scrutiny of tax inversion deals, through which US companies use a takeover to move their headquarters to Europe to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates.Analysts at Olivetree Securities said the change in recommendation from AbbVie confirmed that the deal was principally driven by its desire to gain tax advantages by acquiring Shire.“There is a throwaway reference to the strategic rationale remaining strong. Presumably, that is a weak defence that such a large deal wasn’t purely transacted for tax purposes, which it now seems clear it was,” Olivetree said of the AbbVie statement.The collapse of the deal, which would have been the largest US takeover of a European group, casts doubt on one of the biggest drivers of dealmaking this year as companies have looked to use foreign takeovers to lower their taxes.Thursday’s statement added that while the withdrawal of the recommendation alone would not cause a lapse of AbbVie’s offer, it would lapse if the company’s shareholders did not adopt the agreement.There have been 14 tax inversion deals so far this year, according to data from Dealogic and Credit Suisse.Additional reporting by Claer Barrett

But as the rally failed, the overall losses became almost as broad, with 83 of the main index’s stocks falling by 1.30pm BST.Hargreaves Lansdown’s senior analyst, Laith Khalaf, pointed out that Thursday’s descent took the main London index into the territory of a technical correction, down 10 per cent from its September peak.“Long term investors should recognise there will be times like these which are uncomfortable, but when the best policy is to grin and bear it,” said Mr Khalaf.“Indeed, they might well see a glimmer of opportunity in current stock prices. The UK market now looks cheaper than it did at the bottom of the bear market in 2003, according to one long term valuation measure.”Spurned merger candidate Shire was the most consistent feature of the list of decliners.The drugmaker’s shares fell 10 per cent to £35.89 after its one-time suitor AbbVie of the US confirmed its change of heart, which came after a White House clampdown on deals designed to reduce the tax burden of American companies.It formally recommended investors reject the £32bn deal that would have represented the biggest US takeover of a European company.Tesco fell 0.2 per cent to 174.5p after a regulatory filing revealed Warren Buffett reduced his stake in the UK’s biggest supermarket group to below 3 per cent.Mr Buffett, the world-famous investor known as the Sage of Omaha, owned 3.97 per cent of Tesco earlier this month when he admitted to CNBC that he had made a “huge mistake” with his investment. Shares in Britain’s biggest retailer have fallen to 11-year lows this month as it has suffered from plunging profits and an accounting scandal.Heavily weighted financial and mining stocks stayed higher on the day, although the extent of their opening gains faded. Chilean copper producer Antofagasta rose 1.4 per cent to 675p. HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank, was 0.8 per cent stronger at 622p.IAG, the parent of British Airways and Iberia, made more of a turnround. Its shares gave up opening gains of more than 2 per cent to fall by 3.4 per cent, as the impetus given to the stock by falling crude prices ebbed amid concern about the potential impact of the spread of the Ebola virus on travel stocks.
96;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-10-15T19:32:04Z;Inversions should not (hop) scotch healthy trend for tax competition;While tax-driven deals are not yet dead, they are pallid and shaky;"We come not to bury tax inversions but to praise them. The news that US drugs group AbbVie of the US may back out of its $54bn takeover of UK-listed rival Shire shows that while tax-driven deals are not yet dead, they are pallid and shaky. However, they have served a political purpose, even if they failed in their financial aim, in highlighting the improbably high taxes to which US corporations are exposed.Flipping their domiciles overseas through share-based takeovers has allowed US groups to cut effective tax rates of almost 30 per cent by up to 10 percentage points. It has also helped them to pay out some of their overseas cash piles to shareholders. AbbVie’s absorption of Shire, a specialist in orphan and hyperactivity drugs, is an important test case of their resolve. One the Chicago-based group looks set to flunk.Pfizer’s £70bn tilt at AstraZeneca of the UK was damaged by resistance from a UK elite that, for all its claims to the contrary, nurtures national champions. Walgreens, which dropped plans to relocate to Europe when buying pharmacies chain Alliance Boots, had a consumer brand to nurture. Neither factor stood in the way of AbbVie’s purchase of footloose Shire.What has disrupted the deal is a political backlash in the US that M&A bankers have persistently and wrongly played down. The Obama administration cannot raise the proportion of foreign ownership needed for a merged business to execute a tax inversion without legislation. But it has been able to clamp down on so-called “hopscotch loans”, through which offshore cash may be channelled tax efficiently to the US.Savvas Neophytou of brokers Panmure Gordon believes that the reform may prompt AbbVie to renegotiate new terms with Shire. But a 25 per cent drop in Shire’s shares this morning shows market hopes of this are low. AbbVie may be liable for a $1.6bn break fee if it tells shareholders to vote against a deal. This beautiful relationship, like so many others, may end acrimoniously in court.The cognitive dissonance gripping observers in the UK, where effective corporate tax rates are about 20 per cent, is the high social charges borne by US business, of which tax inversions are the deformed fruit. This is out of kilter with the country’s deserved pro-business reputation. One receives the same shock on discovering the real name of tough-guy actor John Wayne was “Marion”.The explanation is that the US prefers to tax its citizens more heavily through corporations than it does directly. This is politically convenient but creates an incentive for companies to play skilful games with cash flows – poker rather than hopscotch – to reduce the impact. The process has been fuelled by cynical incentives from job-hungry jurisdictions, such as Ireland, which this week was forced to say it would close its “double Irish” tax loophole.However, tax competition between nations at the level of headline and effective corporate tax rates is entirely healthy. It encourages transparency and checks the ambitions of spendthrift politicians. The duality of tax is that it is both intensely dull and a lively battle front between the state and the individual. Some policy wonks promote the idea of governments agreeing tax rates as a solution to avoidance. This would be an outcome of the inversions imbroglio far less palatable than the collapse of one takeover deal.Upside of the downturnHarbinger O’Doom Lombard’s meltdowns correspondent is back in action after a long furlough.

97;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-10-15T19:00:48Z;AbbVie drops £32bn bombshell on Shire;Panic set in as logic of takeover faced Treasury’s tax inversions crackdown;Only two weeks ago AbbVie’s chief executive, Richard Gonzales, sent a letter to Shire employees saying he was “more energised than ever” about his group’s £32bn takeover of the company.In the wake of a White House crackdown on tax inversions, the memo, entitled “An Inspiring Visit” , was intended to quash doubts over the viability of the deal. Mr Gonzales described the recipients as his “Shire colleagues”, warmly espousing the companies’ “shared traits and values” and “similar cultures”.He said AbbVie had considered buying Shire because it saw “the opportunity to lead and grow in important therapeutic areas”. There was no mention that the deal was a tax inversion that would be funded with some of AbbVie’s $10bn of net cash, a significant portion of which is held offshore and would attract a hefty tax bill if repatriated to the US.While tax-driven deals are not yet dead, they are pallid and shaky, says Jonathan Guthrie.Continue readingOn Tuesday night Mr Gonzales dropped a bombshell. In another message to staff, published shortly after an official statement, the Abbvie chief executive said the board was meeting to decide whether to “withdraw or modify” its support for the deal.It was a remarkable volte-face that lifted the lid on several days of panic at AbbVie, during which time it became clear that the financial logic of the deal had changed in the wake of the crackdown on inversions, which allow a company to dramatically reduce its US tax liabilities by acquiring a company in a lower-tax jurisdiction.People close to the situation said that AbbVie’s understanding of the US Treasury proposals, published late last month, began to evolve in recent days and undermined the financial rationale for a deal with Shire.These people said the concerns specifically related to future actions that the Treasury could take. They pointed to its warnings that it would “continue to examine ways to reduce the tax benefits of inversions, including through additional regulatory guidance as well as by reviewing our tax treaties and other international commitments.”AbbVie’s board will meet soon, when, according to people familiar with the situation, it is likely to remove its recommendation ahead of a shareholder vote. The move has strained relations between the two pharmaceutical companies and their advisers as Shire was caught completely unaware of AbbVie’s decision, other people familiar with the matter said.Large investors in both companies were also surprised by the sudden U-turn, and some were quick to criticise AbbVie. One top investor in Shire described it as “shortsighted response” to political developments in the US. “AbbVie have been aware of the political climate…for a long time, so they should have seen the rules changing.”“It is clearly very unhelpful for holders of Shire shares. Shire is right to insist that the deal should go ahead. This has certainly come as a shock. Shire investors have not been in the loop, although neither it seems has the company.”A top 10 shareholder in AbbVie said “We were not aware that the company was considering this change, but let’s wait and see what happens. AbbVie will have to pay a big break fee, so it is not clear to us that pulling out of this deal is necessarily the right thing to do.”Changes to US rules on tax inversions do not necessarily mean the pharma deal will collapseContinue readingIf AbbVie’s board does not recommend the deal and shareholders vote against it, it will have to pay Shire $1.6bn, the eighth biggest break-fee paid by an acquirer in the last decade.A spokesperson for Paulson, which holds almost five per cent of Shire’s shares, said: “We believe this transaction creates enormous value for AbbVie shareholders. The combination is both strategic and accretive regardless of the tax considerations. As a large Shire shareholder we hope the AbbVie Board reaffirms its commitment to the transaction after its review.”The collapse of the deal contributed to a global market sell-off, with investors dumping shares in companies attempting tax inversions and those perceived to be takeover targets. Covidien of Ireland, which is being bought by Medtronic, shed 4.26 per cent in early New York trading, while AstraZeneca, the UK pharmaceuticals group that was subject to an abortive offer from Pfizer, closed down 3.6 per cent in London.Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think-tank, said the AbbVie move “signals that what the Treasury does matters”. But he said there was an “open question” over whether the moves would protect the US tax base.Companies such as Abbvie could choose try to cut their US tax liabilities by being taken over by overseas groups, Mr Rosenthal said. “The question is does AbbVie now put itself on the block to be acquired by a foreign company,” he said.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson in Washington DC.

People close to the situation said the US group was likely to withdraw its offer.Shire shares suffered their steepest one-day decline in 12 years, falling 22 per cent to £40.12 and wiping out nearly all of their gains over the past four months.John Paulson, whose hedge fund Paulson & Co owns almost 5 per cent of Shire’s shares, was left sitting on paper losses of around £314m following the sell-off. Other large hedge fund holders include Magnetar Financial, Elliott Capital and Pentwater Capital.“This is probably the biggest single-name losing event in the history of event-driven strategies,” said one hedge fund portfolio manager.Shire said on Wednesday that it believed that AbbVie should proceed with the offer and that its board would meet to discuss the development, making a further announcement “in due course”.AbbVie said its decision was made in light of US government actions to clamp down on so-called tax inversion deals, in which a US company uses an acquisition to redomicile and lower its tax obligations.AbbVie’s deal for Shire was the largest agreed tax inversion deal by value and the biggest US acquisition of a European company on record, according to data from Dealogic.But if AbbVie walks away from the deal, it will have to pay Shire a break fee equivalent to 3 per cent of the value of its takeover offer, or $1.64bn. JPMorgan Chase, AbbVie’s sole adviser, also stands to lose out on around $45m in advisory fees, according to Thomson Reuters.JPMorgan declined to comment.AbbVie’s announcement blindsided some of the most savvy and well-connected investors, who had amassed large positions in Shire since the deal was struck in July.Only two weeks ago, AbbVie chief executive Richard Gonzalez told employees he was “more energised than ever about our two companies coming together”.Hedge funds in particular were confident that the US government would not be able to stem the wave of tax inversion deals at least until next year, a view that was widely held among corporate bankers and lawyers.Cold feet or negotiation tactic? No one knows. And the people prepared to guess were 25 per cent wrong about Shire’s price this time yesterday, so their views should be taken with a degree of caution . . .Continue readingShire’s biggest shareholder is BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, but its holdings are likely to be allocated across multiple portfolios rather focused in specific event-driven funds.People familiar with some of the hedge funds’ other holdings said that they also owned shares in AbbVie, which lost 2 per cent to to $52.95 in afternoon New York trading.AbbVie and Shire have been racing to close the transaction by the end of the year as political scrutiny of tax inversion deals has picked up.The US Treasury last month unveiled a series of measures last month designed to erode a principal attraction of inversion deals: the ability of companies to access earnings held offshore without paying US tax. AbbVie has a cash pile of $10.2bn and says a “significant portion” of that is overseas.
99;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;AbbVie and Shire: the tail of the tax tale;Changes to US rules on tax inversions do not necessarily mean the pharma deal will collapse;"One of the more lamentable products launched by the insurance industry is wedding insurance, offering protection if the big day has to be postponed. Regrettably, the cover does not apply if the betrothed have second thoughts. So Shire shareholders should be happy that their board negotiated better protection for the proposed acquisition by AbbVie. The US pharma company has said that in the light of proposed changes to US rules on tax inversions, it could rethink its support for the deal. If it does, a $1.6bn break fee looms.In the context of Wednesday’s heavy drop in Shire’s shares, which wiped £7bn off the market capitalisation, that fee is little solace. But even if the deal collapses, Shire’s shareholders (or at least those not involved in merger arbitrage) need not feel too badly. Their shares are still 62 per cent ahead of where they were a year ago; the company had a decent standalone strategy and all that will have been lost is the (admittedly hefty) bid premium.AbbVie shareholders should have more cause for concern. The company said that there was industrial logic to the combination; that it was not simply a tax-driven deal. But it is tax changes that have prompted the rethink. The tax rationale was not all about lowering the buyer’s tax rate – AbbVie’s average rate over the past five years was 15 per cent, against Shire’s 20 per cent.Rather, it would help the US company to repatriate cash in a more tax-efficient way. AbbVie had $9.6bn of cash at the end of 2013. It is unclear where that cash is, but the split of pre-tax earnings – a $581m loss in the US and a $5.9bn profit overseas – gives some indication of where it makes its money. The US Treasury wants to make it harder for companies to avoid tax on repatriation.That does not mean the deal will collapse. Barclays argues that, even after the US Treasury’s changes, inversions can still work – especially when it comes to accessing future cash generated by overseas subsidiaries.What might really be spooking the AbbVie board is the Treasury’s promise to look for more ways to reduce the tax benefits of inversions. That shows the fundamental weakness of tax-driven deals – government rules dictate how successful the tie-up will be. Where there are cost savings (and there are none here), the companies are in control. Still, if the deal does not makes sense it is better for AbbVie to pull out.

100;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;AbbVie reconsiders $54bn Shire deal;Tie-up could be biggest to be torpedoed by US crackdown on tax inversions;AbbVie, the US pharmaceutical company, has said it is reconsidering its $54bn takeover of UK drugmaker Shire, putting it on track to become the biggest deal to be torpedoed by a White House crackdown on tax inversions.AbbVie said in a statement late on Tuesday that its board would meet next week to reconsider the recommendation it made in July, when it advised shareholders to vote in favour of a deal that would have created one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.The Chicago-based company said: “AbbVie’s board will consider, among other things, the impact of the US Department of Treasury’s proposed unilateral changes to the tax regulations announced on September 22, 2014, including the impact to the fundamental financial benefits of the transaction.” Shire declined to comment.The collapse of the deal, the largest ever US takeover of a European group, would cast doubt on one of the biggest drivers of dealmaking this year as companies have looked to use foreign takeovers to lower their taxes.There have been 14 tax inversion deals so far this year, according to data from Dealogic and Credit Suisse. In these transactions US companies use a takeover to move their domicile to Europe to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates and access offshore cash without having to repatriate it and face US taxes.In a statement early on Wednesday, Shire said it believed that AbbVie should proceed with the offer and that the board will meet to discuss the development, making a further announcement in “due course”. It noted the agreed break fee of $1.64bn.Some of the biggest names in the hedge fund industry will be left nursing big losses if the deal falls through, after they piled into Shire’s shares in anticipation of a transaction.Paulson & Co, the hedge fund manager controlled by John Paulson, owns a 4.7 per cent stake in Shire, according to Bloomberg data, making it the group’s second-largest shareholder. Other well-known hedge funds, including Elliott Capital and Magnetar Financial, are also big investors.US-listed shares of Shire fell 8 per cent to $225 in after-hours trading in New York. AbbVie lost 2.1 per cent to $54.13.The collapse of the deal would also mean that AbbVie would need to pay certain break fees to Shire that were negotiated in the event of the deal’s collapse. AbbVie will pay $500m if shareholders voted against a deal and $1.5bn if it instructed shareholders to block a deal.The action comes as the two sides have been racing to close the transaction by the end of the year as political scrutiny of tax inversion deals has picked up significantly. Less than two weeks ago AbbVie chief executive Richard Gonzalez told employees he was “more energised than ever about our two companies coming together”.If the transaction is cancelled, it would be the biggest casualty so far of the crackdown on tax inversions. Salix, the US pharmaceutical group, scrapped its plans for a $2.7bn inversion deal with Cosmo Pharmaceuticals of Italy this month, blaming the “political environment” for the decision.Bankers and lawyers say that inversions are still possible but that the economic benefits and strategic rationale have to be strong.This week, Steris Corp, the Ohio-based medical equipment maker, agreed a $1.9bn takeover of the UK’s Synergy Healthcare. The deal will allow it to redomicile in Britain and cut its effective tax rate from 31.3 per cent to around 25 per cent by 2016.The US Treasury department unveiled a series of measures last month designed to erode a principal attraction of inversion deals: the ability of companies to access earnings held offshore without paying US tax. AbbVie has a cash pile of $10.2bn and says a “significant portion” is overseas.Asked about the AbbVie announcement on Tuesday night, a US Treasury spokeswoman said the department did not comment on specific deals. But she pointed to a comment from Treasury secretary Jack Lew on the day anti-inversion measures were announced. “For some companies considering deals, today’s action will mean that inversions no longer make economic sense.”
101;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-09-23T21:59:49Z;Curbs on tax inversions fail to convince;;Dissections of a White House plan to curb tax-driven mergers gave way on Tuesday to a realisation that the most significant features of the move were what it left out.The Obama administration’s move , announced late on Monday, would not put a stop to most mergers known as “inversions”, because it left several of their potential benefits in place, said bankers, lawyers and accountants.The two most important are the ability of inverters to access future non-US earnings – as opposed to their existing cash piles – free of US tax, and their ability to take generous tax deductions on loans between different parts of their business.Those benefits will be sized up carefully by companies still considering inversions, such as Pfizer, which was in May rebuffed in a £69.4bn approach for the UK’s AstraZeneca.Several experts who work on structuring such deals said the overall effect of the Treasury’s move would be to create some short-term uncertainty and alter deals’ terms and pricing, as their potential profitability would be trimmed.But once the Treasury-stoked anti-inversion publicity died down, they did not expect many companies contemplating deals to be deterred.Thirteen inversion deals worth $178bn have been announced since the start of 2013, according to Dealogic, including Burger King’s $11.4bn acquisition of the Canadian coffee shop chain Tim Hortons last month, and the $42.9bn takeover of Dublin-based Covidien by Medtronic, the US medical devices maker. President Barack Obama has branded the companies “corporate deserters”.Inversions enable US companies to reduce their US tax bill by shifting their addresses to countries with lower tax rates.What Jack Lew, the Treasury secretary, did unveil were measures to block companies from accessing their existing offshore cash without paying US tax on it – one of the big motivations for doing inversions. According to data compiled for the Financial Times, just three of the companies that have agreed to do inversions – AbbVie, Medtronic and Applied Materials – hold at least $21bn offshore.The Treasury’s move does not apply to deals that have already been completed.The Obama administration has launched measures to curb controversial mergers known as “inversions”, which US companies use to cut their taxes by shifting their addresses overseas.What has been announced?Continue readingWhile the Treasury is limiting access to companies’ accumulated offshore earnings, it is not targeting a potentially larger sum of money: the offshore earnings they will make in years to come. Inverted companies will be able to keep future earnings beyond the reach of US authorities by channelling them into newly created non-US subsidiaries, which have never been linked to a US corporation.“The Treasury has given a fairly narrow response,” says Bret Wells, a law professor at the University of Houston. “They are trying to deal with the legacy earnings and not with the prospective business. The companies consider global growth to be an increasingly important part of their businesses. As they rotate into more global growth, those opportunities will remain unaffected.”The other advantageous technique that the Treasury left alone, for now, is a manoeuvre called “earnings stripping”. It involves companies loading up their US subsidiaries with debt owed to their foreign head offices, because they can deduct the interest payments – which are often substantial – from their US taxable income.The Obama administration promised a second round of measures that could tackle earnings stripping, but it will be tougher to stop because it is deeply embedded in the law, which only Congress can change. “This is a more important problem, but it is so much harder,” says Steve Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think-tank.One Wall Street adviser said: “Clearly, the Treasury didn’t feel they had the legal authority to attack intercompany debt agreements [without Congressional action]. Either that, or they realised that doing so would create huge problems for US companies with global operations.”For the short-term, Treasury’s action creates uncertainty around inversions, which is Treasury’s intent: uncertainty helps stop inversionsDemocrats on Capitol Hill have been pushing for legislation to block inversions but their efforts have so far been resisted by Republicans. This logjam prompted Monday’s move by the Treasury to announce executive action.Most companies engaged in inversion deals or considering them declined to comment on Tuesday or said they were still assessing the measures.The US Chamber of Commerce, the biggest business lobby, called them a “vain attempt to lock corporations into an obsolete tax system”. Its preference is for comprehensive tax reform to lower the US’s 35 per cent corporate rate and end US companies’ obligation to pay tax on their non-US earnings when repatriated.Terry Haines, managing director in Washington at ISI Group, an investment research house, said: “For the short-term, Treasury’s action creates uncertainty around inversions, which is Treasury’s intent: uncertainty helps stop inversions.”The situation will be clouded for longer if companies challenge the Treasury in the courts, either for overstepping its authority or for treating companies that have not yet done an inversion deal differently from those that have already inverted.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi in Frankfurt and Miles Johnson in London

Analysts with Citi note prime borrower credit scores climbed during the quarter and the mix of subprime loans to prime loans declined year over year.Despite caution by subprime lenders, executives told investors on a conference call that they were still “very happy with the finance environment”.“Optics of the comp unit miss will likely pressure CarMax shares today, as we believe many CarMax bears will point to the positive contribution of subprime buyers last year, which continues to wane as a percentage of customers this year,” James Albertine, an analyst with Stifel, said.The Virginia-based car dealer said profits rose 10 per cent to $154.5m, or 70 cents per share. When adjusting for settlement proceeds from a class-action lawsuit, CarMax earned 64 cents per share, short of forecasts.Net revenues increased 11 per cent from a year earlier to $3.6bn, ahead of analyst forecasts. CarMax shares fell 9 per cent to $47.80, leading the laggards on the benchmark S&P 500. Rival AutoNation declined 2 per cent to $48.95.Shares of Carnival Cruise rose as much as 5 per cent before paring gains, as both profits and sales eclipsed forecasts and the company lifted its outlook.The company reported net profits of $1.24bn, or $1.60 a share, in the three months ending August 21, up from $934m a year earlier.Carnival’s performance was boosted by gains in China as well as a near 20 per cent increase in guests travelling routes to the Caribbean. As a result, the operator expects full-year earnings per share to be between $1.84 to $1.88 per share. The company rose 0.4 per cent to $40.51.Pharmaceutical companies broadly weakened on Tuesday after the US government announced a set of rules to crack down on tax inversions.The new rules from the US Treasury would ban the use of certain assets to inflate the size of a foreign merger partner and stop US companies from paying special dividends just before an inversion in order to reduce their own size.Pfizer shares fell 0.5 per cent to $30.05, AstraZeneca declined 5 per cent to $71.13, GlaxoSmithKline dipped 1 per cent to $46.64 and AbbVie slipped 2 per cent to $57.56.Overall, US markets moderated following weakening European manufacturing PMI figures. The S&P 500 declined 0.6 per cent to 1,982.77, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.7 per cent to 17,055.87.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 4,508.69.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
103;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-09-23T11:55:23Z;US Treasury hopes to stand logic of tax inversion deals on head;Hubris combined with weak rules could be key factors;"Taxes may be one of the only two certainties, but tax benefits are very uncertain – as the US Treasury has just demonstrated.By making it harder for US companies to use M&A to shift their addresses overseas and cut their domestic tax bills, President Barack Obama’s administration has rained on the parade of UK companies that have attracted transatlantic interest based on the portability of earnings and cash as well as strategic rationale.While not retrospective (phew!), the measure may affect those that are works in progress and will certainly affect those that are still just on corporate wishlists.So, shares in Shire and AstraZeneca shivered slightly – the first on worries that AbbVie might walk away from its £32bn cash and shares bid; and the second on fears that Pfizer might not now come back with a higher offer than the £69.4bn that failed in May.The Shire transaction looks the safer bet. Its US suitor has been careful to talk about an “excellent strategic fit”. The prospect of coughing up the $500m-and-counting break fee designed for just this eventuality must enhance the attractions of sticking to the deal even if the financial case is not what it was. If any share price should be wobbling it should surely be AbbVie’s.A renewal of Pfizer’s interest in AZ looks less likely. Take account of lower tax benefits, or the higher costs – financial and reputational – of structuring the deal to get around the new rules, and the gap between what Pfizer might be prepared to offer and what the UK pharma group might be ready to accept looks too big.The Treasury’s move will have caused some investors discomfort and losses. Too bad. Transactions sold on tax advantages should be sources of shareholder unease too. Governments can readily change their minds about corporate tax regimes (see above) and, more importantly, companies should be looking to industrial logic and more reliable financial benefits to justify M&A, not depending on tax wheezes to make the numbers stack up.There is honour among retailers, if not among thieves, writes Jonathan Guthrie. Dave Lewis, chief executive of Tesco, appealed to Marks and Spencer boss Marc Bolland to release outgoing finance director Alan Stewart early. Mr Bolland said Yes. So Mr Stewart has stopped sweeping up leaves in his garden and is getting on with cleansing the Augean stable of Tesco’s accounts.The common thread in theories about how Tesco wound up overstating a profits forecast for the half year to August 23 by £250m is that the troubled supermarket chain recognised some income overoptimistically.The problem is the scale of the shortfall in a sector where rivers of cash flood through tills weekly.Malpractice may turn out to be part of the answer. However, accounting standards are sloppy enough to create temptation for a grocer under pressure.For example, IAS18 allows a company to recognise sales when “it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity”. If a supermarket applied that principle to profits as well as revenues, it might book rebates in advance, hubristically believing sales performance would be strong enough to trigger them.A new standard, IFRS 15, starts from 2017. This requires companies to recognise revenue only when performance targets have been met, reflecting convergence with tougher US guidelines. God Bless America. Crazy when it comes to gun laws, sound on so much else.Jimmy Choo is brandishing its “playfully daring spirit” while working to persuade brogue-clad City folk that its shares should be their accessory of choice, writes Kate Burgess. But the £650m to £800m price tag mooted for the footwear group’s first step on to the London Stock Exchange equates to about 13 times this year’s expected earnings before nasties. That doesn’t seem particularly playful or daring for a group whose heels retail at £400 a pair and which earned £47m in 2013.JAB Luxury – part of the Reimann family’s £30bn investment empire – paid about £530m for Jimmy Choo in 2011. Since then the shoe group has expanded to about 120 stores round the world and revenues have risen on average by a fifth a year. Like-for-like growth over the past six months has been a less than impressive 2 per cent, however, and Jimmy Choo must convince investors that this is off trend rather than the start of one.The board says that it will continue to use cash generated to pay down debt and open between 10 and 15 stores annually while reaping the benefits of previous years’ investment. If it can jack up operating margins to 18 per cent as it hints, that surely is daring enough for investors to play with.alison.smith@ft.comTesco: jonathan.guthrie@ft.comJimmy Choo: kate.burgess@ft.com"
104;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-09-04T14:05:14Z;Levinson move highlights Google health ambitions;;The man Google hopes will unlock the secrets of ageing has quit his board seat at Swiss drugs group Roche in a sign of the internet giant’s ambitions for its secretive life sciences venture.Arthur Levinson, who built Genentech into one of the world’s biggest biotech groups before its takeover by Roche in 2009, is leaving because of a potential conflict with his role as chief executive of Google’s Calico start-up. On Wednesday Calico agreed a $1.5bn alliance with AbbVie, a rival of Roche, to develop treatments for age-related diseases.The 64-year-old, who is also chairman of Apple, was appointed by Google last year to head its new biotech venture with a mission to extend healthy lifespan.Although run as a separate company, Calico highlights Google’s push beyond its core internet business into “moonshot” projects aimed at delivering transformative technological breakthroughs, such as self-driving cars.Few details have been revealed about Calico since it was founded a year ago, but Mr Levinson said on Wednesday that the AbbVie deal would “turbocharge” the company’s efforts.He highlighted neurodegeneration and cancer as areas that Calico was focused on – putting the company on a potential collision course with Roche, the world’s biggest maker of cancer medicines.Announcing Mr Levinson’s departure on Thursday, Christoph Franz, Roche chairman, said: “We regret Art’s decision but at the same time understand his reasons.”The potential for conflicts of interest became clear last November when he hired Hal Barron, Roche’s chief medical officer and a former colleague at Genentech, to head research and development at Calico.The tensions were highlighted further on Wednesday when Mr Levinson spelt out his ambitions to work with AbbVie “in the fields of medicine, drug development and molecular biology and genetics”.Under their partnership, Calico and AbbVie will each invest up to $250m, and potentially another $500m each, to “explore the basic biology of ageing and develop new medicines for patients with ageing-related diseases”.This would involve the creation of a “world-class research and development facility in the San Francisco Bay area”, Mr Levinson added.Calico is not the only foray by Google into the world of healthcare. In July, the internet group struck a deal with Novartis of Switzerland to develop “smart” contact lenses that can monitor blood sugar levels in the eyes of diabetics.Other US west coast companies are also showing interest in the science of ageing. In March, Craig Venter, the biotech entrepreneur best known for sequencing the human genome, launched a venture called Human Longevity with similar aims to Calico.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Google will leave us with nothing to do / From Mr Paul Drexler
105;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-08-15T17:51:35Z;IRS to probe Valeant tax returns after Canada deal;;A recently disclosed audit of US tax returns for Valeant, the Canadian pharmaceutical group pursuing a $53bn hostile takeover of Allergan, is part of a two-year inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service, according to people familiar with the situation.A number of individuals, including former senior executives, have raised concerns with the IRS, those people said.The probe has included an examination of Valeant’s tax arrangements following the 2010 merger with Canadian peer Biovail, a so-called “inversion” deal that enabled the former US company to dramatically reduce its tax bill.The investigation comes as political opposition to companies reincorporating overseas has grown, following moves by other pharmaceutical groups to lower their tax payments by buying foreign competitors, for instance the proposed takeover of Shire by US drugmaker AbbVie.Before the 2010 merger, Valeant profits were largely subject to the US federal income tax rate of 35 per cent. Biovail, by comparison, reported an effective tax rate as low as 7 per cent. For the last three years Valeant has paid an effective tax rate of between 3 and 5 per cent, even though around half of the group’s revenues came from the US, which is the world’s largest drug market.The Canadian company was notified by the IRS in the second quarter of this year that it has commenced an audit of the Valeant US consolidated group for its 2011 and 2012 tax years, according to regulatory filings.Valeant said “all standard audits are disclosed in our SEC filings. We are not aware of any other investigations”.A person familiar with the situation said that the difference in Valeant and Biovail’s tax rates may simply reflect the basis on which they were calculated.Historically, Valeant paid little tax, due to the location of a subsidiary Barbados, which owned the group’s intellectual property. A tax treaty allows the transfer of those profits to Canada without further taxation.Biovail’s chief executive was also based in Barbados, to satisfy a concept in international tax law that the appropriate management and control takes place in the jurisdiction where taxes are levied.Biovail was renamed Valeant after the merger, and is run by Michael Pearson, the former US company’s chief executive who is based in New Jersey. A subordinate was appointed to run the Barbados subsidiary until the company’s intellectual property was relocated to Bermuda in 2012, then Luxembourg the following year.
106;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Shire drops on doubt over AbbVie takeover;;All may not be lost for Shire shareholders.The drugmaker dropped 5.1 per cent this week on worries that US moves to curb tax inversions would derail its takeover bid from AbbVie. A key attraction of the deal is that AbbVie could redomicile to avoid US repatriation taxes on its global cash flows.However, tax avoidance is not the only attraction, according to analysts.A meeting with AbbVie’s chief financial officer Bill Chase provided reassurance that the takeover will complete, Credit Suisse told clients. “While he cannot break down the value that AbbVie would obtain from an inversion specifically, the strategic importance of integrating Shire into a more diversified, speciality care NewCo holds more importance than some on the Street currently appreciate,” it said.Buying Shire will give AbbVie greater flexibility to deploy cash trapped outside the US, which is more important to management than using controversial tax-lowering methods such as intercompany debt and interest expense deductions, said Credit Suisse.Currently, AbbVie has a 13 per cent pro forma tax rate and pays 35 per cent to repatriate international cash. So even without redomiciling, AbbVie could still make savings worth about £9 per Shire share just by getting access to the UK group’s cash flow, 70 per cent of which comes from the US, Barclays estimated. “Put another way, for every dollar of expenditure that AbbVie can avoid paying with repatriated cash by utilising Shire’s US cash flows it saves 54 cents,” the broker told clients.Merger cost savings can deliver a further £3.70 per Shire share so even if inversion is impossible, Abbvie’s offer, worth £52.42 on Friday’s prices, looked only marginally too high, Barclays said. Shire ended flat at £46.19, rallying from a session low of £45.00.The FTSE 100 ended at a three-month low, down 0.5 per cent or 30.01 points at 6,567.36. For the week the index was off 1.7 per cent.Among Friday’s gainers, silver miner Fresnillo rose 3.2 per cent to £10.12 on a continued short squeeze following results on Wednesday. Nearly 14 per cent of Fresnillo’s free float is on loan to short sellers, up from around 5 per cent at the start of the year, Markit data show.WPP rose 1.3 per cent to £11.95 after Goldman Sachs added the advertising agency to its conviction buy list with a price target of £15.20. The shares 15 per cent fall in the year to date, sharply underperforming both peers and the wider market, does not reflect strong underlying momentum heading into results due August 26, Goldman said.“WPP has won 12 consecutive months of positive new business with only 30 per cent coming from Publicis and Omnicom,” Goldman said. It also noted recent comments this week from Rocket Fuel, the US digital advertising marketeer, that it had lost market share to the agencies.Insurer Catlin rallied 4.3 per cent to 507p on better than expected interim results, largely from unrealised gains on its investment portfolio. Ahead of the report, investors had been concerned about Catlin’s aviation losses due to its exposure to Libya’s Tripoli Airport, where fighting between militias damaged aircraft.Vodafone eased 2.1 per cent to 191.9p after India began the consultation phase for its next spectrum auction, expected early in 2015. As an incumbent, Vodafone should expect to face aggressive competition to retain the spectrum it needs, said CLSA, which estimated a total auction value of $7.7bn.Dixons Carphone lost 4.9 per cent to 320.4p to lead the mid-cap fallers amid talk that prime brokers were unwinding positions following the merger of the retailers. The loss came in spite of “buy” advice from analysts at Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Barclays.Hyder Consulting jumped 9.5 per cent to 706.5p after Japanese peer Nippon Koei bid 680p per share for the engineering consultant, trumping an earlier agreed offer from Arcadis. Expectations of a bidding war meant the stock was trading well through Nippon Koei’s offer.
107;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Pharma shares slide on fears of ‘tax inversion’ clampdown;;Investors fled global healthcare stocks on Wednesday after the Obama administration threatened action to halt the wave of transatlantic acquisitions by American companies seeking to cut their US tax bills.The sharp fall in several UK, Swiss and Irish companies reflected investor fears that one of the main driving forces behind this year’s surge of cross-border dealmaking in the healthcare sector could be brought to a halt by US political intervention.Shares in Walgreens, the US pharmacy chain, plunged more than 14 per cent after it confirmed it would pass up an opportunity to move its tax home to Switzerland in another sign that political pressure against inversions is beginning to work.Walgreens announced a well-trailed £9bn deal to acquire full control of Switzerland-based Alliance Boots – but without an inversion that could have saved the company billions of dollars in taxes. Gregory Wasson, Walgreens chief executive, told the Financial Times an inversion would likely have faced “intense and maybe prolonged” scrutiny from US tax authorities.The decision followed a warning from the US Treasury on Tuesday that it was “reviewing a broad range of authorities for possible administrative action” to deter companies from using cross-border deals to escape US taxes.Lawmakers in Congress who have led attacks on inversion deals welcomed the decision by Walgreens. But congressional staff said the U-turn did not signal victory in the broader fight against inversions and vowed that work would continue on legislation to curb them.Political attacks on inversions have been building for weeks, with President Barack Obama last month criticising the “corporate deserters” who had “renounced their US citizenship” by moving offshore.On Wednesday, Mr Obama said he did not want the inversions trend to grow. “We don’t want companies who have up until now been playing by the rules suddenly looking over their shoulder and saying … ‘Some of our competitors are gaming the system. We need to do it too’.”Shire, the UK pharmaceuticals company, was the biggest victim of the European sell-off on Wednesday as investors worried that its £32bn takeover by AbbVie of the US could be imperilled. Its stock fell 4 per cent to £46.80, below the £52.48 a share cash and stock offer agreed with AbbVie.AstraZeneca, the UK drugmaker which was the subject of a failed £69.4bn bid from Pfizer in May, was down 3.6 per cent, while Smith & Nephew, the UK medical devices maker considered to be another inversion target, dropped 4.1 per cent.Actelion, the Swiss biotech company, and Alkermes, an Irish-based drugmaker, were both down at least 2.5 per cent.An aide to Ron Wyden, the Democratic chair of the Senate finance committee, said: “Let’s hope this really is a turn in the tide, but I don’t think you’re going to see people here let up. It’s great that one company has decided to do the right thing, but we’re going to push forward to put laws in place to stop companies from abusing this loophole.”Few on Wall Street believe Washington will be able to block the wave of inversion deals already in the works. Worldwide pending or completed inversions are at $139.4bn for the year to date, or about 6.5 per cent of the total M&A market, according to Thomson Reuters.However, some have started warning that tax management should not be allowed to replace strategic thinking.“There is a serious degree of indigestion with inversions and the market wants to move on,” said John Studzinski, global head of Blackstone Advisory Partners. “There is a lot of scrutiny and, with it, reputational risk.”Republicans have so far resisted legislative action, arguing that any move to close the inversion loophole should be part of broader reform to make the US tax system more competitive. At 35 per cent, the US has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the developed world.Orrin Hatch, the senior Republican on the Senate finance committee, said: “Walgreens’ decision is a welcome development, but it is still imperative Congress work together moving forward in order to make our corporate tax system more attractive for US companies.”Stephen Shay, a professor at Harvard Law School and former international tax lawyer at the US Treasury, last week called on the administration to adopt regulations that would “materially reduce” the tax incentives behind inversions. Companies that eroded their US tax bills by lending money to their US subsidiaries could be thwarted by new rules reclassifying their debt as equity, he said.Willard Taylor, adjunct professor at New York University Law School, said it remained highly uncertain whether the US Treasury had the power to take such steps. But he added that any companies pursuing inversions should expect extremely tough scrutiny of their remaining US tax affairs by the Internal Revenue Service.Under its proposed deal with Shire, AbbVie would shift its tax domicile to the UK in a move that would reduce its average tax rate from 22 per cent to 13 per cent.Additional reporting by Vanessa Houlder
108;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
109;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;FTSE 100 bid stocks lead broad losses;;Stocks at the centre of recent bid activity faltered on the FTSE 100 on Wednesday, as jitters spread from news overnight of the collapse of separate US deals worth more than $100bn.Shire, the drugmaker which has agreed to be acquired for £32bn by its US peer AbbVie, fell 3.2 per cent to £47.18 and made the biggest single loss on the main London index. As part of the deal, AbbVie will shift its tax residence to the UK in a move known as tax inversion, which has sparked several other putative mergers and attracted fierce political controversy in the US.The issue has been put back under the spotlight after Walgreen – the US pharmacy chain that is acquiring Boots chemist shops in the UK from their private equity owners – said it would not use the transaction to change its tax domicile from the US.Smith & Nephew, the medical devices maker that has also been at the centre of transatlantic bid speculation, fell 2 per cent to £10.43.AstraZeneca, which was the subject of a failed £69.4bn bid from Pfizer which would have included a tax inversion, fell 1.6 per cent to £42.75.There were broad losses as sentiment across global markets suffered as investors tracked the growing geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine.“As reports of a humanitarian crisis in the east of Ukraine increase, concerns are growing that [Russia’s] President Putin could use these sorts of reports as justification for a military incursion, which would raise the stakes with the EU and the US and this particular crisis to a whole other level,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC.The FTSE 100 fell 0.6 per cent to 6,645.52, a loss of 37 points.Defensive stocks made up the bulk of the leaderboard. Precious metals miners stood out, with Fresnillo up 0.5 per cent at 931½p and Randgold Resources up 0.8 per cent at £50.45. Mobile telecoms provider Vodafone was 1.3 per cent higher at 198.2p and its fixed-line peer BT Group rose 0.5 per cent to 380.1p.
110;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Corporate acquirors take early aim at their target’s investors;;To win investor support for last month’s $53bn takeover of rival drugmaker Shire, AbbVie delivered a blunt message to its target’s shareholders: if you want a deal, speak now or risk us walking away.To stress the importance of their response, AbbVie pointed to the example of AstraZeneca, the UK pharmaceutical company that in May fought off attention from US rival Pfizer – and has faced disgruntled shareholders ever since.Abbvie’s tactic worked. Days later – and with its shareholders voicing support for a deal through the press and directly to its board – Shire agreed to sell itself to AbbVie.The willingness of Shire’s shareholders to speak up so early in a takeover fight highlights a shift in the relationship between companies and their investors. The shareholder passivity that has long allowed companies to keep the rump of serious decision making in the boardroom is ebbing. Increasingly, shareholders want to be part of a wider discussion about what is best for all those invested in the future of a company. The debate has been enlivened by the recent surge in dealmaking and activist investment.At the end of 2013, and with transaction markets still lumbering, the thought of shareholders interposing their own views on to any M&A decision-making process was not one stirring many company directors from sleep.One example where it did happen was Charter Communications’ $61bn unsolicited – and, ultimately, unsuccessful– offer for Time Warner Cable. The two US cable companies had been jousting for a full seven months when T Rowe Price, a top 20 shareholder in TWC, wrote to its board urging it to engage with its suitor. Even so, the decision to communicate its views directly marked T Rowe out as a dissenter in an otherwise largely submissive pool of shareholders.This year the game has changed: with M&A at healthy levels, shareholders – and their opinions – have gone from sitting on the sidelines to centre stage in transactions on both sides of the Atlantic.The question is why has their role changed?One explanation lies with exchange traded funds. Holding less than 3 per cent of the market value of the US’s 500 largest public companies five years ago, ETFs represent about 7 per cent of that shareholder base today. The increase has coincided with a rich run for funds that passively track the stock market – the S&P 500 has risen almost 50 per cent in the past three years. The remainder of publicly traded stock is mostly held by asset managers, such as BlackRock and T Rowe Price. They, too, have reaped the fruits of the flourishing market.But a big difference between ETFs and asset managers lies in the fees they charge.On average, ETFs charge investors an annual fee of 0.47 per cent, whereas asset managers ask for 1.24 per cent, according to data from Thomson Reuters.To justify those higher fees, asset managers cannot passively hold the same stocks as the ETFs. Instead, they are having to push the companies whose stock they hold to make better decisions.Jim Woolery, head of the Shareholder-Director Exchange, a working group that hopes to foster better discussion between boards and shareholders, says passivity among asset managers is a thing of the past.“There has been a tectonic and permanent shift in the American shareholder base that is creating an economic pressure for asset managers to be more thoughtful and more vocal about how the companies they invest in should be run,” said Mr Woolery, who is also chairman-elect of Wall Street law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.Companies, for their part, seem increasingly willing to listen – and with good reason. Activist investing and hostile takeover attempts, both of which have soared this year, prosper when companies and their investors are out of sync.“The practice of using investor relations or other arm’s length methods for speaking to your largest shareholders is fading fast,” says John Studzinski, global head of Blackstone Advisory Partners. “Chief executives and directors are realising that they have to be out there themselves, understanding and addressing the key concerns of shareholders. It is morphing from something that happens in a crisis towards being accepted best practice.”An obvious benefit of these pre-event conversations is in learning the right balance between the competing interests of different investor groups.As news of deals reach the market, short-term investors known as merger arbitrageurs often pile into the shares of the target company, betting on the likelihood of a deal closing. Arbs are typically more vocal than traditional long-term investors which can put disproportionate pressure on boards and influence other shareholders to enact decisions that run counter to what the board sees as being in the best interests of the company.To defend against this, companies can redefine the rules that govern the rights of their shareholders.In July, the board of Time Warner, the television and film company (unconnected to Time Warner Cable), changed its bylaws to block its own investors from forcing it into a $73bn takeover by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox. In a move that reflects that changing pace and degree of shareholder involvement – and the expectation of it – Time Warner waited just five days after Mr Murdoch’s public approach before rewriting its rule book.It was, according to advocates of shareholder-director dialogue, an indelicate solution to an unnecessary problem. Their hope is that the increasing tendency of investors to voice their opinions, and of companies to listen, will lead to decisions that better address the interests of those stakeholders beyond the boardroom.
111;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-08-03T05:55:45Z;Doomsayers distrust ‘sexy part of the market’;Corporate mergers and acquisitions are back with a vengeance;"The lawyers and investment bankers are in clover. Corporate mergers and acquisitions are back with a vengeance, and the fees for advising on deals are rolling in.The list of companies involved gets longer almost every day and now spans almost all sectors of the market: Rupert Murdoch’s Fox is hunting fellow media behemoth Time Warner; US biotech AbbVie is buying Shire Pharmaceuticals of the UK; and there is even a revival of M&A in banking, courtesy of former Merrill Lynch boss John Thain, whose CIT Group has agreed to buy OneWest.Little wonder that Ken Jacobs, chief executive of Lazard, the M&A adviser, boasted to the Financial Times that his business was in the “ sexy part of the market” right now.The elevated levels of activity, and the evidence that we are just at the start of an M&A cycle, pose the question of whether investors are prepared. It seems many are not. Fixed income investors, in particular, find themselves in double jeopardy. Nervous equity investors may have underestimated the solidity of the current market.Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest investment manager, says M&A activity underpins equity market valuations. “It is creating a scarcity,” he told me last month.With cheap financing available in the debt markets, companies are funding their acquisitions in large measure with cash, which leaves investors in the acquired company hunting around for something to do with the money.Meanwhile, the joyless manner in which equities have reached record territory is in sharp contrast with the euphoria that usually characterises the top of a bull market. This suggests we are not at the top. Doomsayers see bubbles everywhere, yet stock market valuations remain within the range of average on all but a few fashionable metrics such as Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio.The upswing in M&A activity ought to be an answer to the naysayers. It reflects one factor that is supportive of equity valuations above all: confidence. The more-benign economic environment on both sides of the Atlantic has given executives and boards enough confidence to make bold strategic moves.What began last summer in the US has begun to pick up in Europe since the start of this year, Mr Jacobs said. “M&A cycles are funny,” he told Lazard investors on a conference call. “They never happen gradually. This year we have seen a slew of larger transactions, and that kind of jump is what is associated with the beginning of a cycle.”The value of worldwide M&A activity was $1.8tn in the first six months of the year, according to Dealogic, the data provider. This was up 73 per cent on the same period last year and showed no sign of slowing down in July.Inevitably there are investment losers, however, and Mr Fink’s comments hint at who it might be. The financing available to companies is indeed cheap. More so, in fact, than ever. Perhaps it is too cheap.According to the Barclays Aggregate index, fixed income investors are now getting yields of less than 3 per cent on a typical US investment-grade corporate bond, and barely 100 basic points of yield over and above risk-free Treasury rates. That is great for borrowers, but bond investors may come to rue not having built in any cushion for increased credit risk.On the one hand, the low rates and spreads are explicable. Good-quality corporate bonds, which have very little default risk, trade more in step with Treasuries, where yields have also fallen. An improving economy should improve corporate credit quality across the board, too.Yet companies have already been tempted to borrow to fund share buybacks over the past few years, and cash piles that were built up in many corporate treasuries after the shock of the credit crisis are being whittled down. M&A provides another justification for levering up, taking on extra debt to pursue a deal, eroding a company’s creditworthiness in the process.DoubleLine, the fixed income specialist based in Los Angeles, decided near the end of last month that investors were no longer being appropriately compensated for the risks and cut its exposure to investment-grade corporate bonds. The investment committee specifically cited “M&A risk” in its decision, according to people who were there.One might add the risk that interest rates start to rise to reflect the strengthening economy and the strengthening business confidence that ought to make it sustainable. Corporate bonds would do poorly in a rising interest rate environment, too.Doomsayers paint the M&A boom as a desperate attempt by companies to buy growth that is not being generated organically in a permanently stalled economy, and the last dollop of froth on the top of an equity market that is well into bubble territory. This is a stretch. More probably it reflects the healthy return of confidence after a long period of trauma, and a natural development in the business cycle. If so, equity investors will be in clover for a while too."
112;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-07-31T17:30:41Z;Drug pricing: Bitter pill;A hepatitis treatment’s soaring price is prompting the debate that most alarms the industry;"When delegates turned up for a big healthcare conference at New York’s plush Waldorf Astoria hotel in February, they were met by placard-wielding activists.That in itself was not unusual. Big pharma has long been the subject of angry campaigns over issues such as animal testing and access to Aids drugs in Africa.Yet the focus of these protesters was something different: the high cost of a new hepatitis medicine in the US.This small-scale insurrection on a Manhattan sidewalk has since turned in­to something approaching a national rebellion against Gilead Sciences and its drug known as Sovaldi, which costs $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment. Scrutiny increased further last week when the California-based biotech company announced that sales of the medicine had reached $5.7bn after six months on the market, making it the most successful drug launch on record.But while investors were celebrating – Gilead’s share price is up 50 per cent in the past year – many in the industry were nervously monitoring the growing political debate over drug pricing that Sovaldi has triggered.Last month two senior members of the US Senate finance committee wrote to John Martin, Gilead’s chief executive, asking him to justify Sovaldi’s price and expressing “serious concerns about the extent to which the market for this drug is operating efficiently and rationally”.Such an intervention is unusual in the US, which, alone among big developed economies, has no government powers to regulate pharmaceutical pricing. The letter from Ron Wyden, Democratic chairman of the Senate finance committee, and Charles Grassley, a Republican, has raised questions over whether this laisser-faire approach could be destined to change.After a slowdown since the financial crisis, US healthcare costs have started to rise again. At about 17 per cent of gross domestic product, they are the highest in the developed world. Pharmaceuticals account for only one in every $10 spent on health but they are among the most visible to patients because of the steep co-payments demanded by insurers.President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms have increased incentives for healthcare providers to control costs as insurance coverage is widened. But Sovaldi has shown that, when a new medicine arrives with high demand and no competition, there is little to stop drugmakers charging what they wish.“Other countries have come up with frameworks to make drugs affordable for people whereas in the US it has always been a case of what the market will bear,” says Steve Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts, one of America’s biggest prescription management companies. “We think the market is no longer bearing up.”For the pharmaceuticals industry, there is nothing that causes greater anxiety than the idea that its cherished pricing freedom in the US could be imperilled. Annual US per-capita spending on pharmaceuticals is $1,010, more than double the $498 average among members of the OECD.This high US spending underpins the economics of the global pharmaceuticals industry. More than half of all sales from new drugs launched between 2009 and 2013 were made in the US, compared with 23 per cent in Europe.Seldom has the international disparity in drug pricing been starker than in the case of Sovaldi, a drug hailed as the biggest breakthrough in hepatitis C treatment since the virus was discovered in 1989. In more than nine out of 10 cases, the treatment will lead to complete cure within 12 weeks.Gilead agreed to sell the drug in Egypt, the country with the world’s highest prevalence of hepatitis C, at a 99 per cent discount to the US price. The move was aimed at heading off the kind of controversy faced by drugmakers in the 1990s when the industry was accused of keeping HIV medicines out of reach of poor Africans.However, while few would begrudge efforts to make the medicine more affordable in the developing world, many Americans have been asking why, if Gilead can afford to price Sovaldi at $11-a-pill in Egypt, does it charge $1,000 in the US.“The answer is because it can,” says Dr Miller, one of Gilead’s fiercest critics. “Sovaldi has shone a light on the fact America is subsidising healthcare innovation for the rest of the world.”US drug prices are high because, unlike in most other countries, the government does not use its purchasing power to contain them. There is nothing like the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), for example, which acts as a gatekeeper for new medicines.Before a treatment is recommended for use in Britain’s National Health Service, its manufacturer must convince Nice that the product represents value for money.The result is that fewer new drugs are adopted in the UK and those that are command a lower price than in the US. Gilead, for example, has priced Sovaldi at a 30 per cent discount to its US price in Britain. Yet even that has not been enough to convince Nice of its clinical value. The agency told Gilead in June to come back with more data to support its case for the drug. France, too, is playing hardball.To many in the US, the notion of government rationing drugs and regulating prices is wholly un-American. Republicans have long characterised Nice as a “death panel” that epitomises all that is wrong about European socialised healthcare. A study sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry lobby group, in July showed that almost 80 per cent of cancer drugs reviewed by Nice in the past seven years have had some type of restriction placed on access. This, said the lobby group, could explain why the average five-year survival rate for US breast cancer patients is higher, at 90 per cent, than the UK’s 78 per cent.Yet the fact that the US industry issues warnings against “centralised, one-size-fits-all value assessments” across the Atlantic exposes its concern that such concepts could be gaining ground in the US.Nobody expects a US equivalent of Nice or anything similar to be adopted in the foreseeable future. Political resistance is too strong and the health system too fragmented and privatised. However, there are increasing signs that politicians and health officials are taking a harder look at how to rein in rising costs.“We can’t ignore the elephant in the room,” says Karen Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, which represents health insurers. “The Sovaldi case brings all these issues together in a very stark way: How much is too much? Can this price be sustained? What happens if it blows up your budget? This is a debate we’re just on the cusp of having in our society.”Sovaldi is not the most expensive drug on the market. What sets it apart is the size of the patient population it aims to treat. There are an estimated 3.2m people in the US infected with hepatitis C, four times more than the number with HIV.So far 70,000 patients have been prescribed Sovaldi but its impact is being felt throughout the healthcare system. WellPoint, one of the biggest US health insurers, for example, spent $50m on hepatitis C treatment in the first quarter – as much as the whole of last year. State governments warn that their social healthcare budgets risk being crippled. Louisiana would have to spend more than its entire transportation budget if everyone who was eligible was treated with Sovaldi, says Express Scripts.While Sovaldi may be an exceptional case, there is a growing number of expensive speciality medicines emerging from laboratories that collectively promise to put further stress on budgets. As mass-
market blockbusters, such as statins and beta-blockers, have gradually lost patent protection, many drugmakers have refocused on speciality treatments. These are often cutting-edge biological drugs that draw on breakthroughs in genomic science over the past decade to target rare diseases and subtypes of more common conditions, such as cancer. In order to recoup high development costs from relatively small patient groups, prices tend to be very high. Take, for example, a cystic-fibrosis drug, called Kalydeco, made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which costs $300,000 a year.Increased spending on speciality medicines explains why the average price of branded medicines in the US has almost doubled since 2008, according to Express Scripts. The overall drugs bill has been growing more slowly because of the falling price of generic medicines, which represent 86 per cent of all US prescriptions.However, rising use of speciality products is expected to create more upward pressure in future. While they account for less than 1 per cent of total prescriptions, they drain more than a quarter of pharmacy spending.Gilead and other drugmakers argue that their prices are justified both by the need to provide a return on investment in research and development and by their long-term value to patients. John Castellani, president of the PhRMA, says that, by curing hepatitis C, Sovaldi has the potential to save the US healthcare system $9bn a year in the long run by reducing hospitalisations from the liver disease that often results from the virus.“It is penny wise and pound-foolish to focus solely on the price of a new medicine while completely ignoring the value it provides to patients and the healthcare system broadly,” says Mr Castellani. A broader debate is needed, he adds, about “outdated” insurance models that force patients to pay an ever-growing share of prescription drug costs while shielding them from the typical $5,000-a-day cost of hospitalisation.However, industry leaders accept that they have a role to play in bringing healthcare costs under control. It has become almost obligatory for pharma executives to espouse a shift towards more “value-based” pricing models that reward drugmakers based on measurable health outcomes. This is code for acknowledging that the era of overpriced “me too” drugs is drawing to a close, while making clear the industry expects to be rewarded for true innovation.“If you are not number one or two to market or you do not have a demonstrable clinical advantage over rival products you are going to be up against it,” says Daniel Hoffman, president of Pharmaceutical Business Research Associates, a consultancy.This trend is already visible in the most competitive parts of the market. GlaxoSmithKline, the UK drugmaker, last week issued a profits warning in large part because of increased pricing pressure on respiratory drugs in the US. Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive, said several factors, including consolidation within primary care networks, were eroding pricing power. The Obama administration’s Affordable Care Act had “added some fuel to this fire” by making the whole system more cost-conscious, he added.The question is whether such pressures will influence pricing of high-margin speciality drugs such as Sovaldi. A big test will come in the months ahead when AbbVie and
Bristol-Myers Squibb are expected to launch rival hepatitis C medicines. If they significantly lower prices, the controversy may be quickly forgotten and the primacy of market forces in the US healthcare system reasserted. If not, calls for some form of government intervention are likely to grow. “It will tell us,” says Mr Hoffman, “whether this is a competitive market or a cartel.”Innovation: A young company reshaping the industryCritics have cast Gilead Sciences’ $1,000-a-day pricing of its Sovaldi hepatitis C medicine as an example of drug industry greed at its worst, writes Andrew Ward. To others, it shows how market forces are the only reliable way to drive medical innovation. Founded in 1987 by a 29-year-old medical doctor with a Harvard MBA, Gilead is among a new generation of young US biotech companies that are reshaping the pharmaceuticals industry.It is already bigger by market capitalisation, at $143bn, than some traditional pharma mainstays, including GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca.This reflects the phenomenal success of Sovaldi, on top of breakthrough treatments for HIV and flu. Sovaldi is on course to generate more than $10bn of sales in its first year on the market. The medicine is the first of a new category of hepatitis C drugs that treat the virus more effectively, more quickly and with fewer side effects than previous therapies.While Sovaldi shows how much of the best drug innovation comes from biotech companies rather than traditional big pharma, Gilead’s own scientists cannot claim credit. The medicine was acquired in 2011 through an $11bn acquisition of Pharmasset, founded by Sovaldi’s inventor, Egyptian-born Raymond Schinazi. The speed with which Gilead has started to recover that investment is cited by critics as evidence that its drug is overpriced.Addressing investors last week, John Milligan, the company’s chief operating officer, said the full value of Sovaldi was only now becoming clear. Patients who previously had faced up to a year of treatment with nasty side effects and patchy success rates are now cured within 12 weeks in most cases.“I don’t think anybody disagrees with the fact that Sovaldi is a remarkable drug,” he said. “It’s an outlier because we are curing people of a horrible disease in a very rapid timeframe, and that’s a very unusual thing for payers to think about.”Gilead’s success has intensified the race among rivals to catch up. AbbVie and Bristol-Myers Squibb are nearing market with similar drugs, and in June Merck & Co paid $3.85bn to buy Idenix, a hepatitis C specialist, to strengthen its position."
113;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-07-29T17:01:20Z;Windstream soars on Reit spin-off plan;;The US telecoms sector climbed on Tuesday after a small wireline network announced plans to spin off part of its business into a real estate investment trust, establishing a new way for rivals to derive value from assets.Windstream, based in Little Rock, Arkansas, said it would turn its existing fibre and copper network, as well as other fixed real estate assets, into a publicly traded Reit, allowing the new company to avoid federal income taxes.The approach has been tried by cellular tower operators like American Tower, but not by a larger cable or fibre optic network owner.Windstream said its board of directors had received a favourable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, although it will still require regulatory approval.“Given the IRS approval, we expect other companies may explore the possibility of spinning off their wireline assets into a similar structure,” Mike McCormack, an analyst with Jefferies, said.Analysts with Credit Suisse said AT&T and Verizon were likely evaluating a similar strategy, but would “have the advantage of waiting to see how the Windstream transition plays out”.The conversion to a Reit comes as many companies, particularly those in the pharmaceutical sector, evaluate means to reduce taxes. Several, including AbbVie, are hoping to redomicile overseas to reduce their tax bill.The news sent shares of S&P 500 listed telecom operators broadly higher. Windstream soared 12 per cent to $11.83, AT&T rose 3 per cent to $36.59, Verizon advanced 1 per cent to $51.97 and Telephone & Data Systems increased 5 per cent to $25.92.UPS was under pressure after the company, which together with FedEx and Deutsche Post’s DHL dominates the business of shipping parcels around the world, cut its profit forecast for the year as it invests in its business.The company said it would expand operations on the day after Thanksgiving in the US as part of a $175m increase in operating expenses. UPS executives hope to avoid a surge in demand last year that left it incapable of meeting delivery targets.Earnings per share will now be between $4.90 and $5.00 this year, UPS said, compared to a previous forecast of $5.05 to $5.30 a share.Shares of UPS are among the worst performing on the Dow Jones transport index this year. The company declined 4 per cent on Tuesday to $98.86 while rival FedEx dropped 2 per cent to $147.14.A 17 per cent slide in second-quarter profits and tepid third-quarter earnings guidance from Herbalife sent its shares 14 per cent lower to $58.35.Net income at the nutrition supplement company declined to $120m, or $1.31 per share, shy of Wall Street expectations. Sales climbed 7 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn.Herbalife has sought to keep shareholders on board amid its battle with Mr Ackman, the founder of the Pershing Square hedge fund who claims the company is a pyramid scheme.The company, which denies Mr Ackman’s allegations, accelerated its $1.5bn share buyback plan earlier this year.Both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have launched a probe into the allegations.Darden shares rose 4 per cent to $46.88 after the company said Clarence Otis, who has served as Darden’s chief executive for nearly a decade, would step down at the end of the year amid an ongoing tussle with activist investor Starboard Value.The shake-up within Darden’s executive suite came as the company entered settlement discussions with Starboard regarding the firm’s proxy contest.Darden, which owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, said it would trim the list of nominees to its board of directors to ensure at least three Starboard nominees are elected at the company’s annual general meeting in September.Overall, US equity markets trended lower despite rising consumer confidence figures. The S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent to 1,969.95 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 16,912.11.

114;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-07-27T20:00:33Z;Hepatitis C researchers battle to ‘nuke’ the competition;Search for improved therapies intensifies;Idenix has fewer than 100 employees and no products on the market. So what was it that persuaded Merck to pay $3.85bn – more than triple Idenix’s market capitalisation before the deal – to buy the Boston-based biotech company in June?The answers lay in Idenix’s portfolio of experimental treatments for hepatitis C, widening Merck’s arsenal in the battle for supremacy over one of the hottest areas of drug development.Little doubt exists over who leads the race. Gilead Sciences’ Sovaldi medicine had sales of $5.8bn in its in its first six months on the market this year, a record for a drug launch.Gilead’s success has encouraged a cluster of other companies to step up their pursuit of therapies for a condition affecting 150m people worldwide. Analysts say the market could be worth up to $20bn a year by the decade’s end.Along with Merck, others in the chasing pack include AbbVie, Achillion, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Johnson & Johnson. While the burst of innovation around hepatitis C has stoked debate over pricing because of the $1,000-a-day cost of Sovaldi, it is an example of strong commercial incentives driving medical breakthroughs.The rush of new drugs promises to transform treatment of a disease for which previous therapies had low success rates and unpleasant side effects.“The development of direct-acting antiviral agents has revolutionised hepatitis C treatment by offering genuine prospects for the first comprehensive cure of a chronic viral infection in humans,” say Harvard liver specialists Raymond Chung and Thomas Baumert in the New England Journal of Medicine. “It may now be possible to imagine the global eradication of chronic hepatitis C.”Previously, patients faced up to a year of medication on a pill called ribavirin and injections of interferon, which boost the immune response to hepatitis C but cause flu-like symptoms.Direct-acting antiviral agents offer prospects for comprehensive cureMany people failed to complete the course. Even for those who did, the success rate was less than half in cases involving genotype one – the hardest-to-treat form of the disease – and no more than 80 per cent for other genotypes.A step forward came from 2011 with the new so-called protease inhibitors from Merck, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and, more recently, Janssen, part of Johnson & Johnson. These drugs, taken in combination with ribavirin and interferon, nudged cure rates up significantly but the nasty side effects remained.The big breakthrough came in December with the US regulatory approval of Sovaldi. The outcome was treatment time down to as little as 12 weeks with success rates of above 90 per cent – even for those with genotype one. Sovaldi, also known as sofosbuvir, is the first of a generation of hepatitis C drugs called nucleotide analogue inhibitors, or “nukes”.Gilead’s medicine still leaves room for improvement, however, because many patients must still take it together with interferon. The race is on to develop the first “nuke” that eliminates the need for injections and older drugs altogether.Analysts say Gilead remains in the lead, with the US Food and Drug Administration expected to rule by October on its application for a once-a-day, all-oral pill combining Sovaldi with another new medicine called ledipasvir.Others are scrambling to catch-up. AbbVie, for example, filed in April for FDA approval of an interferon-free combination, including an experimental “nuke” that cured more than 90 per cent of patients in trials. Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb have revealed some strong trial data this year.Many doctors, meanwhile, have ditched interferon by prescribing Sovaldi with Janssen’s Olysio protease inhibitor, even though the combination is not officially approved by the FDA.“If you have to have Hepatitis C, now is the time to have it,” says Douglas Dieterich, a liver specialist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.“We have these marvellous drugs we can treat you with right now, without side effects,” he adds. “And this time next year, we’ll have another round of drugs available.”The revolution in hepatitis C drugs has not been without setbacks and controversy. In addition to the political furore over pricing, Sovaldi is the subject of several patent disputes. AbbVie and Merck are among those to have challenged Gilead’s rights to some of the intellectual property behind the drug.Safety has been a concern. Bristol-Myers Squibb wrote off $1.8bn in acquisition and development costs after a patient died and others were admitted to hospital during trials of a nuke it was developing in 2012, leading to the drug being abandoned. Idenix, Vertex and Achillion have been slowed down by worries over toxicity.Analysts say it is still uncertain which company will emerge with the most effective and safest drug cocktail. This explains why Merck was prepared to take a gamble on Idenix to boost its range of combination options.Progress in tackling hepatitis C is as welcome for drugmakers as it is for patients.After a long period of sluggish growth and productivity, Sovaldi’s success has shown that the industry is capable of powerful financial returns when it produces true innovation.But Mark Purcell, analyst at Barclays, cautions that not everyone will be a winner in an increasingly competitive market where “economic returns might not meet increasingly high expectations.”
115;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-07-27T20:00:33Z;Advances in hepatitis C research prompt calls for improved prevention;The latest research has enhanced the status of experts in the disease and stirred up political controversy over pricing;For specialists in hepatitis C, the past few years have been disconcerting. After decades in the shadows struggling to attract attention and funding, they have suddenly become the rock stars of the medical science community.This year has seen the introduction of a breakthrough medicine for hepatitis C which, in more than 90 per cent of cases, will cure the disease within 12 weeks. Further drugs are expected to be approved in the next few months, representing the biggest advance in treatment for hepatitis C since the virus was identified in 1989.This has made hepatitis C one of the most closely watched areas of drug development. Gilead Sciences of the US has broken industry records with the success of its new Sovaldi medicine as analysts predict a market worth £20bn by 2020.All this suggests that a disease often described as a silent killer is finally attracting resources commensurate with its global health impact. An estimated 150m people, just over 2 per cent of the world population, are infected with chronic hepatitis C, a blood-borne virus that can cause deadly liver damage.Until recently, hepatitis C struggled to compete for attention with HIV/Aids, despite there being four times more people living with the former. But as antiretroviral drugs gradually slow the Aids epidemic, hepatitis C is rising up the agenda.So why, given all this progress, is there not a sense of jubilation surrounding the scientists, health professionals and activists who have toiled for years to put hepatitis C in the spotlight? Instead of celebrating the arrival of transformative treatments, the past few months have seen furious debate over the high price of the new drugs and worries that the breakthrough will distract from efforts to improve prevention and detection.In part, this is a natural stage in the cycle of any public health threat. First, comes the long battle to raise awareness and find a solution. Then, once that is achieved, the focus shifts to ensuring access to the remedy and preventing complacency from setting in as scientists and policy makers move on to the next problem.“Right now there is a huge momentum for action,” says Charles Gore, president of the World Hepatitis Alliance, a non-governmental organisation. “The new drugs could be game-changing but we must see governments and the World Health Organisation emphasising prevention if the drugs are going to make the global impact we’re hoping for.”The challenge of translating a scientific breakthrough into sustainable public health gains looks set to be especially tricky in the case of hepatitis C for two reasons. First, the new drugs are exceptionally expensive. Second, 75 per cent of people with the virus do not know they have it.The pricing issue has been making headlines since Sovaldi won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration last December, heralding the first of a new generation of drugs that treat hepatitis C more effectively, more quickly and with fewer side effects than previous medicines.“As far as the treatment is concerned, I’m over-the-moon optimistic,” says Susan Simon, president of the Hepatitis C Association, a US patient advocacy group. She contracted the virus from a contaminated blood transfusion in 1966 but has recently been given the all-clear after taking part in one of the new drug trials. “It’s a very exciting time. However, the pricing is outrageous and will be a huge barrier.”With Sovaldi priced at $84,000 for a 12-week course in the US, each daily pill works out at $1,000. Gilead and its allies say this reflects the cost of development and value to patients.Lori Reilly, head of policy and research at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry group, argues that more effective treatment will produce long-term savings for the healthcare system compared with the cost of treating liver disease and, in some cases, carrying out transplants.“This is a disease that kills more people in this country than HIV/Aids. It is the leading cause of liver cancer. For these patients, for the first time, there is a hope of a medicine that will cure this disease.”Critics say the price will keep the drug out of reach of many and cripple healthcare budgets. Sovaldi’s price is hardly unique among drugs but what makes it unusual is that the hepatitis C population size is so large and concentrated among people who rely on social healthcare.In Louisiana, it would cost $1.4bn, greater than the state transport budget, to treat everyone with hepatitis C who receives health coverage through the Medicaid programme or the prison system, according to Express Scripts, the prescription management company. “The unsustainable pricing of this medication has, essentially, become a tax on all Americans,” says Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts.Similar arguments are made in Europe as the drug is pushed beyond the US. Marisol Touraine, France’s health minister, this month said the French government was co-operating with 13 other European countries to haggle with Gilead. “If we accept such a high price, we won’t be able to treat everyone and we will also be creating a risk for our social security system,” she said.Gilead has promised to make the drug available at a steep discount in the developing world, where the majority of hepatitis C cases occur. In Egypt, which has the highest infection rate at 12 per cent of the population, a deal has been struck to supply Sovaldi for $900 a course.The World Health Organisation in April recommended use of Sovaldi and Janssen’s Olysio as new treatments for hepatitis C but said a “concerted effort” was needed to make them “affordable and accessible for all those who need them”.Increased competition should help as a rival drug from AbbVie nears market with others to follow.The so-called nucleotide analogue inhibitors, or “nukes”, promise to eliminate the need for the interferon injections. The nasty side effects and patchy success rate of the interferon injections have made hepatitis C so hard to treat.Right now there is a huge momentum for action. The new drugs could be game-changingActivists and healthcare experts worry that expensive drugs will divert resources from detection and prevention – difficult matters given a virus that often betrays no visible symptoms for decades. By the time people become aware they are carrying the disease the liver is often badly damaged.Mr Gore says in the long term the way to control costs is to reduce the number of infections. “If prevention is neglected and governments see no progress towards reducing the numbers, they will lose the appetite to continue funding these new drugs,” he argues.Research is under way into possible vaccines but progress is slow. Prevention measures include educating people about the risks of sharing needles, which in poorer countries can even happen in a medical environment.Providing access to testing is challenge. Even when a test is available, people can be reluctant to take it because of the social stigma of hepatitis C.While commonly associated with illegal drug use, the virus was often contracted unwittingly by people such as Ms Simon from blood transfusions and other means before it was identified in 1989. Many are carrying it now without knowing.

Angst is now rising over Walgreens, a drugstore chain that could use its agreed takeover of Switzerland-based Alliance Boots to redomicile.Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate finance committee, intensified his attacks on inversions on Tuesday. “The inversion virus now seems to be multiplying every few days,” he said. “How many more infections can America’s economic body endure?”He complained that even as they hurt US employment and shrank the country’s tax base, the deals were being promoted by “fast-buck artists” such as investment bankers, private equity groups, lawyers and accountants.“With the investment bankers in that inversion feeding frenzy, there may be 25 more inversions during [this year],” he told a hearing of the Senate finance committee.In inversion deals in the past month, Medtronic announced the $42.9bn acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien and AbbVie agreed to take over the UK’s Shire for $54bn.Speaking for the Obama administration, Robert Stack, an official at the US Treasury, told the hearing: “We are aware of many more inversions in the works right now”.Companies and their advisers on both sides of the Atlantic remain undaunted by the political onslaught in Washington, calculating that the chances of Congress passing bipartisan legislation to curb inversions are slim.Last week, Jack Lew, Treasury secretary, urged lawmakers to pass a White House proposal – backed by Mr Wyden – to stamp out inversions, which would lift the foreign ownership threshold for such deals from 20 per cent to 50 per cent.Although senior Republicans have also lambasted inversions, the two parties cannot agree on how to tackle the problem.Orrin Hatch, the most senior Republican senator on the finance committee, criticised proposed countermeasures from the White House and others as being mainly “punitive and retroactive”. He said that rather than “incentivising American companies to remain in the US, these bills would build walls around US corporations in order to keep them from inverting”.The inversion virus now seems to be multiplying every few days. How many more infections can America’s economic body endure?He added that they could have the unintended consequence of encouraging “reverse acquisition” inversions by making US companies more attractive targets for foreign suitors.Chris Krueger, an independent analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said the probability of Congress taking action on inversions this year was less than 10 per cent.Politicians will go on a five-week recess next week and when they return minds will be focused on November elections.In a statement echoed by many Republicans, the Business Roundtable, which represents blue-chip companies, said last week that inversions were symptoms of failures of a US tax system that hampers US competitiveness.It said “piecemeal” bills to curb the deals were not the answer and repeated its longstanding calls for comprehensive tax reform.Mr Wyden said he had invited the chief executives of several companies doing inversions to testify, but they had not accepted.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Switch and you are on your own / From Mr Arnold Holtzman

AbbVie is borrowing £13.5bn from JPMorgan to help supply the cash it is offering, planning to repay the bridge loan later by issuing bonds.In doing so, AbbVie is joining what is becoming the biggest corporate bet worldwide: that equities will outperform bonds.Bond issuance has soared on both sides of the Atlantic as companies race to satisfy investor demand for a return above depressed government bond yields. In the eurozone corporate bonds yield an average of just 1.5 per cent, the lowest to date, according to the Barclays benchmark index, while in the US they are higher but not far above last year’s record lows.If companies were investing this money in new factories and expanding output, this would be a sign they expect a bright future. Sadly, it is not the case. Compared to profits, investment remains depressed. In aggregate companies are borrowing money in order to buy shares, both their own and those of other companies.The logic of this change in the capital structure is obvious for AbbVie. Its bridge finance costs it base rate plus zero to 0.5 per cent – a maximum of 1 per cent. If Shire cannot earn 1 per cent of the deal cost, it has no business being in business.A broader justification applies for other companies: if profit as a percentage of the share price (the earnings yield, a measure of how much accrues to shareholders) is higher than the bond yield – and, crucially, expected to stay higher – it makes financial sense to issue bonds and buy shares. If a company does not do so itself, it can expect an acquirer to make the same calculation and launch a bid.This equity-for-debt swap has been under way since 2010, with buybacks and debt issuance booming (although the near-perfect match between the two in the US since the late 1990s has broken down, with debt issuance soaring above buybacks in the past 18 months, BlackRock points out).Lex on Shire’s rejection of AbbVie approachThe economy may be miserable in the US, but takeovers are at boomtime levels. If this year’s trend continues, there will be $1.9tn of deals in the US in 2014, passing the $1.6tn peaks of 1999 and 2007. The world total would reach $3.9tn, trailing only 2006 and 2007, Dealogic data show.Selling bonds looks like a no-brainer at these yields. Even central bankers, who were trying to encourage markets in the hope some of the gains would trickle into the real economy, have begun warning about froth in junk bonds and leveraged loans. For equity investors it should ring alarm bells too, as it is a modern version of the flawed “Fed model”. This approach, mentioned by the Federal Reserve in 1997, compares bond yields and the earnings yield, the inverse of the PE ratio.The idea is that investors have a choice between bonds and shares, and the two yields measure what shareholders or bondholders can expect to make.It is a good predictor of corporate financing. When shares were outrageously expensive in the dotcom bubble, finance directors naturally chose to sell them, racing to float, and financing deals by issuing equity. When the model showed bonds overpriced relative to equity in 2006 and 2007, companies sold debt to fund buybacks and takeovers.Today it suggests debt is cheaper relative to equity even than during the credit bubble, so it should be no surprise to see buybacks and debt-funded acquisitions taking off.Yet, the Fed model is deeply flawed. Theoretically, it makes no sense to compare fixed nominal bond yields to variable profits, which are broadly linked to inflation. Practically it has been a poor indicator, too. It worked from 1982 to the early 2000s, shortly after it was identified.But investors who stuck with the modern version, comparing the forecast earnings yield to corporate bond yields, saw the strongest-ever buy signal in July 2008. After losing horribly in the crash, hardy souls still using the model received the strongest sell signal in five years in May 2009 – just as a raging bull market began.Yet, if companies keep using the model to arbitrage bonds and equities, it matters. Companies have been the biggest buyers of US shares for years, supporting the market. If they gear up further to buy shares, they can levitate prices for a while, even as the long-term profit outlook is hurt by low investment. As in 2006-7, this is likely to prove temporary.james.mackintosh@ft.comTwitter: @jmackin2
118;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-07-18T18:42:51Z;Shire chief’s $10m ‘golden hello’ at AbbVie;Other senior staff to share $23m in retention bonuses;"Shire’s chief executive is to receive a $10m “golden hello” after agreeing to remain with the drugmaker after its £32bn takeover by US pharmaceuticals group AbbVie.Flemming Ornskov, who only joined Shire in May 2013, will be paid the sum next year. Other senior executives at the London-listed group will share $23m from AbbVie in additional retention bonuses.When he took over running the company last year, Mr Ornskov, a 56-year-old Dane, quickly earned the respect of investors by accelerating Shire’s double-digit sales growth, cutting costs and overseeing a doubling of the share price.Richard González, AbbVie chairman and chief executive, said Mr Ornskov would lead the integration and set up a new unit within the merged group focused on rare diseases – an area he has made a priority at Shire.For Mr Ornskov, this new role, which will be based in Switzerland where he lives, will represent a new chapter in a career that started on a hospital paediatric ward, before moving on to jobs with Merck, Novartis and Bayer. The son of shopkeepers, Mr Ornskov told the Financial Times last month about his modest upbringing in a family that had never previously seen anyone go to university.Chart the development of the UK group from BasingstokeSee belowMr Ornskov’s future had been the focus of speculation during talks with AbbVie, along with that of Susan Kilsby, Shire’s chairman, who will now take a seat on the AbbVie board.Ms Kilsby, who took over as chairman in April, also looks set to emerge from the deal with her reputation enhanced, after brokering a deal that represents a 53 per cent premium over Shire’s share price before AbbVie’s initial approach in May.The appointment of the former Credit Suisse investment banker had fuelled longstanding speculation about a potential takeover of Shire, which has delivered one of the highest shareholder returns of any FTSE 100 company over the past year.Mick Cooper, an analyst at Edison, said: “This is a positive outcome for both sets of shareholders and it is pleasing to see that personal egos have not interfered with the commercial rationale.”The deal stands to end Shire’s near-three decade history as an independent company, from its origins selling calcium supplements from above a shop in Basingstoke, southern England.It is the second FTSE 100 drugmaker to be subjected to an unsolicited takeover attempt by a US rival this year, after Pfizer’s failed £69.4bn bid for AstraZeneca.However, while the latter approach drew strong political opposition because of AstraZeneca’s importance to the UK science base, the proposed Shire takeover has proved much less controversial.Despite its London listing, Shire has fewer than 500 employees in the UK and conducts most of its business and its research and development in the US – where it has a leading position in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.For AbbVie, the acquisition would reduce its dependence on its Humira rheumatoid arthritis drug, which accounts for 60 per cent of sales and loses patent protection at the end of 2016. The Chicago-based company was spun off from Abbott Laboratories last year.The deal is the latest in a wave of dealmaking in the pharmaceuticals sector this year as companies hunt for fresh growth and greater efficiency. Ronny Gal, analyst at Bernstein, said there was no end in sight to the consolidation.Journey from Basingstoke: the development of ShireFrom its origins in Basingstoke, southern England, to its current base in Boston via a stock market listing in London and a tax home in Dublin, Shire has come a long way in the past 28 years, writes Andrew Ward.1986: Shire is founded by Harry Stratford and his wife, Caroline, with a small group of co-investors in an office above a Basingstoke shop. Its first product is a calcium supplement to prevent osteoporosis.1996: The company, by now led by Rolf Stahel, a Swiss oncologist, joins the London Stock Exchange in a flotation that raises £40m and values the company at £107m.1999: In its first large acquisition Shire buys Roberts of the US in a $900m deal that gives the company its first future blockbuster: Adderall, an amphetamine-based drug for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).2000: The $4bn takeover of BioChem of Canada takes Shire into treatments for Aids and hepatitis B and marks out the company as one of the most acquisitive young drugmakers in the industry. It also takes the company further from its UK roots.2002: Mr Stahel steps down as chief executive after building annual sales from $3m when he took over in 1993 to more than $1bn. His replacement by US native Matt Emmens highlights Shire’s shift in gravity towards North America.2005: The $1.6bn acquisition of US biotech company Transkaryotic Therapies and its treatment for Fabry disease marks Shire’s first step into the world of rare diseases – conditions that affect fewer than one in 2,000 people.2007: Another year, another big US deal; the $2.6bn takeover of New River Pharmaceuticals extends Shire’s leadership of the ADHD market by adding Vyvanse to its portfolio as Adderall’s patent nears expiry.2008: In another sign of Shire’s weakening ties to the UK, the company moves its tax home to Dublin to take advantage of Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate.2013: The $4.2bn acquisition of ViroPharm, another US biotech company, marks the first big move by new chief executive Flemming Ornskov and reinforces Shire’s push into rare diseases.2014: Susan Kilsby, a former Credit Suisse banker, is appointed chairman, becoming only the second woman to head a FTSE 100 company board. Within weeks of taking the helm she is approached by AbbVie about a takeover, which is eventually agreed on Friday."
119;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-07-18T17:31:33Z;Shire rises as AbbVie takeover is sealed;;Investor satisfaction over dealmaking at Shire and ITV dominated the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard as end-of-week gains for London stocks were restricted by renewed global political risk.Drugmaker and bid target Shire was the biggest blue-chip mover on Friday, rising 4 per cent to £49.96 as AbbVie of the US sealed its £31bn takeover of the company and confirmed the enlarged group’s tax domicile would be in the UK.Shire’s shareholders will receive £24.44 in cash and 0.8960 new AbbVie shares for each Shire share they hold.“This is a positive outcome for both sets of shareholders and it is pleasing to see that personal egos have not interfered with the commercial rationale,” said Mick Cooper, analyst at Edison Investment Research.Meanwhile, UK media stocks enjoyed a second strong day of gains in the wake of transatlantic M&A optimism.There was another broker upgrade on Friday for ITV, one of the biggest risers of the week after BSkyB’s disposal of its stake in the free-to-air broadcaster to Liberty Global sparked speculation about a full-blown takeover.Citigroup lifted its rating on ITV stock from “sell” to “neutral” and drew attention to the potential tax benefits for US company Liberty, which already owns the UK’s Virgin Media, should it seek to redomicile in Britain.“A UK tax base is increasingly attractive for US companies, and in Liberty Global’s case it has $4.5bn of UK tax losses to utilise, which ITV could help to expedite,” said Catherine O’Neill, Citi analyst.“We believe the change in ownership increases the likelihood of ITV being acquired medium term, and at the very least provides a support level for the shares.”Citi also lifted its price target on the stock to 193p from 175p.Shares in ITV rose a further 3.8 per cent to 202.5p. Over the week, the stock has risen 13.9 per cent. BSkyB shares also enjoyed a strong finish to the week, rising 2.2 per cent to 917.5p.More broadly, investors shunned risk amid fresh geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, although global stock markets did experience some recovery towards the London close on Friday.Investor preference for defensive stocks saw utilities Severn Trent climb 2.1 per cent to £19.26 and United Utilities tick up 1.4 per cent to 894p,The FTSE 100 edged 0.2 per cent upwards to 6,749.43, an advance of 11.13 points, to extend weekly gains to 0.9 per cent.Banks were prominent among the early fallers on Friday as regulators confirmed that the sector would face another inquiry into part of its market, although most trimmed losses in late trade.Concern that high street banks could face the prospect of being broken up followed confirmation from the Competition and Markets Authority that there will be a detailed investigation into the market for current accounts and small business banking.The UK regulator estimates that four banks provide more than three-quarters of UK current accounts.Royal Bank of Scotland lost 1.4 per cent to 319.2p and was the main faller in the sector on Friday while HSBC recovered to stand flat on the session at 599.2p.But early analysis on the implications of the probe was sceptical about the likelihood that it would result in calls for banks to be broken up.In a note to clients, Deutsche Bank analysts Jason Napier and David Lock wrote that such action “would involve vast shareholder value destruction and financial waste, and so is unlikely”.Noting the scale of recent investment, they added: “It has cost Lloyds Banking Group over £1.5bn to create a TSB [as a separate entity to be spun out from the group] that has a 2-6 per cent market share (the low is its credit share, the high its branch share). Total spend will probably approach £2.5bn when all is said and done.”Lloyds erased early losses of as much as 1 per cent to stand 0.3 per cent higher at 73.4p.
120;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Tax inversion risk loomed over Shire talks;;It took AbbVie two and a half months to land Shire, but on Friday the US pharmaceutical group finally sealed the £32bn deal.The announcement came hours before a deadline for AbbVie to make a formal offer for the FTSE 100 speciality pharma group or walk away for six months under UK takeover rules. Seemingly the only thing that had remained in the final days of negotiations since Shire recommended AbbVie’s cash-and-share bid on Monday– its fifth offer since early May – were the non-financial details of the deal.However what now ranks as the largest US acquisition of a European company was no ordinary cross-border deal.For AbbVie, which was only created last year when Abbott Laboratories split its pharmaceuticals unit off – buying Shire would diversify its drug pipeline and allow it to access billions of dollars in foreign earnings.Rick Gonzalez, AbbVie’s chairman and chief executive, had learnt the hard way about the cost of repatriating foreign profits in 2013 when his company’s effective tax rate soared to 22 per cent from 7.9 per cent a year earlier.When Shire recommended the offer at the start of the week, Mr Gonzalez knew he was close after successfully bringing Susan Kilsby, Shire’s non-executive chairman, to the negotiating table.But Ms Kilsby, a former senior investment banker at Credit Suisse, was not ready to give in just yet.Flanked by an army of advisers, including her former colleague Francois Maisonrouge, now a senior managing director at US boutique Evercore – Ms Kilsby, pictured, wanted more assurances that AbbVie was truly committed to a deal as the two sides gathered. Shire demanded that AbbVie include a reverse break fee as part of an agreed upon deal in effect creating a hefty penalty for AbbVie if it were to walk away.The meetings in New York took place against a backdrop of heightened political scrutiny of US companies making foreign acquisitions to avoid US taxes.Jack Lew, US Treasury Secretary, wrote to Congress on Tuesday urging action to stop the practice, calling for “ a new sense of economic patriotism”. AbbVie was not the first to seek to flee the country’s borders, but the deal was now squarely in the public spotlight.The political risk added further complications to an already complex acquisition structure. Under the deal, AbbVie’s shareholders must approve the acquisition of old AbbVie by a newly formed company out of Jersey, the Channel Island.Shire and its US legal advisers Davis Polk argued it faced significant risk of a deal collapsing if the US government moved to limit inversions. Ms Kilsby said AbbVie needed to offer a break fee “in the multibillions”, according to people familiar with the talks.Mr Gonzalez, his lawyer Matthew Hurd from Sullivan & Cromwell, and advisers at JPMorgan Chase said they understood the concerns but they recognised they could not acquiesce to them. Under no circumstance would AbbVie make such a large guarantee, they told Shire and as the talks become “highly emotional” between both sides, these people added.As the sweltering heat bore down on Davis Polk’s New York offices, the two sides continued to fight over the terms of the break fee as they raced to beat the deadline. Finally, there was a compromise was struck early Thursday afternoon.AbbVie would pay $500m if shareholders voted against a deal and $1.5bn if it instructed shareholders to block a deal.The groundwork for the biggest tax inversion in history had been laid.Mr Gonzalez would liberate his overseas profits, Ms Kilsby would become a director of the new company – and a much sought after chairman – and Mr Ornskov would be the head of a new rare drug unit insideAbbVie. For his services, he would also be paid $10m over the next year.
121;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;AbbVie rounds on US tax laws as it snares Shire;;AbbVie defended plans to shift its tax residence to the UK after agreeing to buy Shire for £32bn and urged US politicians to consider comprehensive tax reform rather than trying to block American companies from moving offshore.Richard Gonzalez, chief executive of the Chicago-based drugmaker, said the trend for US companies to use foreign acquisitions to pursue so-called “tax inversions” was a symptom of wider problems in the US tax system.“At the moment we’re at a disadvantage to other [international] companies,” he said, referring to the high US corporate tax rates levied on cash repatriated from overseas. “That is the important debate we should be having about inversions and the whole . . . US tax code.”AbbVie on Friday won the recommendation of Shire’s board for its £52.48-a-share cash-and-stock offer for the UK-listed speciality pharmaceuticals company after a month-long pursuit.In a letter to Congress on Tuesday, Jack Lew, US Treasury Secretary, urged lawmakers to act immediately to prevent more companies from pursuing tax inversions.But Mr Gonzalez said Washington should focus on how the tax system was acting as a deterrent against US multinationals bringing overseas revenues home.“Companies like ours need access to cash flows and need to be able to make investments around the world but particularly in the US,” he said in a conference call with investors and media.How AbbVie’s pursuit of Shire has progressedVisit timelineAbbVie said that, while its main administrative base would remain in Chicago and its listing in New York, the merged entity would be incorporated in Jersey in the Channel Islands and have its tax residence in the UK.This was projected to reduce its average tax rate from about 22 per cent to 13 per cent by 2016.The deal was the second big inversion in the pharmaceuticals sector this week after Mylan said on Monday that it would move its tax home to the Netherlands as part of its $5.3bn acquisition of a drugs portfolio from Abbott Laboratories.AbbVie’s move would be the biggest inversion completed so far this year, outstripping the $42.9bn takeover of Dublin-based Covidien by Medtronic, the US medical device maker, agreed last month.Analysts have said legislation to clamp down on inversions is unlikely this year, but concern over political risks to the deal prompted Shire to negotiate a hefty “break fee” of at least $500m, which must be paid by AbbVie if the acquisition breaks down under certain circumstances.Mr Gonzalez said he was confident of completing the deal by the year-end and insisted that, while the tax savings were attractive, the main motivation was access to Shire’s fast-growing portfolio of treatments for rare diseases and neurological disorders.AbbVie will pay Shire £24.44 in cash and 0.8960 in shares for every Shire share owned.This would give Shire shareholders about a quarter of the merged entity and represent a 53 per cent premium to the UK-listed company’s stock price at the beginning of May, before AbbVie made its first approach.Flemming Ornskov, Shire chief executive, will lead the integration on behalf of Shire and oversee the creation of a new rare disease unit within the merged group – with a $9.9m retention payment due to the Dane next year. Susan Kilsby, Shire chairman, will join the AbbVie board with Dominic Blakemore, another Shire director.The deal stands to end Shire’s near-three decade history as an independent company, from its origins selling calcium supplements from above a shop in Basingstoke, southern England.It is the second FTSE 100 drugmaker to be subjected to an unsolicited takeover attempt by a US rival this year, after Pfizer’s failed £69.4bn bid for AstraZeneca, which would also have involved a tax inversion.However, while the latter approach drew strong political opposition because of AstraZeneca’s importance to the UK science base, the proposed Shire takeover has proved much less controversial.Despite its London listing, Shire has fewer than 500 employees in the UK and conducts most of its business and its research and development in the US – where it has a leading position in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Even so, the loss of the third-biggest UK-listed drugmaker after AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline is likely to increase the sense of siege surrounding FTSE 100 healthcare companies, with Smith & Nephew, the medical devices maker, also the subject of transatlantic takeover speculation.For AbbVie, the acquisition would reduce its dependence on its Humira rheumatoid arthritis drug, which accounts for 60 per cent of sales and loses patent protection at the end of 2016. The company was spun off from Abbott Laboratories last year.
122;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-07-18T10:57:14Z;Letter from Lex: 21st century fox;More big deals in the developing M&A boom;"Of course he had to get involved. Could Rupert Murdoch, one of the media sector’s most enthusiastic dealmakers, really sit out the developing M&A boom? News emerged this week that Twenty First Century Fox had made an approach to rival Time Warner. A combination would create a company worth $142bn. But Mr Murdoch may have found his match in Time Warner chief executive Jeffrey Bewkes, a longstanding opponent of big deals. The initial approach was rejected but do not expect Mr Murdoch to stay away for too long.One of the TMT sector’s other big dealmakers, John Malone, has also been busy. Liberty Global, the European cable operator he chairs, has taken a 6 per cent stake in UK broadcaster ITV. The deal was not driven by any big thirst for TV advertising revenues though. ITV’s content business, although only a quarter of its revenues, is of more importance. Rival infrastructure companies, such as BSkyB and BT, see content as a big part of their future. Mr Malone has little option but to follow.Other parts of the TMT world were also making changes. Microsoft announced 18,000 job cuts, many of which will be in the Nokia handset business, as it narrowed its smartphone ambitions. The challenge for chief executive Satya Nadella will be to convince investors that Microsoft can be a big player in mobile and in cloud computing. And IBM, which has turned strategy shifts into something of an art form, has found a new avenue for investment – it plans to put $3bn over the next five years into next generation microchips.The big pharma M&A party shows no signs of petering out. After a brief cat-and-mouse game, AbbVie has agreed to buy Shire. Like many other deals in the sector, this one will bring big tax benefits. The deal was the subject on Monday of Lex’s first ever “live” note – a new format in which we post our ideas and data online as we conduct our research, and you get to comment at the same time. Watch out for more on our new blog.Shire and AbbVie was not the only pharma deal of the week. In another so-called tax inversion, Mylan is to buy Abbot Laboratories’ European business. One pharma deal still in the works is Valeant/Allergan. The former is very keen on a deal; the latter is resisting with promises of its own M&A strategy. But one of its potential targets, Shire, has just been taken out of the game.Finally, second-quarter earnings season started in earnest this week. The US financial sector was centre stage. Banks such as Citi and Goldman Sachs reported smaller than expected declines in their fixed income trading businesses, but news from US retail banking at the former was less impressive. In the asset management sector, BlackRock keeps bringing in new money across most of its businesses although the institutional operation is a cause for concern.Have a good weekend.Oliver Ralph, Deputy Head of Lex"

However, they added that the deal could still break down at the last minute.One of the main sticking points has been Shire’s demand for a big break fee from AbbVie, if the Chicago-based company later walked away from an agreed deal.Worries that the US government may move to limit so-called tax inversions – whereby companies move their headquarters offshore to reduce their tax burden – have increased uncertainty around the deal in recent days. In a letter to Congress, Jack Lew, US Treasury Secretary, urged lawmakers to act immediately to prevent more companies from pursuing such deals.The proposed deal would surpass last month’s $42.9bn takeover of Dublin-based Covidien by Medtronic, the US medical device maker, as the biggest tax inversion in the healthcare sector so far.AbbVie has said the merged group’s tax domicile would be in the UK, putting its offshore cash out of reach of the US taxman.Shire is the second FTSE 100 drugmaker to be subjected to an unsolicited takeover attempt by a US rival this year after Pfizer’s failed £69.4bn bid for AstraZeneca. However, while the latter approach drew strong political opposition because of AstraZeneca’s importance to the UK science base, the proposed Shire takeover has proved much less controversialConcern over mounting US political risks to the deal prompted Shire’s chairman Susan Kilsby, a former Credit Suisse investment banker, to seek protections against the possibility of the takeover collapsing. People close to the matter said the two sides were still haggling over the proposed break fee even as other elements of the deal fell into place on Thursday.Under the terms of the latest offer made by AbbVie last week, shareholders would receive £24.44 in cash and 0.8960 in AbbVie shares for every Shire share owned. This would give Shire shareholders approximately 25 per cent of the combined entity.Under UK takeover rules, AbbVie has until Friday to make a firm offer to shareholders or walk away after a month of publicly courting Shire.The deal, if completed, would mark the end of Shire’s near-three decade history as an independent company, from its origins selling calcium supplements from above a shop in Basingstoke, southern England, into a global specialist in treatments for rare diseases and neurological disorders.Shire is the second FTSE 100 drugmaker to be subjected to an unsolicited takeover attempt by a US rival this year after Pfizer’s failed £69.4bn bid for AstraZeneca.

Shareholders in drugmakers are advised to wade in anyway.They provide capital to a set of impeccably globalised companies already. Mergers designed to allow the acquirer to shift (or “invert”) its domicile outside the US for tax purposes push this further.On Monday, the board of Shire – London-listed, Jersey-incorporated, Irish tax-resident – said that it was willing to recommend an improved £53 per share offer from AbbVie. The combined company would be taxed in the UK instead. So would the new Mylan, which said on Monday that it would invert by purchasing European assets from Abbott Laboratories.The geography is dizzying. So is the premium AbbVie is offering for its target: 42 per cent.

Are the tax savings worth the premium?Moving to a tax rate like Shire’s in 2013 could, in theory, increase AbbVie’s net income next year by $0.5bn. But this assumes that the rates paid by Shire (16 per cent) and AbbVie (22 per cent) were not abnormally low or high respectively. AbbVie’s rate may have been high after paying up to repatriate cash to the US that year.A UK domicile would allow that cash to be used – or returned to investors – without pain, though. Shareholders could also bet that access to diversification via Shire’s specialised drugs portfolio would improve AbbVie’s multiple, creating value irrespective of tax savings.Except acquirers’ shareholders have another tax to worry about: US capital gains. Mylan’s holders will record gains when they get shares in the new company as a consequence of inverting. That structure is also a feature of Medtronic’s deal for Covidien. A reason to check the rules – and then to ask whether this structure is a fair division of the inversion spoils.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com

Its board started talking to AbbVie last week and garnered a revised £53.20-per-share offer – up from £51.15 previously – made up of cash and stock that would hand Shire shareholders a 25 per cent stake in the combined company.Rolls-Royce shares gained 1.5 per cent to £10.52 after Airbus, the European aerospace group, said it was to sell new versions of its A330 passenger jet powered by the British company’s Trent 7000 engines.Insurance group Direct Line climbed 1.5 per cent to 281.5p after it was reported the company was in advanced talks to sell its Italian and German operations.
127;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Bid battle timeline: AbbVie’s pursuit of Shire;;How US pharmaceuticals group AbbVie sought to take over its London-listed Dublin-based rival Shire.● May: AbbVie makes a series of three indicative offers for London-listed Shire.● June 20: News of the approach becomes public, as Shire says it has rejected AbbVie’s third, £46.26-a-share bid – a 23 per cent premium over the company’s closing price the day before. Shire says the £27bn offer “fundamentally undervalues” its business and issues a new forecast that it will more than double revenues to $10bn by 2020.● June 23: Flemming Ornskov, Shire’s chief executive, says the company is open to a takeover– at the right price. “This is a premium asset and if someone wants to shorten the life of this company they will have to pay a price that reflects that,” he says.● AbbVie lays out its case for the takeover, saying it would move its tax domicile to the UK in the event of a deal. Richard Gonzalez, chief executive, insists there is a “clear strategic rationale” beyond tax savings, arguing that his company’s greater global scale would allow it to widen the reach of Shire’s products and accelerate drug development.● July 8: AbbVie announces it has raised its offer to £51.15 a share, valuing the company at about £30bn, and says there is broad support among Shire’s shareholders for a deal● July 9: UK Takeover Panel forces AbbVie to retract its claims that Shire investors back the deal. The US company releases a statement saying “in the absence of written statements of support from shareholders it is not in a position to make any statement of shareholder support”.● July 10: The two companies open talks on the takeover, with Mr Gonzalez meeting Mr Ornskov and Shire chairman Susan Kilsby in New York, in a sign they could be moving closer to a deal.● July 13 AbbVie raises its proposed offer to £53.20 a share.● July 14 Shire says it would be willing to recommend the revised £31bn offer to its shareholders, opening the door to the deal.
128;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Shire in talks with US drugmaker AbbVie over £30bn bid;;Shire has opened talks with AbbVie, the US drugmaker, over its proposed £30bn takeover bid for the UK-listed speciality pharma company in a sign that the two parties may be moving closer to a deal.Shire confirmed it had held a meeting with AbbVie in a short statement late on Friday. According to people familiar with the matter, senior executives from both companies met in New York to discuss AbbVie’s £51.15 per share offer for Shire.Talks began on Thursday, when Rick Gonzalez, AbbVie chief executive, flew to the New York area to meet Susan Kilsby, Shire chairman, and Flemming Ornskov, chief executive. But he later returned to Chicago, leaving colleagues to continue the talks. Both companies declined to comment.It is not the first time the two sides have met since AbbVie launched its pursuit in May. Brief talks have previously taken place in Geneva and Paris but did not lead to full-blown negotiations and people close to the situation said there was no guarantee a deal would materialise from the latest meeting.Shares in Shire closed 5.9 per cent higher to £48.70 in London, while AbbVie fell 1.2 per cent to $54.75 in midday New York trading.The talks come as some large Shire shareholders have privately pushed for the company to engage with AbbVie, which this week launched its fourth offer to acquire it since early May.On Wednesday, AbbVie was forced to make an unusual retraction of statements Mr Gonzalez made to news outlets including the Financial Times that Shire shareholders were “generally supportive” of its attempts to acquire the company.Under UK Takeover Code rules – which regulate mergers and acquisitions activity – a company cannot claim to have shareholder support unless it is stated in writing.Despite the glitch, analysts said Mr Gonzalez was probably right in his assessment of investor sentiment. John Boris at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said AbbVie’s latest offer was “largely in step” with what shareholders wanted.Shire’s board, led by Ms Kilsby, a former investment banker, has yet to respond publicly to the bid – an 11 per cent improvement on its previous proposal.Mr Boris predicted it could be good enough to bring Shire to the table but a further increase was probably needed to clinch a deal.UK takeover rules give AbbVie until July 18 to make a firm offer or walk away. Some analysts think rival bidders could yet step in, attracted by Shire’s fast-growing rare diseases business – as well as the potential for US companies to use overseas acquisitions to lower their tax rate.Allergan, the maker of Botox which is resisting a $53bn hostile bid from Valeant, this week said it was open to a sizeable acquisition but David Pyott, chief executive, refused to comment on speculation that Shire could be a target.Mr Boris said he felt that Allergan had been “priced out of the running” by AbbVie’s latest bid.A takeover of Shire would add to the wave of dealmaking in the healthcare sector, with $260bn of mergers and acquisitions among pharmaceuticals, medical and biotech companies so far this year, according to Mergermarket. This has accounted for 16.4 per cent of total global M&A activity.Several of the deals have involved US companies, including AbbVie, buying European companies as a way to shift their tax domiciles across the Atlantic in order to shield offshore cash from high US rates.
129;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-07-09T21:12:11Z;Investors press Allergan to find deal;;Shareholders in Allergan are encouraging the Botox maker to do a large acquisition of its own as it tries to fend off a $53bn hostile bid from rival drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals.David Pyott, Allergan’s chairman and chief executive, told the Financial Times he recognised that the company, which has $14bn of cash on its balance sheet, should act sooner rather than later if it was going to make an acquisition.“Our stockholders have been fairly clear that if we have a deal that we can do, we should do it soon. On the other hand, Valeant is trying to use our own balance sheet to buy us.”His comments will lend weight to speculation that Allergan executives could use a large acquisition to undermine Valeant’s cash and stock offer, in the latest dealmaking twist in a rapidly consolidating healthcare sector.Since being targeted by Valeant, which is working with Bill Ackman, the activist investor who runs the Pershing Square hedge fund, analysts have linked Allergan to a string of possible takeover targets, the most recent being Shire, the UK drugmaker that is itself the subject of a $51bn bid from AbbVie of the US.Mr Pyott declined to comment on whether Allergan was working on, or planning to launch, a bid for Shire.A top 15 shareholder in both Allergan and Shire told the FT that the UK company would be more likely to accept an offer from Allergan than from AbbVie, even at a lower price, and that he would support such a choice because of Allergan’s faster growth prospects.Investor appetite for such a deal comes three months into a fight with Valeant, in which Allergan executives have repeatedly criticised their pursuer’s acquisition-dependent business model.Allergan’s criticism has also focused on Valeant’s history of cutting costs by scaling back research and development budgets at companies it has acquired. For its part, Valeant has sought to portray Allergan as being inefficient and having a bloated cost structure.The increasingly bitter battle between the two companies, exacerbated by the presence of Mr Ackman, has informed a wider debate in the pharmaceuticals industry about the appropriate levels of R&D investment large drugmakers should fund.Mr Pyott acknowledged the need to reduce his company’s research and development spending, which stood at $1.1bn last year.He said Allergan would freeze some development programmes that were at early stages but added a cautionary note about only investing in projects that delivered short term results: “It’s a challenge for our industry but there is a mismatch between the life cycle of a chief executive and the life cycle of drug development.”Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi in London
130;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Myners must give independent advice on independents;Share price performance offers intriguing view of such advisers;"There has been much debate over the impact that independent investment banks might have on initial public offerings. This is set to be revisited by Lord Myners as he mounts a broader probe into primary deals prompted by last year’s Royal Mail float.Here, Lazard featured as independent adviser to the government, which was criticised for underpricing the issue. However, sceptics are inclined to blame these counsellors for driving prices up rather than down. Fans counter that they stop share distributors keeping prices low to please institutions.Intriguing findings flow from the envelope on which Lombard tackled the conundrum. In the year to noon on Wednesday, shares in companies that had deployed an independent adviser to achieve a UK main market listing fell an average of 0.6 per cent. Debutantes that did not bother rose 7.6 per cent. That appears to support the case against the independents.Lombard also knocked out some fast and dirty snapshots on the performance of debutantes advised by specific banks. IPOs from investment companies were excluded, as were advisers with fewer than three deals under their belts.Floats featuring Numis in the lead advisory role (“book runner” or “global co-ordinator” in Cityspeak) returned an average of 12.2 per cent. Any portfolio so eccentric as to only buy IPOs brought by Goldman Sachs would have lost 6.12 per cent. Floats involving Rothschild, the busiest independent, returned 3.2 per cent.In a spirit of self-scrutiny, Lombard worked out that floats receiving a favourable write-up in this column had risen a mean 2.6 per cent. Lady Luck has thus shown she can occasionally smile on pundits whose judgments are finger-in-the-air exercises, as well as bankers with fancy spreadsheets.Not so flash boyA phone rings.

The UK Takeover Panel forced the US drugs group to retract claims of shareholder support from AbbVie boss Richard Gonzalez. The £69bn bid that Pfizer, made for AstraZeneca unravelled in May after its own discussions with the City M&A watchdog.The US suitors share two advisers: investment bank JPMorgan and PR consultant Brunswick. Their knuckles must be getting rather bruised from all those slaps from the panel.AbbVie was already being cheeky in issuing a statement on Tuesday that implied support from more than 50 per cent of shareholders for a bid at £51.15 a share. Mr Gonzalez crossed a line in media briefings by explicitly claiming investors’ support. It is an open question why no one warned the businessman to be more circumspect. As it is, the retraction looks to be no more than an avoidable setback for AbbVie. But the territory where US bidders tussle with UK targets must increasingly remind participants of another Britney tune: Toxic.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com"
131;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
132;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-07-09T17:00:14Z;AbbVie retraction shows panel has teeth;;"Perhaps Richard Gonzalez did not make it to page 190 of the Takeover Code.The inch-thick document, written by the UK Takeover Panel, advises chief executives to take “particular care” in media interviews if they are engaged in mergers and acquisitions activity.But the boss of AbbVie was on Wednesday forced to retract comments made the previous day to several news outlets, in which he indicated Shire shareholders were supportive of the US pharmaceuticals group’s £30bn offer to acquire its UK rival.Under panel rules, such statements cannot be made without the written support of the investors in question.Mr Gonzalez is not the first buccaneering chief executive to fall foul of the British panel’s rules, an extensive set of guidelines that can easily trip up globe-trotting company bosses. He joins a distinguished line including Pfizer’s Ian Read; Todd Stitzer, the former CEO of confectioner Cadbury; and Sir Stuart Rose, ex-head of Marks and Spencer, the retailer.The Takeover Panel, which was set up in the 1960s, has a frontline staff of about 15 employees – half of them permanent, the rest secondments from banks, brokers, law firms and accountants.It moves swiftly to force companies to clarify any public statements that could affect the share price of a target. However, this can be frustrating for chief executives who want to make a move for a company but do not want to show their hand and unwittingly boost the share price of the target.UK takeover rules – an ever-evolving framework covering mergers and acquisitions involving companies with registered offices in Britain – were beefed up in the wake of Kraft’s hostile £11bn takeover of Cadbury in 2010.That deal, centred on a popular British chocolate brand in the run up to a general election, piqued a level of political scrutiny for a corporate transaction that went unmatched until this year, when Pfizer launched its informal approach for UK pharmaceuticals rival AstraZeneca.AbbVie’s statement on Wednesday was not the first time that a company has been forced to clarify its position because of the UK’s intricate Takeover Code. Here are five examples, showing the potential deal and the rule it fell foul of.Continue readingKraft’s takeover was preceded by a siege lasting several months that, analysts say, raised questions over the company’s future and destabilised the shareholder register. Kraft also made commitments – such as keeping open the Cadbury Somerdale plant near Bristol – that it later reneged on.Of the new rules subsequently introduced by the panel, most significant was a requirement for a publicly named bidder to make a firm offer or walk away within 28 days of tabling a proposal – the so-called “put up or shut up” deadline.This requirement was a fixed deadline imposed by the panel, rather than requested by the target and negotiated with the predator.The panel also ruled that if a bidder announced business plans for a target – such as maintaining staff or keeping plants open for an unspecified period of time – it must stick to these for at least a year.The body, set up as a non-statutory organisation, took on enforcement powers in 2006, so could seek a court order to back up its rulings, though it has yet to do so.Oops! We did it again! The team advising AbbVie on its proposal to buy London-listed Shire for £30bn is having a Britney Spears moment, writes Jonathan Guthrie.Continue readingThe renewal of M&A activity in the pharmaceuticals sector this year has offered an extended test for the panel’s new regime. The increased scrutiny of the code during the Pfizer/AstraZeneca courtship sparked complaints that the rules were arcane and led to muddle and confusion.But a series of company statements prompted by the panel, including Wednesday’s retraction from AbbVie, have offered evidence that the watchdog intends to make its changes bite.“It would seem to be more proactive setting out what is expected of all parties,” says Savvas Neophytou, an analyst at Panmure Gordon.“I’m not saying all these largely American bankers at big advisory firms don’t know the rules, but in many instances they fail to appreciate the spirit of the law and the panel is making sure they are not confused about what should and should not be done.”Other analysts say retractions and clarifications are simply part of the tit-for-tat that accompanies confrontational dealmaking, as each side seeks to embarrass the other. But such political point-scoring rarely has a significant bearing on the outcome – as seen by the muted reaction of the Shire share price on Wednesday.The irony for Mr Gonzalez is, the rule that caught him out – rule 19.3 – is nothing new. According to a senior lawyer at a UK firm: “This rule has been in the code for years and says that if you make a statement of shareholder support there must be documentary evidence of that.“I don’t think that’s a post-Cadbury innovation and I don’t think it is an example of the way the code operates to make it difficult for acquirers. It is a slip-up by the advisers, but it doesn’t undermine the bid.”"
133;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-07-09T12:57:33Z;Five examples of the UK Takeover Code in action;;AbbVie’s statement on Wednesday was not the first time that a company has been forced to clarify its position because of the UK’s intricate Takeover Code. Here are five examples, showing the potential deal and the rule it fell foul of.July 9 2014: AbbVie issues clarification after telling journalists Shire shareholders were “generally supportive” of its offer to acquire its UK rival – even though it had not received written confirmation of that supportRule 19.3“An offerer or the offeree company must not make statements about the level of support from shareholders or other persons unless their up-to-date intentions have been clearly stated to the offerer or the offeree company.”May 28 2014: Stryker says it has no plans to make a takeover offer for Smith & Nephew – at the request of the Takeover Panel – ruling itself out for six months, following a Financial Times story linking Stryker with a possible bid for the medical devices makerRule 2.8“A person making a statement that he does not intend to make an offer for a company should make the statement as clear and unambiguous as possible . . . . Neither the person making the statement, nor any person who acted in concert with that person . . . may within six months from the date of the statement . . . announce an offer or possible offer for the offeree company.”May 19 2014: Pfizer outlines “final” offer to AstraZeneca, saying that its offer will not be increased, “except in the circumstances set out below”. AstraZeneca issues its own clarification a day later, following questions from shareholders, saying the offer is “not capable under the Takeover Panel rules of being increased or even suggested at being increased, privately or publicly”Rule 2.5 (ii)“Where the statement concerned includes reference to the fact that the terms of the possible offer ‘will not be increased’ or are ‘final’ or uses a similar expression, the potential offerer will not be allowed subsequently to make an offer on better terms.”September 25 2009: Cadbury issues a statement saying Todd Stitzer, then chief executive, does not believe that Kraft’s intention to acquire the confectioner “makes strategic or financial sense”. He had been quoted at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch investor conference as saying there was “some strategic sense” in a combination of the two companiesRule 19.1“Each document or advertisement published, or statement made, during the course of an offer must be prepared with the highest standards of care and accuracy and the information given must be adequately and fairly presented.”Feb 28 2007: Marks and Spencer says it does not intend to make an offer for Sainsbury’s, following a Bloomberg report quoting Sir Stuart Rose, then chief executive of the clothing retailer, saying he would be considered “an idiot” if he did not think about mounting a takeover bid for the supermarketSee Rule 2.8.
134;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;UK Takeover Panel forces AbbVie to retract claims of Shire support;;AbbVie has been forced to issue an unusual retraction a day after the US pharmaceuticals company said Shire shareholders supported its moves to acquire the rival drugmaker.Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie’s chief executive, on Tuesday told several news outlets – including the Financial Times – that he felt there was broad investor backing for the company’s latest £51.15 a share, £30bn offer for the UK-listed company.“We have met with the majority of shareholders, they understand the strategic rational,” Mr Gonzalez told the FT. “I believe they are generally supportive of this transaction and this offer is indicative of those discussions.”However, upon seeing the reports, the UK Takeover Panel contacted AbbVie on Tuesday afternoon and asked the company to issue a retraction.Under rule 19.3 of the Takeover Code – which regulates mergers and acquisitions activity in the UK – a company cannot claim to have shareholder support unless investors’ “up-to-date intentions have been clearly stated to the offeror or the offeree company”, normally in writing.In a statement on Wednesday the US group said: “AbbVie confirms that it has not received any written commitments of support and accordingly retracts the statements. It acknowledges that in the absence of written statements of support from shareholders it is not in a position to make any statement of shareholder support.”The clarification is both an embarrassing volte-face for the US suitor and a further sign of how closely the panel is policing the company’s public utterances, as it did with Pfizer’s attempts to acquire another FTSE 100 pharmaceuticals group, AstraZeneca.Oops! We did it again! The team advising AbbVie on its proposal to buy London-listed Shire for £30bn is having a Britney Spears moment, writes Jonathan Guthrie.Continue readingIn an apparent miscalculation during its pursuit of the UK-based drugmaker, Pfizer limited its options to raise its £69bn bid after using the technical term “final” in issuing an offer.AbbVie first approached Shire in early May with an offer to acquire the speciality drugmaker, which makes treatments for rare diseases and neurological disorders. The latest cash-and-shares offer values the Irish-based company’s equity at about £30bn.Shire, which dismissed the previous offers as “fundamentally” undervaluing the company, said on Tuesday it had not been informed of the new offer in advance and that its board would meet to consider the proposal.The Takeover Panel declined to comment.

The airline blamed overcapacity on transatlantic flights, as well as difficulty repatriating revenues from Venezuela because of a currency dispute.The warning on flights between the US and European destinations weighed most heavily on Delta, American Airlines and United Continental. More than two-fifths of international revenue passenger miles flown by the three carriers in May, a key industry metric, were on routes across the Atlantic.UBS analysts remained optimistic on the sector, forecasting transatlantic revenue passenger mile growth of between 4.4 and 5.5 per cent in the second and third quarters for the US-based carriers.“Transatlantic bookings continue to come through strong, although we see risk down the road if high single-digit capacity growth continues,” analyst Darryl Genovesi said.Delta fell 5 per cent earlier in the day, but pulled back to close down 1.25 per cent to $36.44; American Airlines slid 4 per cent but ended the day 0.40 per cent up at $40.26; and United Continental climbed from a dip of 1 per cent to end the day up 2.38 per cent at $39.54.Domestic-focused carriers JetBlue fell 1.22 per cent to $10.49 and Southwest fell 1.73 per cent to $26.70.AbbVie shares weakened on Tuesday after the company raised its bid for UK-listed drugmaker Shire to £51.15 a share, or just over £30bn.The US company is again offering a mix of cash and its own shares for Shire, which has long been seen as a likely takeover target as drugmakers seek new medicines.Under the bid, Shire investors would receive £22.44 in cash and 0.856 AbbVie shares for each Shire share they own.AbbVie shares declined 2.98 per cent to $55.69 while Shire shares trading in New York fell 2 per cent to $232.92.US retailer Guess climbed 3.87 per cent to $28.45 after broker Piper Jaffray lifted its rating to overweight from neutral as European confidence improves.“With the exception of France in which visibility remains cloudy, consumer confidence is building in the region and discretionary spending is improving,” analyst Erinn Murphy said.Europe accounted for 35 per cent of Guess sales and 44 per cent of operating earnings in the year to February 1.Guess shares remain nearly a tenth lower since the beginning of the year, as heavy discounting across the retail sector crimped margins, and harsh winter weather in the US kept shoppers away from malls.Shares of specialist grocer Fresh Market declined 2.16 per cent to $31.96 after Goldman Sachs cut its rating to sell from neutral, citing high food cost inflation and intensifying competition.“The bottom line is The Fresh Market is operating in a more competitive environment for speciality grocers that we expect will cap the top line and pressure margins long term,” analyst Stephen Grambling said.Mr Grambling added that a likely re-acceleration in same-store sales would not be enough to offset inflation and the impact from competitors.US markets broadly declined on Tuesday, despite improving job opening figures from the labour department.The S&P 500 fell 0.70 per cent to 1,963.71 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.69 per cent to 16,906.62. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.35 per cent to 4,391.46.After touching a multiyear low last Thursday, the Vix volatility index climbed for its second day. The index, also known as the “fear gauge”, rose 6 per cent to 11.98.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt"
136;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;AbbVie lifts offer for Shire to £30bn;;AbbVie of the US has increased its offer for Shire to £30bn and urged shareholders to press the UK-listed drugmaker to enter talks over a friendly deal.The £51.15 a share offer represents an 11 per cent increase on the £46.26 proposal made last month, which Shire said “fundamentally undervalued” the company.Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie’s chief executive, told the Financial Times on Tuesday he felt there was broad shareholder support for a deal after talks with big Shire investors in London and New York over the past week.“We have met with the majority of shareholders, they understand the strategic rational. I believe they are generally supportive of this transaction and this offer is indicative of those discussions.”Shire, which makes speciality drugs for rare diseases and neurological disorders, said it had not been informed of the new offer in advance and that its board would meet to consider the proposal.It is the second FTSE 100 drugmaker to face an unsolicited takeover bid from a US rival this year, with AbbVie trying to avoid the fate of Pfizer, which failed to buy AstraZeneca for £69.4bn earlier this year.Like Pfizer, AbbVie is motivated in part by potential savings from a plan to establish the merged company’s tax domicile in the UK as a way to shield offshore cash from higher US rates.AbbVie’s bid is less controversial because Shire lacks the large UK workforce and research and development base that roused political opposition to the AstraZeneca deal.However, a takeover of Shire, whose market capitalisation exceeds that of household names such as Tesco and Rolls-Royce, would remove one of the fastest-growing FTSE 100 companies from the UK investment landscape.Jeffrey Holford, analyst at Jefferies, said the increased offer was close to “the tipping point” at which Shire would be coaxed into talks but predicted AbbVie would have to get closer to £55 a share to clinch a deal.Ronny Gal at Bernstein predicted Shire would reject the latest bid but agree to enter negotiations, adding that the acquisition was likely to go through eventually.Tuesday’s proposal was made up of £22.44 in cash and 0.8568 AbbVie shares for each Shire share – roughly the same 44 per cent cash proportion as in the earlier proposal.Mr Gonzalez declined to rule out a higher offer or the possibility of taking the bid direct to shareholders if Shire’s board refused to negotiate. AbbVie has until July 18 under UK takeover rules to make a firm offer or walk away.Analysts and bankers said a hostile bid was a more realistic possibility than it was for Pfizer in its pursuit of AstraZeneca because, with few overlapping businesses or potential cost synergies, AbbVie has less need to see Shire’s books.The US company said its latest proposal represented a 75 per cent premium over Shire’s share price in mid-April before takeover speculation intensified, although the UK-listed company disputes that this should be the reference point.Shire’s defence is being spearheaded by Susan Kilsby, the former Credit Suisse investment banker who took over as chairman of the drugmaker in April.The company’s double-digit sales growth has long marked it out as an attractive potential target for bigger rivals and one shareholder speculated that the company could seek to draw other bidders, such as big US biotech groups, into an auction.Shares in Shire fell more than 3 per cent to £44.96, reflecting uncertainty over the prospects of a takeover. A 2.8 per cent drop in AbbVie’s stock to $55.81 was another factor, reducing the value of the paper portion of any deal with the US company.
137;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;AbbVie courts shareholders to put pressure on Shire over bid;;The chief executive of AbbVie has urged Shire shareholders to press the FTSE 100 pharmaceutical group to engage with the US company regarding its £27bn takeover approach.AbbVie’s Richard Gonzalez flew back to his company’s Chicago headquarters this week after telling large Shire shareholders that AbbVie would like to see the UK company’s books before it would consider making an improved offer, according to people in attendance.The meetings in London this week came after Shire, which focuses on treatments for rare diseases and neurological disorders, rejected three separate proposals from AbbVie beginning in early May. It has said that AbbVie’s latest £46.26 a share offer “fundamentally undervalued” the company.Shire indicated to the Financial Times on Wednesday that it was up to AbbVie to make the next move. “Shire has made its position very clear and the ball is firmly in Abbvie’s court,” the company said.One investor who met Mr Gonzalez said Shire would be reluctant to open its books to AbbVie in the absence of an increased offer because, under UK takeover rules, it would then be obliged to do the same for any other interested parties.Analysts have speculated that rival US bidders could emerge, attracted by the prospect of using Shire as a vehicle to shelter offshore cash from high US corporate tax rates – a manoeuvre known as a tax inversion.The investor who met Mr Gonzalez said it was unclear whether AbbVie was categorically ruling out a higher bid in the absence of talks or simply trying to manage market expectations and increase pressure on Shire.Mr Gonzalez told investors that Shire’s forecast of doubling annual revenues to $10bn by 2020 was too vague.He added that he had met Susan Kilsby, Shire chairman, in Geneva for one hour after the company made its first informal offer of £39.50 a share in early May. Shire’s board rejected a second offer at £40.97 on May 20 without a meeting between the two sides.After making a third offer worth £46.26 a share, Mr Gonzalez met for nearly two hours with Ms Kilsby in Paris. A few hours later, Mr Gonzalez was told the third offer had been rejected. AbbVie declined to comment.The US company’s latest offer represents a 23 per cent premium over Shire’s share price the day before its interest became public. However, AbbVie highlighted the 58 per cent premium over the price in mid-April, before news of Pfizer’s interest in AstraZeneca caused takeover speculation surrounding Shire to intensify.Analysts and bankers have predicted that AbbVie will increase its offer, while people close to the company have said that it would “remain disciplined” on price. AbbVie has not ruled out going hostile with its approach.
138;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;AbbVie takes pursuit of Shire to shareholders;US drugmaker’s CEO flies into London to put pressure on target;AbbVie will this week step up its pursuit of Shire when the US drugmaker’s chief executive flies into London to pitch a proposed £27bn takeover to shareholders.Richard Gonzalez will hold talks with Shire investors in an attempt to increase pressure on the UK-listed company’s board to enter negotiations.Shire has rejected three separate proposals from AbbVie since early May and said the latest £46.26 a share offer “fundamentally undervalued” the company.Analysts and bankers predict that AbbVie will increase its offer but people close to the company said on Sunday that it would remain “disciplined” on price.AbbVie has said it would move its tax domicile to the UK in the event of a deal, joining a series of US companies that have sought to use foreign acquisitions as a vehicle to shelter overseas cash from higher US corporate tax rates.However, Mr Gonzalez insisted last week that there was a “clear strategic rationale” in addition to tax savings, arguing that AbbVie’s greater scale would enable it to increase the value of Shire’s drugs for rare diseases and neurological disorders.Analysts at Barclays have said AbbVie could pay up to £55 a share while those at Bank of America Merill Lynch claimed it could go as high as £62.In the event of a deal, Shire shareholders would have to own at least 20 per cent of the merged company in order for AbbVie to complete a so-called “tax inversion”.That means Mr Gonzalez will need to convince Shire shareholders of his own company’s prospects because a large proportion of any offer would have to be in AbbVie shares. About 44 per cent of the latest offer was in cash.AbbVie, spun-off from Abbott Laboratories last year, derives almost 60 per cent of sales from its Humira rheumatoid arthritis drug, which loses patent protection at the end of 2016. Mr Gonzalez last week pointed to a new hepatitis C treatment and several others in development to argue that the outlook was bright.Flemming Ornskov, Shire chief executive, has lamented the disruption caused by AbbVie’s approach, saying that under UK takeover rules the company has been forced to put planned acquisitions on hold.Shire last month put in place a $5bn credit facility in readiness for a possible bid for NPS Pharmaceuticals, a US rare disease specialist, according to people familiar with the matter. Shire declined to comment.AbbVie has until July 18 under UK takeover rules to make a firm offer or walk away. Shire is the second FTSE 100 drugmaker to face an unwanted approach from a US rival this year after Pfizer’s abortive £69bn offer for AstraZeneca.While the Pfizer bid sparked political uproar because of AstraZeneca’s importance to UK science, reaction to AbbVie’s proposal has been muted because Shire has less than 500 employees in Britain and moved its tax domicile to Ireland in 2008.
139;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-06-27T21:36:47Z;Nomad at heart of Shire’s defence;;Born in Denmark and commuting between his office in Boston and his home in Zurich, Flemming Ornskov is the ultimate global businessman.It is an appropriately nomadic lifestyle for the chief executive of a company, Shire Pharmaceuticals, which has been criticised for its rootlessness.Listed in London, incorporated in Dublin and managed in Boston, Shire is facing another twist in its 28-year history of dealmaking and border-hopping as it battles to resist a £27bn takeover proposal from AbbVie of the US.Shire has put Dr Ornskov at the heart of its defence, highlighting the company’s status as one of the best-performing stocks in the FTSE 100 since he took over in May 2013, with a doubling in the share price and a 19 per cent increase in sales.If AbbVie is to seize its prey, it must convince investors it can create more value with Shire’s assets than the 56-year-old Danish medic.Dr Ornskov has been credited with reducing Shire’s dependence on treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These have proved highly lucrative but also controversial because of debate over alleged over-medication of children.He vigorously defends the drugs’ clinical value, but at the same time is pushing Shire deeper into rare diseases, a fast-growing market in which the small number of patients is offset by the high price commanded by often life-saving niche drugs.Dr Ornskov started his career on a hospital paediatric ward before moving into industry with Merck, Novartis and Bayer. “I saw premature babies born at 26 or 27 weeks fighting for their lives,” recalls Dr Ornskov. “You learnt quickly to focus on the most important things: breathing, fluids, stabilisation.”This helped shape his management style. “I like simplicity and focus. I don’t want complex systems and all-day meetings.”He grew up on in Esbjerg, a port town on the west coast of Denmark, the son of shopkeepers. The family’s modest circumstances became tougher still when his father contracted tuberculosis and moved to a sanatorium. This deepened an interest in physiology that took him to medical school in Copenhagen and later to Harvard.Few others from his community went to university but he stays in touch with his best friend, a postman, with whom he shares a passion for football, particularly Bayern Munich. “He’s been keeping me in touch with World Cup scores,” says Dr Ornskov, who has nonetheless tried to catch as much action as possible from Brazil in between contending with AbbVie’s bid.Married with four children, Dr Ornskov sets aside weekends for family, when he is expected to compensate for his absence during the week by “doing the laundry, mowing the lawn and looking after the kids”.They are planning to move to Boston to eliminate the transatlantic commute. Whether there will still be a job at Shire for Dr Ornskov when they get there may depend on whether its board continues to hold out against AbbVie’s advances.
140;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Shire / AbbVie: let’s have a war;The back-and-forth between pharma companies is about price, not strategy;"The battle is not joined, but the war-dances are great fun. Shire, the target, performed its haka last week, shouting of organic growth. On Wednesday, it was the bidder’s turn. AbbVie’s ritual had several parts.First, the companies will grow faster together than apart. AbbVie’s muscle in research and regulatory affairs will make Shire’s products grow faster, and Shire’s strength in rare diseases and neuroscience will provide foundations for new AbbVie franchises. This is a stretch. In research the worry is that, after a point, industrial scale hurts. In selling, Shire’s products are specialised. A bigger sales force will not make sales pop. And what problems is Shire having with regulatory approvals?Next, the combined company will be more diverse, with more capacity for investments and shareholder returns. Indeed, a diverse drug portfolio can boost a company’s valuation. Gilead, for example, is growing fast, but is very dependent on a few drugs; its shares are cheap. That said, Shire’s valuation is firm. And trumpeting a larger company’s investment capacity and cash returns is silly. What matters are a company’s spending and distributions relative to its capitalisation.Now this: the offer is partly in AbbVie shares, which have “meaningful upside independent of a transaction”. Shire’s board thinks the same of its own shares. In both cases, the share prices before the dance began are a better guide. On the matter of moving AbbVie’s tax domicile to the UK, AbbVie says the transaction is “highly executable”. Executability is not the risk. The risk is that lawmakers will execute the relevant tax loopholes.And so, at last, to the premium, set a third above the price before the offer was announced. Shire wants more. AbbVie must decide if the cost and tax savings are worth it. Enough dancing. Let’s have a war.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex"
141;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;AbbVie lays out case for Shire takeover;;AbbVie said it wanted to “move quickly and co-operatively” to strike a deal with Shire as it set out its case for a £27bn takeover of its UK-listed rival.AbbVie confirmed it would move its tax domicile to the UK in the event of a takeover, joining a series of US companies that have sought to use foreign acquisitions to shelter offshore cash from high US corporate tax rates.This would reduce AbbVie’s average tax rate from 22 per cent to 13 per cent, the company said, while stressing it would keep its headquarters in Chicago and its listing in New York.However, Richard González, AbbVie chief executive, insisted there was a “clear strategic rationale” beyond tax savings, arguing that his company’s greater global scale would allow it to widen the reach of Shire’s products and accelerate drug development.Shire said last week that AbbVie’s £46.26 a share offer– 44 per cent of it in cash – “fundamentally undervalued” its fast-growing portfolio of treatments for rare diseases and neurological disorders.Flemming Ornskov, Shire’s chief executive, on Friday forecast a doubling in annual revenues to $10bn by 2020 as he laid out the case for independence.Mr González said the projection was more optimistic than AbbVie’s own analysis of Shire’s prospects, but signalled flexibility over price if the UK company agreed to enter talks.He said AbbVie was “willing to move quickly and co-operatively to engage …with a view to achieving a transaction for the benefit of all shareholders”. However, Mr González did not rule out a hostile bid if Shire continued to resist, and said AbbVie planned talks with the UK company’s shareholders to seek their backing for a deal.Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Shire could be worth as much as £62 a share to AbbVie, but those at Barclays felt the upper limit was £55.The back-and-forth between pharma companies is about price, not strategyRead moreTouting the appeal of AbbVie stock to Shire shareholders, Mr González highlighted that the company’s market capitalisation was now greater, at $86bn, than the entire value of Abbott Laboratories before its pharmaceuticals division was spun off last year to create AbbVie.He pointed to several potential blockbuster drugs under development by AbbVie, including for hepatitis C and cancer, and said a combination with Shire would make both stronger.Some Democrats on Capitol Hill are pushing for legislation to make it harder for companies to escape US taxes by moving overseas. But AbbVie said it had “thoroughly assessed” its tax proposals and was confident of executing the deal.The US company’s offer represented a 23 per cent premium over Shire’s share price the day before its interest became public. However, AbbVie highlighted the 58 per cent premium over the price in mid-April, before news of Pfizer’s interest in AstraZeneca caused takeover speculation surrounding Shire to intensify.
142;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Shire a jewel in crown among drugmakers;Company’s strong growth and product pipeline are a big attraction;Having started life selling calcium supplements from above a shop in provincial England, Shire has emerged three decades later as one of the most prized assets in the European healthcare sector.On Friday, months of speculation over which big pharmaceuticals group would make the first move for Shire came to an end when AbbVie confirmed it had made a £27bn takeover proposal.Flemming Ornskov, Shire chief executive, made clear on Monday that AbbVie - or any other suitor - would have to bid much higher than the latest £46.11 per share cash and stock offer made by the Chicago-based company.The Dane highlighted Shire’s acceleration in growth since he took charge just over a year ago as the company builds one of the industry’s most promising portfolios of rare disease treatments.“The full benefits of this transformation are yet to be delivered, and we do not think they are fully reflected in the current share price or AbbVie’s proposal,” he told investors on a conference call.Shire is attractive because it possesses two rare qualities for a drugmaker: strong growth among its existing products and a rich pipeline of new products nearing market.While other drugmakers fret over diminishing returns from ageing drugs, Shire still has almost a decade of US patent protection remaining on its top-selling product: Vyvanse, a medicine for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Revenues from Vyvanse rose 19 per cent last year to $1.23bn – a quarter of total sales – and Mr Ornskov on Monday said it would continue growing as the company seeks to expand the drug into a new use as a treatment for binge-eating.Controversy over alleged over-use of amphetamine-based drugs such as Vyvanse for behavioural disorders had in the past been seen as a deterrent to takeover interest from reputation-conscious big pharma groups.However, while Mr Ornskov vigorously defends the therapeutic value of Vyvanse, he has sought to change perceptions of Shire since taking charge by sharpening its focus on rare diseases through a series of acquisitions.The biggest came last November in a $4.2bn takeover of US-based ViroPharma, which makes a treatment for hereditary angioedema, which causes sudden attacks of swelling and affects 18,000 people in the US and EU.The condition is typical of a range of serious rare diseases being targeted by Shire where the small number of patients is offset by strong pricing power because of the absence of alternative treatments.“These are [treatments for] kids who are going straight into organ failure with no known treatment,” Mr Ornskov told the Financial Times. “So the value is very clear.”In addition to high prices, the other appeal of rare disease drugs is the small sales force they require compared with the expensive marketing machines involved in selling medicines for more common ailments.Mr Ornskov said this limited the potential cost savings available to AbbVie in the event of a deal.“There are very few synergies,” he said. “Normally a deal would produce savings through scale or merged sales forces but there is none of that here. I do not think you will find that Shire is a fat organisation.”Jeffrey Holford, analyst at Jefferies, agreed that AbbVie was mainly motivated by “financial engineering” and the potential to lower its tax bill by using Shire as a vehicle to shift its headquarters to the UK – a so-called tax inversion.However, he said there would be an additional benefit for the US company by reducing dependence on its Humira rheumatoid arthritis drug, which accounts for about 60 per cent of revenues and loses patent protection at the end of 2016.“An acquisition by AbbVie may be required to dilute the contribution of Humira over time as well as to prevent AbbVie itself eventually becoming prey to industry consolidation,” said Mr Holford, predicting that a price of £55 per share may be needed to clinch a deal with Shire.That could be a stretch for AbbVie considering the lack of available cost synergies. Another obstacle could be its need to make a sizeable proportion of the offer in shares because the rules governing tax inversions require Shire shareholders to end up owning at least 20 per cent of the merged company.
143;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Shire Pharmaceuticals says it is open to takeover at right price;;Shire has made clear it is open to a takeover at the right price while insisting that the £27bn approach from AbbVie of the US falls far short of an acceptable offer.Flemming Ornskov, Shire’s chief executive, said he had no philosophical objection to a deal but argued that the company had the potential to emulate the success of standalone US biotech companies such as Biogen Idec and Gilead Sciences if it remained independent.“I’m not someone who is entrenched,” he told the Financial Times. “If the board decides that [a sale] is the best option I will make it happen with my management.”However, he insisted that AbbVie’s £46.11-a-share cash and stock offer “substantially undervalued” one of the fastest-growing companies in the pharmaceuticals sector.“This is a premium asset and if someone wants to shorten the life of this company they will have to pay a price that reflects that,” he said.His comments were in contrast to the more confrontational attitude adopted by AstraZeneca, another UK-listed drugmaker, in its successful battle to resist a near-£70bn takeover by Pfizer last month.Whereas Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca chief executive, made clear his scepticism about the merits of big pharmaceutical deals, Mr Ornskov said he felt “no hostility” towards the idea of a takeover.“Everybody can show up and bid for Shire,” he said. “It is an open capitalist market. I’m an acquirer myself.”Shire has long been seen as one of the most attractive acquisition targets among midsized European drugmakers because of its growing portfolio of treatments for rare diseases and the low tax rate that comes with its Irish headquarters.Mr Ornskov said the company was on course for double-digit sales growth from slightly less than $5bn in revenues last year to $6.5bn by 2016 and $10bn by 2020.The bullish defence echoed the aggressive sales targets set by AstraZeneca as it sought to shake-off Pfizer. Mr Ornskov said Shire’s were more reliable because, whereas AstraZeneca’s growth is still years away, his company was already expanding rapidly and had a more advanced pipeline of new products.Of the $10bn of sales forecast by 2020, 70 per cent would come from existing drugs and only 30 per cent from unproven products, Mr Ornskov said.However, as with AstraZeneca, some analysts said the targets looked over-optimistic and lacking in detail. “There were some areas where the assumptions were aggressive versus our estimates,” said Ronny Gal at Bernstein, describing the forecasts as a “missed opportunity” to win over investors.Shire is best known for its Vyvanse medicine for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among children, which accounted for a quarter of sales last year.But Mr Ornskov has focused on diversifying into treatments for rare diseases – defined as conditions affecting fewer than one in 2,000 people.Such treatments have emerged as one of the hottest areas of drug development, as the small patient populations are offset by strong pricing power and high unmet need.Shire has made a series of acquisitions to strengthen its rare disease portfolio, including the $4.2bn takeover of ViroPharma last year and a $260m deal with Lumena last month.Mr Ornskov said the company had undergone a “dramatic step-change” since he took over a year ago, producing total shareholder returns of 99 per cent.This compared with an average of 44 per cent for its biotech peers and 10 per cent for the FTSE 100 index. “We believe this is only the start in our long-term growth profile,” Mr Ornskov said. People close to AbbVie pointed out that much of Shire’s share price increase had come since April, when takeover speculation intensified.The full benefits of this transformation are yet to be delivered and we do not think they are fully reflected in the current share price or AbbVie’s proposalMr Ornskov said the company would continue hunting for acquisitions and pointed out that the 2020 revenue targets did not include the potential benefit of further deals.AbbVie’s offer represented a 23 per cent premium over Shire’s share price the day before news of its interest became public last week, although the stock is up 60 per cent since takeover speculation intensified in April.Shire shares closed down almost 1.6 per cent at £43.03 on Monday.AbbVie, based in Chicago, is the latest among US drugmakers and medical device companies to attempt an overseas acquisition motivated in part by potential tax savings.According to Shire, AbbVie would move its tax domicile to the UK in the event of a takeover – a move that would allow it to shelter offshore cash from high US corporate tax rates.Acquiring Shire would also help AbbVie reduce its dependence on its Humira rheumatoid arthritis drug, which accounts for almost 60 per cent of sales and loses patent protection at the end of 2016.Analysts have predicted that AbbVie could face competition for Shire, with Pfizer, Allergan and Bristol-Myers Squibb among those touted as rival bidders.
144;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Shire shores up defences against AbbVie;Growing sense of siege surrounding UK healthcare sector;Shire will on Monday step up its defence against a £27bn takeover approach by AbbVie amid a growing sense of siege surrounding Britain’s healthcare sector.The UK-listed drugmaker is the third FTSE 100 healthcare company to be targeted by a US rival so far this year after AstraZeneca fought off Pfizer and Smith & Nephew attracted tentative interest from Stryker.All three are now rushing to bolster defences against further potential bids, as cash-rich American companies hunt for overseas assets to help them escape high US corporate tax obligations.Of the four pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers among Britain’s 100 biggest listed companies, GlaxoSmithKline is the only one whose independence has not so far been called into question.While Shire is much smaller and less important to the UK economy than AstraZeneca or GSK, its takeover would nonetheless highlight concern over Britain’s failure to translate its strong science base into a deeper stock of globally competitive medical companies.If sold to AbbVie or another predator, Shire would follow promising UK biotech companies such as Celltech, Powderject and Amersham that have been bought by bigger foreign groups in the past 15 years.However, while Shire was founded in Basingstoke, southern England, in 1986 and has been listed in London since 1996, it will not be able to call on UK political support of the kind that helped AstraZeneca head off Pfizer.The company shifted its headquarters to Dublin in 2008 to take advantage of Ireland’s low corporate tax rate and has moved its research and development to the US, leaving fewer than 500 mostly administrative employees in the UK.Instead of nationalistic arguments, Shire will make a hard financial case for independence when Flemming Ornskov, chief executive, holds a conference call with investors on Monday to explain the company’s stance.He will highlight Shire’s status as one of the fastest-growing companies in the pharmaceuticals sector to argue that AbbVie’s £46.11 per share cash and stock proposal falls well short of what would be required to bring the board to the negotiating table.The offer represented a 23 per cent premium over Shire’s share price the day before news of AbbeVie’s interest became public on Friday, although the stock is up 60 per cent since takeover speculation intensified in April.AbbVie plans to spell out its rationale for a takeover to its shareholders this week, while many analysts expect the US company to return with a higher bid. The company is attracted not only by the potential to move its tax domicile out of the US but also by its need to reduce dependence on its Humira rheumatoid arthritis drug.Shire has increased sales at an average compound rate of 11.6 per cent since 2008 and earnings by 14.7 per cent and the pace has picked up since Danish-born Mr Ornskov took over a year ago.Telling investors there is more growth ahead, he will flesh out his forecast made on Friday to more than double revenues to $10bn by 2020.Shire’s expansion has been driven by surging US demand for its Vyvanse treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which generated a quarter of last year’s $4.8bn in sales.Meanwhile, Mr Ornskov has stepped up diversification into treatments for rare diseases– a fast-growing part of the pharmaceuticals sector that involves small patient numbers but high prices.Several other US drugmakers have been touted as potential rival bidders for Shire ranging from Pfizer to Allergan, the Botox maker resisting a $53bn takeover by Valeant.
145;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-06-20T19:38:57Z;Two tales of upstart pharma;AbbVie and Shire are taking different routes to success;"AbbVie and Shire are both, in different ways, relatively fresh faces on the big pharma block.The former was created last year when Abbott Laboratories spun off its research-based pharmaceuticals business from its medical devices and generic drugs.Shire has been around since the 1980s, but has recently grown in size and prominence through acquisitions and strong growth.AbbVie is much the bigger of the two with revenues last year of almost $19bn and a market capitalisation of $86.3bn, compared with Shire’s revenues of $4.8bn and market value of £25.6bn.However, Shire is growing faster – sales were up 12 per cent in 2013, compared with 3 per cent for AbbVie, and the company said on Friday it expected sales to more than double to $10bn by 2020.Both companies are trying to reduce dependence on a single product. AbbVie generates more than half its sales from Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis drug, while a quarter of Shire’s comes from its Vyvanse treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.AbbVie is seeking fresh growth from a new hepatitis C medicine; Shire is expanding into rare diseases."
146;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-06-20T17:09:39Z;Ofcom broadband report lifts BSkyB;;The way BT Group prices it wholesale broadband fees provided a football-related talking point on the London stock market, as investors mulled the implications for sports rights bidding in the UK.Dominant domestic football broadcaster BSkyB climbed 2.3 per cent to 891½p after regulator Ofcom said in a preliminary assessment that its pay-TV rival BT Group was “close” to squeezing competitors’ margins with its pricing of wholesale fibre broadband.Ofcom’s stance was seen to limit the chances of BT bidding aggressively for English Premiership football rights in the upcoming auction.“One of the cost elements that Ofcom is using in its margin squeeze test is the cost of BT Sport given it is bundled in for free to BT broadband subscribers,” said UBS.“With BT close to the boundary for a margin squeeze, this suggests that BT will have limited scope to be aggressive on acquiring sports rights and give it away for free, particularly with £300m per annum of incremental Champions League costs coming in 2015. Alternatively, it will have to start charging for BT Sport.”BT ended 1.2 per cent lower at 387.8p.In the wider market, broad-based gains took the FTSE 100 up 0.3 per cent on the day to 6,825.20. Over the week, the main London index was up 0.7 per cent.Further bid activity in the pharmaceutical sector provided the main point of interest. Shire jumped 16.9 per cent to £43.71, a record high, after confirming it had rejected three unsolicited takeover approaches from AbbVie, a US rival, with a value of up to £46.11 per share.Takeover speculation around Shire has been constant over the past year, helping the shares climb nearly 130 per cent since last May. “The list of potential alternative US bidders that are small enough to benefit from tax inversion but sufficiently large to acquire Shire is very short,” said UBS. It listed Biogen, Eli Lilly, Celgene and Allergan as the most likely challengers to AbbVie.Shire’s gain buoyed other companies said to have attracted interest from US groups looking to redomicile. Smith & Nephew was up 1.3 per cent to £10.79 and InterContinental Hotels climbed 1.1 per cent to £23.05.SABMiller, which is linked with potential bid interest from Anheuser-Busch InBev, failed to hold intraday gains even after a broker upgrade. Canaccord Genuity upgraded the UK brewer to “buy” and backed the logic of a deal.AB InBev needed to decide within the next year to 18 months whether it would pursue SAB or renew its PepsiCo franchises for a further 10 years, Canaccord reasoned. It reckoned an offer for SAB at £42 a share made sense, and that the merger’s scale and complexity would not dissuade AB InBev management.“We believe a two-year window has now opened within which the deal will be done, or shelved for good. SAB’s best defence would be its share price: good news for shareholders,” Canaccord told clients.But SAB’s shares, which traded as high as £34.32, slipped 0.1 per cent to close at £33.93, a session low.Marks and Spencer slid 1.3 per cent to 433.7p as forecasts drifted lower ahead of its first-quarter trading update due on July 8. SocGen said to expect a 0.5 per cent like-for-like decline in M&S’s general merchandise sales, as disruption from a website relaunch erased the benefit of Easter falling into the quarter.J Sainsbury lost 1.4 per cent to 316.8p on the news that it had set up a joint venture to bring Netto, the Danish discount store chain, back to the UK.HSBC saw the lossmaking venture as the wrong way to take on the discounters. “Sainsbury has the attitude ‘if you can’t beat them join them’, but to us this is a tacit admission its core model can’t compete,” it said. “The solution to the discounter problem is P&L investment, not capital investment with a competitor to accelerate the problem.”Precious metals stocks rose in line with the week’s strong gains for gold and silver prices, sparked by investors covering short positions in the commodities. Randgold Resources moved 1.6 per cent higher to £48.12. Fresnillo was 1.4 per cent higher at 847p.Stocks with defensive properties fell as investors’ appetite for risk rebounded. BG Group fell 1.6 per cent to £12.39. Vodafone, one of the most widely held stocks on the FTSE 100, fell 1.5 per cent to 191.9p.
147;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-06-20T14:38:01Z;Shire / AbbVie: a study in hyperbole;Press releases during merger discussions are less than illuminating;Without hyperbole, the world would come to a halt. Sceptics must be swayed, egos assuaged, details smoothed over. We all add to the stock of oleaginous, bloated rhetoric – not hoping to deceive, but just to keep the ball rolling. Still, hyperbole requires occasional deflation. The press releases that companies exchange during merger discussions are a rich field for this activity.Shire, explaining its decision to reject AbbVie’s £46-per-share offer in cash and scrip, says the offer “fundamentally undervalued” the company. Standard talk, and probably untrue. The day before the offer, the market had concluded that Shire was worth £37. The market is sometimes wrong but, as stock pickers know to their sorrow, not often. More to the point: a look at Shire’s stock chart shows that a significant amount of value has already been added, on top of the company’s independent prospects. Shire’s stock leapt in mid-April and soon ran up by over a quarter. What had happened? Pfizer made its bid for AstraZeneca. A game of “What British Isles drug group could be bought by a US company looking to cut its taxes?” broke out. AbbVie’s offer is 60 per cent above Shire’s April 15 level.Shire’s board also believes that the company’s sales will double between 2013 and 2020. This does not sound ambitious. The company already doubled its sales between 2007 and 2013 (a year less). But the law of large numbers is working against Shire now. Between now and 2017, analysts (an optimistic bunch) expect average annual growth to be lower than that. After 2017, the number of analysts with estimates dwindles. The reason is simple. In pharmaceuticals, estimating revenue growth more than a few years out is silly. The business is too chancy.Finally, in praise of Shire’s current management, we are told that the company’s margins have expanded quickly. So they have. Shire has been working hard to cut costs. But this makes the premium that AbbVie is offering all the more impressive. To recoup their investment, the buyers will not be able to cut those costs again.The offer could go higher still, if Shire comes to the table. Less hyperbole, more negotiation, please.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
148;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-06-20T07:35:40Z;Shire rejects £27bn AbbVie approach;;Shire, the UK-listed specialty drugmaker, has rejected a £27bn takeover bid from AbbVie in the latest attempt by a US healthcare company to buy an overseas rival with a lower tax burden.Dublin-based Shire said the cash and stock offer “fundamentally undervalued” its business and set out bullish growth targets as it sought shareholder support for its go-it-alone stance.The offer marks the second time in two months that a FTSE 100 drugmaker has faced an unwanted approach from a US rival motivated at least in part by potential tax savings.Whereas Pfizer’s abortive £70bn bid for AstraZeneca faced political resistance in the UK, a takeover of Shire would be less contentious because its headquarters are in Ireland and most of its research and development are in the US.Shire has long been the focus of takeover speculation, not only because of its exposure to Ireland’s low corporate tax rate but also because of its status as one of the fastest-growing companies in the pharmaceuticals sector.Analysts said AbbVie’s approach could spur rival bids from other companies that have been linked with Shire, including Allergan, the Botox maker which is fighting off a $53bn takeover by Valeant.“Shire is clearly in play,” said Ronny Gal, analyst at Bernstein. “If other interested parties want to bid, it is likely they will need to do so now.”AbbVie, a research-based drugmaker spun off from Abbott Laboratories last year, said it had made three indicative offers to Shire’s board since early May – each one rebuffed – and talks had now ceased.The latest, received on May 30, was worth £46.11 per share – £20.44 in cash and the rest in AbbVie stock – and represented a 23 per cent premium to Thursday’s closing price. Shire shares climbed 16 per cent to £43.50 on Friday and have more than doubled in the past year.Savvas Neophytou, analyst at Panmure Gordon, predicted that an offer in excess of £50 would be needed to clinch a deal. Chicago-based AbbVie has until July 18 to make a firm bid or walk away under UK takeover rules.More than $200bn of healthcare deals have been proposed so far this year as cash-rich drugmakers and medical device companies seek new sources of growth.Many of them have involved US companies looking to buy assets in countries with lower corporate tax rates, such as Ireland and the UK, as a way to shelter offshore cash from relatively high US rates.Last week, Medtronic, the US-based device maker, struck a deal to buy Ireland’s Covidien for $42.9bn in the biggest so-called “tax inversion” agreed so far.Some Democrats on Capitol Hill have threatened legislation to make it harder for companies to escape the US taxman, but there has so far been no sign of Republicans rushing to help close the loophole.Mr Gal said action was unlikely before the next US presidential election in 2016. In the meantime, the prospect of more tax-driven deals would put a premium on midsized European drug companies. According to Shire, AbbVie planned to move its tax domicile to the UK in the event of a takeover.Setting out its defence, Shire issued a new forecast that it would more than double revenues to $10bn by 2020 and said AbbVie’s offer would deny shareholders the full benefits of this growth.More than a quarter of Shire revenues come from its Vyvanse treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – making it a lightning rod for debate over whether US children are being overmedicated for behavioural problems.Flemming Ornskov, who took over as chief executive a year ago, has sought to reduce dependence on the ADHD market by stepping up Shire’s expansion into rare diseases through a series of acquisitions.
149;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2014-06-10T22:10:41Z;Hepatitis C: Gilead’s Odyssey;Progress shows why big drug companies are good things;The Hepatitis C virus is the kind of problem that drug companies are meant to solve. The World Health Organisation thinks as many as 150m people have chronic HCV infections, and as many as half a million deaths a year result. Until recently, the standard treatments – interferon and ribavirin – offered poor efficacy and serious side effects.Gilead’s $11bn acquisition of Pharmasset, in 2011, brought along an HCV treatment, sofosbuvir. In clinical trials, in combination with the old treatments, as many as 90 per cent of patients were effectively cured. The drug was approved last December. In the first quarter of this year alone, its sales were a stunning $2.3bn – nearly half of Gilead’s total. Hopes are high. ISI Group thinks that the HCV market will be worth $15-$20bn annually by 2018. And Gilead’s stock has run up nearly 300 per cent over three years.Sofosbuvir is, however, one of three new classes of drug – NS5As, protease inhibitors and nucleotide inhibitors – that attack the virus at different points. And the race is on to develop an ideal combination. The contestants: Gilead, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. The combined research and development budgets of these companies run to $25bn a year. Combinations of two of the drug types from Gilead, Bristol-Myers and AbbVie are under review with the US authorities. Merck just spent $3.85bn to buy Idenix, a nucleotide developer, making way for one pill containing all three types.A bonanza for patients, and a sterling example of why for-profit drug development works. A puzzle for investors, though. How will the profits be split? Will winner take most? If there are multiple good treatments, will governments and insurers play one company against the other, bringing prices down? Hard to say. This is reflected in Gilead’s valuation: while robust growth is expected, it trades at 13 times earnings, below the group average. The progress against HCV shows why big drug companies are good things, and why their shares tend to be cheap.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
150;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Hepatitis C: Treated – at a price;New drugs to combat the disease are a boost for the industry but treatment costs are causing controversy;"Gemma Peppe lived with hepatitis C for two decades before she – and the teenage son she inadvertently infected at birth – received a first round of painful and ineffective treatment designed to stave off the risk of liver disease. “The side effects were dreadful,” she recalls. “You feel like you have flu, you become terribly angry and mentally unstable. My son stopped going to school and our house was like a bloodbath.”Since 2012, both of their lives have been transformed after switching to an alternative experimental medicine that offered quicker, simpler and more effective treatment to them – and soon potentially to millions of other patients around the world.Ms Peppe is working again in Britain and her son, after four years out of education, has resumed studying and won a university place to study mathematics. “It’s incredible. I thought I would die before my pension but now I feel like I’ve shed 15 years,” she says.The launch in recent weeks of sofosbuvir, the first of a series of new drugs for hepatitis C virus (HCV) set for regulatory approval, raises the prospect of curing and potentially eliminating a disease that levies a heavy global burden.The new medicines will also provide a substantial financial boost to pharmaceutical companies after a fallow period in which there have been few significant “blockbuster” drugs, such as the cholesterol-lowering statins of the 1990s. Analysts say HCV medicines will generate billions of dollars in annual revenues, making them among the most lucrative of a new crop of drugs.“This is a watershed moment for hepatitis C with newly available, highly effective, easy to administer therapies,” says Prof David Goldberg, an epidemiologist at Health Protection Scotland.Yet in one of many parallels between HCV and HIV, sofosbuvir has sparked controversy over its high price. Gilead, the California company that produces sofosbuvir, known by the brand name Sovaldi, is charging $84,000 for the 12-week course of treatment in the US. Many patients will struggle to afford it in its home market. In poorer countries, still fewer are likely to gain access.● About 150m people are infected with the virus● More than 350,000 people die each year from hepatitis C-related liver diseases● The body fights off the virus in about 25 per cent of cases● The market for hepatitis C treatments is forecast to hit $15.5bn by 2022As Médecins Sans Frontières, the medical charity, argued before a discussion on the topic at the World Health Organisation: “New oral treatments set to become available in coming months will revolutionise hepatitis C treatment . . . However, for government programmes to be able to scale up and address the true burden of the epidemic, [they] must be affordable.”HCV infects an estimated 170m people globally. Like HIV, it can be transmitted sexually, via blood transfusion, from syringes shared by drug users, and from mothers to their children.HCV appears more resilient, however, surviving more easily on inadequately sterilised surgical instruments and tattooing equipment. The UK National Health Service says it may be transferred via shared toothbrushes, razors or rolled banknotes used by those snorting cocaine.There is no vaccine to prevent either HIV or HCV, and both typically take a number of years before symptoms develop. They are often long left undiagnosed, rendering eventual treatment more difficult and costly and increasing the risk of their inadvertent spread to others.Without treatment HIV leaves the body at risk from opportunistic infections and almost inevitably death. By contrast, the body fights off HCV in about 25 per cent of cases. In the UK and other countries, HCV now kills more people than HIV.Over 20 years or more, HCV causes liver disease. It is ultimately responsible for the majority of cirrhosis and liver cancer cases. Many of those infected may unwittingly consume large volumes of alcohol, intensifying and accelerating the effects of the disease on the liver.Treatment is arduous. Patients require a year of regular injections of interferon and swallowing the pill ribavirin, which cause severe side effects. At best, only half of patients who complete their therapy are cured.“The treatments are quite toxic,” says Barry Bernstein, head of antiviral development programmes at AbbVie, another drug company gearing up to launch new treatments. “Many patients decline them because they are so burdensome. People having injections on Friday night may spend the weekend in bed with flu-like symptoms and cannot then work.”That explains the excitement surrounding the next generation of treatments. The parallels between the two viruses mean that the billions of dollars invested by universities and companies in developing HIV drugs over the past 30 years have helped understanding of how to tackle HCV.Many of the researchers, such as Mr Bernstein, have worked on both diseases. So have more than a dozen drug companies: alongside AbbVie and Gilead, other large pharmaceutical producers in the field include Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Roche, Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline.Some of the drugs they are studying – such as protease inhibitors designed to stop the viruses replicating – are closely related chemically to HIV equivalents. Researchers treating HIV discovered the need to attack the virus simultaneously with different types of medicines, ideally combined in a single pill. They are now applying the same principle to HCV.“There were corollaries from HIV,” says John McHutchison, senior vice-president for liver disease therapeutics at Gilead. “The viruses are very similar, with a very high turnover and rate of replication. There is a highly reproducible cell culture system to test for molecules.”Clinical trials and regulatory scrutiny are still required before many of the HCV drugs win approval, and their use without the need for interferon and ribavirin becomes possible. Not all are equally effective against different strains, nor for patients with other medical complications.But the positive results in patients such as Ms Peppe and her son (who used AbbVie’s experimental compound) have increased interest.They have also helped spur investments by drug companies.“There’s a lot of hope associated with these drugs,” says Ueli Fankhauser, head of global product strategy at Roche. “The race is coming to the market and will result in tremendous benefit to the patient with the chances of being cured at 90-95 per cent.”Vertex, the first company with an important recent breakthrough in hepatitis C, saw a surge in its valuation with the launch of Incivek in 2011. It generated sales of $1.6bn within its first 12 months on the market. A still stronger signal of the scientific and commercial potential of new treatments came when Gilead surprised the markets by paying $11.2bn for Pharmasset in 2012. That gave it control of the then still experimental drug Sovaldi.In a research note last week, Barclays Capital forecast that Gilead would generate $416m in the first quarter this year alone from sales of the drug. “The highly anticipated and closely watched launch of Sovaldi has so far performed up to, if not above, expectations,” it said.Others forecast that Sovaldi will overtake Incivek as the most rapid drug launch in the industry, generating $2.5bn this year. EvaluatePharma, a consultancy, judged the drug to be “easily the industry’s most valuable pipeline product”, estimating its annual sales would reach $7.4bn by 2018. Datamonitor, a market research specialist, says the market for all HCV treatments will total $15.5bn by 2022.…Yet Gilead’s strategy has also sparked criticism over the speed of progress and the affordability of its treatments – critiques likely to develop for its peers, too. It reflects another parallel between HCV with HIV: patient activists.For many years, HIV patients were in the vanguard of medical campaigning, using sit-ins, demonstrations and political lobbying to accelerate funding, research and availability of treatment. HCV has never had a high political profile.But many, including those with both viruses, are now reapplying their energies from HIV to its cousin.Critics argue that Gilead delayed the launch of life-changing combination HCV therapy by refusing to test Sovaldi in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s compound daclatasvir, despite results showing that the two drugs together generate high cure rates. Instead, Gilead combined Sovaldi with ledipasvir, its own experimental combination treatment, which had been further behind in the race to win regulatory approval.The company has also priced Sovaldi expensively, arguing that its speed and efficacy justifies a premium over existing HCV therapies – not to mention the need to recover its development costs and the $11bn purchase price of Pharmasset.Andrew Hill, a researcher at Liverpool University, argues that the new HCV drugs could be manufactured for just $100 to $200 for a course of treatment, and that high volume sales would offset lower prices.“The question is whether you treat a very small number with low volumes and high margin, and have the epidemic carrying on for decades; or you treat many more with the chance to eradicate the disease,” he says.“Given the overall size of the epidemic, even if prices were cut tenfold, the companies would still make a profit,” he says. He points out that in the UK alone, treating everyone with the disease at the current pricetag would cost £13bn, more than the annual NHS bill for all drugs.Successful activism to extend access to antiretroviral drugs for HIV to poorer countries has encouraged advocates to do the same for HCV. Indian groups launched a legal challenge to Gilead’s Sovaldi patent application, seeking to allow generic companies to make it at lower cost.“Once people see you can make a real difference with oral therapies, it spreads through the community very fast,” says Leena Menghaney of MSF. “The movement is being led by people who are not scared of demonstrating or going to jail. They are willing to do everything to get treatment.”John Milligan, Gilead’s chief operating officer, points out that Sovaldi offers time and cost savings over existing HCV treatments – particularly when taking into account the savings from reduced liver disease.But he also pledges to examine ways to make the drug available more cheaply in lower income countries, as Gilead did for its widely used HIV treatments. Unlike the latter disease, he points out that there are no donors to help support the costs.HCV shares another characteristic with HIV: the need for prevention. The number of new infections remains high because of inadequate diagnoses, as well as poor blood and infection control standards.With the new generation of drugs now becoming available, the pressures on governments to buy them – and companies to make them available affordably – are set to grow.Charles Gore, head of the World Hepatitis Alliance, an umbrella organisation of patient groups, cautions: “It’s HIV all over again. Can we not make the same mistakes but instead learn from painful lessons? Or will companies wait for activists to set fire to their stands at scientific conferences?”——————————————-The good deed that led to disaster in EgyptAlan Fenwick went to work in Egypt in 1988 to help tackle bilharzia, a parasitic worm disease that can cause severe liver damage. He discovered a country struggling with the legacy of past efforts to address the first problem, which had in turn made the burden of the second much heavier.Today, the result is that Egypt has a far higher prevalence of hepatitis C than anywhere in the world: an estimated 15 per cent of the population aged 15-59 years old has been infected with the virus, imposing enormous costs on the health system. Nearly 200,000 people have HCV.The problem began during the 1950s when a programme was launched to treat and prevent schistosomiasis (bilharzia), which infected people exposed to the Nile’s stagnant floodwaters. The good intentions had dreadful consequences.The approach was to provide “mass drug administration” of tartar emetic, a poison injected into humans to kill the worms or prevent them spreading around the body. To do so, health workers unaware of the risks of infection used the same poorly sterilised glass syringes on multiple patients.“The drug had to be given daily for 14 consecutive days,” recalls Prof Fenwick. “That’s an awful lot of cross needle work. They didn’t even know hepatitis C existed at the time, but when one person had it, they spread it.”It was only in the 1990s that blood tests were developed for the virus and identified what Tom Strickland, a researcher at Imperial College in London, has described as Egypt’s “occult” hepatitis C epidemic. By then it had far overtaken bilharzia as the main cause of liver disease. The two conditions together make treatment still more complex.The old injectable treatment has now long been replaced with the far safer pill praziquantel, in a control programme for bilharzia still overseen by experts including Prof Fenwick. Yet the underlying infection of hepatitis C has continued to rise and illness and death is projected to double over the next 20 years.While such mass injection programmes no longer exist, Egypt still has low-quality infection control, permitting transmission through blood products, surgical and dental operations. Anecdotally, there are also examples of children scavenging hospital waste dumps for discarded syringes, which they sell for reuse."
151;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2013-06-17T22:04:37Z;Payments to delay generic drug rivals to be scrutinised;;Payments by drug companies to delay generic competition will be open to fresh antitrust scrutiny in the US, following a Supreme Court ruling on Monday.In a decision that boosts long-running efforts by the Federal Trade Commission to query so-called “pay for delay” deals, the justices argued by 5 votes to 3 that an Atlanta court was wrong to throw out a case brought by the regulators.The ruling provides a fresh twist to a dispute over efforts by Solvay, now part of AbbVie, to delay cut price versions of its AndroGel product following payments to generic rivals including Actavis.The judgment does not outlaw such payments, but it rejected drug company claims that their patents allowed them to exclude competitors, which had limited the FTC’s abilities to pursue such cases in the past.It comes as European antitrust regulators prepare to fine the Danish pharmaceutical group Lundbeck for a similar pay to delay deal within the EU, as well as some national probes including one brought earlier this year against GlaxoSmithKline by the UK’s Office of Fair Trading.Regulators argue the practice means health systems are deprived too long of cheap drugs. The companies deny the claims and argue settlements bring quicker legal certainty to complex disputes and often still permit generic versions to be launched ahead of patent expiry.
152;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2013-05-28T13:40:49Z;Generic drugs: Watchdogs probe pay-for-delay deals;Big pharma companies are defending payments to producers of low-cost rivals, says Andrew Jack;Sir Andrew Witty winces at the term, but the chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline is one of a growing number of chief executives under scrutiny for the use of “pay for delay” agreements between drug manufacturers holding patents on medicines and their generic rivals.For years, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has raised concerns about such deals, but it has been unsuccessful in efforts to bring legal actions to challenge them. In Europe, the competition directorate gave the issue a new prominence in a pharmaceutical “sectoral inquiry” that warned such practices could violate EU law.At root, “pay for delay” implies that patent holders provide money to generic rivals to defer threatened launches of lower-cost versions of their medicines. In reality, the pattern is more complex and – to those who defend it – ultimately pragmatic.Jason Rutt, a lawyer with Rouse Patents, a specialist intellectual property firm, says: “I hate the term. It makes settlements seem like the pharma version of Danegeld, with innovators paying money to make marauding generic Vikings go away without a fight. In practice, it’s the bitterly contested resolution of some fairly brutal, red-in-tooth-claw litigation.”In the US, the debate has advanced to the Supreme Court, where the judges are currently scrutinising a case brought by the FTC against Solvay, part of AbbVie and producer of the testosterone product AndroGel, and three generic rivals including Actavis.The agency has estimated that there are several dozen such agreements reached each year in the US in the industry, resulting in $3.5bn in additional costs for drugs in the absence of more aggressive competition.In Brussels, the antitrust authorities last year pursued cases against Lundbeck, which is accused of delaying the launch of generic versions of citalopram, its antidepressant, in agreement with generic rivals. A parallel case against Servier is examining deals with rivals over perindopril, a blood pressure drug. Lundbeck and Servier are contesting the EU cases.In 2011, the commission identified 120 patent settlements in Europe covering more than 40 medicines, of which 30 per cent limited generic entry and 11 per cent involved a payment to the generic producer. It saw the trend as flat or falling, suggesting its own scrutiny is acting as a deterrent.The issue was rekindled in the UK in April when the Office of Fair Trading in April accused GSK of abusing its dominant position through an agreement with three companies – Alpharma, Generics UK and Ivax – concerning its antidepressant paroxetine (branded as Paxil).The watchdog said: “The OFT’s provisional view is that these agreements included substantial payments from GSK to the generic companies in return for their commitment to delay their plans to supply paroxetine independently.”GSK argues that the deal had already been scrutinised by the European competition authorities, which have not pursued it, and that such arrangements typically led to earlier launch of generic products and greater certainty for all parties involved.The companies are fighting the allegations, and Sir Andrew at GSK, who will not comment on the specifics of the OFT case, told journalists: “I push back at the description of pay for delay. It’s a very convenient label people have chosen to use but, in very many situations, a settlement leads to a generic product being available before the expiration of a patent. It achieves the elimination of uncertainty for both sides.”Mr Rutt agrees: “It’s easy to characterise pay for delay as a way of innovators buying off a lazy generic competitor industry who are happy to be complicit in such deals,” he says. “It probably helps consumers, upsets both innovators and generics [companies] equally in the terms agreed and is, to my mind, a reasonable way to resolve disputes.”He argues that all patents are subject to potential legal challenges, hence to the considerable cost and risk of disputes. “The owner and the opponent have varying degrees of confidence in it,” he says. “The patent holder may be 75 per cent certain he’ll win, but losing is a disaster. The patentee is also probably under pressure from shareholders to give some certainty around future earnings. So he compromises, agrees a pay for delay settlement and the generics get on the market a bit earlier. The US patient gets a break he probably wouldn’t have got had litigation been seen through.”That may be true, and so far the legal precedents to expose abuses of pay for delays have been scant. But, at a time when healthcare systems are keen to encourage price competition for medicines and save money, antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic now seem determined to pursue the issue into the courts.
153;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2013-04-30T22:17:24Z;Court stops EU regulator releasing drug trial data;;The European Medicines Agency has been blocked from releasing clinical trial data generated by AbbVie and InterMune, under a court ruling issued on Tuesday with wide-ranging implications for the pharmaceuticals industry.The EU’s General Court upheld requests from the two drug companies for a temporary stay in making public information on tests of their medicines in patients, stalling the agency’s policy of releasing data since 2010.News of the decision caused anger among the coalition of independent researchers, medical journals and academics, which has called for full release of clinical data to allow broader scrutiny of the safety and efficacy of medicines.Dr Ben Goldacre, author of the book Bad Pharma and co-founder of the AllTrials campaign seeking industry transparency, called the judgment “a disgrace”. Tracey Brown, head of Sense About Science, a campaigning group, said: “The European courts are indicating that they are on the wrong side of history.”However, the ruling will provide relief to some drug companies that have argued that such information is commercially sensitive and could undermine their competitive position and the incentives to conduct research.The legal judgment, pending full consideration of the two cases by the court, came as the medicines agency stressed its determination to pursue release of data following consultations expected to lead to draft guidance in June.In a statement, the agency said that it “regrets” the court’s decision, is considering whether to appeal, and will still consider releasing information similar to that contested by the two companies “on a case-by-case basis”.The agency said that it would not release data it considered commercially confidential and would not impinge on companies intellectual property rights. But Martin Harvey, an agency spokesman, said these issues were “technical and not show stoppers” to the release even of “raw” data on the detailed results of drugs in individual patients.Since November 2010, the agency has received 613 requests to release data on medicines it reviewed, and has released 1.9m pages of documents in response. In an indication of potential commercial sensitivities, a third of the requests came from rival drug companies themselves, and a further 22 per cent from lawyers and consultants.UCB of Belgium launched the request for data on AbbVie’s trial documents, although it has since withdrawn its demand. Boehringer Ingelheim of Germany filed for information on InterMune’s products. Both rivals were developing similar compounds.The industry is divided on trial transparency, with both GlaxoSmithKline and Roche among the companies that have pledged support for far greater release of their clinical data.They and others have expressed the need both to safeguard patient confidentiality and to release the data only to legitimate researchers who can responsibly interpret and publish findings. The Wellcome Trust, the UK based medical research philanthropic group, is helping co-ordinate discussions on a mechanism for independent review and release of trial results.

Pfizer, Merck, Eli Lilly and AbbVie (formerly Abbott) are all expanding revenues between very little and not at all, a pattern that is expected to persist. They have clean balance sheets. Dividend yields are 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent, and dividend payouts amount to 40 per cent or 50 per cent of net profits. The valuations, varying from just over 13 times forward earnings (Merck) and just under 15 times (AbbVie), are the highest in several years – though it should be kept in mind that earnings multiples are hitting multiyear highs across plenty of other sectors.All four companies have solidly outperformed the market through the last leg of the rally, extending back to the autumn of 2011. This makes sense, given that defensive stocks of all sorts have been favoured.The interesting exception is Bristol-Myers Squibb. It has long commanded a premium price-to-earnings ratio; the multiple now sits at 21. And while it still offers one of the highest dividend yields in the group, its payout ratio – the portion of this year’s expected earnings that will go to paying the dividend – is higher than the others, at more than 70 per cent. Investors are willing to pay up, and accept a thinner comfort margin around its dividend, for two reasons. Bristol has executed very well, controlling costs, spinning off non-core assets at good prices and using product partnerships to spread risk. Second, its above-average pipeline, highlighted by the just-approved cardiovascular drug Eliquis and the late-stage cancer drug Nivolumab, has kept growth expectations high. But the time to deliver is arriving. Early Eliquis sales figures will arrive in the coming quarters and key data on Nivolumab are expected soon. Investors who have shunned the safety of the crowd and bet on leadership will soon know whether they have been bold or foolhardy.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
155;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2013-03-10T17:36:56Z;Pharma group sues European regulator over data;;A leading US pharmaceutical group has sued Europe’s medicines regulator, in a sharp intensification of the battle between advocates for greater transparency on drugs and companies who fear their competitive position will be undermined by more openness.AbbVie has sought an injunction to block the European Medicines Agency from releasing detailed data on the effects in individual patients in clinical trials of its top-selling medicine Humira for rheumatoid arthritis.The action, taken in the European Union’s general court, follows two Freedom of Information requests to the Agency in 2012 to release “raw data” on the drug’s safety and efficacy.A second legal action has been brought against the agency by InterMune, a Californian biotech company. The European and US pharmaceutical industry bodies have lodged supportive pleas.While public debate has concentrated on opening data to independent researchers to prevent any concealment of side effects of drugs by companies, the cases show that rival companies have been most active in seeking the information. UCB, the Belgian drug company, was one of those seeking reports on AbbVie’s Humira.AbbVie confirmed that it had filed legal actions “seeking to protect AbbVie’s confidential and commercially-sensitive information.” It said it supported “transparency of clinical research and safety information for the benefit of patients and healthcare professionals [but not] the disclosure of commercially confidential information that does not meaningfully contribute to the scientific review or evaluation of our products.”The legal decision will have important implications for a broader commitment made late last year by the agency to publicly release by the start of 2014 all data on drugs submitted to it, once it has made a decision either to approve or reject them for use across the EU.The fight comes at a time of rising demands for transparency, with a campaign led by medical publications including the British Medical Journal concerned that too many drugs are approved and prescribed based on selective evidence that exaggerates benefits and downplays the risks of drugs.This week, the British parliament’s science and technology committee begins hearings on whether pharmaceutical companies “cherry pick clinical trial data to promote their drugs and hide potential defects”.Drug companies say full data transparency risks jeopardising patient confidentiality, misinterpretation by non-experts and undermining sensitive commercial information that weakens the incentives to invest in research and development of new medicines.Competitors developing similar drugs or generic companies trying to more rapidly produce cheaper copies could both exploit more openness.The European Medicines Agency said the “overwhelming majority” of freedom of information requests it had received for clinical trial data came not from independent researchers but drug companies, industry consultants and lawyers.
156;ABBV;Abbvie Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
