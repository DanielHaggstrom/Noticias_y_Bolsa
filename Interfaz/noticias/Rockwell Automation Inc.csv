0;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2019-01-29T17:00:08Z;Rockwell Automation bucks China weakness as sales grow;;Rockwell Automation lowered its forecast for full-year revenue on Tuesday amid uncertainty over trade. But earnings in the group’s first quarter came in better than Wall Street anticipated, reflecting resiliency in China and sales growth in North America.The company, a provider of factory machinery and software, now expects to book sales growth of 2.2 per cent to 5.2 per cent in fiscal 2019, down from its prior guidance of 2.7 per cent to 5.7 per cent. Rockwell also lowered its earnings estimate to a range of $7.33 and $7.73 a share. It previously expected $8.92 to $9.32 a share.Projections for adjusted earnings per share of $8.85 to $9.25, as well as organic sales growth, were unchanged.“We see continuing uncertainty due to trade tensions and geopolitical risks,” chief executive Blake Moret said in a statement. “However, forecasts continue to call for industrial production growth.”Mr Moret added that Rockwell had a “good” first quarter as its backlog grew and project quoting activity was strong.Some manufacturers have warned that softness in China has dragged on sales, fuelling worries the world’s second-largest economy, along with US corporate earnings, could suffer from a prolonged trade dispute. Most recently, Caterpillar and Nvidia rattled Wall Street with downbeat forecasts, citing weaker results in China.For Rockwell, Chinese sales were up in the mid-single digits during the quarter ending on December 31, and sales across Asia expanded 4 per cent. Mr Moret, speaking during an earnings call, said mass transit and electric vehicle manufacturers contributed to sales strength in China.He also said that despite moderating activity in China, the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment is on pace to record sales growth in the low-single digits for the 2019 fiscal year.North America and Latin America also drove first-quarter sales growth for Rockwell, whose total revenue climbed 3.5 per cent to $1.64bn. That was slightly better than a consensus estimate of $1.63bn, according to a Refinitiv poll.Milwaukee-based Rockwell said it earned net income of $80.3m, or 66 cents a share. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported a loss of $236.4m, or $1.84 a share, partly due to charges related to US tax reform. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share rose to $2.21 from $1.96. Analysts were looking for earnings of $1.99 a share.Investors cheered the first-quarter results, driving up shares by 5.4 per cent to $172.37 in recent trading.
1;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2018-06-11T19:46:01Z;Industrial cyber security group Claroty raises $60m;Start-up draws backers including Siemens and Schneider as attacks boost software demand;Claroty, a start-up specialising in cyber security for the industrial internet, has raised $60m from investors including equipment manufacturers Rockwell, Siemens and Schneider-Electric.The company expanded its bookings by more than 300 per cent last year as demand for security software to protect critical infrastructure and the factory floor from cyber attacks soared.Galina Antova, Claroty’s chief business development officer, led industrial cyber security services at Siemens before co-founding the company with former members of the Israeli army’s cyber offensive operations team, Unit 8200.She said the ransomware attacks that hit industrial control systems at multinationals including shipping company Maersk and delivery company FedEx last year had been a “wake-up call” that had cost those companies more $300m each.Ms Antova said industrial companies are now realising that their systems are vulnerable not just to nation-state actors but to anyone who wants to have a “direct impact on their bottom line” by stopping production. The start-up now has customers in nine industries and on six continents.The industrial “ internet of things” has been hard to secure because many machines run on outdated operating systems, are poorly integrated and struggle to communicate with the IT systems used to monitor network security. The US department for homeland security warned in March that Russian hackers were targeting a range of critical industries including energy, nuclear, water, aviation and critical manufacturing.Claroty has developed technology that works on the full gamut of connected machinery and can spot and communicate suspicious anomalies to IT staff through their normal systems. Ms Antova said it had much “broader coverage” than its competitors so that Claroty’s clients did not have to hire the hard-to-find specialists in securing the industrial internet.Claroty partners with its strategic investors to sell to customers as they buy new machinery, as well as selling directly. Frank Kulaszewicz, senior vice-president of architecture and software at Rockwell Automation, said he had partnered with Claroty since 2016 and it had been a “key element” of its threat-detection service.“Our investment in Claroty is a logical extension of our ongoing strategic partnership,” he said.Temasek, a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, led the round, which brings the total raised by the start-up to $93m. The company has taken funds from a large utility company which is a customer. Previous investors including Bessemer Venture Partners and Team8, an Israeli accelerator for cyber security start-ups, also participated in the round. ** This article has been amended to show that Claroty has taken funds from one company which is a customer
2;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Rockwell boosts sales forecast in wake of rebuffed Emerson bid approach;Customer demand continues to lift sales at equipment maker;Rockwell Automation has boosted its sales growth guidance for 2018, underscoring the factory equipment maker’s decision late last year to reject a $29bn takeover offer from rival Emerson Electric.Milwaukee-based Rockwell, which makes factory automation equipment for sectors like autos and oil and gas, said it expects sales growth of 7.5 per cent (or, 6.5 per cent on an organic basis) in 2018 compared to a previous forecast of 4.5 per cent (3.5 per cent).This comes as the company reported a 6.5 per cent year-on-year rise in sales in its fiscal first quarter to $1.59bn, or 5.3 per cent on an organic basis.The company posted a net loss of $236.4m for the quarter ended December 31, compared to a $214.7m profit a year ago, owing to the recent changes to the national Tax Act.Adjusted earnings per share rose 12 per cent to $1.96 in the first quarter, and the company has forecast earnings of between $7.60 and $7.90 per share for fiscal 2018.Blake Moret, chairman and chief executive, said global economic conditions “continue to provide a solid backdrop for customer demand” and that the company was well positioned to take advantage of “the attractive opportunities in the industrial automation and information market.”Last October, Emerson Electric went public with a takeover offer for Rockwell. The following month, it walked away from the proposed $29bn tie-up after failing to win the support from investors. Rockwell’s board also rejected the deal, saying it undervalued the company and created long-term risks for shareholders, partly owing to the nature of the bid which included a 40 per cent stock component.
3;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2017-11-28T19:30:28Z;Emerson walks away from $29bn Rockwell bid;Analysts had raised questions about the industrial logic of the deal;Emerson Electric, the US automation and building equipment group, has withdrawn its $29bn bid for rival Rockwell Automation after failing to win support from investors.Emerson said that it would seek small bolt-on deals alongside a $1bn share buyback instead, after shareholders supported the Rockwell board’s opposition to the deal.Emerson’s approach was an attempt to reshape the fast-changing industrial automation industry, which is being transformed by technologies including low-cost connected devices, advanced data analytics, and augmented and virtual reality.Rockwell has been at the forefront of that shift, helping to push its shares up by 197 per cent over the past ten years. Emerson has a strong automation division, but also has other more traditional business lines including thermostats, refrigeration and air-conditioning. Its shares have risen just 17 per cent in the past decade.Emerson went public with its bid in October, and last week raised its offer slightly and boosted the cash component, but Rockwell’s board has continued to reject the approach. Rockwell issued a statement on Tuesday morning thanking its shareholders for their “input and support”.Dave Farr, Emerson’s chief executive, told analysts on a call on Tuesday that he believed its offer, which was about 60 per cent in cash and 40 per cent in shares, was “a very good proposal for Rockwell relative to shareholders” but it was “time to move on”.Emerson tried to meet and talk on the phone with Rockwell’s senior management to explain the rationale for a deal, but was never given the opportunity to do so, said a person close to the company. He added that this showed that Rockwell’s management was opposed “for social reasons not strategic ones”.However, Rockwell‘s board said last week that it had rejected the bid on the grounds that it undervalued the company, created long-term risks for shareholders, and would “create a company that is not well-positioned to compete successfully in the evolving market.”Several analysts had raised questions about the industrial logic of the deal. Rockwell is strongest in discrete manufacturing for industries such as car manufacturing, while Emerson is strongest in process industries, including oil and gas.The two companies also use different software platforms, which would have had to be run in parallel by the merged group.Sawyer Rice, an analyst a Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note last week that “the combined company would be less competitive”, and Emerson was “understating investment needed and overstating revenue synergy opportunities”.Vertical Research Partners argued that Emerson needed Rockwell more than Rockwell needed Emerson.Rockwell’s shares rose by about 2 per cent on the news that the bid had been withdrawn. Analysts have suggested that other companies interested in strengthening their automation businesses, including ABB and Siemens, could make bids.Shares in Emerson increased by 3.1 per cent.There was also speculation among analysts that Emerson might now think about a break-up. Craig Resnick of ARC Advisory said: “If Emerson was a pure-play industrial automation company, I think its share price performance would be stronger. The automation business is a great place to be at the moment.”Speaking to analysts, however, Mr Farr rejected the idea of a break-up, saying Emerson’s board had reviewed the portfolio two and a half years ago and “feels very strongly that we can build off these two platforms” of automation and equipment for buildings.He added that among its planned bolt-on acquisitions, Emerson would “clearly be interested in looking at” some businesses that could be sold by General Electric, which has announced a $20bn disposal programme to simplify its structure.
4;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2017-11-28T19:27:08Z;Emerson/Rockwell: poetic justice;Abandonment of $29bn bid is a warning to chief executives seeking a last hurrah;There is little comfort for Emerson Electric in the words of namesake and Transcendentalist funster Ralph Waldo Emerson: “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” That is a better endorsement of Rockwell Automation’s independence than it is of Emerson’s attempt to end it.The failure of the $29bn deal is a warning to chief executives who might feel tempted, as Emerson’s David Farr was, to chase a transaction as a last hurrah late in their incumbencies. This only works with the balance of advantage in your favour.Rockwell was able to rebuff Emerson’s public approach, which it raised three times, because investors were unconvinced of its merits.Emerson’s final offer of $225 per share was 12.5 per cent higher than its first. It was also 38 per cent above where Rockwell stock was trading in August. But even after a tweak to the bid mix, two-fifths of the offer was in Emerson shares, not cash. Shareholders were right to prefer the stronger currency of Rockwell equity. Profits have been patchy at Emerson. They have been rising at Rockwell, which is better positioned to benefit from factory automation.Mr Farr is in a spurned-but-strengthened mood, judging from an analyst call on Tuesday. That look suits singer-songwriters better than chief executives. A $1bn buyback does not dispel the whiff of desperation emanating from Emerson.Rockwell, whose shares rose, is vulnerable to an all-cash bid. Emerson, having failed to become a scale consolidator, is exposed too.One reason is the differing characteristics of its two divisions. The first is an automation business specialising in refineries and the like. The second, commercial and residential solutions, runs the gamut from air conditioning to food waste management.Mr Farr may call this diversification. Others may see a break-up opportunity. Emerson has a forward earnings multiple in line with broader industrials. But the oil price rally has bolstered it. The automation unit would be worth more without its property-related appendage. The message of Emerson the company was: “Business as usual”. Emerson the poet had wiser words: “What lies behind us and lies before us are tiny matters compared with what lies within.”Premium subscribers are eligible to receive alerts when Lex notes publish.

5;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2017-11-28T12:37:34Z;Emerson abandons $29bn bid for Rockwell;;Emerson Electric has abandoned its $29bn swoop on rival Rockwell Automation, putting an end to an ambitious campaign that would have dramatically reshaped the US industrial equipment industry.Emerson said in a statement on Tuesday that it has withdrawn its $225 a share offer, citing Rockwell’s board unwillingness to engage in discussions about the deal.“The Rockwell board again rejected our offer, which would have delivered approximately $30bn of value to Rockwell shareholders,” said David Farr, Emerson’s chief executive.“We are disappointed that the Rockwell board refused even to discuss the potential combination of our two great companies. Instead of engaging in constructive dialogue, the Rockwell Board decided to let this unique and value-generative opportunity go unexplored.”Shares in Rockwell fell more than 3 per cent in pre-market trading while those in Emerson edged 0.1 per cent higher.Emerson’s decision to walk away comes less than a week after Rockwell rejected the sweetened unsolicited takeover approach, saying the new higher offer still undervalues the company.Emerson first approached Rockwell with a $200 a share offer in August, upped the offer to $215 a share in October before raising it again to $225 last week.
6;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2017-11-22T12:38:23Z;Rockwell rejects sweetened offer from Emerson (again);;Still a no.Rockwell Automation has rejected a second sweetened $29bn unsolicited takeover approach from rival Emerson Electric, saying the new higher offer still undervalues the company.The controls and automation software maker said in a statement that its board has “unanimously determined” that Emerson’s proposal was not in the best interest of the company or its shareholders.“Emerson’s proposal undervalues Rockwell Automation and its prospects for continued growth and value creation, presents significant long-term risk for Rockwell Automation’s shareowners, and would create a company that is not well-positioned to compete successfully in the evolving market,” it said. “The Board believes that continuing to execute Rockwell Automation’s successful strategy, which is generating extraordinary returns for the Company’s shareowners, will create greater long-term value than pursuing Emerson’s proposal.”Emerson last week increased the cash component in its offer for Rockwell, offering $135 per share in cash and $90 in Emerson shares for every one of their Rockwell shares.This compares to an earlier a $215-per-share offer in October, half in cash, half in shares, and a $200-per-share proposal in August – both of which were rebuffed by Rockwell.The latest unsolicited offer represents a 30 per cent premium to Rockwell’s volume-weighted average share price over the 90 days before its approach first became public on October 31.Shares in Rockwell fell 1.2 per cent to $190.68 in pre-market trading while those for Emerson dropped 1 per cent to $59.75.Emerson is trying to reshape the US industrial equipment industry at a time when it is being disrupted by new technologies including advanced robotics and the combination of connected devices and data analytics often referred to as the “internet of things”.
7;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2017-11-16T19:02:21Z;Emerson sweetens bid for Rockwell to $29bn;Unsolicited offer comes after Milwaukee-based group rejected previous approaches;Emerson Electric has increased the cash component in its offer for rival Rockwell Automation and raised the total value of its bid to $29bn, in an attempt to secure agreement for a deal that would reshape the fast-changing industrial equipment sector.David Farr, Emerson’s chief executive, set out the offer in a letter to Blake Moret, his counterpart at Rockwell, arguing that combining the two companies “would create a leader in the $200bn global automation market” with an “unmatched technology portfolio”.He reiterated his proposal to name the merged company “Emerson Rockwell”, and offered to include three Rockwell directors on its board, as well as selecting a management team “using a ‘best of both’ philosophy, with significant roles for members of your existing team”.Emerson also published a presentation suggesting the combined company could achieve synergies with a present value of $6bn, two-thirds in cost savings and one-third in increased revenues.Milwaukee-based Rockwell said its board would “carefully review Emerson’s proposal” to decide on the best response for the company and its shareholders.Its shares were up 4 per cent to $197.10 by early afternoon trading in New York.The latest unsolicited offer comes after Rockwell rebuffed a $215-per-share offer in October, half in cash, half in shares, and $200-per-share proposal in August.Emerson is trying to reshape the US industrial equipment industry at a time when it is being disrupted by new technologies including advanced robotics and the combination of connected devices and data analytics often referred to as the “internet of things”.Its latest proposal has a higher proportion of cash than previous ones, a clear attempt to win shareholders support for the combination, as investors tend to prefer takeovers with a bigger upfront cash component.The offer would give Rockwell shareholders $135 per share in cash and $90 in Emerson shares for every one of their Rockwell shares. It represents a 30 per cent premium to Rockwell’s volume-weighted average share price over the 90 days before its approach first became public on October 31.The total enterprise value of the transaction is approximately $29bn.Last month, Rockwell’s chief executive said the board was “confident in the company’s strategic direction and our ability to continue delivering superior levels of growth and value creation”.A person close to Rockwell then described Emerson’s approach as a “Hail Mary strategy” for Mr Farr “at the back end of his career”. Mr Farr has led Emerson for 17 years.Analysts’ views on the latest approach were divided. Vertical Research Partners wrote: “We view Emerson’s overtures as harder and harder to resist. The price certainly is full and the cash consideration is relatively high.”Wolfe Research, however, argued that it was “unlikely the deal goes through” given the opposition from Rockwell’s management.Other large companies in the automation industry, including ABB and Honeywell, could also be interested in buying Rockwell, Wolfe suggested.
8;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2017-11-16T14:55:11Z;Rockwell shares pop as Emerson sweetens bid to $29bn;;Rockwell Automation stock price rose nearly 7 per cent on Thursday after it received a new $225 per share cash-and-stock offer from rival Emerson Electric, valuing the Milwaukee-based industrial group at $29bn.The latest unsolicited offer comes after Rockwell rebuffed a $215 offer in October and $200 proposal in August, highlighting Emerson’s determination to combine in an effort to restructure the fast-changing industrial equipment sector.Emerson’s new proposal has a bigger cash proportion compared to previous ones, a clear attempt to win shareholders support for the combination, as investors tend to prefer takeover with a bigger up front cash component.The fresh move comes as Emerson is trying to proactively reshape the US industrial equipment industry at a time when the sector is being heavily disrupted by new technologies including the combination of connected devices and advanced data analytics often referred to as the “internet of things”.According to the latest proposal, Rockwell shareholders would receive $135 per share in cash and $90 per share in Emerson shares. The total enterprise value of the transaction is approximately $29bn. The new offer represents a 30 per cent premium compared to Rockwell’s undisturbed 90-day volume weighted average share price.David N. Farr, chairman and chief executive, made a strong case for uniting the two midwestern companies, arguing that the industrial logic for the combination was clear as it would create a market leader in the $200bn global automation industry.“Together, we could offer an unmatched technology portfolio that addresses customers’ current and future needs for a fully connected enterprise, where process, discrete, and hybrid work seamlessly together rather than relying on single, disparate platforms,” Mr Farr wrote in a letter to his counterpart at Rockwell, Blake Moret.Last month, Rockwell’s chief executive said that the board was “confident in the company’s strategic direction and our ability to continue delivering superior levels of growth and value creation”.A person close to Rockwell described Emerson’s approach as a “Hail Mary strategy” for its chief executive David Farr “at the back end of his career”. Mr Farr has led Emerson for 17 years.
9;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Emerson/Rockwell: currency crisis;Neither group’s shareholders appears excited about the prospect of a deal;"Having a stock market listing is supposed to give managers an acquisition currency. But it has to be one that is widely accepted. Emerson Electric is finding that not everyone is keen to take its paper.On Tuesday, the US industrial group and peer Rockwell Automation both acknowledged that Emerson had made multiple, unsolicited offers for Rockwell in recent months. The bids were rejected and no discussions are currently under way, but in its most recent offer Emerson was willing to pay an 18 per cent premium to Rockwell’s undisturbed share price, valuing the target’s equity at $28bn. Half that consideration would have come in the form of Emerson stock.It is not hard to see why Emerson covets Rockwell, which has exposure to the hot trends of the internet of things, connected devices and robotics. These have enabled it to achieve organic sales growth of 8 per cent in its most recent quarter, well ahead of general economic growth. Its shares have almost tripled over the past five years. as a result.It is rather less obvious why Rockwell shareholders would want Emerson shares in return. They have risen far less. Emerson is an industrial conglomerate that has an automation segment along with businesses in measurement and diagnostics, climate control and building management. It is another industrial conglomerate trying to figure out what it wants to be; last year, it announced it was selling $5bn worth of underperforming units.Emerson can compensate for the gulf in performance by bumping up its deal premium, which translates into an even deeper discount on the shares it is proffering to Rockwell investors. But they, alongside the management of Rockwell, are unlikely to find that any more appealing than the bids they have already rejected.Emerson’s shares dipped 2.5 per cent on news of the approaches. That suggests further restructuring may be needed before it can mount a big, successful stock-based takeover bid.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox?

10;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Rockwell Automation rebuffs $28bn takeover bid;Offer by Emerson Electric aimed to reshape fast-changing industrial equipment sector;Emerson Electric is attempting to restructure the fast-changing industrial equipment sector, bidding about $28bn for rival Rockwell Automation, but its approach has been rebuffed.Emerson first made an approach in August with a bid worth a $200 per share, and in October raised its offer to $215 per share, but Milwaukee-based Rockwell again rejected its proposal. The two companies confirmed the approach on Tuesday after it was reported by CNBC.Rockwell shares were trading at about $203 by early afternoon in New York.Emerson’s move is an attempt to reshape the US industrial equipment industry as it faces rapid change from new technologies including the combination of connected devices and advanced data analytics often referred to as the “internet of things”.Moody’s, the rating agency, said in a note it expected increased investment and takeover activity in the process and controls sector that includes Rockwell and competitors such as Siemens of Germany, Hitachi of Japan and Honeywell of the US.Rockwell supplies services, software, controls and other equipment for industries including car manufacturing, food, and oil and gas. Emerson is also a leader in industrial automation, serving a similar range of markets, and buying Rockwell would enable it to generate synergies worth about $6bn, said people briefed about its approach.Emerson said no talks were going on between the two companies, adding that it was “a disciplined acquirer and will only pursue transactions that are in the best interests of its shareholders”.The Rockwell name has been a big part of US industrial history. Rockwell International, the predecessor company to Rockwell Automation that was broken up in 2001, played a key role in the Apollo space programme, among other achievements. Rockwell Collins, the aerospace business formed in that demerger, in September agreed a $30bn bid from United Technologies.A hostile bid for Rockwell would be possible although someone close to Emerson’s senior management said they wanted a friendly deal. The person added that Emerson would be open to renaming the merged company as Emerson Rockwell, as part of an effort to preserve its rival’s identity and brand.Rockwell said in a statement that its board was unanimous in deciding that Emerson’s offers were “not in the best interest of Rockwell Automation or its shareowners”.Blake Moret, Rockwell’s chief executive, said the board was “confident in the company’s strategic direction and our ability to continue delivering superior levels of growth and value creation”.Over the past 10 years, Rockwell’s shares have risen 151 per cent, compared to a 27 per cent rise for Emerson, and a 67 per cent rise for the S&P 500.A person close to Rockwell described Emerson’s approach as a “Hail Mary strategy” for its chief executive David Farr “at the back end of his career”. Mr Farr has led Emerson for 17 years.Analysts at Baird wrote in a note that they saw “a very low probability” of success for Emerson’s approach, but noted that “the high suggested valuation” of the offer showed Rockwell’s “tremendous franchise value”.Rockwell Automation is advised by Goldman Sachs and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
11;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2017-10-31T14:18:09Z;Rockwell Automation rejects $27.6bn approach from Emerson Electric;;"Rockwell Automation said on Tuesday that it has rejected a $27.6bn unsolicited takeover approach from Emerson Electric, confirming an earlier report that sent its shares more than 10 per cent higher in early trading.Milwaukee-based Rockwell, which makes controls and automation software for factories, said Emerson made the $215 a share cash-and-stock offer on October 10. The approach came after it spurred a $200 a share offer from Emerson in August.Rockwell said in a statement that after a careful review, its board has “unanimously determined” that neither of Emerson’s proposals was in the best interest of the company or its shareholders.“The Rockwell Automation Board of Directors and management team…are confident in the Company’s strategic direction and our ability to continue delivering superior levels of growth and value creation,” said Rockwell chief executive Blake Moret.Shares in Rockwell rose as much as 10.3 per cent to $206.23 before trading was halted after CNBC first reported the approach. The gain gives the company a market value of $26.47bn. Emerson, whose shares dropped 2.2 per cent before they too were halted for trading, has a market value of $42.14bn.Emerson confirmed in a statement that it has made a private offer for Rockwell. It added however that there are no discussions currently going on between the two companies after its offer was rejected by Rockwell.The bold move by Emerson is an attempt to reshape the US industrial equipment industry as it faces rapid change from new technologies including advanced robotics, 3D printing, connected devices and new techniques for processing and analysing data.Rockwell describes itself as providing “smart automation”, offering equipment, software and services for industries including car manufacturing, food, and oil and gas.

12;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2017-01-17T05:03:53Z;Chiefs hold back on smart factories after backlash;Half of executives surveyed fear new technologies will fuel distrust;A revolution is stirring in the world’s factories. Industrial robots are breaking out of their cages to work side by side with humans. Autonomous vehicles scoot around factory floors replenishing production line supplies. Giant milling, moulding and pressing machines are learning to communicate with each other. And factories are improving their links with suppliers, exchanging data and rectifying problems, with minimal human intervention.The age of the smart factory is upon us and with it the promise of a step-change in manufacturing efficiency and productivity. The falling cost of sensor technology and the ability to harvest previously hidden data — hitched to an all-pervasive internet — promises to transform the fabrication of everything from cups to cars.General Electric, one of the world’s biggest industrial companies, estimates that digitising industrial machinery, networks and processes will not just bring down the costs of manufacturing. The data it generates will open new business opportunities, such as optimising maintenance schedules for customers or improving the design and quality of products. The resulting “industrial internet”, GE argues, has the potential to deliver global productivity improvements that could add $10tn-15tn to global GDP over 20 years.No manufacturer can ignore the coming revolution. Yet many, in developed economies at least, are wary. A backlash against globalisation, fuelled by decades of decline in America’s rust belt and the erosion of blue-collar jobs, has already upset the status quo in the US, where Donald Trump’s protectionist slogans helped him to win the White House.Almost half the 1,370 chief executives questioned in PwC’s annual Global CEO survey published this week fear that this latest industrial revolution will feed further distrust among their companies’ stakeholders — whether they be investors, employees or the wider public.German manufacturers have been some of the earliest converts to the new technology age, having recognised that unconventional competitors such as Google pose a threat to traditional industries, including carmaking. The government has over recent years led a national campaign to encourage the adoption of the industrial internet under the banner of Industry 4.0, and provided incentives for investment.But even German business is finding the transition more complicated than expected. Hartmut Rauen, deputy director of the mechanical engineering industry association VDMA, says that many of his members are struggling to identify where the value will finally lie in the new industrial model. Predictions that manufacturers would derive new revenue streams from data-led services remain unfulfilled, he says. Customers are not yet convinced that they should pay for such services. “It is a question of behaviour and it is not so easy to change the behaviour of a customer, and of the whole value chain,” he says.Yet failure to respond to these new changes would be fatal, says Juergen Maier, chief executive of Siemens UK. “There is only one responsible thing to do and that is to embrace it and see the opportunities,” he says. “We are now in a race as to who uses all of this technology the most effectively to increase productivity and to be globally competitive. If you put your head in the sand you get the opposite. You lose competitiveness and lose jobs.”If you put your head in the sand you . . . lose competitiveness and jobsIrmgard Nübler, senior economist at the International Labour Organisation, argues in a recent study that investment in new technology is a defence rather than a threat to industrial employment and should be sold to the public as such. Germany, Denmark, Italy and South Korea invested heavily in robotics between 1993 and 2007. Yet manufacturing’s share of overall employment fell far less in these countries than in the US and UK, where growth in robot use was far lower, her study found. In Germany the decline in industrial jobs as a percentage of the total was roughly half that in the US between 1991 and 2014 — yet it has 301 robots for every 10,000 manufacturing workers compared to just 176 in the US.ThyssenKrupp, the industrial conglomerate, began to prepare its business for the industrial internet more than five years ago. Stefan Schmitt, ThyssenKrupp’s head of human resources strategy, says the nature of jobs has changed but not the overall number of employees. “It is not robots or humans,” he says. “It is robots with humans.”Yet those humans will have to learn how to do their jobs differently, whether it is about maintaining the automation that has replaced traditional labour or using the data that their new smart machines generate. Tim Lawrence, a manufacturing specialist at PA Consulting, warns that not enough companies have begun to formulate strategies to retrain their existing workforces.Blake Moret, chief executive of Rockwell Automation and a member of the executive committee of the US National Association of Manufacturers, says companies will have to give training budgets the same priority as research and development spending. “Life-long learning for factory workers can be a competitive advantage. No matter how much you automate, your people will remain your most important asset.”

However he reported continued solid growth in EMEA and Latin America.“Heavy industry end markets continued to soften globally, particularly oil and gas in the U.S. I am pleased with the continued solid growth we are seeing in EMEA and Latin America” he said.First quarter revenues were down 9.4 per cent from $1.57bn to $1.43bn. Sales by its control products division – more than half the total – fell 9.6 per cent to $783.7m. Net income in the quarter fell from $214.2m to $185.5m.
14;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2015-04-30T15:59:11Z;Yelp crushed after earnings fail to match expectations;US markets end month on lower note;Investors took a dim view of Yelp’s first-quarter results, which fell short of expectations. The online review company said its loss had narrowed to $1.3m, or 2 cents a share, for the three months ending in March, from $2.6m for the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected a profit of $877,625.Although sales climbed 55 per cent to $118.5m, they were below projections for $120m.Yelp also forecast that second-quarter sales would lag analyst’ expectations, projecting revenues between $131m and $134m, below Wall Street’s call of $137.4m.Shares in Yelp, which have declined 32 per cent in the past year, fell 23 per cent to $39.39.RBC Capital downgraded the stock from “outperform” to “sector perform” and lowered the price target from $82 to $50 after the results.The number of average monthly users of its mobile products rose 29 per cent from a year earlier to 79m, while a similar metric for desktop unique visitors fell 3 per cent to 80m. Overall, unique visitors climbed 8 per cent to 142m.“Younger cohort markets are generating revenue dramatically below the level of Yelp’s older markets, but we’re now seeing substantial deceleration in all cohorts’ revenue growth,” said Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.“Yelp’s international markets have yet to break out of the 3 per cent contribution range, and now international unique visitor numbers have flatlined,” he added.Harman International was among the worst performers on the S&P 500, after it missed fiscal third-quarter sales expectations.The auto electronics and audio equipment maker, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut, reported profits of $70m, or 99 cents a share, compared with $73m, or $1.05 a share, in the period a year ago. Sales rose 4 per cent to $1.46bn.Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.25 a share, on sales of $1.48bn.Harman also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 33 cents a share. The shares dropped 7 per cent to $130.38.Avon Products, the door-to-door cosmetics company, reported a first-quarter loss as the strong dollar weighed on its results, sending its shares 6 per cent lower to $8.17.The New York-based company reported a loss of $147m, or 33 cents a share, on sales of $1.8bn. Analysts were expecting profits of 7 cents a share, on sales of $1.83bn.Avon derived more than 80 per cent of its sales overseas last year and on a constant currency basis, it said, sales had risen 1 per cent in the first quarter, driven by strong growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa.Rockwell Automation was among the best performers on the US benchmark index after reporting a 14 per cent rise in its fiscal second-quarter profit, which topped analyst expectations. However, the company said the dollar had weighed on revenues, which declined 3 per cent to $1.6bn from the year ago period.US stocks declined for a second straight day with the S&P 500 information technology sector leading the decline.The S&P 500 declined 1 per cent to 2,085.51, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 17,840.52, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 4,941.42.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
15;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Rockwell Automation reaps big data robotics rewards;;Robots first surfaced in industry as automated car production lines. Ranks of machines moving in choreographed union to piece together thousands of vehicles.These days, the legions of machines are smaller, but equally as crucial, helping to ensure the efficiency and productivity of factories.“Manufacturing has always been producing a lot of data – but generally it hasn’t been used,” says Keith Nosbusch, chief executive of Milwaukee-based Rockwell Automation. But the data can be incredibly useful. When something goes wrong – a pump fails or a valve breaks down – it can be turned into “something that tells you why”.Rockwell does not build robots, but it uses software and hardware – including the routers, switches and complex sensors that power the “internet of things” – to allow industry to remotely monitor assembly lines, reduce energy consumption, forecast outages and better maintain round-the-clock production. By aggregating and analysing vast streams of data, Rockwell technology can alert a technician that a belt is on the verge of breaking, or teach managers how to reconfigure machines, assembly lines or entire factories so that they are more energy efficient.The company, which reported $6.35bn in sales last year, is smaller than competitors such as Siemens, Honeywell and Emerson Electric. But it is at the vanguard of the automation industry when it comes to aggregating and exploiting data.In a high-speed bottling production line pumping out thousands of bottles a minute, “you need to know when the failure occurred and what were the conditions – what was the machine being told to do at the time of failure,” he says. “It’s about uptime and how fast you can repair and understand what happened.” said Mr Nosbusch.That means real-time analysis at every level is key: within the processors embedded in machines, on the production line, in the plant, in the cloud, and at Rockwell’s 24-hour control room in Cleveland, where engineers monitor the operations of offshore oil rigs, food packaging plants and auto assembly lines.The FT analyses the growth in the use of robots in the workplaceAround 2000, Rockwell made what the company calls “a big bet” – that the industrial internet would move from the proprietary, closed networks on which it had long run, to more standardised equipment. In 2007, Rockwell formed a partnership with Cisco that has since led to a line of routers and switches that are made to withstand the extremes of the factory floor but operate using standard internet protocols.Rockwell says the partnership allows it to stay ahead of traditional closed industrial networks and update its networks with the latest in cybersecurity safeguards. That gives them an advantage in sectors where the consequences of a cyber attack could be much more severe, particularly in the energy sector.Analysts say the bet has paid off, allowing Rockwell to be at the forefront of connecting the factory floor to the rest of the company, easing the way for better real-time diagnostics, maintenance and remote monitoring.“Last year was an inflection point for connectivity between factories and IT,” says Sujeet Chand, chief technology officer. “They’ve really come together.”
16;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2012-12-30T13:32:13Z;Industrial takeovers on the cards for 2013;;After enduring four lean years for mergers and acquisitions, the UK’s listed industrial companies are beginning to demonstrate a renewed interest in dealmaking.In recent months, Invensys’ £1.7bn sale of its rail division to pay off its pension deficit, and the decision by Cookson Group to split itself into two smaller companies, have given investors hope of a higher level of corporate activity in the sector.Some analysts have suggested that asset sales by Smiths Group, the UK technology company, may be on the agenda next year. Others say that two profit warnings in rapid succession at Volex – the electrical cable maker that counts financier Nat Rothschild as its largest shareholder – have cut its market capitalisation to such an extent that suitors are likely to be circling.Since the global economic downturn hit in 2008, the UK industrials sector has experienced a lull in M&A activity, as potential overseas bidders chose to sit on their cash until clear signs of an upturn emerged.However, the November move by Invensys to sell off its rail division to German conglomerate Siemens, sparked rumours that the British engineering group’s two remaining units would also be snapped up in the near future.Invensys’ decision to use the rail division proceeds to plug most of its £490m pension fund deficit effectively removed the “poison pill” that was blocking the sale of its core operations management arm, which provides software and consulting services, and its controls division, which makes interfaces for appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators.Analysts say both would be useful bolt-on additions for US suitors that could include Emerson Electric, General Electric, or Rockwell Automation.Andrew Carter, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says: “We consider Invensys to be ‘in play’ following the rail disposal. It may be only a matter of time before Invensys is acquired once the sale to Siemens is completed.”A top 10 investor in Invensys agrees: “Invensys is a minnow in the land of the giants. I can’t believe it won’t be broken up further or gobbled up.”Invensys’s deal has since led to suggestions that Smiths Group will follow suit and sell off a division to pay down its pension deficit, which stood at £620m in August, up from £199m the year before.“We think that the template of the Invensys rail disposal to Siemens suggests disposals for Smiths could come sooner than we’d previously thought,” argues Martin Wilkie, analyst at Deutsche Bank.“The read-across from the structure of the recent [Invensys Rail sale] warrants a rethink as to how much of a poison pill the pension really is for Smiths to sell assets.”Volex, despite counting Apple among its largest customers, has struggled over the past year, blaming a “softening of demand across all sectors as well as delays in specific project timelines” for its most recent profit warning, in mid-December.Michael O’Brien, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, believes that competitors with stronger balance sheets could be tempted to bid. “Volex’s strong market position in the sectors in which it operates, opportunities to diversify out of consumer, and concentrated shareholder base in our view makes it vulnerable to take-out,” he says.Cookson’s split, which was confirmed on December 19, leaves the two companies it created – Alent and Vesuvius – similarly vulnerable. Even Steve Corbett, Alent’s chief executive, acknowledges the possibility.“When we made the initial demerger announcement, we alluded to the fact that we had a couple of tyre kickers during the strategic review period,” he says. “[A buyout] could happen, but I would very much like to run this business for a while before that occurs.”Analysts had argued that Cookson’s share price was being held back by a “conglomerate discount”, whereby the group’s disparate operations prevented a fair valuation being put on the company.They now believe the demerger will enable Alent, formerly Cookson’s performance materials unit, and Vesuvius, its ceramics division, to be more accurately valued as individual entities – and takeover targets.“Alent is the cleaner, bite-sized target with a better growth track record,” says Oliver Wynne-James, analyst at Panmure Gordon.“Given that Cookson was so faulty, it looks as if the problems can be traced to Vesuvius’ doorstep. A merger with Morgan Crucible is a possibility, but both need to sort out their own issues first.”
17;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2011-11-08T22:45:14Z;US stocks edge up as financials lend support;;Shares in Wells Fargo rose on Tuesday as the bank said it had settled a long running legal dispute. The San Francisco-based lender will pay at least $37m to city governments, which had alleged that banks colluded on bids for contracts to underwrite municipal bond auctions.Shares closed up 4.4 per cent to $26.53.Wells Fargo could yet pay out more in damages, as it has yet to settle with state attorneys-general, who are investigating the same issues.Banks generally outperformed with financials the best performing sector in the S&P 500.Citigroup was up 2.9 per cent to $31.42, shrugging off reports that it will be one of two US banks to face a capital surcharge of 2.5 percentage points under plans to ensure the stability of systemically important financial institutions.JPMorgan, the other bank reported to be in line for the higher surcharge, was up 2.3 per cent to $35.02.After a subdued morning of trading, broader markets received a boost from reports that Silvio Berlusconi is set to resign as Italian prime minister. The S&P 500 was slightly negative at 1pm, but jumped 15 points by 2pm as the news broke.The benchmark US index finished the day up 1.2 per cent to 1,275.93, closing in positive territory for the year for the second day running.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent to 12,170.11 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.2 per cent to 2,727.49Oil and gas driller Pioneer Natural Resources sunk 3.7 per cent to $88.59, after the company announced it will issue 5.5m new shares, diluting existing shareholders.Pioneer hopes to raise $489.5m to expand drilling in the Wolfcamp Shale play in West Texas next year. The funds will be parked in US Treasuries and money market funds for now.Shares in highly cyclical exploration companies like Pioneer suffered badly during summer volatility, but have rebounded strongly in recent weeks, creating a window to raise finance.“This could presage a wave of issuance by E&P firms,” said William Herbert, head of research at Houston-based investment bank, Simmons and Company. “There is an acute need for capital to fund exploration costs, and companies are wary of taking on debt.”Oil drillers, which would benefit from higher capital spending by exploration firms, moved upwards on the news.Key Energy Services was up 3.1 per cent to $14.29 and Parker Drilling gained 6.8 per cent to close at $6.72Shares in Rockwell Automation leapt, after the factory equipment maker reported a 22 per cent rise in sales in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with the same period last year.That translated to a 50 per cent rise in per share earnings to $1.39 per share, thanks to a share buy-back scheme, which saw the company retire 4m shares in September and October alone.Rockwell benefited from the strong dollar with “currency translations” contributing 4 percentage points of the year-on-year increase in sales.Shares were up 6.5 per cent to $74.33.Online travel retailer Priceline.com was up 8.8 per cent to $552.85 after posting third-quarter profit of $1.1bn, a 65 per cent increase from the prior year, on revenues of $1.5bn, a 45 per cent increase over a year ago.Priceline’s success was bad news for rival Expedia, which fell 2.2 per cent to $28.22 on fears it will lose market share.Urban Outfitters was off 3.2 per cent to $26.34 after the retailer said store sales declined 7 per cent in October compared to a year earlier, led lower by a slump at its Anthropologie chain.Abercrombie & Fitch tumbled to a 6 month low in morning trading, before recovering to close down just 0.2 per cent at 58.21The stock is down more than 20 per cent over the last week, after quarterly results showed flat same stores sales at European outlets.US carmakers were given a fillip by the woes of Japanese group Toyota. which had earlier withdrawn its full-year guidance, as flooding in Thailand continues to disrupt supply chains.Ford was up 3.5 per cent to $11.61 and General Motors was up 4.3 per cent to $24.04.International Flavours and Fragrances slumped 10.2 per cent to $55.03 after third-quarter revenue at the flavour producer was stagnant once currency moves were stripped out.The company missed analyst estimates, as it suffered from higher commodity prices.
18;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2011-05-10T20:49:00Z;US stocks edge higher as global worries ease;;Microsoft lost ground after the software group confirmed that it was buying Skype for $8.5bn while US stocks continued to trend higher following the strong non-farm payrolls report.Shares in the world’s second-largest technology company by market capitalisation were down 0.6 per cent to $25.67 after announcing the deal with Skype.The acquisition is one of the largest by Microsoft and illustrates how the company is attempting to boost its online operations.The last substantial deal was the purchase of Aquantive, an online advertising company, in 2007 for more than $6bn.The move brings the value of worldwide tech-related mergers and acquisitions to $85.5bn, the strongest start to the year for tech M&A since 2000 according to Thomson Reuters.Ebay, the online auction site that still owns 30 per cent of Skype, was up 2.5 per cent to $33.93 in expectation of a windfall.Ebay shares were helped by the fact that the value put on Skype by the acquisition represents a large premium to what Wall Street had been expecting from its planned initial public offering.The news comes as a host of other internet companies like LinkedIn, Facebook, Groupon and Twitter are looking for initial public offerings at potentially lofty valuations.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent to 1,357.16, with solid economic data showing that US wholesalers had stockpiled goods in March as sales rose strongly helping to lift sentiment on Wall Street.But the wider markets were also bouncing back from losses last week after a string of disappointing economic data called into question the strength of the US economic recovery and sent the S&P 500 down 1.7 per cent.This malaise was largely banished on Friday, however, after a bumper official non-farm payroll figure turned sentiment around, leading to three solid days of gains on the S&P 500.“The jobs data on Friday was off the charts and that good news has been working its way into stock prices this week,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 12,760.59 while the Nasdaq Composite added 1 per cent to 2,871.89.The gains on Tuesday were broad based but industrial stocks saw some of the strongest improvements as healthy trade data from China pointed to robust global economic growth.United Parcel Service, one of the world’s largest package delivery companies, was up 0.9 per cent to $74.37 while General Electric added 1.2 per cent to $20.30.The S&P industrial sector was up 0.8 per cent.Energy stocks were the worst performing, weighed by falling oil prices after it was announced late on Monday that margins on US oil contracts would be raised by 25 per cent.The oil price recovered as the session continued but investors remained cautious. Hess Corp declined 0.4 per cent to $79.67 while ExxonMobil lost 0.4 per cent to $70.31.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in Dean Food rose 11.5 per cent to $12.24 after the dairy and meat purveyor beat expectations with its first-quarter results and raised its earnings forecast.The company lifted its forecast to 67-75 cents a share from its earlier view of 55-65 cents.It also estimated second-quarter earnings of 15-20 cents, ahead of the 13 cents expected by analysts.But in absolute terms, the food group’s first-quarter profit fell 41 per cent as margins slid, however.The stock is still down more than 30 per cent since the start of 2010.JA Solar Holdings was up 6.2 per cent to $6.48 after reporting a better than expected quarterly profit, although the solar company also said its second-quarter sales would be slowed by a cut in renewable energy subsidies in Italy.Wendy’s-Arby’s rose 4.2 per cent to $5.02 after the fast food group reported strong same-store sales growth in the US.Investors were impressed in spite of the company reporting a loss of $1.4m in the quarter compared with a profit of $3.4m a year earlier as well as lowering its full-year earnings forecast.Sotheby’s, the auction house, lost 6.1 per cent to $43.71 after reporting slimmer-than-expected first-quarter profit.The auctioneer did report an increase in the number of works sold over $1m but competitive pressures to win the consignments resulted in lower commission margins.
19;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2011-04-27T20:56:04Z;US markets cheer Fed decision;;Amazon led the gains on Wall Street after investors responded positively to its first-quarter earnings, while in the wider markets the Nasdaq Composite index hit a 10-year high after the Federal Reserve’s latest statement on monetary policy and the subsequent press briefing by Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed.Shares in the world’s largest online retailer jumped 7.9 per cent to $169.63, an all-time high, after the company reported a 38 per cent jump in sales.This increase in revenues, however, was accompanies by a 33 per cent fall in net income for the quarter as new investments in data storage and distribution eclipsed the rise in sales.But investors had already braced themselves for a drop in earnings and some analysts appeared to be convinced by a letter from Jeff Bezos, the chief executive officer, justifying the revenue focused strategy.This helped the S&P retail sector add 1.6 per cent and helped boost the Nasdaq Composite up 0.8 per cent to 2,869.88, a 10-year high.The S&P 500 was flat for much of the day, but jumped higher after the statements by Mr Bernanke and the Fed. The benchmark index closed up 0.6 at 1,355.66, a multi-year high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.8 per cent at 12,690.96.The Fed held rates steady at 0 to 0.25 per cent but tweaked its statement on growth, reducing its outlook from a “firmer footing” for the recovery to a “moderate” pace of growth. The central bank also said that it would end its $600bn “QE2” quantitative easing programme and Mr Bernanke suggested that the pace of stimulus might slow.Sentiment in the wider markets was also helped by data showing that US durable goods orders had jumped last month, with orders rising 2.5 per cent in March after a revised 0.7 per cent rise in February.In the previous session, the S&P 500 reached its highest level since June 2008, indicating that the markets have now recovered from sharp losses following the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa and the natural disaster in Japan.Much of the recent gains in the S&P have been driven by a strong start to the earnings season. Of the 197 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 77 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations compared with 73 per cent last quarter. Before the season started, analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that there would be a 65 per cent surprise rate overall.Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, said that momentum in the markets would continue to tick higher from here over the year, but there was likely to be more volatility.Boeing’s profits in the first quarter exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, and the stock advanced 0.8 per cent to $76.12. The world’s second-biggest aircraft maker by revenue made a net profit of $586m, or 78 cents per share, up from $519m, or 70 cents per share, in the same period last year and ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about 72 cents per share.Northrop Grummanreported a 21 per cent rise in earnings, beating estimates, while also raising its full-year guidance. Stock in the defence and aerospace group put on 0.7 per cent to $62.90.Rockwell Automation, the maker of factory automation equipment and software, saw one of the sharpest losses of the session, falling 8.7 per cent to $89.33 after reporting only a modest profit and a small increase to its 2011 earnings forecast.Elsewhere in the sector Parker Hannifin, another industrial supplier, also disappointed with its earnings and the stock declined 5.1 per cent to $93.48.Disappointing earnings reports from ConocoPhillips and National Oilwell Varco weighed on the energy sector.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company, reported a 43 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings, but missed its production and refining targets, leaving the stock down 1.7 per cent at $79.83.The decline in production was due to civil unrest in Libya, a supply vessel collision with a company platform, natural field decline and the temporary shutdown of the trans-Alaska pipeline system.Elsewhere in the sector, National Oilwell fell 4.6 per cent to $76.88 after the US oilfield equipment maker reported a 4 per cent drop in quarterly profit amid restructuring charges and Libya-related writedowns.
20;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2011-03-18T20:51:04Z;Financials lead Wall Street rally;;Financial stocks climbed after the Federal Reserve cleared the way for banks to raise their dividends, while in the wider markets a turbulent week on Wall Street ended on a high note due to easing geopolitical tensions.JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo were among those to raise their dividend following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders.JPMorgan climbed 2.7 per cent to $45.74 while Wells Fargo added 1.5 per cent to $31.83. The S&P financial index rose 1.1 per cent.In the wider markets, US equities continued to rebound from the heavy losses seen earlier in the week lifted by news that Libya had announced an “immediate ceasefire” in its offensive against rebels.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,279.20, adding to the 1.3 per cent gains from the previous session.News that the G7 had reached an agreement to intervene in the markets to curb the rise of the yen also served to bolster sentiment.The S&P 500 is still down 1.9 per cent over the week, however, and 4.8 per cent lower since the onset of turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East in mid-February.Industrial stocks saw the strongest gains after financials, helped by the easing geo-political tensions. In the industrial sector Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, was up 1.9 per cent to $105.06, while Rockwell Automation advanced 1.2 per cent to $88. The S&P industrial index was up 0.7 per cent.Energy stocks lost some ground in the session following these developments in Libya. Schlumberger, the oilfield services giant, was down 1.3 per cent to $85.93 while Rowan Companies fell 2.6 per cent to $40.43.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 11,858.52, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,643.67. The indices were down 1.5 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively over the week.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, was down 6.5 per cent, but is still up 22 per cent over the week.In corporate news, General Mills announced that it was in negotiations to buy half of Yoplait, the yoghurt brand, sending shares in the food group up 1.4 per cent to $36.65.Elsewhere, Celera was up 34 per cent to $8.40 after Quest Diagnostics, a laboratory-testing group said it was buying the genetics group. Quest Diagnostics fell 0.8 per cent to $53.74.Nike lost ground after the company reported disappointing profits and slimmer margins due to higher commodity costs. Its shares tumbled 9.2 per cent to $77.59, a six-month low.The week on Wall Street was split into two halves. The first three days saw heavy selling as traders worried about the impact of the earthquake and resulting tsunami and potential nuclear disaster on Japan, the third-largest economy in the world.Negative news flow left the S&P 500 down 3.2 per cent in three days and caused the Vix volatility index to spike up 46.4 per cent. Thursday and Friday saw a recovery as traders decided that the sell-off had been overdone and analysts calculated that the impact on the Japanese and the world economy would not be significant.Research from RBC Capital Markets found that technical indicators such as the number of US stocks trading below their 50 day moving average and the put-to-call ratio showed that the markets were at “deep ‘oversold’ levels often associated with market rebounds”.The markets were also lifted by bumper manufacturing data from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday, the best monthly reading since 1984, and news of a ceasefire in Libya on Friday. The sectors that suffered worst in the week were those directly affected by the Japanese disaster. Nuclear stocks plunged, with Uranium Energy falling 10.5 per cent and Uranium Resources declining 6.7 per cent.Insurance companies also lost ground on worries over how much they will be forced to pay out. Aflac was 8.8 per cent lower while Platinum Underwriters lost 4.1 per cent. The KBW property casualty index slid 2 per cent over the week.Technology stocks fell on worries over component shortages as Japan is one of the world’s largest producers of semiconductors. Qualcomm fell 3.5 per cent while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2 per cent over the week.Material and industrial stocks had a mixed week, pulled sharply lower early in the week but rebounding strongly as sentiment improved. The S&P materials index ended up flat and the industrial index fell 1.7 per cent overall.
21;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;GE sets its sights high in Chinese tie-up;;General Electric’s avionics joint venture with Aviation Industry Corp of China (Avic), which is expected to be formally confirmed on Friday, has attracted a great deal of attention focusing on familiar concerns about protection of western companies’ intellectual property when doing business in China.The fear is that, as has happened in other industries, less sophisticated Chinese companies will take advantage of the collaboration to learn what they need, and then launch into the market as competitors with much cheaper versions of the same products.In the case of the new avionics joint venture, those concerns completely miss the point, says Jeff Immelt, GE’s chairman and chief executive.It is not a case of a world-beating western company being induced to surrender its technological leadership “under threat of death”, he says, adding that the relatively weak US business is seeking to use a Chinese alliance to propel it into the front rank of global competition.“This is a story about a joint venture: the Chinese bring technology, GE brings technology. It makes us better able to compete with Thales, BAE, Honeywell and Rockwell,” he says.GE does have a significant presence in avionics, however, not least as the supplier of the central system for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. But it is not one of the sector leaders and comes in at “number four or three, I think: not where we want to be,” Mr Immelt says.GE entered the avionics business in 2007, with the $4.8bn acquisition of Smiths Aerospace.GE’s calculation is that it can use its position on the Chinese C919 airliner, which is being built as a challenger to the duopoly of Airbus and Boeing in the narrow-body market by Comac, to grow its global market share. The joint venture with Avic is supplying the C919 with GE’s flight management system – the central electronics system of the aircraft.Comac expects to sell more than 2,300 C919s over the 20-year life of the programme, creating a market for avionics systems worth about $2bn. The venture will also be able to bid for other programmes, in China and worldwide. Mr Immelt draws a parallel with CFM, GE’s 50/50 aero engine joint venture with Snecma of France, part of Safran, in which the French state has a 30 per cent stake.“It’s now the most successful joint venture, certainly in GE, maybe in the history of the world,” he says. “This is about creating a new competitor and it’s about an American company looking for strategic opportunity to develop a new platform.”He says of GE’s avionics operation: “It’s a good business today, but this gives us a chance to do integrated cockpits. And we’ll have more content on the C919 than on any other plane in history. This is more about trying to play offence in a win-win setting than: ‘under threat of death we gave our technology’ …It’s just not true.”GE has put in place various mechanisms to protect its IP, including a bar on Chinese staff with links to the military having access to technical data from GE or the JV. There is also a “cooling off” period to stop Avic staff moving to a Chinese military job within two years of leaving the JV.Mr Immelt accepts that protection of IP is a real issue. “When I talk to some of my friends in high-tech companies, they have legitimate concerns. I have a lot of empathy for those guys,” he says. He says every company setting up a joint venture “has to be very judicious about where they take their IP anywhere, and how they protect it”.

ABB topped the FTSE Eurofirst 300 which closed 0.7 per cent higher at 1,021.66.The company, which is a leader in power transmission and energy efficiency solutions, is renowned for its strong cash position with firepower of more than $10bn to make an acquisition.Analysts said ABB is relatively weak in the low voltage power application market, thus a potential acquisition would most likely be in this area.There were rumours that Rockwell Automation in the US, which has a market value of $7.6bn, is a potential target. The acquisition of Rockwell would consolidate ABB’s automation expertise while allowing the company to diversify into software where the US company has a stronghold.There was also talk that ABB would bid for Brazil’s Weg to help close the gap in the low voltage market.TF1, France’s largest commercial broadcaster, saw its shares drop after reporting disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. The company which has suffered from a two-year slump in advertising revenues issued a surprisingly downbeat guidance for 2010, despite an improving market.Bruno Hareng at Oddo & Cie said: “I think the market is recovering nicely but I think the company doesn’t want to disappoint investors, and so has given a conservative profit estimate for 2010.”TF1 spent €120m ($160m) to acquire the broadcasting rights for the football World Cup, which Jean Baptiste Sergeant at Gilbert Dupont believes will be negative for profitability.Its shares pared early losses to close down 4.9 per cent to €11.71. The shares are down 9.2 per cent since the start of the year.Capgemini, Europe’s largest computer consultancy , saw its shares leap after the company reaffirmed its long-term outlook amid signs of improving economic conditions.The company, which reported earnings above-analyst forecasts, also predicted that profits and sales would dip later this year before recovering. Shares in the group fell as much as 4.1 per cent before reversing losses as investors were convinced that the sector was on the road to recovery. Capgemini closed 6.2 per cent higher at €33.65.Societe Generale slid 7.2 per cent after the French bank announced it may have to inject more capital into its lossmaking Greek unit Geniki, which is under pressure from the country’s debt crisis.

The S&P 500 financials index added 2.3 per cent - its biggest daily gain since November.However, traders were also bracing themselves for President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union address.After spending most of the day in the red, the S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent higher at 1,097.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to 10,236.16 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8 per cent to 2,221.41.“The Fed repeated its message that everything it has previously put into place is working, albeit slowly,” said Andrew Wilkinson, a senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “It must be content that the liquidity pressures it tackled a year ago through monetary and quantitative policies have been dealt with successfully, but now it continues to rely on that old adage that time is a great healer.”The market had initially struggled to make sense of mixed earnings reports from the industrials sector.Caterpillar, the world’s largest manufacturer of construction equipment, posted a higher quarterly profit than analysts had been expecting and noted encouraging signs of economic recovery. However, the group gave a disappointing profit forecast for this year, sending its shares down 4.3 per cent to $53.44.Boeing, the second-largest maker of commercial aircraft, also beat estimates but disappointed Wall Street with its outlookThe company said that its defence business had suffered from government budget cuts while demand for air travel remained low.Its shares initially fell back before the opening bell but were later trading 7.3 per cent higher at $61.93.United Technologies, the diversified manufacturer, also weighed on the market in spite of posting results and a forecast that were just above the average analysts’ forecast.Profit fell about 6 per cent in the past quarter due to restructuring costs and lower revenue from commercial airline contracts. Its shares slipped 1.3 per cent to $67.61.Elsewhere in the industrial sector, shares in Rockwell Automation jumped 10.2 per cent to $50.84 after the industrial software maker posted quarterly results above the consensus forecast and boosted its outlook for 2010.While the group has trimmed costs by closing facilities and cutting jobs, it has also seen higher demand as industrial production increases in the economic recovery.Concerns over tighter monetary policy in China still haunted the market, pushing the S&P 500 materials index 0.8 per cent lower.Apple helped the Nasdaq to outperform the wider market, gaining 0.9 per cent to $207.81 after the company launched a new $499 computer.After the closing bell on Tuesday, Yahoo posted fourth-quarter results broadly in line with expectations. It gave a promising outlook for the current quarter, prompting the shares to surge in early trading. However, they were later down 0.1 per cent at $15.98.RF Micro Devices, which makes chips for mobile phones, posted a higher profit than analysts had been expecting but mainly as a result of cost cuts. Revenues, however, were worse than expected, causing its shares to fall 4 per cent to $4.10.Amazon.com added to the sector’s gains, rising 2.7 per cent to $122.75 after Kaufman Bros upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold”.Analyst Aaron Kessler said that the company was in a good position due to its low prices, offers of free shipping and trustworthiness and was a particularly attractive investment given its shares had just suffered a 15 per cent correction.

Its shares jumped 14.1 per cent to 952p as short-sellers rushed to close positions amid rumours of predatory interest from CME Group, which was formed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s $11bn takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade last year.Analysts were sceptical, asking why the CME, which is focused on derivatives, would want to enter the the fiercely competitive European cash equities market. According to Data Explorers, more than 21 per cent of the LSE’s share capital is currently on loan.Next rallied 7 per cent to £10.27 after Dresdner Kleinwort stoked buy-out talk by pointing out that £3bn would be theoretically enough to acquire the retailer.Geoff Lowery, analyst, said: “We are not suggesting that a retail LBO is possible in the current environment, but we are suggesting that Next remains one of the most do-able ‘take private’ stories in the sector”.British Airways climbed 8.5 per cent to 229p as the crude price dropped sharply after data showed US oil supplies had risen last week for the first time in a month and half.However, the weakening oil price could not prevent BP from closing 0.4 per cent higher at 573½p. Traders pinned the rise on a Morgan Stanley upgrade to “overweight”.The broker said, setting a 750p target price: “We sense that BP under new management wants to change the way it is run. We also believe that Tony Hayward [chief executive] has injected a new sense of urgency”Experian, the credit checking company, dipped 1.7 per cent to 367p as it traded ex-dividend and Citigroup advised clients to “sell”. Analyst Ed Steele said Experian’s premium rating was difficult to explain given its below-average growth and high operational gearing.Beazley Group took top spot on the FTSE 250 leaderboard after two brokers – Credit Suisse and UBS – upgraded the stock. The re-insurance company also announced plans to buy back £20m of its own shares. Its share price rose 14.5 per cent to 110p.Mitchells & Butlers rallied 8.7 per cent to 221½p after Goldman Sachs removed the pub operator from its “sell” list and Aaron Brown, a non-executive director and representative of R20, the investment vehicle of financier Robert Tchenguiz, declared the purchase of stock worth £100,000.Mecom, the European newspapers group that joined the FTSE 250 on Monday, was marked 4.2 per cent lower at 23p as investors fretted about its debt levels. Traders said the recent surge in the euro had inflated the level of Mecom’s net debt from £524m at the year-end to about £600m now. The company has a market value of £360m.Rentokil Initial, the pest control and parcel delivery group, dropped 3.1 per cent to 102p after UBS downgraded. The broker pointed out that Rentokil’s new management team would not outline their turnround plan until third-quarter results in November at the earliest.
25;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2007-11-01T22:19:16Z;New Siemens chief poised to slash jobs;;Peter Löscher, new chief executive of Siemens, is preparing a series of aggressive earnings targets for senior managers, along with thousands of job cuts, in an effort to introduce a US-style “can-do” culture at Europe’s biggest engineering group.Under the plans, he will tie the pay of top executives more closely to their performance in achieving the targets, which will be aligned with those of Siemens’ main competitors such as General Electric of the US and ABB, the Swiss-Swedish group.Behind the project, more details of which are likely to be outlined next week, is a bid by Mr Löscher to narrow a big profitability gap between Siemens and some of its rivals, chiefly GE.Mr Löscher, who has just completed 100 days in office, is upset that while Siemens has world-class technologies, it is the margin leader in none of its 10 operating businesses.In the first nine months of this year, the operating margin for its industrial businesses was 8.5 per cent, against 14.7 per cent for the equivalent activities at GE. “We have not been ambitious enough [in profits],” Mr Löscher has said.Julian Mitchell, analyst at Credit Suisse, said: “Mr Löscher has a great opportunity to take Siemens in a new direction. The external conditions, including a new and supportive chairman, and a strong environment for orders, are mostly in his favour.”Among Mr Löscher’s plans are the cutting of many middle management jobs from theworkforce of more than 400,000.While Mr Löscher is not yet ready to say how many jobs will go, some analysts think the cull could be up to 10,000 in the next few years, mostly outside Germany.Mr Löscher was appointed in May after a bribery scandal that claimed the jobs of the previous chief executive and the supervisory board chairman.Although many of Mr Löscher’s ideas go against Germany’s consensus-based business traditions and could face resistance within the company, they are likely to be backed by Gerhard Cromme, the new chairman.One example of where Mr Löscher is keen to cut the profits gap with rivals is in automation and drive technology where Siemens’ margin of about 13 per cent trails those of two US rivals, Rockwell and Emerson, which have margins of about 17 and 15 per cent respectively.
26;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Web turkeys for Christmas;;"Here are some turkeys for Christmas: things to be thankful other people did on their websites. We have been collecting these for years and have put together a collection from which most of these are drawn. If you have any responsibility for a website, I expect you will see clearly what has happened and have a smaller shudder – there, but for the grace of God, go you.Many of the problems we see come from poor handling of international audiences. Have a look at Rockwell Automation (www.rockwell.com) and click the Contact link at the bottom of any page. Select a country, as the dropdown menu asks, and choose Greece. The form that appears starts in English then switches to Italian. Try Latvia and you get Danish; Romania and you get German. This is not the stereotypical US company with no idea what languages Europeans speak, but rather the result of a Rockwell-centred view of the world. In this, Italy is the hub for a region that includes Greece, Denmark includes Latvia and so on. I can see why it happens, but it doesn’t make it any more sensible.Intel (www.intel.com) has much the same problem. Look for products on the Belgium site, and you find yourself directed to retailers in the UK; the same for South Africa. If anyone should be getting this right, surely it is a master of technology such as Intel?If AIG, the insurance giant, is wondering why it is not getting too many recruits from much of the world, we may be able to help. Click the Careers link on the home page (www.aig.com), and choose the region where you live – it could be the UK, Australia, or China (pretty much anywhere except the US or continental Europe). You will be presented with a list of group companies headed by American International Underwriters. Click its address (www.aiu.com), find the Recruitment link – in About AIU – and you get sent right back to the AIG Careers page. The great thing about round-and-round games, of course, is that you can start anywhere in the cycle. What fun, unless you happen to be one of AIG’s recruitment people.Anyone who writes or edits knows that spelling mistakes have a habit of surviving the most rigorous checking. But it was still surprising to find Boeing launching a shiny new site (www.boeing.com) with two bloopers in its navigation links. If you go to About us, then General information, you will now find a link to Boeing Corporate. But at the beginning of this year it was World Headquaters [sic], a mistake repeated in the breadcrumb trail at the top of the page. I wonder why Boeing gave up trying to spell the word properly and changed the label completely: is there such a thing as company-wide spelling failure?Even odder is the website of Small Business Opportunity Center, part of Northwestern University School of Law – or as the site used to say, the ‘Schoool of Law’. It’s been fixed now but it stayed like that for at least a year, even though the content was regularly updated. How could they have missed that?These are typographical errors – they are not exactly excusable, but they happen. A couple of years ago we were looking at the travel insurance page of Sainsbury’s Bank, the financial services arm of the UK’s biggest retailers. In two paragraphs it managed to miss two apostrophes (‘travel agents prices’ and ‘whether its a luxurious summer break’) and to make a spelling mistake: ‘oppurtunity’. These were more than typos – they were a sign that the bank was not running its site properly. Allowing someone to publish copy with such basic mistakes showed a lack of proper control – if even one vaguely literate person had checked the copy before it went up, it would surely not have got through.The last two turkeys show what happens when the site’s designers forget that business websites are there to be used, not admired as graphic masterpieces. Racing Post is a leading British sports and betting newspaper that relaunched its site (www.racingpost.co.uk) earlier this year. The aim was apparently to reflect the print daily more closely, which is why it mirrors its two column format. As few stories fit on one screen, this means readers have to scroll their way down to the bottom of the first column, then go up to top of the next one and down again. It may look pretty, but it breaks many rules of usability (and common sense).Designers have always loved Flash animation, and it is the job of their boring business colleagues to make sure they do not have too much fun with it. I’m happy to say that VNU, the Dutch publisher, has not succeeded. Click on the About VNU link on its site (www.vnu.com), select Organisation, and marvel as little business ‘cards’ emerge from the left margin margin and edge their way across the screen. As many as seven are on show at any one time: clicking any of them and you get a static page on the business the card represents. This animation is a nonsense for any company; for one that sells itself as an information provider, it is positively bonkers.For more turkeys, go to www.bowencraggs.com/turkeys.html.

27;ROK;Rockwell Automation Inc;2006-07-26T21:12:33Z;Wall Street unmoved by mixed earnings;;Wall Street closed flat on Wednesday as investors were pulled in opposite directions by economic data and mixed earnings reports.Stocks moved sideways most of the morning, but ticked higher following the afternoon release of the Fed’s beige book, a report on regional economic conditions that suggested price pressures in the US were contained.Markets took the news as making it less likely that the Fed would raise interest rates at its next meeting. However, the rally was not enough to distract investors from disappointing earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Corning and others.At the close, the S&P 500 was flat, down 0.48 points, at 1,268.40, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2 per cent, or 3.44 points, at 2,070.46. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also flat, down 1.20 points, at 11,102.51.General Motors reported a net loss of $3.2bn in the second quarter as charges related to the carmaker’s employee buyout programme took a heavy financial toll. But operating earnings were $1.2bn, ahead of analyst estimates, pushing shares 4.4 per cent higher to $32.00.Online retailer Amazon reported a 58 percen fall in quarterly earnings. Shares plunged 21.8 per cent to $26.26, their lowest level in more than three years.However, other technology stocks did better. Apple Computer gained 3.1 per cent to $63.87 and Sun Microsystems rose 4.4 per cent to $4.27 after reporting an increase in quarterly revenue.Corning fell 14.5 per cent to $18.52 after it warned that third-quarter sales would miss analysts’ forecasts. The company was hit by sluggish sales of its liquid-crystal-display glass, used in television screens and mobile phones. The stock is down more than a third since early May.“We’re not selling,” said Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at US Trust, whose fund owns Corning.“Corning is in an enviable position in the market. Our belief is that by the end of the September quarter the inventory glut will have been rebalanced and set the stage for renewed growth.”ConocoPhilips led a rally in oil stocks, rising 1.7 per cent to a three-month high of $68.60 after it announced profits had risen 65 per cent on higher crude prices.Boeing dipped 4.6 per cent to $79.90 after it reported a quarterly loss – in line with expectations – caused by charges related to a settlement of government investigations into its defence business.Rockwell Automation, maker of industrial automation products, fell as investors took fright at narrowing margins and the shares lost 10.2 per cent to $60.50.The transport sector continued to retreat. Rail group Norfolk Southern sparked the sell-off after it fell short of analyst estimates with a 12 per cent drop in quarterly earnings. The stock lost 8.5 per cent to $41.40.
