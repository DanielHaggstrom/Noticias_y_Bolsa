That compared to a backlog of $2.1bn at the end of 2013.The results lifted the broader homebuilding sector. Shares of Lennar rose 3 per cent to $44.89, PulteGroup increased 3 per cent to $21.21 and KB Home advanced 2 per cent to $12.42.Roper Industries, the industrial technology company, said fourth-quarter profits rose 12 per cent to $186m, or $1.84 a share. Sales increased 6 per cent to $946m.Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of $1.79 a share on sales of $955m. Adjusted earnings of $1.85 a share topped analysts’ estimates.The Sarasota, Florida-based company now expects first-quarter earnings to range between $1.47-$1.53 a share, compared to Street consensus forecasts for $1.51 a share. Shares of Roper Industries rose 4 per cent to $155.70.Mattel shares fell 5 per cent to $26.64 after the maker of Barbie dolls reported a 59 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profits. Bryan Stockton resigned as chief executive and chairman.
