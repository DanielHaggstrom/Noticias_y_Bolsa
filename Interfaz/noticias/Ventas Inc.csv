0;VTR;Ventas Inc;2008-01-22T07:28:02Z;Roche wins Ventana with sweetened bid;;The turmoil on financial markets failed to derail Roche’s ambitions to buy Ventana Medical Systems, as peace broke out on Tuesday after the Swiss pharmaceuticals group made an improved offer for the US diagnostics company.Roche raised its bid from $75 to $89.50 a share, valuing Arizona-based Ventana at $3.4bn, or $400m more than its repeatedly spurned initial offer.Analysts had set a minimum $90 price a share tag on Ventana, which makes sophisticated diagnostics equipments that fits ideally with Roche’s own drug discovery and diagnostics ambitions.Ventana’s board had already opened the door to talks, after allowing Roche access to the group’s books, but the deal may have been clinched by the sharp falls in share prices recently.The improved price represents a 4.9 per cent premium to Ventana’s closing price last Friday and a 19.3 per cent boost compared with Roche’s initial offer of last June.“We were very pleased that we were able to reach an agreement with Ventana. We believe that our offer provides significant value to Ventana’s shareholders and that this acquisition ideally complements Roche’s strengths”, said Franz Humer, Roche chairman and chief executive.The deal also marks a personal boost for Severin Schwan, Roche’s young head of diagnostics. Mr Schwan, nominated last year as chief executive designate, was closely identified with the transaction, and failure would have cast a shadow, despite his emergence as successor to Mr Humer.The Ventana deal still leaves Roche, currently one of the world’s most successful drugs companies, with a full war chest for further acquisitions. The group is due to report its 2007 results on January 30.Christopher Gleeson will continue as Ventana’s president and chief executive and join the executive board of Roche’s diagnostics division.“After a full evaluation of its strategic alternatives and thoughtful consideration, as well as consultation with our outside financial and legal advisors, our board believes that the transaction with Roche at $89.50 per share is in the best interests of our shareholders”, he said.Greenhill and Citi advised Roche. Ventana was advised by Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs.
1;VTR;Ventas Inc;2007-11-19T19:05:27Z;Roche and Ventana;;Now they’re talking. Roche and Ventana Medical Systems have been at loggerheads for more than five months over the Swiss medical company’s efforts to buy the Arizona diagnostic firm for $3bn. Ventana’s board has called the $75-a-share offer “grossly inadequate” and “futile”. Though Roche’s offer represented a 44 per cent premium to the undisturbed price, Ventana’s shares soared right through it. Investors’ enthusiasm appears nearly boundless: at Monday’s share price of $89, Ventana is trading at 47 times consensus 2008 earnings.Last week the two sides blinked, entering into a confidentiality agreement that allows Roche an inside look at Ventana’s prospects and potential synergies. Among drug firms, Roche is almost certainly Ventana’s best option. Roche has bet bigger than most of its peers on combining diagnostics with targeted therapies. The companies also have a history of working together. Ventana’s test for whether breast cancer cells contain the HER2 protein is the best indication for the drug Herceptin, which is made by Roche-controlled Genentech. However, there is only so far Roche can go. Investors are unlikely to react well if the firm pays too much. AstraZeneca’s shares have fallen by about 40 per cent since it bought MedImmune last spring on an even dizzier multiple.But Ventana may have other options. The company is attractive to companies in pharmaceutical research and medical technology. Both General Electric’s healthcare arm and Siemens have been out shopping for diagnostic firms in recent months. In the grand scheme of things, Ventana is not a large mouthful for many potential buyers. If Roche proves reluctant to cough up $90-plus a share, other suitors could bite.
2;VTR;Ventas Inc;2007-06-25T23:27:42Z;Roche launches hostile $3bn Ventana bid;;Roche, the Swiss drug and diagnostics group, on Monday launched a hostile $3bn cash offer to acquire Ventana Medical Systems and its leading US cancer tissue diagnostics business.Roche views Ventana’s tissue-based diagnostics as a key component in its vision for the future.It plans to capitalise on the increasing convergence of testing and drugs to personalise medicine, particularly in cancer.In Ventana it sees the chance to add a US market leader to broaden its global diagnostics business.At the same time the addition of Ventana would help Roche in its efforts to use diagnostics to find, develop and administer pharmaceuticals.Roche said it was launching the hostile move in an attempt to force negotiations after Ventana had rebuffed its earlier efforts to negotiate a deal.Franz Humer, Roche chairman and chief executive, said: “We’ve tried for over a half a year to open a dialogue with them that has been rejected at every stage. We think there’s an ideal fit between the companies.”Under the terms of the offer, Roche will pay $75 for each Ventana share, a 44 per cent premium to the US group’s closing price on Friday.The offer sent Ventana shares soaring 52 per cent, or $26.96, to $78.51 in after-market trading in New York.Ventana said its board of directors would consider the offer but it had no further comment.Mr Humer said combining Ventana with Roche was a “very important step . . . at a very significant premium”. The tender would commence “promptly”.Roche and its majority-owned partner Genentech of the US have some of the world’s best-known targeted biotechnology drug therapies.Mr Humer said improved use of diagnostics and drugs could help make sure the right patients benefited from new therapies.“That’s where we think the future lies,” he said.Ventana’s tissue-based diagnostics business has a nearly 70 per cent market share in the US but less prominence globally.Roche says it is a missing piece to its diagnostics business and adds to its expertise in cancer, molecular biology, diagnostics information technology, and automation and standardisation of testing.Roche also wants to give Ventana global reach.Roche envisions Ventana as an independently operating unit remaining in its headquarters in Tuscon, Arizona. The group has 950 employees and about $240m in annual revenues. Roche’s had SFr42bn ($33.8bn) in revenues last year.Hostile offers are rare in the pharmaceuticals industry because of the need to keep key personnel such as research scientists. They are more common in diagnostics, a once staid industry that has heated up after discoveries in genetics.
3;VTR;Ventas Inc;2006-10-10T11:10:58Z;Two bidders drop out of Vision fight;;Danaher, a US diversified manufacturer with a growing medical technology business, looks set to gain control of Vision Systems after two American rivals effectively pulled out of the takeover battle.Ventana Medical Systems, which made the initial offer for Vision that triggered the three-way takeover race, said it would withdraw, expressing disappointment at missing ``this particular opportunity.’’Cytyc, which made a A$600m bid which was rejected by Vision’s board, said Tuesday it would not improve its offer, but would keep it on the table and urged Vision shareholders to endorse it.Both Ventana and Cytyc maintain substantial stakes in Vision which they acquired on the open market and that could make it more difficult for Danaher to delist Vision.Danaher is hoping to boost its pathology diagnostics business by gaining full control of Vision, but it has made its offer conditional upon receiving 50.1 per cent of Vision’s equity.Vision shares fell 2.9 per cent to A$3.71 Tuesday amid disappointment among investors that the takeover battle was coming to a close. Still the share price has rallied in recent weeks, after the company was valued in Ventana’s original offer at A$2.13 per share.The takeover battle for Vision comes as intense takeover activity shakes up the Australian healthcare sector as companies such as Vision attract interest because of their pipeline of new products and the country’s aging population.Separately, Australian Pharmaceutical Industries is expected to reject an unsolicited A$566m offer from Sigma Pharmaceuticals, made last Friday. Analysts expect another bidder could soon enter the arena.The API board told shareholders that it would evaluate Sigma’s bid, but noted that it was valuing API at a discount to its current share price. API shares rose 1.5 per cent Tuesday to A$2.66.
4;VTR;Ventas Inc;2006-10-09T08:41:52Z;Danaher takes lead in Vision Systems fight;;Danaher, a US diversified manufacturer that has been expanding into medical technology, yesterday trumped its two rivals in the battle to acquire Vision Systems with an agreed A$700m offer for the Australian supplier of medical devices.Danaher’s move came as a surprise because the company had been discussing joining forces with one of the other bidders - Ventana Medical Systems, also of the US.Philip Whitehead, Danaher’s vice-president for corporate development, said in an interview with the Financial Times that the negotiations with Ventana were mutually ended “as soon as we concluded it wasn’t going anywhere.’’ He did not elaborate.Instead, Danaher is offering A$3.75 per share share for Vision. The takeover battle has sparked a rally in the share price of Vision, which rose 31 cents yesterday to close at A$3.82, up 8.8 per cent. The initial offer, made by Ventana, had valued Vision at A$2.13 per share.Washington-based Danaher’s offer is conditional upon 50.1 per cent of the shares being tendered.It also still faces tough negotiations with Ventana and Cytyc, which have already acquired significant stakes in Vision on the open market that could prevent Danaher from delisting Vision.Cytyc holds 13.5 per cent, while Ventana has 12 per cent. Mr Whitehead said Danaher hoped to gain full control, but was also ready to work with powerful and competing minority shareholders. ”Obviously our hope is that we will get full and 100 per cent control. But it [the situation] is what it is,’’ he said.The board of Vision, which recently rejected a A$600m bid from Cytyc, recommended that shareholders should accept Danaher’s offer in the absence of another improved bid.The three-way jockeying to gain control of Vision comes amid frenzied takeover activity in the Australian healthcare sector.CVC Capital Partners recently agreed to pay A$2.7bn for DCA, which runs hospitals for the elderly and X-ray clinics, while Hospira, a spin-off from Abbott Laboratories , offered A$2.5bn in cash for Mayne Pharma, an Australian supplier of generic drugs. Australian Pharmaceutical Industries (API) is also considering a takeover offer from Sigma Pharmaceuticals.Although Danaher joined the takeover battle after its two rivals, the group insisted yesterday that it had been eyeing Vision for some time, as a way to boost Leica Microsystems, its pathology diagnostics business. Mr Whitehead said that Leica was operating in “a fast-growing, very interesting and lucrative market.’’Danaher, whose activities range from measurement devices to laser-marking technology used by companies to identify their goods, has made several acquisitions in recent years. Mr Whitehead said a takeover of Vision would probably not satiate the group’s appetite for more takeovers.
5;VTR;Ventas Inc;2006-10-03T00:37:12Z;Ventana and Danaher eye joint Vision bid;;The takeover battle for Vision Systems, an Australian supplier of medical technology, intensified after two US companies said they might join forces to trump a competitor’s improved bid.Ventana Medical Systems and Danaher said they were considering a “potential co-operative effort” to thwart US-based Cytyc, which is raising its offer for Australia’s Vision to A$692m (US$517m), or A$3.25 a share.Ventana last week acquired a stake of 12 per cent in Vision that could give it a blocking minority over a competing takeover offer by Cytyc. So far, Danaher has only been conducting due diligence on Vision and has yet to table a bid.The tussle to gain control of Vision has sparked a rally in its share price since Ventana’s initial takeover offer of A$2.13 per share in August. On Monday Vision shares closed 14 per cent higher at A$3.60, with some analysts expecting other companies still enter the race.The bid battle comes after CVC Capital Partners last month agreed to pay A$2.7bn for DCA, which runs hospitals for the elderly and X-ray clinics, setting a new record for a private equity transaction in Australia.Hospira, the US pharmaceuticals group, last month said it was in advanced talks to acquire Mayne Pharma, the Australian injectable drugs specialist, in a deal worth about US$2bn.Ventana started the take-over battle for Vision with a A$450.7m friendly offer, which was then trumped by Cytyc with a A$497m counter-bid. On Monday, Vision recommended shareholders reject Cytyc’s improved bid, a decision that was clearly designed to encourage higher offers.Vision said it would accept Cytyc’s offer if it did not receive a higher proposal within an “acceptable” timeframe. However, Ventana and Danaher warned on Sunday that there was no guarantee that their talks would lead to a joint offer.Analysts at JP Morgan said in a recent research note that companies with a strong presence in clinical diagnostics would be able to derive the most synergies from buying Vision. They also noted that the Australian group, which has launched new medical devices in recent months, could be attractive for “a very large number of companies worldwide”.Meanwhile, shares in Australian Pharmaceutical Industries (API), another possible takeover target, rebounded on Monday after tumbling at the end of last week following a profit warning.API has sought to cool expectations of an imminent takeover by telling shareholders that it had only held informal talks with unnamed parties over ownership issues.Shares in API rose 3 per cent to A$2.39 on Monday, after losing 5.5 per cent on Friday.
6;VTR;Ventas Inc;2006-09-28T12:03:40Z;Ventana ahead in 3-way battle for Vision;;Ventana Medical Systems of the US on Thursday edged ahead of its two rivals in the battle to acquire Vision Systems, an Australian supplier of medical technology, by buying a stake of 12 per cent that could give it a blocking minority over a competing takeover offer.The three-way jockeying to gain control of Vision Systems lifted Vision’s share price 9.3 per cent on Thursday to A$3.06, after a 10 per cent climb on Wednesday. It comes amid frenzied takeover activity in the Australian healthcare sector.Earlier this month, CVC Capital Partners agreed to pay A$1.7bn for DCA, which runs hospitals for the elderly. Meanwhile, Hospira, a spin-off from Abbott, offered A$2.5bn in cash for Mayne Pharma, an Australian supplier of generic drugs.Separately, another likely takeover target, Australian Pharmaceutical Industries (API), on Thursday told shareholders that, although it had unexpectedly been approached by some unnamed companies, it had not yet received a formal takeover offer.Peter Robinson, chairman, said: “As part of our duties we will look at firm approaches that are made to us and at the appropriate time put them to shareholders. However I can assure you that the greatest focus of our directors is on the development of our current business.’’Ventana’s purchase of a stake in Vision comes as Danaher, also of the US, is undertaking due diligence on the group. Cytyc, another US medical technology company, sparked the takeover battle earlier this month when it trumped Ventana’s initial A$450.7m friendly offer with a A$497m counter-bid.The tussle between Ventana and Cytyc also prompted Ventana to threaten to revive a legal case against Cytyc over patent protection, in a dispute that dates back to 2003.Analysts said a US buyer could apply its greater marketing expertise and clout to increase revenues from Vision’s diagnostics business. Analysts at JPMorgan said in a research note that companies with a strong presence in clinical diagnostics would be able to derive the most synergies.They added: “It is the intellectual property associated with Vision’s instrument platform and reagents, which are used in clinical diagnostics, that potential acquirers appear to value most. Vision has accelerated the deployment of its medical devices significantly in recent months.’’The original offer from Ventana valued Vision Systems at A$2.13 per share, but Ventana this week acquired its 12 per cent stake at an average price of A$2.85 per share. The recent share surge and bidding battle means that analysts now expect Vision to be sold for at least A$600m.Management recommended that shareholders should reject Cytyc’s bid, a decision that was interpreted by analysts as a way to encourage higher offers.JPMorgan and other analysts said Vision could be attractive for “a very large number of companies worldwide.’’ An unsourced report from AAP, the Australian news agency, GE Healthcare, the medical technologies subsidiary of General Electric, might also be eyeing Vision.
