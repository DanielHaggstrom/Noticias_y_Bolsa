0;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2018-04-04T15:49:42Z;Investors smart at ailing pharma deals;Doubts hang over acquisitions struck when the industry was in the grip of an M&A frenzy;In the highly unpredictable world of pharmaceuticals, there is but one certainty: all drugs will lose patent protection in the end.This explains why pharma executives are engaged in a perpetual hunt for new medicines to replenish their pipelines and replace revenues from drugs that fall off the “patent cliff”. As Big Pharma has cut back investment in internal research and development in recent years, the search has tended to focus on acquiring smaller biotech companies with promising drugs. Such deals can transform a company’s fortunes. Gilead’s $11.2bn purchase of Pharmasset, a hepatitis C biotech, in 2012, brought with it one of the most lucrative drug franchises. And Bristol-Myers Squibb’s $2.4bn acquisition of Medarex in 2009 turned it into a leader in the hot field of cancer immunotherapy. Not all transactions stand the test of time, however. There is particular concern among investors over a crop of deals done in 2015 and 2016, when the industry was in the grip of a mergers and acquisitions frenzy. Questions over the merits of one such deal — AbbVie’s purchase of Stemcentrx for $5.8bn in 2016 — resulted in a sharp sell-off of its shares late last month, amid concerns the lung cancer medicine it acquired via the acquisition will be a flop. Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at Leerink, said the poor performance of some acquisitions is dissuading drugmakers from agreeing new deals. “There’s a lot of buyer’s remorse out there, and that is part of the reason we’re not seeing people pull the trigger on transactions,” he said.The Financial Times looks at some of the large biotech companies acquired by Big Pharma in 2015 and 2016, and evaluates whether the deals are turning out as planned.Alexion Pharmaceuticals paid a huge premium to acquire Synageva. At the time, then chief executive David Hallal described the deal as a “beautiful fit” and insisted the value was “appropriate” given the potential for Syangeva’s main medicine, Kanuma, to generate $2bn a year in peak sales. But Alexion has struggled to find enough patients for the drug, which treats lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, a rare inherited disease. Mr Porges forecasts peak sales somewhere in the region of $200m a year. Mr Hallal has since left Alexion, as have several other executives and directors, after investors turned sour on the acquisition, which was compounded by accounting irregularities at the company.“The deal was bad enough that the CEO, the entire management team, and a good proportion of the board of directors left,” said Mr Porges. “The pall has lingered over the company for several years.”As recently as October, AbbVie was predicting up to $5bn annual sales for Rova-T, the lead drug it acquired when it bought privately held Stemcentrx. But data published last month from trial of patients with a type of lung cancer suggest the drug is no better than existing treatments. Shares of AbbVie have lost 20 per cent of their value since the data were published, and the scale of the sell-off indicates that investors are worried about more than a single failed medication. AbbVie is highly reliant on Humira, the world’s top-selling medicine, which generated $18.4bn of sales last year and accounts for roughly two-thirds of revenue: the company desperately needs new products to offset the looming introduction of generic versions of the anti-inflammatory drug. Stemcentrx’s drug development platform, which tries to use stem cell technology to discover cancer medicines with a high chance of success, had been touted by AbbVie as an opportunity to push into the lucrative oncology market.But the data “do not instil confidence in the future of the product or the platform”, said Vamil Divan, analyst at Credit Suisse.Somewhat ironically, the failure of the Stemcentrx deal makes AbbVie more — not less — likely to do further acquisitions, because it still needs products to prepare for the Humira patent cliff.“Pharma companies know their products will disappear,” said one lawyer who has advised on several large healthcare transactions. “Either they have to shut off the lights, develop products themselves — which many of them can’t do — or buy them.” Celgene has been doing deals at a frenetic pace as it prepares for the loss of patent protection on Revlimid, a cancer medicine that accounts for 63 per cent of revenue. Some deals have been welcomed by shareholders, like its recent $9bn acquisition of Juno, a leader in the pioneering field of cell therapies for blood cancers.But the deal for Receptos, which Celgene bought to gain a foothold in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s, is not working out as planned. The US Food and Drug Administration recently refused to accept an application to approve the company’s lead medicine, Ozanimod, in patients with a type of multiple sclerosis, leading to concern over its potential.Scott Smith, who had been promoted from head of its inflammation and immunology unit, stepped down as chief operating officer and president on Monday.However, some bankers argued it is unfair to judge companies on individual deals. Drug development is inherently risky with very poor odds of success, they said.“It makes more sense to look at a series of transactions, as if they were in a portfolio of a venture capitalist, and then assess the outcome of those deals in an aggregated manner,” said one healthcare banker. Still, Celgene could have placed a bet on Receptos for much less: it came within touching distance of buying the group in 2013, when its market capitalisation was just $550m.Pfizer acquired Medivation, a cancer biotech group, after a closely fought contest with rivals including Sanofi and Gilead. Medivation already had a drug on the market when it was acquired, a prostate cancer treatment called Xtandi, which meant it attracted a lot of interest. However, it did not take long for investors to turn sour on the deal, as sales of Xtandi fell short of expectations, prompting concern that Pfizer had overpaid.Andy Schmeltz, Pfizer’s global president of oncology, insisted that the merits of the acquisition will become apparent, as the company wins approval to market the drug for patients whose disease is at an earlier stage. “Everything is tracking as we had aspired and we’re very confident this is a good deal, not only for cancer patients, but also for Pfizer shareholders,” he said. One large Pfizer investor said sentiment towards the deal has improved somewhat in recent months, as the company publishes clinical trial data that support its strategy of broadening the number of patients who can receive Xtandi. The person said they would prefer Pfizer to buy medicines that were already approved, such as Xtandi, rather than a drug in late-stage trials that looks like a sure thing but turns out to be a flop.However, some advisers are counselling clients to take care when bidding in overheated auctions. “Some competitive processes are not great,” said one M&A lawyer. “You get rushed on your diligence and it can be hard to resist bidding up.” No auction was more hotly contested than that of Pharmacyclics, which made a single drug, Imbruvica, for blood cancer. More than any other deal, it embodied the M&A frenzy of 2015 and 2016, and the pressures that Big Pharma face to secure new assets. AbbVie eventually won a three-way fight with a mega offer that stole the group away from Johnson & Johnson, which had a longstanding partnership with Pharmacyclics and was confident it would win.Some advisers also suggested AbbVie ended up valuing the whole of Pharmacyclics at roughly $40bn — given that it still has to share a significant chunk of Imbruvica profits with J&J, it is a huge sum for a company making a single medicine. Other investors warn of competition from new drugs that work in a similar way — known as BTK inhibitors — such as AstraZeneca’s Calquence, which launched late last year. “It has been the only BTK on the market until recently,” said Brad Loncar, founder of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy Index. “The question will be how quickly more competition comes, how much it impacts sales and whether others can actually be superior versions.”AstraZeneca managed to snag its BTK medicine for much less than AbbVie, after purchasing a majority stake in Acerta, a Netherlands-based biotech, for $4bn.AbbVie said in 2015 that it expected Imbruvica to generate peak annual revenues in excess of $7bn, but it generated $2.6bn sales last year.However, Mr Porges pointed out that “even though Pharmacyclics was ridiculously expensive, it left them with a good drug”, adding: “I think they would do that deal again today.” *Premiums are calculated based on the difference between the agreed sale price and the undisturbed stock market price of the target
1;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2017-09-06T04:01:51Z;Secretive Moderna yet to convince on $5bn valuation;Biotech hopes to turn our bodies into ‘drug factories’ able to create own cures;"In Silicon Valley technology circles, a company like Moderna would not look out of place: a private group that has obtained a multibillion-dollar “unicorn” valuation by promising to disrupt one of the world’s most lucrative industries.In the world of biotech, Moderna Therapeutics stands out, not just for its pledge to rewrite the rules of drug development, but also for the billions of dollars it has raised from partners and backers since it was founded in 2010.Investors have bestowed the company with a $5bn valuation even though it has yet to provide much proof that its products work.After years of guarding its privacy — it went for the first 18 months without even a website — Moderna has started to open up. It presented at the JPMorgan healthcare conference earlier this year and is holding a research and development day in New York later this month.With Moderna planning to go public in the not too distant future, the next year will prove crucial as it tries to prove it can live up to the hype.There is little doubt that Moderna’s technology, if successful, would be transformational. Rather than trying to discover chemical- or protein-based medicines, it hopes to hack human biology to turn our bodies into mini drug factories that can churn out their own cures and fixes on demand.To do so, the Massachusetts-based company is targeting “messenger RNA” or mRNA, which act as couriers in the body that transport recipes for producing proteins from our DNA. When those recipes are badly written or damaged, the body’s protein-making machinery goes awry, causing all manner of sickness and disease.Moderna believes it can create synthetic mRNA and deliver them into the body, where they will trigger the creation of proteins to stop or reverse illnesses.“What we’re trying to do is mimic biology, which is the best way to make medicines,” says Stéphane Bancel, chief executive, who previously worked at Eli Lilly, the Indiana-based drugmaker, and, most recently, bioMérieux, the French biotech.Mr Bancel says that a major advantage of Moderna’s approach is its replicability. Once it has figured out how to deliver mRNA to treat a specific genetic variant of a disease, it can simply reference the sequence of all the other culpable genes and quickly reproduce the effect.Working at such a speed would dramatically lower the cost and time it takes to develop a medicine, which stands at roughly $2.6bn and a decade, according to Tufts University.“Every time you develop a drug in the old pharma world, you start from scratch and you have to relearn everything,” says Mr Bancel. “The thing that is cool about mRNA is it is really hard to make the first one, but then we can scale very quickly.”Big pharma is enthralled. Moderna has struck lucrative partnerships with companies including AstraZeneca and Merck to work on medicines for a wide range of illnesses from cancer and vaccines to rare diseases.The company has also received millions of dollars in grants from branches of the US Federal government and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Moderna has used the money — and the more than $1bn it has raised from investors — to start working on a large number of medicines for a company of its age, including 12 drugs in its “pipeline” and several more in the early stages of research.One does not have to look far to find doubters, however.In the close-knit world of biotech, where executives regularly bump into each other at conferences, few are willing to make their criticisms public. But hardly anyone in the industry believes Moderna has yet proven it deserves a $5bn valuation, a hefty amount for a group that has no approved medicines.By comparison, Spark Therapeutics, a public company that could win regulatory approval for its gene therapy for blindness later this year, is worth less than half that amount.“It is preposterous,” says one executive. “Unheard of,” proffers another.Rival companies working in mRNA, including Translate Bio, Germany’s CureVac and France’s BioEnTech, have also secured money from investors and inked partnerships with established drugmakers, but their valuations are a fraction of Moderna’s, according to people briefed on the fundraisings.Beyond gripes about the valuation, criticism of Moderna falls into two categories: the area where it is most advanced is vaccines, a low-margin business that will never produce bumper profits; and the company is too secretive, having published scant data showing that its science works.“The only products they have data for so far are vaccine candidates — even if they ever get it approved, they’re very low margin,” says one biotech executive.Others argue that the area of vaccines is an easy target. When something foreign like synthetic mRNA is introduced into our bodies, our immune system tries to destroy it, sometimes triggering an unpleasant reaction. For vaccines — which are designed to elicit a controlled immune response — that is a good thing.“You could call it low-hanging fruit, or a prudent place to start,” says Ron Renaud, chief executive of rival Translate Bio.Mr Bancel argues that vaccines can be big business, pointing to existing “blockbuster” products that have sales in excess of $1bn a year. One of the vaccines the company is working on is for cytomegalovirus, the leading cause of congenital birth defects in the US, and could have similar revenues, he says.However, he concedes vaccines are but a first step for Moderna.“We first wanted a product that was low biology risk,” he says, arguing it makes it easier to show investors and regulators that the company’s technology works.As for the paucity of data — Moderna has released results from a single and small human trial — Mr Bancel says the company has “not published for competitive reasons”.“We said let’s not teach the world how this works because we’ve invested a lot of money,” he adds, although he makes a distinction between the company’s platform and its individual products“We will publish product data; you’re going to see much more, quite a number of studies,” he says.As for the criticism, existing investors seem unfazed.“We always knew this was a big, binary bet,” says someone who works at one of Moderna’s largest backers. “If it pays off, the returns will be huge. We don’t want to be investing in incrementalism.”But while Moderna is well-funded, it is burning through cash, and expects to spend a net $300m this year. Eventually it will need to raise more money.“We’ll go public one day — but not this year,” says Mr Bancel. “It might make sense to do another private financing [first].”When that day comes, Mr Bancel will surely want to maintain or even increase Moderna’s valuation. He still has some people left to convince.It is two decades since researchers cured diabetic mice using mRNA, but translating the effect to humans has been far more difficult.The primary reason is the human immune system zeroes in on synthetic mRNA and destroys it, rendering it useless.The success of Moderna and its rivals therefore rests on their ability to deliver the mRNA without triggering an immune response.Moderna believes it has cracked this problem, but there is one snag: another group, Arbutus Biopharma, says it holds the patents to the delivery technology.The disagreement has culminated in a complex legal battle involving a third company that is due to be settled in court in February.Mr Bancel acknowledges that some of Moderna’s earlier products use technology that was licensed in from elsewhere, but insists later ones use a much better approach developed in-house.“We have invented several families of formulation, developed by Moderna scientists, with patents filed with the patent office,” he says.Mark Murray, chief executive of Arbutus, disagrees.“From our perspective anything we’ve seen in the scientific or patent literature clearly falls under the scope of our intellectual property,” he says. “Nothing they’ve done is free of our IP.”If a judge agrees with Mr Murray, Moderna might end up having to pay a chunky royalty to Arbutus."
2;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Alexion shares fall amid latest management departures;;Alexion announced a wide-ranging management shake-up that will see several top executives depart, sending shares in the rare diseases drugmaker down by 7.4 per cent in early New York trading.The US pharmaceutical company said on Tuesday that it was parting ways with its chief financial officer, Dave Anderson, who only joined the company six months ago in the wake of an accounting scandal.The head of research and development, chief commercial officer and head of human resources are also leaving, Alexion said in a statement.The departures appear to have been engineered by new chief executive Ludwig Hantson, who was appointed in March following several months of turmoil for Alexion.Alexion shares have been on a roller-coaster ride since December, when the company parted ways with its chief executive and chief financial officer after uncovering accounting improprieties.An internal investigation found that customers had been pressured to order medicines before they needed them so the company could meet its financial targets.
3;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Alexion CEO, CFO resign in major shake-up;;The chief executive and chief financial officer of drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals have resigned following allegations the company might have engaged in improper sales practices.The Connecticut-based biotechnology group said on Monday that David Hallal, who has been CEO since April 2015, is leaving with immediate effect. David Brennan, the former CEO of British drugmaker AstraZeneca and a Alexion board member since 2014, will be taking over as interim chief executive.Alexion also announced Vikas Sinha will be replaced as CFO by David Anderson, a former CFO at Honeywell, with immediate effect. Alexion said Mr Sinha has left Alexion “to pursue other opportunities”.The departure of its two most senior executives comes just a month after Alexion said it was delaying its quarterly filing in order to investigate allegations of improper sales practices related to its top-selling drug.The company said last month that its audit and finance board committee was “conducting an investigation into allegations that recently have been made by a former employee” related to sales of Soliris, a drug that treats a rare blood disease.Alexion said in an update on Monday that the audit committee “has not identified any facts” that would require it to “update its previously reported historical results.”It added that it expects to file the Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016 in January 2017 or earlier.Shares in Alexion, which has a market value of $31bn, was briefly halted for trading ahead of the news. The stock tumbled more than 13 per cent in pre-market trading after trading resumed.
4;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2016-11-09T21:58:08Z;Alexion discloses internal probe into sales practices;;Alexion Pharmaceuticals said late on Wednesday that its board has launched an investigation into its sales practices related to its biggest-selling drug.The Connecticut-based biotechnology group said that its audit and finance board committee was “conducting an investigation into allegations that recently have been made by a former employee” related to sales of Soliris, a drug that treats a rare blood disease.Alexion’s board said it has hired outside counsel to assist in the query, and that it had not yet “identified instances where Soliris orders were not placed by customers for patients or any facts that require the company to update its previously reported historical results.”However, it remains “uncertain” on when the investigation will be completed.The company’s shares were halted in extended trading on the news. They were down by 33.3 per cent for 2016 as of Wednesday’s close.
5;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2016-08-22T20:56:26Z;Marathon Oil slips on broad sector fall;US stocks make little progress at start of the week;Marathon Oil led a broad decline in the oil sector’s stocks as crude prices fell back after a bumper seven-session rally.West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, fell 3 per cent to $47.05 on Monday, ending a rally that saw its price rise more than 20 per cent since August 2.Last week’s rise came off the back of hopes that Opec and other big oil producers might finally be looking at a long-discussed output freeze. Positive data and bets by hedge funds that the oil price would rise also helped to send prices higher.But Monday’s pullback led to a broad decline in oil company stock prices.Marathon, the Houston-based exploration and production company, led the pack, falling 6.9 per cent to $15.64 amid the additional investor pressure triggered by managerial changes.JR Sult, the company’s chief financial officer, left the company on Monday, citing personal reasons. Pat Wagner, vice-president of corporate development and strategy, has been named interim chief financial officer.Marathon, also the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 index on Monday, has struggled due to the prolonged drop in oil prices.It reported its sixth straight quarterly loss this month, cutting its production outlook for the year. It has curtailed spending and sold off more than $1bn in assets.It said its revenue fell below $1bn in May for the first time since it became a standalone company in 2002.Other oil stocks also struggled. Murphy Oil was down 3.3 per cent to $29.07, Noble Energy fell 1.5 per cent to $35.57 and Southwestern Energy declined 1.8 per cent to $13.47.At the other end of the spectrum, pharmaceutical companies saw early gains after Pfizer reached a deal worth $14bn to acquire California biotechnology company Medivation.Pfizer, the world’s second-largest drugmaker, saw its stock tick up by 0.2 per cent before giving up ground and closing 0.4 per cent lower at $34.84. Medivation, not in the S&P 500 index, soared higher, up 19.7 per cent to $80.42.The top three performers in the S&P 500 index were pharmaceutical companies.Regeneron rose 3.6 per cent to $418.65, Vertex Pharmaceuticals gained 3 per cent to $100.96 and Alexion Pharmaceuticals climbing 3.3 per cent to $136.53.Elsewhere, clothing brand Urban Outfitters saw its stock fall 3.2 per cent to $36.61 as Goldman Sachs downgraded it from buy to neutral. The bank suggested it was at “near peak” operating performance, leaving less room for meaningful improvement.The S&P 500 was relatively unchanged at 2,182.6, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 18,529.4, and the Nasdaq Composite ticked 0.1 per cent higher to 5,244.6.
6;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2016-01-18T16:46:32Z;Pharma sell-off threatens to stifle appetite for IPOs;Cautious sentiment risks cutting off funding for smaller biotechs;After months of battling a public outcry over high drug prices, the pharmaceuticals and biotech industry had hoped that its annual gathering in San Francisco last week would provide an opportunity to start the year on a positive note.The JPMorgan Healthcare Conference is the largest event of its kind, providing a forum for companies to trumpet their prospects, and for healthcare bankers to cook up deals.Shire, the Anglo-Irish drugmaker, kicked off proceedings by announcing its long-awaited $32bn takeover of US-based Baxalta on Monday. But investors reacted to the proposed deal by promptly sending shares in both companies tumbling, adding to a growing sense that appetite for large deals is waning.There was little else on offer to convince investors to start buying again after the recent sector sell-off. The Nasdaq biotech index finished last week down roughly 6 per cent, compared with a fall of about 2 per cent for the S&P 500.Celgene, one of four large-cap biotech groups, added to the gloom by cutting its profit forecast for 2015 and predicting that revenues this year would be below analyst expectations. Robert Hugin, chief executive since 2010, also spooked some investors by announcing that he is to stand down in March and become chairman.Industry executives argue that investors are missing the bigger picture: biopharma companies are discovering more drugs than they have in years, such as cancer immunotherapies that are producing some remarkable results in tumours which have hitherto been untreatable.They also point to other potentially huge advances: if solanezumab, an Alzheimer’s drug being developed by Eli Lilly, is successful when data from a large trial are published later this year, it would be the first medicine proven to delay the onset of the disease.Investors remain wary, however. Just over a third say they believe solanezumab will work, according to a survey by Evercore ISI, the investment bank. And, at any rate, the data are not due until the fourth quarter — which seems like a long time when stock markets are so volatile.Usually the JPMorgan conference is the time to tee up fundraisings, and I think that this week has probably shaken some organisationsAs investors scurried around the conference halls of Westin St Francis hotel, nervously checking the sea of red on their smartphone stocks apps, bankers and lawyers tried to put a positive gloss on tumbling valuations. They say that the recent market sell-off could spark a fresh wave of deals as acquisitive companies go bargain hunting.Last year was a record for healthcare deals, with much of the activity being driven by a group of drugmakers loosely known as “specialty pharma”, which typically increase profits and sales through acquisitions rather than discovering their own drugs.That is unlikely to be the case in 2016. Allergan, the largest specialty pharma group, has said it will refrain from large deals ahead of its takeover by Pfizer. Valeant, the beleaguered Canadian drugmaker, has pledged to abstain from acquisitions so it can pay down a $31bn net debt position that is making its investors nervous.Instead, bankers expect large, cash-rich biotechs to drive dealmaking, such as Gilead and Amgen, which recently told the Financial Times they were actively seeking acquisitions.However, David Hallal, chief executive of Alexion, a rare diseases specialist, says it will take time for directors of smaller biotech companies to accept that they are worth considerably less than they were in the summer.“Capitulation doesn’t just happen all of a sudden, especially when you juxtapose today’s valuations with where you were just a month or two ago,” says Mr Hallal.Some cash-rich companies will have the luxury of waiting for stock markets to improve, but there are many smaller groups that had hoped to raise funds from investors in the early part of this year through initial public offerings. Others had planned to return for a second or third follow-on financing.“Where the pressure is going to be is on those who are thinking about coming out with their IPO and then all the secondaries,” says Mr Hallal. “Usually the JPMorgan conference is the time to tee up fundraisings, and I think that this week has probably shaken some organisations.”The head of healthcare at one large investment bank said the week would prove crucial for companies considering raising capital. Editas Medicine, a group focused on modifying genetic defects that cause diseases, will test the markets with its IPO, as will BeiGene, a Chinese biotech in the field of cancer.The banker, who is not involved in either fundraising, predicted the companies would complete their listings due to strong support from their existing shareholders, but said if their stock prices subsequently tumbled it could prevent others from following suit.If IPO markets do freeze up, it would leave some cash-strapped companies with little option but to sell at a knockdown price. Many companies are ready to pounce, such as Horizon Pharma, an acquisitive group that is trying to turn itself into a rare diseases specialist.“I think you’re going to see a trend, depending on the next few months, of people being scared about the IPO markets and not being able to access them,” says Timothy Walbert, chief executive of Horizon.“When we do start seeing an increase in trading in private companies, we will have the ability with our cash balance to be active.”A panel of experts appointed by the US Food and Drug Administration is set to recommend on Friday whether or not the medicines watchdog should approve a new drug for a rare and deadly childhood disease.There is no treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an inherited disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness in boys, leading to paralysis in early infancy, and cardiac and respiratory problems during a sufferer’s teenage years. Most patients die in their twenties.Sarepta Therapeutics, a tiny biotech group, is hoping to secure the first approval for a DMD drug, but a negative briefing document published by the FDA on Friday does not bode well. Shares in the group fell 55 per cent following its release.If the FDA rejects the drug, it will be the second time it has rejected approval for a treatment for DMD this year. Last week, it refused to approve a similar treatment made by BioMarin, a rare diseases specialist.The knock-back was an embarrassment for BioMarin, which took a big gamble by buying the drug’s maker, Prosensa, for $680m last year, even though the medicine had failed in late-stage clinical trials and lost the backing of its big partner, GlaxoSmithKline.PTC Therapeutics has also applied for approval for its DMD medication, even though the medicine failed to hit its primary target during a clinical trial last year. The drug is conditionally approved in Europe, pending the results of further trials.The failure of all three drugs, which have secured billions of dollars in investment, would underline the sometimes risky endeavour of developing medicines for rare diseases.Because the number of people suffering from a rare disease is by definition so small, it can be hard to design clinical trials that show a clear benefit — even though the cost of the medicines often runs to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for each patient.A highly organised group of parents who have campaigned for the medicines to be approved fear that if the FDA rejects the drugs, its decision will discourage drugmakers from pursuing other potential treatments for the disease.
7;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2015-11-09T10:24:19Z;Amgen on the hunt for potential deal of up to $10bn;Companies with drugs already in clinical testing are being evaluated;Amgen, one of the four largest US biotech groups, is on the hunt for potential acquisitions, according to people familiar with the situation, as it prepares to end its self-imposed exile from the boom in pharmaceuticals mergers and acquisitions.More than $850bn of healthcare deals have been announced since the start of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters, but Amgen has so far stayed on the sidelines, eschewing large or medium-sized transactions.Instead, it has focused its efforts on buying or licensing a handful of unproven drugs that are in early-stage testing and typically command much smaller price tags.However, a person familiar with the company’s thinking said it had recently “opened the aperture” and was now evaluating companies worth up to $10bn, with drugs that have been proven in clinical testing and are almost ready to bring to market.Companies that have recently completed similar acquisitions include Celgene, another biotech group, which paid $7.2bn for cancer specialist Receptos, and Alexion, which spent $8.4 on Synageva, a rare diseases specialist.Amgen, which ended last week with an equity value of $121bn, has also been seen as a potential target and has been linked to Allergan, the drugmaker that is in talks about combining with Pfizer.One investor who recently held meetings with Amgen’s management team said the company had contacted shareholders in the past few weeks to get “everybody prepared” for an acquisition.Amgen declined to comment.Amgen’s last major acquisition was Onyx, which it bought in 2013 for roughly $10bn, primarily to secure the rights to its cancer drug Kyprolis.$121bnAmgen’s market value on FridayInvestors initially turned sour on the Onyx deal amid lacklustre sales of the medicine, but many shareholders revised their opinion this year, after the US drugs watchdog approved Kyprolis for use in a cocktail of medicines to treat patients with cancer of the plasma cells.The decision by the Food and Drug Administration paves the way for a big jump in sales, according to analysts.“They’re taking a lot of comfort from the Onyx acquisition,” the investor said.Amgen would probably finance an acquisition by raising debt, according to the person familiar with the company’s thinking.Although the company’s balance sheet has $30bn of debt it also has roughly the same amount in cash, with the vast majority trapped offshore. Repatriating cash to the US to fund a deal would incur a hefty tax bill.Amgen, founded in 1980, is one of the four cornerstone groups of the US biotech sector, along with Celgene, Gilead and Biogen, and is credited with developing some of the first successful “biologic” drugs.It is now facing competition to some of its top-selling products from a new generation of “biosimilar” copycat medicines. Earlier this year, the FDA approved the first ever biosimilar version of Neupogen, an Amgen medicine that had sales of $1.16bn last year.Last year, Dan Loeb, the activist investor, acquired a stake in Amgen through his Third Point vehicle and pushed for cost-cutting and a potential break-up of the company. Subsequently, the group said it would make roughly $1.5bn of cuts.However, Amgen has fiercely resisted any attempt to split in two, and Mr Loeb has, for now, dropped the idea.
8;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2020-04-25T06:59:05+0000;Orphan drugs become big business;Investors are drawn to the low-volume, high-margin model;Orphan drugs might target small groups of patients, but they are increasingly big business.Pharmaceutical companies, from tiny biotech start-ups to Shire, the London-listed group with a market capitalisation of more than £30bn, are focusing on drugs for orphan diseases, lured by regulatory incentives and a low-volume, high-margin business model.Ever since the introduction of the US Orphan Drug Act 32 years ago, developing medicines for rare disease has become the so-called “Goldilocks option” for some pharma companies.Groups selling orphan drugs are granted seven years of market exclusivity (against five years for most medicines), along with generous tax credits. Because they target diseases that do not already have treatments, they also tend to benefit from other regulatory initiatives designed to get drugs to market more quickly.Once approved, the drugs often have a ready-made audience: many patients with rare diseases are well organised in advocacy groups, have been waiting for years for a treatment, and are primed to request the medicine from their doctors once it is available.Global sales of orphan drugs are expected to jump as more companies enter this field, rising by 11 per cent each year to reach $176bn in 2020, according to EvaluatePharma, the research group.Investors have taken notice. In the past year, the value of US biotech companies focused on rare diseases has risen by about 56 per cent, according to the Orphan Disease Index, assembled by JMP Securities, a San Francisco investment bank.That performance was even better than the broader Nasdaq biotech index, which is up by roughly 37 per cent over the same period, and smashed the S&P 500 index, which is 5 per cent higher.Venture capitalists who invest in early-stage companies have also increased their bets in the US. In 2012-14, these early-stage companies raised more than $500m each year, compared with 2008 when they pulled in less than $200m.Orphan medicines account for about one in three drug approvals in the US but no one in the industry expects the proliferation of medicines to end in the near future, according to Christopher Milne, an orphan drug specialist at the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development. “There is a lot of low-hanging fruit,” says Mr Milne. “With 7,000 rare diseases, there is plenty of potential, because just 10 per cent of those have treatments.”The opportunity has prompted Shire to try to build an orphan drugs powerhouse as it seeks to reduce its overall reliance on Vyvanse, its blockbuster treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.To that end, it recently bought NPS, a US-based rare disease specialist, for $5.2bn and is in the throes of a $30bn hostile takeover attempt of Baxalta, another US group, which focuses on rare blood disorders.Rare diseases is one of the few areas in pharmaceuticals where it is not essential to be big. Many successful smaller biotechs will have to decide whether they can go it alone. Those lucky enough to win approval can struggle to build a global sales force and manufacturing capabilities, forcing them to turn to big pharma.To get their medicine to market, they often have to sell the company outright to a larger group or strike a sales and distribution partnership in exchange for a large share of revenues and profits.Companies focused on orphan drugs, however, are less likely to be forced into the same choice: because the patient populations are so small, they can afford to make and sell the drug themselves.Alexion, founded in 1992, is a case in point. By switching its focus to rare diseases 10 years ago, it has been able to build its business without selling itself to, or joining forces with, a larger rival.Its only approved product in the US is Soliris, a treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, an ultra-rare and deadly blood disorder.The drug is also used to treat atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome, which causes blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body.Alexion’s market capitalisation is almost $43bn. Despite booking sales of $2.2bn in 2014, it employs just 2,800 people, equating to revenue of almost $790,000 per employee, one of the highest ratios in the industry.But companies such as Alexion can experience growing pains, too. Once they have developed a successful orphan drug and sold it to what is always a small patient population, it can often be hard to create growth.Alexion tackled that problem this year by buying Synageva, another rare diseases group, for $8.4bn, a 139 per cent premium on its market value before the deal was announced. It was among the biggest premiums ever paid for a company, according to Dealogic.In a recent note, Geoff Porges, an analyst at Bernstein, explained that Alexion had to pay such a high price because companies developing orphan drugs are, by their very nature, quite rare.“Synageva was one of a handful of rare disease companies with real scale,” said Mr Porges.“We believe the other biotechs focused on rare diseases that Alexion reviewed were relatively few in number and had idiosyncratic drawbacks.”Either the companies had proven assets, in which case they commanded very high valuations, or they were early-stage biotechs with risky, experimental drugs, Mr Porges added.
9;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
10;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2015-09-27T23:00:57Z;High healthcare prices force payers to find ways to cut their bills;Health providers are joining forces in an attempt to negotiate discounts;Nothing strikes fear into pharmaceutical executives so much as pricing.Those who pay for healthcare — whether the insurance companies in the US or the public health systems in other countries — have warned they cannot cope with rampant drug price inflation at a time when society is ageing.Yet there is one area that has proven relatively sheltered from pricing pressure: orphan drugs for rare diseases.This is all the more surprising, given that these drugs normally command very high prices.Soliris, a drug made by Alexion Pharmaceuticals to treat two rare diseases, costs between $400,000 and $560,000 per patient per year, for instance.An Alexion representative says it has experienced little difficulty getting the drug on to US “formularies” — the lists of approved drugs compiled by the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who buy medications.The rationale for charging such high prices is that orphan drugs, by their very nature, will only ever be prescribed to a small number of patients.If a pharmaceutical company is to recoup the investment it takes to develop a new medicine and have it approved, it must charge more per head for orphan drugs than traditional ones.In a recent report, Express Scripts (the largest of the PBMs) used this argument to justify its decision to take on another company, Gilead, which charges $1,000 a pill for a drug that treats hepatitis C, a common illness.“Orphan drugs are among the most expensive medications in the US, often costing tens of thousands of dollars per prescription,” the report said. “[They] treat extremely rare conditions . . . typically only several thousand patients or fewer. The high price tag is necessary — and justified — to fund manufacturer research and development costs.”However, orphan drugs are not entirely immune from pricing pressure. In an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last year, researchers found that many insurers were demanding that doctors get explicit permission before prescribing orphan drugs, or requiring that patients undergo a clinical diagnostic test to ensure they have the relevant condition.Analysts at Wells Fargo bank think PBMs will continue to support the makers of orphan drugs, because, while they cost more per head, these companies tend to evaluate medicines on the “pooled” price rather than an individual basis.They also reckon that PBMs do not want to contend with the negative publicity of denying someone with a rare, quite often deadly condition a potentially life-saving drug. “The political risks of denying reimbursement or coverage may outweigh any potential cost-savings,” the Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a recent note for investors.Some policymakers know those risks all too well. Two years ago, the Belgian health ministry found itself at the centre of a row over its refusal to pay for Soliris for a seven-year-old boy suffering from a rare kidney disease. It eventually agreed to foot the bill after negotiating a discount from Alexion. The case suggests that, while Alexion might be able to set high prices in its domestic market, it could face pressure from health systems in other countries.This year, Belgium formed a partnership with the Netherlands to purchase orphan drugs jointly in an attempt to extract discounts from manufacturers.Canada, too, exerted pressure in February when one of its regulators launched a hearing to review what it described as “excessive” pricing for Soliris.With orphan drugs accounting for roughly a third of all new medicine approvals in the US, says Christopher Milne, an orphan drug specialist at the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, it is an open question as to how long rare disease drugmakers would be able to withstand pricing pressure in the world’s largest and most lucrative healthcare market.But currently there is little sign of a crackdown. If anything, politicians are heading in the opposite direction.US policymakers are trying to institute a change in the law that could prove lucrative for orphan drugmakers. The so-called 21st Century Cures bill is seeking to give a six-month extension of marketing exclusivity to existing drugs that are repurposed for rare diseases.The Congressional Budget Office reckons the legislation would cost the federal government at least $869m by 2025, and possibly more if it delays the introduction of generic “copycat” drugs seeking to treat the illnesses for which the drug was originally intended.Others in the pharma industry warn of unintended consequences. They say that by offering drugmakers such lucrative incentives for orphan indications, they could discourage them from developing treatments for more common diseases, and thus stop them saving more lives.
11;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2015-09-22T08:29:42Z;How US biotech valuations got stretched;Hillary Clinton comments on ‘price-gouging’ hit the sector — but it was already vulnerable;After a stunning rise, US biotechnology shares have had the air taken out of them.After suffering its second biggest decline of the year on Monday, the Nasdaq biotech index slid a further 1.7 per cent on Tuesday, after Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, promised to take on “outrageous” price-gouging in the industry.The comment, sparked after a report highlighted how privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals had raised the price of a 62-year-old drug by more than 5,000 per cent, unnerved investors who had sent the combined market valuation of companies within the Nasdaq biotech index to more than $1tn for the first time earlier this year.Of the 144 companies on the Nasdaq biotech index, shares of 137 groups have fallen over the past two days, including drops of more than 15 per cent by Bluebird Bio, Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Horizon Pharma, ImmunoGen and Retrophin.The index’s valuation has sunk more than $150bn from its peak as investors shift out of US stocks and the Federal Reserve readies to raise interest rates. That has added acute pressure to the Russell 2000 biotech index — home to younger, less-established small-cap biotech groups — whose valuations are dependent on future cash flows and a continued wave of merger and acquisition activity.Russ Koesterich, BlackRock’s chief investment strategist, said valuations had become “aggressive, particularly in the small-cap space” after a sustained six-year rally.“Whenever you have aggressive valuations, any sniff that [the sector] may not be able to deliver — and today we had concerns about pricing power — you’ll have an outsize reaction,” he said.Valuations have been a concern for investors in US equities this year, who have broadly preferred European and Japanese stocks as central banks there continue to ease.The Nasdaq biotech index trades at 41.86 times forward earnings, down from a peak of 55.76 earlier this year but a substantial premium to other parts of the US stock market, according to FactSet. In contrast, S&P 500 healthcare companies — including blue-chips such as Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Pfizer and UnitedHealth — trade at 16.75 times expected earnings over the next 12 months.“While healthcare in general is reasonably priced, biotech valuations are stretched,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, said. “It’s hard to put a p/e on a dream.”Those valuations have been supported by an expanding drug pipeline and a surge in deals. Some 747 mergers and acquisitions have been announced in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries worth nearly $300bn since the year began, up 46 per cent from the same point in 2014, according to data from Dealogic.Analysts with Citi warned that political rhetoric would intensify, which they argued could “impact the assessment of potential acquisition targets” by blue-chip pharmaceutical groups seeking growth through M&A.Against a backdrop of slow economic expansion, boards of US companies have often decided to buy faster growing companies instead of investing in research and development. The prospect of strong earnings and sales growth, often linked to successful medical trials, has appealed to investors after two consecutive quarters of sales declines by the S&P 500.Earnings for healthcare companies within the S&P 500 are forecast to rise 13 per cent from a year earlier in 2015, faster than any other sector, according to S&P Capital IQ.The potential for blockbuster new drugs has also enticed investors. Analysts with Barclays note that roughly a dozen biotechs have key catalysts before year end, including data from trials undertaken by Gilead, Biogen Idec, Neurocrine Biosciences and Alexion Pharmaceuticals.Gilead has epitomised how a novel medical treatment can catapult a company’s share price and valuation. Sales at the company, known for its $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pills, have more than tripled over the past four years, while its market valuation has soared from $29bn to $155bn.Despite the recent declines, the Nasdaq biotech index remains 10.4 per cent above where it started the year, outpacing the 0.4 per cent advance by the overall Nasdaq Composite. Shares of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Sarepta Therapeutics, Exelixis and Prothena Corp have all climbed more than 100 per cent.Biotechs have also seen strong demand for new issuance. Some 94 companies have come to market, raising a total of $8.5bn year-to-date, Dealogic data shows. The figure is tracking ahead of the record $11.6bn raised in 2010, when 77 companies floated. Of the 39 debuts in the US, share prices have advanced 24 per cent on average.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
12;ALXN;Alexion Pharm Inc;2015-05-06T12:45:58Z;Alexion to buy Synageva for $8.4bn;Acquisition by drug developer latest sign of biotech buzz;Alexion, a rare-disease drug developer, agreed to acquire smaller rival Synageva BioPharma for $8.4bn, more than double its market value before the deal was announced, in the latest sign the biotech sector is heating up.The 139 per cent premium Alexion agreed to pay for the rival is likely to raise fresh concerns the industry is entering bubble territory as companies take bigger risks to secure potentially lucrative drugs.David Hallal, Alexion chief executive, defended the large premium, saying he was “confident the value is appropriate given Synageva’s ideal operational fit” and predicting that Kanuma, Syangeva’s main medicine, had the potential to be a $2bn drug.“It’s just dead on strategy with its exclusive focus on Kanuma and [rare diseases], which fits beautifully with our current focus,” Mr Hallal told the Financial Times.Under the terms of the agreement, the Connecticut company will pay Synageva shareholders $115 in cash and 0.6581 Alexion shares, valuing Synageva’s stock at $230. On Tuesday, Synageva’s share price closed at $95.87.Synageva’s shares rose 112 per cent by close of trading, while Alexion’s fell 8 per cent in a sign investors in the larger company were concerned about the valuation. In most transactions over the past 18 months, buyers’ shares have tended to rise as investors rewarded companies seeking inorganic growth, although historically the opposite has been true.Alexion is a rare diseases specialist whose main product is Soliris, a treatment for Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH), an ultra-rare and deadly blood disorder, which results in the destruction of the patient’s red blood cells and costs the UK’s National Health Service £340,200 a year per patient.The drug is also used to treat Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (AHUS), which leads to the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body and causes a high instance of mortality.By switching its focus to rare diseases about 10 years ago, Alexion, which was founded in 1992, has been able to build its business without selling itself to or partnering with a larger rival for the distribution capabilities it would need to reach bigger patient populations.It had revenues of $2.2bn in 2014 but employs just 2,500 people, equating to revenue of almost $900,000 per employee, one of the highest ratios in the industry.Synageva’s main drug, Kanuma, is a treatment for a rare and deadly disease known as Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency or LAL D, which results in the build-up of fatty material in the liver and blood vessel walls and causes many sufferers to die in their infancy. It has received breakthrough therapy designation from the US drugs watchdog, which should expedite its launch to market.As a rare diseases group, much of Alexion’s focus is on finding patients who are undiagnosed and training doctors to spot uncommon conditions. “We’re going to take what we know . . . which is recognising cases and overcoming very low awareness, into LAL D,” Mr Hallal said, adding the disease “probably has a very high rate of misdiagnosis”.Frankly, [sceptics] could not see what the opportunity was — but we see parallel opportunities for LAL DMr Hallal said Kanuma would be incorporated into a “global franchise” for metabolic diseases, along with another drug that Alexion is developing for hypophosphatasia, which affects the development of bones and teeth.“Back in 2006 there were probably a fair amount of Alexion sceptics who asked how do you build a sustainable biotech company out of these rare diseases. Frankly, people could not see what the opportunity was — but we see parallel opportunities for LAL D,” added Mr Hallal.Alexion, which has a market valuation of about $34bn, said the transaction would result in annual cost synergies as early as this year, although it did not specify the amount. By 2017 it said it would achieve synergies of at least $150m. It added the deal would be accretive to earnings per share in 2018.Lazard and JPMorgan advised Alexion, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was its legal counsel. Goldman Sachs advised Synageva, with the legal support of Sullivan & Cromwell and Ropes & Gray.
