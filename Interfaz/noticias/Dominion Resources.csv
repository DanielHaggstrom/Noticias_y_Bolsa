0;D;Dominion Resources;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Aetna rises after earnings beat forecasts;Health insurer’s results buoyed by higher operating income and reduction in medical care spending;Aetna shares climbed on Monday after it reported better than expected quarterly profits as the share of premiums spent on healthcare services dipped.The health insurer earned $320.8m in the fourth quarter, up from $232m in the period in 2014. Operating income, which excludes certain items, rose 12 per cent year on year to $1.37 a share, easily beating estimates of $1.21.Aetna’s bottom line received a lift from a reduction in medical care spending. The proportion of premiums paid in healthcare costs fell from 83 per cent to 81.9 per cent as its medical benefit ratio in the government and commercial segments dipped.Mark Bertolini, chief executive, said the group was “on track” to complete its buyout of fellow health insurerHumana in the second half. The pact, which was unveiled in 2015, would deepen exposure to the Medicare market, where its plans supplement those offered to the elderly by the US government.Aetna’s shares rose 1.50 per cent to $103.37 by the close, bringing their 12-month advance to around 12 per cent.Elsewhere healthcare companies were in focus after another batch of deals were announced.Shares in Alere, a provider of diagnostic tests, surged almost 45.5 per cent to $54.11 after industry heavyweight Abbott Laboratories agreed to acquire it for $56 a share.Under the deal, which will give Alere an equity value of $5.8bn, Abbott will assume about $2.6bn of its debt. Abbott expected the acquisition to lift its total diagnostics sales to more than $7bn.Not all deals received a thumbs-up from shareholders. Shares in Stryker, the medical device company, fell earlier in the day after it announced a deal to buy Sage Products, which makes care products, for $2.78bn. They closed almost flat.Twitter, the short messaging service, closed up 6.61 per cent to $17.91 after a report said Marc Andreessen and Silver Lake had “considered some sort of deal”. However, a source close to Silver Lake dismissed the report, which had appeared in The Information.The shares have halved during the past 12 months as a management overhaul has done little to assuage investor concerns over user growth.Dominion Resources came under pressure after the midsized US electricity and gas distributor unveiled plans to buy smaller rival Questar for $4.4bn. In a sign that Dominion’s all-cash offer of $25 a share might be too rich for investors, the stock fell 2.76 per cent to $70.18.Shares in Questar jumped 22.56 per cent to $24.99.Aluminium producer Alcoa added to its 14-month rout, dropping 1.10 per cent to $7.21 as news that Elliott Management was supporting its board nominees failed to lift sentiment. The stock’s losses for the past 12 months exceed 54 per cent.By the close the S&P 500 was almost flat at 1,938.85, the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged down to 16,444.11 and the Nasdaq Composite was slightly up at 4,619.53.
1;D;Dominion Resources;2016-02-01T12:18:26Z;US gas distributors Dominion and Questar to merge in $4.4bn deal;;Consolidation in the energy sector continued apace on Monday with Dominion Resources, a mid-sized US electricity and gas distributor, offering to buy smaller rival Questar for $4.4bn.The $25-a-share all cash offer represents a 22 per cent premium to Questar’s closing price on Friday and comes as energy companies come under increasing pressure to merge amid the 19 month long rout in global crude prices.The addition of Utah-based Questar will expand Dominion’s geographic reach in the US. Dominion’s existing natural gas operations lie in the heart of the mid-Atlantic, whereas Questar’s system covers western states such as Utah, Wyoming and Idaho.Dominion said:The combined company would serve about 2.5 million electric utility customers and 2.3 million gas utility customers in seven states. It also would operate more than 15,500 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines, one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage systems, and approximately 24,300 megawatts of generation.
2;D;Dominion Resources;2013-07-08T16:47:03Z;Dell rises but US tech stocks struggle;;Dell shares led a strong open to the week’s US equities trading after news emerged that an influential shareholder advisory firm has backed founder Michael Dell’s proposal to take the computer maker private.Shares in the company rose 3.2 per cent to $13.44, and have traded near the $14 range since January when word of buyout discussions first broke.Dell has struggled as it looks to reduce its dependence on a steadily shrinking PC market and become a broader technology company.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,640.49 as a broad rally was led by the energy and consumer sectors, while some tech stocks were under pressure on concerns about the global PC market.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was down 2 per cent after analysts downgraded Intel. Like Dell, Intel has been hit by concerns that the decline of PC sales will damage its core business. Shares in the chipmaker were down 3.6 per cent to $23.19 after downgrades from Evercore Partners and Citigroup.However, declining PC sales only tell part of the story. In the growing mobile chip market, it is far behind competitors.“They have almost no share in the 3G market, which is heavily dominated by Qualcomm, Samsung and some others,” said S&P Capital IQ analyst Christine Amracost. “They have some small wins, but on the 3G they really haven’t been there yet.”She added that Intel is preparing to release its new mobile chip in 2014 to directly compete with the industry leaders.“The game really starts in 2014,” she said.Apple’s struggles, along with Intel, meant the tech-heavy Nasdaq lagged behind the broader rally, up 0.2 to 3,484.83. Apple shares were off 0.6 per cent to $415.05.Sprint Nextel shares were down 1.1 per cent to $7.08 after the company said more than half of its investors chose to receive cash instead of stock in SoftBank as part of its acquisition deal, exceeding the money available for the scheme.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent to 15,225.15. American Express, up 1 per cent to $77.04, and Walmart, 2 per cent higher to $76.71, helped drive the blue-chip index.Utilities were among the strongest sectors, breaking a recent downward trend that has coincided with rising US Treasury rates and better performance from more cyclical sectors.The Southern Company rose 1.7 per cent to $43.85, Dominion Resources added 1.1 per cent to $56.88, and PPL gained 1.7 per cent to $29.85.For all the concerns about rising interest rates and the upcoming end of quantitative easing, the S&P 500 is only 2.7 per cent off its all-time highs hit in May.The Russell Small-cap index hit an all-time high on Monday, adding 0.3 per cent to 1,008.76, having passed the 1,000 mark for the first time on Friday.It has also performed noticeably well when compared with the other major indices since the market top in May. Up 18.8 per cent on the year to date, the Russell has since the beginning of June outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 2 percentage points.The earnings season began with Alcoa reporting earnings just after the bell on Monday. Yum Brands, which has become sensitive to Chinese consumer consumption, reports on Wednesday, and US banks JPMorgan and Wells Fargo on Friday.One of the world’s largest aluminium producers, Alcoa was up 1.4 per cent to $7.87, and traded about 1.3 per cent higher in after-hours trading after reporting that it had beaten earnings per share and revenue estimates.
3;D;Dominion Resources;2013-05-15T09:14:53Z;US utilities’ outperformance fades away;Groups shed 4% in May after strong start to year;The record rally for US stocks that kicked off the year was driven by a historic outperformance from companies in the utilities sector, Wall Street’s hallmark defensive equity market bet.Utilities companies significantly, and unusually, outpaced the industry’s expected returns in a rising market during the four months through April, according to historical research compiled by AllianceBernstein.But the sector, which groups together slow-growth, high-yielding companies such as US electricity groups Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, has since weakened. After a ferocious start to the year, utilities companies have shed 3.3 per cent in May even as a broader market rally continues.Analysts said the early-year rally in utilities’ shares was driven by a hesitancy among investors to buy into riskier equities, a fear that has somewhat dissipated.The recent declines for the utilities sector have meant it is now underperforming the S&P 500, having risen 14.6 per cent in the year to date compared with a 16.3 per cent gain for the benchmark. But the healthcare sector, another defensive industry, still remains as the top performing industry this year.“Through much of history, the defensive sectors have tended to consistently underperform in a rising market,” said Vadim Zlotnikov, chief market strategist at AllianceBernstein. “What was unique about the period through to the end of April was the very unusual outperformance of utilities and other defensive sectors.”Analysts said the gains were a result of a timid push into equities that helped stretch valuations in the companies beyond long-run price-to-earnings averages.Concerns that the US economy was headed for a spring slowdown have been allayed to some extent of late, as encouraging data on retail sales and employment have boosted investor confidence.Investors are seeking companies that are undervalued across all sectorsWhile utilities and other defensive sectors have weakened in recent days, the broad rally on the US market has been driven by soaring prices in stocks more sensitive to swings in the economy.Financials and companies that sell non-essential consumer goods have been the strongest gaining sectors so far in May. Analysts have said gains from companies in those industries and other cyclical sectors are more typical of a rising US market.“If you think about how the rally started, it was driven by investors who were chasing yield from other asset classes,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TDAmeritrade.“What has happened is that the market has found new momentum and now investors are seeking companies that are undervalued across all sectors, particularly ones that had been depressed in recent months.”
4;D;Dominion Resources;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Dominion carves role as utility;;Dominion Resources, the US energy utility, on Monday completed its move away from exploration and production with the sale of the bulk of its US Appalachian operations to Consol Energy, the US coal and natural gas producer.Consol, which has been expanding in natural gas as its coal output declined, will pay almost $3.5bn in cash for Dominion’s conventional E&P operations, as well as the rights to about 491,000 acres in the Marcellus Shale formation.Investment in the Appalachian region by energy companies has picked up since technological developments enabled gas extraction from the Marcellus Shale about four years ago.The area is currently producing about 2.5bn cubic foot per day of natural gas, but that is predicted to rise to as much as 6bn cubic feet a day by 2013, according to industry bankers.Competition for unconventional oil and gas assets, which require more energy and more sophisticated technology to extract, has picked up in the past year as companies focus on securing their supply of natural resources.The biggest deal of last year was ExxonMobil’s $41bn offer to buy XTO Energy, the shale gas specialist.The deal will bolster Consol’s natural gas reserves and production capacity, nearly tripling its presence in the Appalachian basin of Pennsylvania and West Virginia.“In addition to bolstering our gas platform, this transaction will also result in a more balanced energy portfolio,” J Brett Harvey, Consol’s chief executive, said in a statement.Natural gas is expected to account for 35 per cent of Consol’s revenues following the purchase.Consol also said that it would look to raise $4bn in equity and debt to fund the acquisition and to develop the fields.The deal is set to close at the end of April and according to Consol will increase its proven gas reserves by 50 per cent and double its potential gas resources.After the deal, Dominion will have largely completed its withdrawal from its upstream operations, a process that began in 2007.It wants to focus on its business as a regulated utility, storing and transporting natural gas.The company originally set out to sell only the drilling rights to the Marcellus formation, while retaining its shallower producing assets. The price offered by Consol for its entire Appalachian business prompted the company to agree to its sale, said people familiar with the deal.Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Consol on the deal, while Barclays Capital advised Dominion.Consol shares fell 10.22 per cent to $48.79 in afternoon trading as investors digested the fundraising that will be needed to complete the deal.Dominion’s stock price was almost unchanged, at $39.68.
5;D;Dominion Resources;2010-03-15T20:24:15Z;Consol;The miner’s shale deal has dangers, but there is no reward without risk;Old king coal had reason to be a merry old soul on Monday, but investors didn’t see things that way. Shares in Appalachian miner Consol Energy lost a 10th of their value after it announced a bold deal to pay utility Dominion Resources $3.5bn in cash for a vast tract of gas-rich acreage in the Marcellus Shale. In addition to Consol’s production, the enlarged company would get a third of its revenue from gas.The deal vaults Consol from 15th to third place in terms of acreage controlled in the leading eastern US energy patch, behind Chesapeake Energy and Range Resources, each with about twice as much. Consol reckons that, accounting for Dominion’s more easily valued proved reserves, it is paying under $1bn for undeveloped Marcellus resources or about $1,903 an acre. That is a very attractive price indeed for access to the region.Small deals that have more onerous royalty requirements have been done at more than twice as much. Current benchmark prices of about $4.40 a million British thermal units should generate a 20 per cent after tax rate of return. The deal will require considerable debt and equity issuance but Consol hinted it could trim its exposure through sales or joint ventures.There is no such thing as a free lunch, though. Two risks to Consol’s deal are that furious shale drilling creates an even worse US gas glut, forcing down prices and returns, or that it creates an environmental backlash over controversial hydraulic fracturing techniques that are used to unlock the gas. ExxonMobil, which paid $41bn or 13 per cent of its market value for gas-rich XTO Energy, could lick its wounds if its deal flopped. Consol, wagering a proportion three times as high, might not get off so lightly. No risk, no reward.
6;D;Dominion Resources;2009-07-31T19:00:15Z;US stocks close month with hefty gains;;US equities settled mixed on Friday, but closed out July with solid gains as data on the economy suggested the vehemence of the recession was abating and expansion beckoned in the third quarter.Among second-quarter earnings on Friday, Chevron reported a 71 per cent drop in profits. The stock rose 2.6 per cent to $69.47, pushing it up 1.5 per cent this week.Constellation Energy beat estimates and raised its earnings forecast for the full year. The power company’s shares dropped 1.1 per cent to $28.70.Also exceeding its forecasts, Dominion Resources recorded a 52 per cent rise in net income but cut its outlook. The stock fell 2.1 per cent to $33.80.After the closing bell on Thursday, Walt Disney reported a 26 per cent slide in third quarter earnings. The stock slid 4.2 per cent to $25.12 and analysts at JP Morgan downgraded Disney on Friday.The S&P 500 gained 0.1 per cent to close at 987.48, having risen 0.7 per cent to a high of 993.18 earlier. That left the benchmark up 0.8 per cent for the week, and 7.4 per cent higher for July.The Nasdaq Composite slipped in late trade on Friday, closing down 0.3 per cent at 1,978.50, for a weekly climb of 0.6 per cent and a monthly rise of 7.8 per cent.Both the S&P and Nasdaq have rallied for each of the past five months and this week the main benchmarks set highs for the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.2 per cent higher at 9,171.61 on Friday, a gain of 0.9 per cent this week. For July, blue chips jumped 8.6 per cent, the best month since a rise of 10.6 per cent in October 2002.The rise in shares on Friday came after the advance read on US gross domestic product for the second quarter showed a contraction of 1 per cent. That was better than the forecast decline of 1.5 per cent.Economists said this indicated that the recession was abating, clearing the way for a modest expansion during the third quarter.That outlook has powered the equity market’s rally in recent weeks, but some worry that the market is due for a pullback. “There is a lot of money moving off the sidelines into the market, chasing performance,” said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos. “The stock market is getting ahead of itself.”Caution over the economic outlook was provided by the GDP report which showed that consumer spending slipped 1.2 per cent during the second quarter, more than a forecast drop of 0.5 per cent.“With consumers still flat on their backs, it will be a long time before the recovery gains any real momentum,” said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics.Meanwhile, downward revisions to past quarters also weighed on sentiment.GDP for the first quarter is now seen to have fallen 6.4 per cent, more than an earlier decline of 5.5 per cent, while fourth quarter GDP is now pegged at a 1.9 per cent decline, versus a prior drop of 0.8 per cent. But investors are banking that companies, which have focused on drastic cost cutting this year, will benefit quickly from a pick-up in the economy.“The reversal of the safe haven trade we have seen on Wall Street for the past three months is set to start playing out on Main Street,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “It’s not just the lean and mean companies, but also those consumers who have saved and delayed buying products. There is a lot of pent-up demand.”From a trading perspective, the S&P 500 has room to rally beyond resistance just above 1,000 and possibly approach 1,100, according to some analysts“The 1,100 area on the S&P marks fair value for the market’s move between 1994 and the top in 2007,” said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. “These high-value trading areas are like magnets for the market.”Among stocks in the news this week, shares in Yahoo dropped 18.1 per cent to $14.32 after investors knocked the company’s search engine tie-up with Microsoft.General Electric rose 11.4 per cent to $13.40 this week after it indicated that its finance unit did not need additional capital and Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock.Colgate-Palmolive’s profits beat estimates amid cost cutting, and the group maintained guidance for the rest of the year. The stock fell 3.5 per cent to $72.44 this week.MasterCard rose 4.6 per cent to $194.03 after a 26.4 per cent rise in net income for the second quarter. Visa also beat estimates, but dipped 2.7 per cent to $65.46 this week. Dow Chemical recorded a loss of $486m for the quarter, due to charges stemming from its $16.5bn buy-out of Rohm & Haas and weak sales, but beat estimates and rose 4.9 per cent to $21.17 this week.In deals, IBM said it would buy SPSS, a provider of predictive analytics software for $1.2bn or $50 a share. SPSS rose 41 per cent to $49.48 this week, while Big Blue gained 0.2 per cent to $117.93.
7;D;Dominion Resources;2008-07-03T16:59:27Z;Babcock & Brown fund buys Dominion utilities;;An unlisted energy and infrastructure fund managed by Australia’s second largest investment firm has agreed to buy Dominion Resources’ natural gas utilities in Pennsylvania and West Virginia for $910m.Babcock & Brown Infrastructure Fund North America (BBIFNA) said that it would acquire People’s Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas subject to regulatory approvals.On completion of the deal, the San Francisco-based wholesale fund, which is one of three unlisted infrastructure funds managed by Babcock & Brown, will have added natural gas delivery to 359,000 homes and businesses in the Pittsburgh area and to 115,000 in West Virginia to its US asset base.Those assets already include a power cable under San Francisco Bay, port operations in Florida, Louisiana and Alabama, and a stake in the 15,768km Natural Gas Pipeline of America.Babcock & Brown, which advised the fund on the acquisition, said the $910m price included working capital and capital expenditures, subject to adjustments. Babcock & Brown raised about A$1.4bn (US$1.34bn) in the US capital markets between last October and March this year, specifically for infrastructure opportunities in North America.The sale of the gas utilities to BBIFNA comes after an unsuccessful attempt by Dominion in March to sell those same assets to Equitable Resources.The earlier deal was blocked by the US antitrust regulator as creating a natural-gas monopoly in the Pittsburgh area.Dominion, one of the US’s largest energy producers, said it plans to use the $675m after-tax proceeds from the deal to pay down debt.Babcock & Brown, which manages A$72bn in global infrastructure assets, has been forced to justify the viability of its business model which is highly dependent on easy access to capital.It won a last-minute reprieve from its bankers who have agreed to drop a clause giving the lenders the right to review the terms of a A$2.8bn corporate debt facility in return for Babcock & Brown paying more interest on the debt.
8;D;Dominion Resources;2007-12-26T19:47:24Z;Transocean and Google reap M&A rewards;;Technology groups Google and Oracle and energy companies XTO and Transocean enjoyed the best share price performance among US corporations making large domestic acquisitions this year, according to Dealogic data.Figures from the data provider show how shareholders have been willing to reward big deals in the technology and energy sectors, while financial services groups have been unable to offset the pain of the credit squeeze with large acquisitions.Wachovia and Bank of America, the two North Carolina-based banks, were among the worst performers, according to Dealogic.Google took the top spot. Its shares rose 47 per cent between its announcement in April of the $3.1bn purchase of Doubleclick, the internet advertising company, and December 14. The search engine outperformed the S&P 500 index by 44 per cent.Second place went to Trans-ocean, which in July made a bold consolidation move in the oil services sector, acquiring rival GlobalSantaFe for $17.6bn. After the deal was announced, Transocean outperformed the S&P by 31 per cent.Meanwhile, Oracle was rewarded for its purchase of Hyperion Solutions, a rival software group, and XTO gained in the wake of its acquisition of assets from Dominion Resources.The Dealogic analysis has been running for four years, offering some evidence of investor reaction to big consolidation moves.However, it falls short of an evaluation of the best and worst deals. A company’s ability to implement projected cost savings or revenue targets related to a merger often cannot be calculated for months after a deal closes.The worst performer in 2007 was Vulcan Materials, which makes construction aggregates. It agreed to buy Florida Rock Industries for $4.5bn in February, just as the US housing market began its decline. Vulcan shares have underperformed the S&P index by 29 per cent since then.Bank of America also suffered after its $21bn purchase of Illinois-based LaSalle Bank in April. Its shares have fallen 17 per cent compared with the index.Wachovia has underperformed the S&P by 24 per cent since its $6.8bn takeover of AG Edwards, the brokerage, which was agreed at the end of May.
9;D;Dominion Resources;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
10;D;Dominion Resources;2007-06-04T20:29:51Z;Deals, energy push S&P 500 to record close;;Wall Street rallied late yesterday, and the main benchmarks extended their winning streak to six straight days. Upgrades for Wal-Mart boosted bluechips, while deals and energy stocks helped the S&P 500 fashion another record close.In spite of robust increases since late March, analysts were divided over the outlook for equities this summer against a backdrop of higher bond yields.Investors largely took a sharp slide in Chinese stocks in their stride. Energy stocks were buoyed by higher oil prices, and led gains among the main industry groups in the S&P 500 index.The S&P rose 0.2 per cent to a record close at 1,539.18. The benchmark has yet to test its March 2000 intra-day peak of 1552.87.Utilities, however, extended their recent bout of weakness as bond yields remained near highs last seen in August. Higher oil prices and weaker customer traffic at Continental Airlines in May also weighed upon that sector. The American Stock Exchange airline index fell 2.75 per cent, with Continental down 6.1 per cent at $37.45. UAL Corp lost 6.6 per cent to close at $36.21.Technology stocks rose and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent firmer at 2,618.29.Apple rose 2.5 per cent to $121.33, after the company announced the iPhone would be available on June 29.Blue chips reversed weakness earlier in the day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to a record close at 13,676.32.The outlook for sections of the US market this year was tweaked by Citigroup yesterday, as it announced new year-end targets for benchmarks and lifted its forecasts for the Dow to 14,400 from 14,000 and for the S&P 400 index of medium-sized companies to 955 from 905.The S&P 400 rose 0.45 per cent to a record close of 925.90 yesterday, for a rise of 15.1 per cent this year, a performance that has outpaced other US benchmarks.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said: “The US equity market has performed better than most investors expected heading into the year, with mid-caps showing the most powerful returns – driven in part by a scaling-up of market cap by investors due to liquidity requirements but also due to mergers and acquisitions activity.”The bank left its S&P 500 target for 2007 unchanged at 1,600, and also reiterated a target of 888 for the Russell 2000 small-companies index.Other analysts cautioned that stocks might face a testing period later this year.“Stocks have been rising steadily since March, fuelling a wealth effect that has managed to offset the effects of gasoline and housing,” said William O’Donnell, bond strategist at UBS. Against the backdrop of rising bond yields, the current environment “is reminiscent of the conditions in 1987 before the stock market crash”.Deal activity yesterday was led by the sale of a 25 per cent stake in Palm for $325m to Elevation Partners, a $1.9bn private equity partnership.

11;D;Dominion Resources;2007-06-04T14:55:24Z;Dominion to sell gas and oil interests;;"Dominion Resources, the Virginia-based gas and electricity company, has agreed to sell most of its US natural gas and oil exploration and production operations to two energy companies, Loews and XTO Energy, for $6.5bn.Loews will buy Dominion’s operations in the Permian Basin, Michigan and Alabama, including estimated reserves of about 2.5 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent, for $4.03bn, while XTO said it would take Dominion’s operations in the Rocky Mountains, Gulf Coast, San Juan Basin and South Louisiana, which includes 1 Tcfe in reserves, roughly 95 per cent of which is natural gas, for $2.5bn.The sales represent about 85 per cent of Dominion’s reserves.“We expect the new Dominion to produce 2008 operating earnings of $6 or more per share, and we are confident that we can achieve long-term average annual earnings per share growth of at least 4 per cent to 6 per cent thereafter,” said Thomas Farrell, chief executive and chairman of Dominion. “We will provide detailed 2008 operating earnings guidance in January.”The deal is Loews’ first move into the energy exploration and production business.”We have a favourable long-term view of natural gas pricing in the US and believe natural gas will increasingly be the fuel of choice in the future,” said James Tisch, chief executive of Loews.Loews is a diversified financial corporation which runs tobacco company Lorrillard, maker of Newport and Kent cigarettes; CNA Financial Corporation, the casualty insurance company; luxury lodgings in Loews Hotels; and watch and clockmaker Bulova.XTO is an energy exploration, production and marketing company based in Forth Worth, Texas.Alongside the acquisition from Dominion, XTO said it intended to review its portfolio of oil and gas reserves, for possible inclusion in a master limited partnership with an initial capitalisation of more than $500m. A master limited partnership is a limited partnership that is publicly traded. Limited partnerships can provide certain tax benefits, such as avoiding corporate income tax, while being publicly traded provides liquidity and improves cash flow.XTO said it was increasing production growth guidance this year to 15 per cent as a result of the deal, up from 10 per cent. XTO is targeting production growth of 15 per cent next year as well.Both sales are expected to close in August.Dominion is also looking to sell its operations in Oklahoma, with over 2 Tcfe in reserves, by the end of this year.JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers and Juniper Advisory are providing financial advice to Dominion on the sales. BakerBotts and McGuireWoods are the company’s legal advisers.Dominion shares rose 53 cents or 0.6 per cent to $88.17. Loews shares rose 33 cents or 0.65 per cent to $51.35. XTO shares rose $3.45 or 5.91 per cent to $61.82."
12;D;Dominion Resources;2007-04-30T21:22:32Z;Eni pays $4.8bn for Gulf of Mexico assets;;Eni, Italy’s biggest energy group, on Monday agreed to acquire Dominion Resources’ production, development and exploration assets in the US Gulf of Mexico for $4.76bn. The deal would triple Eni’s production in the Gulf to 110,000 barrels a day by the second half of this year, the company said.The boost in output is especially important to Eni, which like bigger peers such as BP has struggled to meet its output targets.At the end of 2006, Eni’s production was 1.77m barrels of oil and gas a day and it was forced to cut its targets at the last earnings announcement.Paolo Scaroni, Eni’s chief executive, said the deal, about 70-80 per cent of which is for deep water assets with the rest being in the Gulf’s shallower areas, was necessary for Eni to reach critical mass in the Gulf of Mexico.In terms of reserves, the deal adds 222m proved and probable barrels to Eni’s current 12.5bn total. The exploration portion of the deal was valued at $680m of the total.In an interview with the FT, he said the price had hit all of Eni’s targets including its aim of achieving more than 9 per cent return on average capital employed and its $40 a barrel long-term oil price assumption.About his recent shopping spree, he said: “We feel that buying assets is cheaper and delivers better synergies than buying companies.”Mr Scaroni hinted he was far from reaching the limit on his credit card, noting the company’s low gearing and solid rating.Analysts at Citigroup said in a statement: “Strategically this acquisition makes sense . . . However, the price paid appears generous.”The investment bank had valued the assets at $3.9bn.At a time when some other leading international oil companies are lying low, scared off by asset prices driven higher by the rally in international oil futures and the industry’s inability to discover new fields, Eni has announced $11bn of acquisitions in 2007 alone.Wood Mackenzie, the industry consultants, said the deal was in line with recent similar transactions and calculated it relied on a long-term oil price of about $42 a barrel. Tom Ellacott, a Wood Mackenzie analyst, said: “This is a reasonable deal from a price perspective, especially as the competition for assets in the Gulf of Mexico is quite intense.”The Dominion purchase follows Eni’s Russian deal with Enel to acquire Yukos assets for a maximum of nearly $6bn, and its agreement to take a stake in one of Angola’s liquefied natural gas projects, as well as smaller deals for fields in Congo and Alaska.Dominion last year made clear it wanted to sell its oil and gas assets to concentrate on the utilities side of its business.
13;D;Dominion Resources;2007-04-30T12:57:42Z;North American oil M&A;;A falling dollar tempts Europeans to hop on a plane and hunt for bargains across the Atlantic. The Old World’s oil executives are doing deals in North America for different reasons.Between them, Eni of Italy and Statoil of Norway have announced almost $8bn of acquisitions in the US and Canada in the past few days. Statoil’s foray into Canadian oil sands is all about reducing dependence on mature fields at home. For Eni, assets bought from Dominion Resources strengthen an existing but marginal position in the Gulf of Mexico.The underlying logic for both deals is the same. Oil executives – and investors – like growth. Outside regions like the Middle East, accelerating field decline is a fact of life. Meanwhile, spot oil prices remain high, and 2010 futures have risen by 19 per cent since mid-January and are back above $70 a barrel. Locking in that high price through hedging – as Eni is doing – mitigates some of the premium paid for producing assets. For Statoil, the forward curve offers comfort – albeit limited – that oil prices will support the economics of challenging projects not expected to hit peak output until 2020.North America holds several attractions for oil companies with cash to deploy. One is higher margins due, in part, to lower taxes. On average, upstream unit profits for the majors have been 46 per cent higher in the US than elsewhere over the past five years, according to Oppenheimer. Lower political risk and availability of assets also attract buyers. Consultants John S Herold and Harrison Lovegrove calculate North America played host to 55 per cent of upstream deal volume in 2006.The corollary of that, however, is competition. Adjusted for the amount paid for exploration assets, Eni is paying just over $18 per barrel of oil equivalent of proven plus probable reserves for its latest purchase. That is in line with other recent Gulf of Mexico deals. But it is worth noting that deal multiples there have more than doubled since the crude oil rally got going in 2003. With a still shrinking pool of potential targets, oil executives will have to pay up for tickets to the New World.
14;D;Dominion Resources;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Investor group unveils climate blacklist;;A coalition of US institutional investors has stepped up pressure on corporate America to do more on environmental issues by accusing 10 companies of failing to address climate change and global warming.The move by Ceres, a group of state pension funds, environmental and religious groups with more than $200bn in assets, highlights a rise in investor and political demands on business to do more to deal with environmental problems.The publication of the blacklist – which names the oil group ExxonMobil, financial services group Wells Fargo and utility TXU – coincided with the filing of shareholder motions at more than 35 companies demanding action on climate change. The list also includes the oil group ConocoPhillips, retailer Bed Bath & Beyond and insurer ACE.The issue will be a key battleground in the upcoming season of shareholder meetings after investors filed a record 42 motions urging actions ranging from reduction in greenhouse gases to better disclosure of energy efficiency plans.The pension funds behind the black list, which include the states of New York, North Carolina, Connecticut and Vermont, say that they cannot “vote with their feet” and sell shares in the companies because they own mostly index funds.As a result, they have to resort to “naming and shaming” and filing resolutions at shareholder meetings.ExxonMobil said on Tuesday it “recognises and is responding appropriately to the risks associated with climate change”.The 10 companies:
15;D;Dominion Resources;2007-01-31T22:45:35Z;Oil mergers and acquisitions;;An old oil industry maxim holds that if it costs too much to go looking for barrels in the far-flung corners of the globe, it is worth drilling on Wall Street. Replacing barrels in the ground is an imperative. Whether that happens through investment in exploration or buying another company is a tactical decision.Oil executives are now likely to tend towards the latter. The costs of finding and developing – the amount oil and gas companies have to spend to explore for reserves and then bring them onstream – have risen rapidly in recent years. John S. Herold, an industry consultancy, thinks European and US oil companies’ average F&D costs almost doubled to between $12 and $14 a barrel between 2000 and 2005, reflecting not only cost inflation but also weak organic reserves replacement.Meanwhile, flagging oil and gas prices squeeze margins, with a disproportionate effect on upstream companies. This results in lower valuations, making them more vulnerable to takeover. The US, with its deep pool of upstream companies, is a particularly fertile hunting ground. On Citigroup estimates, the likes of Apache, Anadarko and Noble Energy all have an enterprise value per barrel that is about or below industry F&D costs.Apart from traditional potential suitors, other cash-rich predators can be expected to take an interest. Already, private equity houses are in the running for Dominion Resources’ oil and gas assets. Even as spot prices have fallen, long-term crude remains above $60 a barrel, enabling financial sponsors to lock in cash flows and pile on debt. Then there are the Russian, Chinese and Indian oil majors. CNOOC’s near-miss on Unocal in 2005 highlighted the political hurdles. But producing fields in the world’s biggest energy market make a tempting target for any emerging major with global ambitions.
16;D;Dominion Resources;2007-01-29T22:16:07Z;Buy-out firms bid for Dominion assets;;Several private equity groups have kicked off the $15bn auction for the oil and gas assets of Dominion Resources by seeking to acquire most of the properties, stretching from the Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of Mexico.The interest from some of the world’s largest buy-out investors could potentially threaten the ambitions of US and European energy groups, such as Spain’s Repsol YPF, Norway’s Statoil and others that are expected to participate in the auction.Last year Dominion, which is based in Virginia and also owns a utility, decided to put its exploration and production assets up for sale.The plan for the auction was to separate the properties into three clusters – the onshore fields, the offshore fields and the smaller Canadian sites.According to people familiar with the matter, packages with details of each of the three clusters have been sent out to potential buyers and a sale along those lines in the second quarter of 2007 remains the most likely outcome.But in recent weeks, several buy-out investors, working in consortia, have sought to make pre-emptive bids for the Dominion assets that would effectively bring the process to an early conclusion.One consortium includes Carlyle, Warburg Pincus, Madison Dearborn and the buy-out units of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which recently re-entered the private equity business after a period of absence. It is not uncommon for the buy-out arms of two investment banks to collaborate on a deal.The other consortium comprises Blackstone, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific Group, people close to the negotiations said.Private equity groups have traditionally shied away from investing in E&P assets, because of the enormous risks associated with volatility in commodity prices. However, buy-out groups have in recent years implemented increasingly sophisticated hedging strategies to help them manage the danger that prices could move the wrong way.People close to the Dominion auction said the private equity groups were more likely to be interested in the onshore assets, which are less capital-intensive than the offshore properties.Even if a buy-out consortium were to buy the entire portfolio on the block, it would probably seek to sell the offshore assets, which are most attractive to domestic and international oil majors.Dominion shares were up 2.4 per cent in morning trading.
17;D;Dominion Resources;2007-01-24T18:33:54Z;FTSE boosted by close rate vote;;Debenhams failed to contribute to a strong rally in the UK market on Wednesday as a leading investment bank slashed its stance on the department store chain.Claire Kent, analyst at Morgan Stanley, cut the stock from “overweight” to “equalweight” and lowered her profit forecasts by 16 and 20 per cent respectively over the next two years in a downbeat assessment of the company’s prospects.Debenhams this month reported a continued fall in underlying sales and a decline in gross margin.“Our expectation [is] that the consumer outlook will remain weak and competition is on the increase,” Ms Kent wrote. “We see no catalyst for the stock to perform in the next three to six months.”Debenhams closed down 1.5 per cent at 167½p, its lowest level since the company was re-floated at 195p eight months ago.In the wider market, the news that four members of the Bank of England monetary policy committee opposed January’s shock interest rate rise stoked hopes that the current rate tightening cycle could be nearing its end.The FTSE 100 surged 87.2 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 6,314.8, its highest level since January 3. Miners, property companies, banks and oil stocks contributed to the sharp rise. The FTSE 250 rose 90.6 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 11,192.8.News that the US would double the size of the national oil reserve and purchase an extra 100,000 barrels of oil a day boosted the crude price late on Tuesday. Royal Dutch Shell rose 1.2 per cent to £17.39 and BP gained 0.6 per cent to 548½p. Sentiment in the sector was further boosted by reports of a $15bn bid for US energy group Dominion Resources.Mining stocks rose sharply amid some bullish strategy notes as nickel and tin, hit fresh highs. Kazakh copper mine Kazakhmys rose 4.8 per cent to £11.19 as HSBC suggested investors take a “short term long position” on the stock following a 16 per cent drop in its share price the last three months.India-based exploration group Vedanta Resources was the day’s top performer, ending 5.8 per cent higher at £11.90 amid a flurry of takeover speculation. Any deal would hinge on Anil Agarwal, the group’s founder and majority shareholder.Reduced expectations of increased interest rates sent property groups Liberty International and British Land 4.4 per cent higher to £13.18 and 2.9 per cent higher to £16.12 respectively. Liberty was further boosted by vague takeover speculation.Financial stocks also made good gains as Northern Rock kicked off the bank reporting season with news of better than expected profits and record mortgage lending of £33bn last year. Northern Rock rose 4.1 per cent to £12.12, Royal Bank of Scotland firmed 2.9 per cent to £21.03 and Alliance & Leicester gained 2.6 per cent to £11.11.Hanson rose 2.9 per cent to 799½p amid reheated talk that Lafarge of France was eyeing a bid for the aggregates specialist.Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionary group, rose 1.2 per cent to 560½p despite a shock profit warning from US chocolate maker Hershey’s.Alliance Boots spent most of the day in the red after Morgan Stanley slashed the chemist group from “equalweight” to “underweight” and said the market had not factored in the risks associated with the merger that created the company. But the shares ended 1.1 per cent higher at 812½p.Of the fallers, InterContinental Hotels Group slipped 1.4 per cent to £12.86 as takeover talk faded.Sage Group lost 0.4 per cent to 271¾p as ING slashed its stance on the software and services group from “hold” to “sell”.In the mid-caps, the day’s best performer was N Brown, the home shopping group. Its shares surged 9.6 per cent to a six-year high of 311½p thanks to a sharp rise in like-for-like sales and a pledge to return £80m to shareholders.Strong figures from pub groups JD Wetherspoon and Punch Taverns sent the pair 5.5 per cent higher to 700p and 3.4 per cent higher to £11.95 respectively.The higher crude price and rumours that a takoever bid was coming in the sector sent oil services companies higher. Wood Grouprose 4.5 per cent to 272¾p, Expro International firmed 4.2 per cent to 910½p and Huntingrose 2.7 per cent to 592½p.However, a profit warning dragged Renishaw14.4 per cent lower to 685p.

18;D;Dominion Resources;2006-06-20T22:16:39Z;New Issues: Shell paper scarce in US;;Royal Dutch Shell sold $1bn of five-year bonds on Tuesday, the Anglo-Dutch oil company’s first SEC-registered issue in the US market.The bonds priced to yield 52 basis points over Treasuries, in line with guidance.The scarcity of Shell paper helped the price below the prevailing Libor yield, among the tightest spreads in memory for a US corporate benchmark issue, according to a person close to the deal.Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley lead-managed the sale.US utility Dominion Resources sold $300m of hybrid securities yielding 240bp over Treasuries. Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch were joint bookrunners for the deal, rated low investment grade by Moody’s and just below investment grade by Standard & Poor’s.In Europe, Swedish Match, the tobacco products maker, was hit by investor nerves as it was forced to sweeten terms and cut the size of its issue.The company priced €300m of 2013 bonds to yield 60bp above mid-swap rates. It had targeted a €350m deal with a slightly lower yield spread.“Even if the credit fundamentals looked quite good, we decided not to participate,” said one London-based investor.He said the sell-off in subordinated financial debt had made industrial bonds look comparatively unattractive.ABN Amro and SEB were the lead managers.In the UK, BP added £50m to its December 2008 note to take the total amount to £500m. The bonds were priced to yield 30bp above Gilts with a 5.125 per cent coupon. HSBC managed the sale.National Grid, the utility company, sold €600m of floating rate notes priced to yield 29bp more than three-month Euribor.About 60 investors across Europe placed orders worth €900m for the bonds, according to one of the bookrunners.The sale was managed by Commerzbank, ING, RBS and SG CIB.
19;D;Dominion Resources;2005-05-04T20:21:41Z;Wall St higher as Kerkorian lifts GM stake;;Surging shares in General Motors put a spark into trading on Wall Street on Wednesday, after a company controlled by Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire financier, said it would buy a sizeable stake in the struggling carmaker.Insurers also posted strong gains, as MetLife and Aon weighed in with strong earnings reports.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 per cent to 10,384.64. The S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent to 1,175.65, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.5 per cent to 1,962.23.Ken Tower, chief market analyst at CyberTrader, cautioned against reading too much into the day’s gains, however. Mr Tower said the ratio between put and call options on the US indices remained elevated, “suggesting a strong lingering scepticism for the market’s ability to rally”.Investors were digesting an Institute for Supply Management survey, which showed that business growth among financial, construction and other services firms moderated last month, in line with expectations.Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow financial, said the large number of positive surprises this earnings season was a sign that companies were countering the effects of high oil prices by increasing productivity and cutting costs.General Motors was the centre of attention on Wednesday after Tracinda, the investment vehicle of Mr Kerkorian, said it would buy as many as 28m shares in the struggling automaker at $31 a share. The move would double Mr Kerkorian’s holdings in the company to 8.8 per cent. GM shares leapt 18.1 per cent to $32.80 on the news. Shares in the biggest US carmaker fell sharply from a January high of $40.30 after it warned on profits this year. Ford, GM’s chief US rival, rose 7.3 per cent to $10.16 on the coat-tails of the GM news.Strong results from a pair of big insurers lifted shares across the sector. Aon, the world’s second-biggest insurance broker, shot up 15 per cent to $24.45 after it beat expectations with profits up 18 per cent. MetLife, a New York-based rival, jumped 12.1 per cent to $43.55 after its earnings beat estimates. American International Group, the biggest US insurer, rose 2 per cent to $54.37.Elsewhere on the earnings front, Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video game maker, fell 6.5 per cent to $49.45 after it reported sharply lower profits for the first quarter and forecast a second quarter loss.Time Warner, the media group, rose 3.6 per cent to $17.28 after profits beat estimates.Utilities companies and energy groups put in the worst performances of the day. Dominion Resources, owner of Virginia’s biggest utility company, fell 3.3 per cent to $72.70 after its first quarter profits fell. Devon Energy, the oil and gas explorer, slipped 0.4 per cent, its second successive day of declines.Microsoft, the world’s biggest software company, slipped 0.6 per cent to $25.21.
