Telford, which had previously focused on building homes for sale, has changed its focus to constructing rental developments on behalf of large investors who have been plunging billions into the UK market.Investors hope the UK rented housing sector, previously dominated by amateur landlords, will develop a large-scale “multifamily” asset class similar to those in the US and Germany.Bob Sulentic, president and chief executive of CBRE, said: “The UK is in the early stages of a secular shift toward institutionally owned urban rental housing, similar to what we have seen in the US over the last two decades. Telford Homes is well positioned to lead this trend.”The deal values Telford’s equity at approximately £267m. Including net debt, the enterprise value of the deal is roughly £340m, according to FactSet data. Telford Homes’ chairman, Andrew Wiseman, said the deal represented “fair value” and the board would recommend that shareholders accept it. He added: “The board remains confident in the long-term prospects of the business, however the board also recognises the risks posed by the political and macroeconomic environment.”Telford’s shares rose almost 12 per cent to 352.7p following news of the deal on Wednesday.The group’s share price has fallen from highs of nearly 500p in 2015, when London’s property market had seen quick-fire growth, enabling Telford to sell luxury apartments to eager buyers including overseas investors.The UK housing market has slowed in recent years, however, with the London market particularly badly affected by changes to taxation and the impact of Brexit-related uncertainty.Telford acknowledged that constructing rented homes represents a “lower margin” business; it downgraded profit expectations in February, leading its shares to drop more than 16 per cent.Aynsley Lammin, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said: “We expect the cash offer to be approved by shareholders in the context of the current market conditions and outlook, and given that more financial and operational resources are likely to be required to be competitive in the [build-to-rent] market in London as the market evolves.”Aim-listed Telford was established in 2000 and develops residential housing across London, with a development portfolio in process of £1.3bn.Telford will operate as a standalone business within CBRE’s development and property investment subsidiary Trammell Crow Company if the deal completes, with Jon Di-Stefano continuing as chief executive.

Specifically, owners are looking to share in the upside of this growing flexible space market, and they are also looking for more control.“They want to understand and have transparency on who the tenants and users of their space are. With most providers out there today, it’s really a black box.”Hana will focus initially on the US and London, with the first deals to be announced in the coming weeks, he said: “We’ve been quietly in the market for some time.”The new offering will have a greater focus on private suites than existing providers, said Mr Kupiec, with tenants expected to commit for one to three years. They will also have access to meeting rooms and shared co-working spaces, although co-working will take up only a small proportion of Hana’s buildings.The launch will add to competition in a field that has become more crowded since WeWork’s rapid expansion helped to draw new customers into a once staid sector. A report earlier this year by CBRE said total global flexible office space had increased sixfold since 2009.However, Mr Kupiec said the company expects flexible offices — which tend to offer an all-inclusive deal, with services such as WiFi and cleaning, on a short-term basis — to expand over time from 1 per cent of global office space to between 5 and 10 per cent.Some landlords have branched into providing their own flexible offices after seeing the premiums such space can command over regular leasing deals.Los Angeles-based CBRE, which has a market value of $13.6bn, hopes to capitalise on global relationships with institutional property investors it already works with in areas such as property services. Mr Kupiec said that Hana would invest heavily in design, in common with other providers such as WeWork and IWG’s upmarket Spaces brand."

The new US embassy is estimated to be one of the world’s most expensive at a cost of $1bn. It opened this year.The Chinese embassy is currently at Portland Place in Marylebone, central London.

More than 90 per cent of all commercial property transactions in the city during the period involved investment from overseas.

6;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2017-10-17T04:02:45Z;Asian investors pour record sums into London offices;More than 90% of commercial property deals in quarter involved overseas investors;Asian investors channelled record amounts of cash into London office deals in the third quarter of this year, as overseas cash flows rapidly into the market since the Brexit vote.Two-thirds of the total £4.8bn invested in London offices between July and September came from Asian buyers, according to figures from property services company CBRE. More than 90 per cent of all commercial property transactions in the city during the period involved investment from overseas.The average proportion of foreign investment in London offices each quarter since the second half of 2016, following the UK’s vote to leave the EU, has been 65 per cent. The average figure since the beginning of 2010 has been about 60 per cent, according to historic CBRE data and Financial Times’ research.Robbie Duncan, analyst at Numis, said the fall in sterling following Brexit has made assets more attractive to overseas buyers.While many overseas investors would be looking to buy property to diversify their portfolios, Chinese and Hong Kong investors may also be aiming to park capital in the UK, Mr Duncan said. “It’s a diversification trade, it’s to try and take as much cash out of the country,” he said.Chinese investors fear greater capital controls being forced on them. In August, the government implemented regulations targeting “irrational” investments in overseas sectors including property. Although Hong-Kong companies are not subject to these curbs, many fear the impact of potential Chinese market instability and so are moving cash.High-value deals also characterised the market, according to CBRE, with 11 transactions worth more than £100m taking place over the quarter, compared with five in the same period last year.One unusually large sale was included in the third-quarter numbers. Landsec and Canary Wharf Group, both UK property companies, sold the “Walkie Talkie” skyscraper to Hong-Kong-based oyster sauce maker Lee Kum Kee in July for £1.3bn, in the largest ever single building transaction in the UK.Stephen Pearson, head of City capital markets at CBRE, said the figures demonstrated that overseas investors “still find London attractive” because UK commercial property offered relatively good income in the context of a robust legal system. “London is a safe place to put your money,” he added.“This is all part of the globalisation we have seen. If you talk to a sovereign wealth fund, it will tell you it needs to be spread and diversified and in major cities around the world.”UK investors dominated the sell side, accounting for about two-thirds of sales during the quarter, according to CBRE.Mike Prew, analyst at investment bank Jefferies, said there was a pattern of domestic owners selling to overseas investors who may be less familiar with the market, with another £10bn of London offices shortly coming to market.UK commercial property values were factoring in “undeliverable growth rates”, said Mr Prew. “We have been expecting a rental recession for over two years,” he said, describing his position as “uniquely bearish”.However, Mr Pearson argued that much of the overseas money pouring into London was coming through sophisticated investors. “Some of these people own conglomerate businesses and they are globally connected, astute and savvy,” he said. “Only time will tell whether they are right or not.”
7;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2017-05-15T04:51:39Z;Data-led tech threatens to make agents obsolete;Online portals are providing transparency and could be used to mitigate risk in a broker-free market;New online property platforms offer a greater wealth of data than ever before. They also provide the means to do business in a transparent and standardised way, potentially mitigating transaction risks without the need for an agent.Websites such as Rightmove and Zoopla have already offered a snapshot of how access to data can change the industry. Buyers and renters find out everything they need to know about a property without setting foot in an agent’s office. Online platforms such as Purplebricks and Yopa are taking this a step further by offering upfront fixed fees for transactions instead of commission.So far, commercial property agents have escaped such disruption. But they are vulnerable. “The traditional gut-feel world is going to change,” says Andy Pyle, head of UK real estate at KPMG. “Agents that don’t change with it or ahead of it will become obsolete. Access to data will accelerate the pace of obsolescence.”KPMG is playing its part in this process by launching an online platform called Deal Room to sell property loan portfolios. For now, it is focused on portfolios larger than £50m. But Mr Pyle says Deal Room could be adapted to sell individual properties. “Smaller [commercial] deals may be more ripe for disruption. We could do what Zoopla and Purplebricks have done for the residential market for the commercial property sector,” he says.Property Partner, an online property crowdfunding platform, is also changing the investment landscape. It has reduced barriers to investing by offering shares in buy-to-let properties that pay dividends and track asset values. The company plans to create the first global stock exchange for all types of property.It used agents to find the £51.5m of transactions completed so far, but does not expect this to always be the case. “Once we get the [global] scale, we will have a market of buyers and sellers and there may not be a place for agents any more,” says Mark Weedon, its head of institutional development.The amount of information everyone has on one another checks the risksThe company is attracting a new type of investor who previously could not afford to buy property and does not want the liabilities attached to managing assets. If the company achieves its global ambitions it will probably attract some investors who know little about property. “One of the biggest risks is people who don’t understand it well enough and overestimate their liquidity position,” acknowledges Mr Weedon. So far, he says, this has not happened.Hubble, a start-up based in London’s tech hotspot of Shoreditch, is introducing a similar concept to the office leasing market. It is attempting to empower tenants by using data to improve the market’s transparency. The company brings together people hunting for flexible office space with those who own space on an online platform that automates a search process normally undertaken by agents.“The average transaction time for office space is down from three months to three weeks — although in some instances we can do it in three days,” says Tushar Agarwal, chief executive of Hubble. He argues that agents “hide behind smoke and mirrors” to support higher prices.To combat the usual upfront risks faced by young businesses, Hubble has standardised client reviews, leases, contracts, deposits and financial outlay.The are risks involved in doing deals directly online. Property agents have long been characterised as a necessary evil by many clients. Yet many would also begrudgingly concede that the market advice received from brokers can often be of comfort despite its cost. This underpinning of the intermediary’s central role, though, is weakening.“The risk to consumers is real,” Mr Agarwal says. “But on other platforms it is dealt with by ratings and reviews. The amount of information everyone has on one another checks the risks. We have come a long way from where a broker is needed.”Agencies are alive to the threats posed by data and technology. As a result, larger companies are investing heavily in both to remain relevant.“We are reinventing how we provide services via data,” says Charles Boudet, managing director of JLL France. “The risk also creates opportunity — so we are completely behind the data drive. It is up to us to move further up the value chain and give better advice.”Chandra Dhandapani, chief digital and technology officer at CBRE, is equally bullish about the opportunities data and technology could bring. But there is a caveat. “Digital technology is only as effective as the quality of the data that fuels it, and importantly, the expertise of the organisation that leverages it,” she says.“The risk associated with purely online transactional activity is the imbalance of knowledge and understanding between the parties involved.”

9;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2016-09-07T04:45:56Z;Crossrail reshaping property market along its route;Experts predict buoyant prices along the renamed Elizabeth Line;Forty years since it was first proposed, the Crossrail train line that will link the east and west of London’s outskirts is nearing completion and is reshaping the property market along its route.Crossrail, which has been renamed the Elizabeth Line, will open in stages, stretching from Shenfield in Essex to Paddington in central London by May 2019 and later extending to Heathrow airport and Reading. It will offer a 29-minute journey from Bond Street in the capital’s West End to Heathrow airport, shaving 20 minutes off that trip.The benefits of cut journey times will not just be enjoyed by rail passengers. According to CBRE, the property consultancy, a 10 per cent reduction in commuting times can in general cause house prices to increase by as much as 6 per cent, all other things being equal. Prices have already risen by around 31 per cent in hotspots near the new stations since Crossrail received the go-ahead, it says.Despite economic uncertainty in the wake of the UK’s decision to leave the EU, CBRE, the property consultancy, expects average prices along the line to increase a further 3.3 per cent per year above local house price growth until the line launches in 2018/19.This amounts to an average £133,000 price increase within Crossrail’s catchment area between now and when the first trains run. By the time Crossrail is operational in 2018, it will have added up to £35bn on to the residential property sector around the 37 stations.“We don’t think Brexit will have a significant impact on the forecasts for property in the immediate proximity to Crossrail, nor will it affect Crossrail’s success as a major infrastructure initiative,” says Jennet Siebrits, head of residential research at CBRE. “Our research on Crossrail suggests that demand for property close to these stations has been so strong that we expect prices to continue to remain buoyant.”The biggest beneficiaries are investors along the line in the central part of London that stretches from Paddington to Canary Wharf. CBRE expects these to increase by an average 4.8 per cent per annum over and above wider price inflation until it opens in 2018.Development around the central stations will transform these areas, particularly at Tottenham Court Road where Derwent London, the property group, is in charge of a significant regeneration project. This will include a new theatre as part of wider redevelopment close to the totemic Centre Point building and the arrival of new shops including Zara, New Look and Primark.The CBRE research is backed by a London School of Economics report into offices. It analysed property deals for signs of an uplift from the Crossrail project and found that between 2005 and 2013 central London office properties within half a mile of new stations saw a 15 per cent rise in values beyond a rising price trend.Between 2008 and 2013, more than 40 per cent of planning applications within a kilometre of stations also cited the new route as a justification for new construction, according to research commissioned by Crossrail.
10;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2016-08-08T10:44:51Z;City office values drop 6% in a month;;UK commercial property values dropped more than 4 per cent in July, with “heightened economic uncertainty” hitting offices in the City of London particularly badly, according to CBRE, the property adviser.Offices in the City of London shed 6.1 per cent of their capital value in the first full month following the UK’s Brexit vote, with values in central London overall falling 4.1 per cent.The sharp monthly declines pulled year-on-year value growth down to 0.4 per cent, while rental values remained static.While London is predicted to be more affected than the rest of the country by any post-Brexit drop in house prices, CBRE’s monthly index showed declines in commercial property values nationwide, with UK-wide office values also falling 4.1 per cent.Capital values for the retail sector fell 3.6 per cent, while industrial property remained relatively strong with only a 2.2 per cent monthly fall. Ongoing supply shortages mean industrial property developers been less affected by the pessimism that has weighed on property sector since the vote.FTSE 100 commercial property groups British Land and Land Securities have both warned that demand is likely to be “subdued” until companies have more clarity on the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU.City offices have taken a particular hit as financial institutions wait to find out whether they will keep the “passporting” rights that give them access to the single market.Miles Gibson, head of research at CBRE UK, said:Capital value growth was always expected to falter at some point during 2016, as global economic uncertainty cast doubt on the likelihood of the strong growth seen in previous years persisting for much longer. The Brexit vote has now crystallised that expectation, though it is not the only driver of it.However, Mr Gibson added that steady rental values were “reassuring” given the uncertainty, and were “a positive sign that the UK occupier market remains strong.”
11;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2016-07-10T09:01:04Z;Alternative investments grow on flight from bonds and equities;Low yields and market volatility saw institutions move further into assets such as property in 2015;Rock-bottom yields from government bonds and destabilising bouts of volatility in equity markets have pushed institutional investors to invest ever more money with alternative investment managers in the quest for higher returns.According to research from Willis Towers Watson, the pension fund consultancy, total assets managed by the 100 largest alternative investment managers rose to $3.6tn at the start of the year, up 3 per cent on the previous year.The annual Willis Towers Watson Global Alternatives Survey shows that property, private equity, hedge funds and infrastructure have become more embedded in the portfolios of institutional investors.“The shift away from equities and bonds into alternatives has gained momentum among most institutional investors around the world,” says Luba Nikulina, global head of manager research at Willis Towers Watson.Allocations to alternative investment managers will grow further, she says, while government bonds deliver only miserly yields and returns from equities are forecast to be substantially weaker than those achieved historically.Despite the rise in allocations, however, managers of alternative investments are under greater scrutiny than ever from pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, which are demanding clear evidence that their interests are being served.“Investors have become more mindful of value for money,” says Ms Nikulina, adding that investors want alternative investment managers to carry a greater share of the downside risks if a strategy goes wrong.Last year the OECD, the Paris-based group of rich nations, warned that pension fund managers and life insurance companies were increasing their chances of going bust if they moved aggressively into alternative assets to meet their promises to savers.The OECD also called on regulators and policymakers to remain vigilant in assessing the exposure of pension funds and insurance companies to riskier alternative investments.The global alternatives survey, which has been extended to cover 10 asset classes and seven investor types, shows that total alternative assets under management globally stood at $6.2tn at the start of the year, spread across 602 managers.Pension funds remain the largest allocator to alternatives, accounting for 41 per cent ($1.5tn) of the total assets managed by the top 100 alternative managers.“Alternatives managers continue to be remarkably reliant on pension fund money,” says Ms Nikulina, adding that if alternative investment managers lowered their fees they would attract greater inflows from insurers and sovereign wealth funds.JPMorgan was the world’s largest manager of alternative assets on behalf of pension funds, helped by a strong performance by its real estate and infrastructure arms. Its pension assets rose 10.7 per cent to $75.6bn in 2015.Anton Pil, global co-head of alternatives at JPMorgan Asset Management, says: “Alternative strategies take time to play out but it makes sense for long-term investors to take advantage of the illiquidity premiums offered by alternatives.”Last year’s winner, Blackstone, did not disclose a breakdown for several asset classes and so dropped to 16th place in the list. However, Blackstone’s total assets increased 30 per cent, suggesting it might have retained its position as the biggest alternative asset manager for pension funds if it had reported its data fully.The study also shows that money has continued to pour into real estate, which remains the most popular asset class for institutional investors. It accounts for just over a third ($1,242bn) of the assets managed by the top 100 managers.Los Angeles-based CBRE retained the top spot as the largest property manager, with assets managed on behalf of pension funds rising 2.9 per cent to $45bn. CBRE’s lead has narrowed over New York-based TIAA and JPMorgan, which both saw an increase of 15 per cent in real estate assets managed for pension funds, to $45bn and $43bn respectively.Fundraising also remained strong for private equity managers, which are now sitting on a record amount of unallocated capital known as “dry power”. This has fuelled concerns that private equity managers will overpay to carry out deals and may damage future returns.Ms Nikulina says “meticulous selectivity” will be required to identify private equity managers with the right skills to navigate the next phase of the business cycle.Hedge fund managers, meanwhile, attracted relatively modest inflows in 2015 amid widespread concerns about high fees and poor returns. Almost half (45 per cent) of hedge funds posted losses in 2015 and the industry overall delivered a -0.85 per cent return last year, according to HFR, the data provider.In January last year Europe’s second-largest public pension fund, PFZW, withdrew all of its €4.2bn investment in hedge funds because of concerns about the investment performance, costs and complexity of the holdings.Ms Nikulina says that competitive pressures are growing for hedge fund managers from providers of low-cost smart beta strategies, a halfway house between active and passive management.Size has also become an issue, not just for hedge funds but for all alternative asset managers. Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create, the fund management consultancy, says: “Asset inflows are a double-edged sword for alternatives managers as their strategies are not scaleable as investments in equities and bonds.”He warns that “the wall of new money is diluting returns from alternatives”, adding that downward pressure on fees, particularly on funds that have mediocre performance, is “intense”.But Mr Rajan expects to see more money flowing into alternatives from institutional investors, which are deeply worried about the end of the 35-year bull market in bonds and the risks in equity markets.“The two main asset classes [equities and bonds] carry huge risks that could be absolutely crippling, particularly for pension funds where growing numbers are being forced to eat into their capital to pay retirement benefits,” he says.Rob Mellor, a partner with PwC, the professional services provider, agrees. “Negative interest rates will drive a shift out of bond markets and the place to go is alternatives managers,” he says.

It expects to produce tours of other towers as part of the deal with CBRE, which has handled lettings in buildings such as the Shard.A series of residential property agents also adopted the technology in 2015, enabling buyers to take digital tours of luxury homes including some on The Bishops’ Avenue, a north London street known as “billionaire’s row”.The retail landlord Hammerson this year mapped all its UK shopping centres and retail parks using Virtual Walkthrough, which integrates 360-degree photography with floor plans.“We feel this counts as a first viewing — people are usually going to physically do the second viewing but this helps to better qualify them and speed up the sales cycle,” said James Morris-Manuel, chief commercial officer at Virtual Walkthrough.“We’ve had clients in Dubai buy [residential] properties off-plan from the virtual tour, but that’s the exception.”A series of companies are vying to replicate buildings in digital form, including the US start-ups Matterport and Studio 216, which use three-dimensional imaging that works on headsets such as the Oculus Rift.Virtual Walkthrough also plans to make its tours available on the headsets.In the UK, rivals include 360 Imagery, run by a chartered surveyor, which is working with British Land and the Greater London Authority. Superyacht providers and hotel chains are also experimenting with virtual tours.LA-based CBRE has tripled its spending on technology in the past four years to almost $350m as it anticipates digital disruption in the real estate industry, affecting areas such as valuations as well as viewings.Savills, another estate agency, this year began offering virtual tours of high-end homes in collaboration with iViewing, including on Oculus Rift headsets.Virtual Walkthrough charges on a sliding scale depending on office size, with “capture” of a 10,000 sq ft office costing £1,000.It says it does not allow landlords to airbrush their properties to conceal flaws, but has on occasion used Photoshop for security reasons.“It’s a question we get asked more on the luxury residential properties: ‘I’ve got a Picasso on the wall, would you mind airbrushing it out?’” Mr Morris-Manuel said.
13;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2015-12-13T13:56:54Z;UK commercial property investment has peaked, says CBRE;Real estate prices expected to remain high for years;Levels of investment in the UK commercial property market peaked this year, according to CBRE, the world’s largest property services company by revenues, but the group does not expect prices to soften yet.The LA-based company predicted that UK real estate prices would stay relatively high for a number of years, with total returns declining by 2020 as rental growth moderates.“Pricing has gotten very high but there’s a reason it has gotten high . . . and we think it can stay high,” said Bob Sulentic, the company’s chief executive. “There’s a wall of capital out there that wants to be invested in real estate.”The cycle in London tends to move ahead of that in other European cities, said CBRE, with investment volumes in urban centres elsewhere continuing to grow.CBRE’s analysts said the UK was “probably at the peak of the market in investment volume in the current cycle, a little above the last cyclical peak of about £62bn in 2006”.They expected similar investment volumes in each of the coming two years.CBRE predicted total returns from the UK asset class of 10.1 per cent in 2016, below the 2014 peak of 17.8 per cent, and 13.1 per cent in 2015.Central London offices reached their highest level in terms of investment volumes in 2013, said CBRE’s head of UK research, Miles Gibson.Mr Sulentic said the evidence showed that the property industry had learned lessons from the 2008 financial crisis, in which a real estate bubble played a significant role.“Assets are less levered around the world, and new development, given how far we are into the cycle, is meaningfully lower than it has been in previous cycles,” he said.“In many markets, absorption is outstripping the creation of new supply. The market is more stable.”10.1%Predicted total returns from UK commercial property in 2016, below the 2014 peak of 17.8 per cent, and 13.1 per cent in 2015Mr Sulentic said pricing was high in big cities including New York, Tokyo and Hong Kong. But he added: “These gateway cities are going to be stable for a while.”Overseas capital has been a key driver of investment in central London since the crisis, but appears to have reached a plateau of about 70 per cent in 2014-15, CBRE said, with investors now looking further afield.International investors accounted for 32 per cent of investment in other parts of the UK, up from 20 per cent previously.This mirrors a global trend in which investors are looking to “second tier” cities, said Mr Sulentic. “Not only is there less availability in the gateway markets, but you can get better yields in the second tier.”With the US Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates — perhaps as soon as this week — the property industry is gearing up for the effects of a rate rise. A UK rise is expected to follow, but could come as late as 2017.Real estate has traditionally suffered from rate rises, which make higher yields available elsewhere, but Mr Sulentic said wide spreads between property yields and those available from long-dated government bonds meant CBRE expected the effects to be relatively gentle.“In the US we are going to see interest rates rise slowly, and we don’t think there’s going to be a lot of impact for the first two or three years,” he said.Mr Sulentic said he did not expect a significant drop in UK property investment from Asia, despite a slowdown in Chinese economic growth and market turmoil over the summer affecting other emerging markets in the region.Investors such as the insurance company Ping An and the commercial property group Dalian Wanda have been big investors in UK commercial real estate and in other developed property markets.“China is like any other place in the world that has a build-up of capital. The capital from China is diversifying. Yields from property in particular in China are low, so Chinese companies are looking for places around the world with higher yields,” said Mr Sulentic.CBRE, which employs 70,000 people, has benefited from the growing internationalisation of property investment. Like its biggest rival JLL, it offers clients property advice and services on an account basis across territories and sectors.CBRE has tripled its spending on technology in the past four years to almost $350m and plans further expansion, as it anticipates digital disruption in the real estate industry.“There are things out there that we have to do, or we’re going to lose our place in line,” said the company’s chief executive, Bob Sulentic. “There is going to be disruption in our sector. There are going to be things done with technology that used to be done by people, and we’re not thinking otherwise.”One example is property valuations, which have historically been carried out by people visiting and inspecting sites.CBRE — which carries out functions including investment management, property management and brokerage — uses an entirely automated system to value residential properties in Australia and anticipates rolling this out to more parts of its business, Mr Sulentic said.Brokerage, leasing and capital markets are other areas in which Mr Sulentic anticipates technological change in the coming years.He said CBRE would achieve this through mergers and acquisitions and strategic partnerships.Real estate has been relatively slow to adopt wholesale digital change, compared with fields such as retail and banking.But the exception is newly developed buildings, in which occupiers and owners are increasingly demanding centralised digital management of areas such as energy use, lighting and maintenance, including systems that alert managers before maintenance issues are likely to occur, said Mr Sulentic.“The buildings we develop have been heavily impacted by technology, but our business itself hasn’t been that impacted yet,” he added.CBRE acquired Wisconsin-based Environmental Systems, Inc., in April, a company that carries out energy management at almost 3,000 US sites, including through remote monitoring and energy use analytical data.
14;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2015-11-25T15:47:39Z;Autumn Statement: buy-to-let homes face higher stamp duty;Estate agents say surcharge will lead to higher rents and deter new landlords from entering market;The UK’s legions of private landlords face a fresh offensive from the chancellor in the form of a stamp duty surcharge on purchases of homes for rent.More than 1.4m people in the UK are landlords and the private rented sector has doubled in 14 years, boosted by an older generation’s search for income and a younger one’s inability to afford their own homes.But the government’s wish to halt the decline in home ownership and alarm bells from the Bank of England on the risks to financial stability from booming house prices, have prompted measures to cool the enthusiasm of would-be landlords.George Osborne, the chancellor, said on Wednesday he would levy a 3 per cent stamp duty surcharge on buy-to-let properties from April, a measure that the Association of Residential Letting Agents called “catastrophic”.Mr Osborne also said that capital gains tax on residential properties would now be due within a month, rather than by the end of the tax year.That followed a surprise summer announcement that tax reliefs available to landlords on mortgage interest payments would be slashed from 2017, while additional tax relief for “wear and tear” would also be substantially reduced.The new surcharge could add between £3,500 and £7,500 to the cost of a £250,000 property, depending on how it is implemented, said Jennet Siebrits, head of residential research at CBRE, the global estate agency.It is expected to raise £625m for the public purse in 2016-17, rising to £880m in 2020-21.Unlike other European countries, the UK’s rental market is dominated by private landlords who own fewer than 10 properties.Ray Boulger, technical director at broker John Charcol, said the announcement would precipitate a rush to buy over the next few months before the measures come in.Buy to Let-down — how will new stamp duty rules hit landlords?Once they do, the Treasury expects a reduction in transactions and warns the measures could even have a “material effect on house prices”.Richard Lambert, chief executive at the National Landlords Association, said the chancellor wanted to “choke off future investment” in private properties to rent, in what he said was “an attack on small private landlords”.But the Treasury noted a “high” level of uncertainty over the funds to be raised, given question marks over issues including enforcement.It noted that “the measure requires purchasers to declare that the dwelling they are acquiring will not be their primary residence — i.e. effectively to opt in to the higher SDLT charge”.Lucian Cook, UK head of residential research at Savills, said the biggest effect was likely to be on expensive homes in central London, which already faced a stamp duty rise under reforms of the tax last year.“The likelihood is that this will further suppress transactions and prices in the prime central London market, given the extent to which this market has been supported by purchases from second homeowners and investor buyers,” he said.Adam Challis, head of UK residential research at JLL, said the tax hike would worsen a shortage of properties to rent and could hamper developments that rely on investors, rather than occupiers, buying before properties are built.The stamp duty surcharge will not be applied to companies or funds making “significant” investments in residential property, the Treasury said — or to purchases of caravans or houseboats.Lenders said landlord buyers might move towards owning homes within a company structure, which may not be liable for the stamp duty surcharge but instead is subject to corporation tax and taxes on dividends.News and analysis of chancellor George Osborne’s mini-budget and spending review updating the government’s economic plansThe Bank of England warned in September that the buy-to-let surge could pose a risk to financial stability by pushing up house prices, increasing household debt and amplifying any downturn.It is also set to take on new powers to regulate the buy-to-let mortgage market.The latest measure also takes aim at owners of second homes. Mr Osborne said some of the money raised would be diverted to “places like Cornwall which are being priced out of home ownership”.The surcharge was one of a series of measures in Wednesday’s Autumn Statement linked to housing, which has risen near the top of the Conservative government’s agenda.It will expand development of subsidised starter homes for purchase and also double equity loans for Londoners under the Help to Buy programme.London first-time buyers will be able to borrow up to 40 per cent from the government, interest-free for five years, if they have a deposit amounting to 5 per cent of the purchase price.

As a result, small and medium-sized businesses are struggling to find space.The change was originally intended to be temporary and is due to end in May. There are also exemptions for clusters of economic activity such as the City of London.But ministers are due to make an announcement about the policy this autumn and are widely expected to make the rule permanent and remove many of the exemptions, despite widespread opposition.London mayor Boris Johnson business lobbyists and the property industry have warned that the reforms threaten the City’s future. Several councils have begun to tighten planning regimes to try to water down the national rule.London’s growing economy and a shortage of development finance over the past half-decade have combined to create a severe shortage of space for business, which has been exacerbated by the loss of offices to become homes.The amount of available office space across the UK is falling at a record rate, partly as a result of the policy’s introduction, according to figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors published last year.Vacancy rates in the West End, the area worst hit by the shortage, are at their lowest level for 15 years at just 2.3 per cent, according to CBRE.The conversions have been particularly concentrated in London, making up 40 per cent of all changes of use in 2014. Across the capital, more than 10m sq ft of office space could be lost if all the conversions approved by councils take place, according to the CBRE/BCO research.Price indices have presented wildly contrasting pictures of the health of the housing market
Further readingRichmond, Islington, Greenwich and Kingston saw the most frequent opposition by councils to developers’ conversion plans. Westminster, London’s biggest borough for employment, has lost enough office space for 78,000 workers as a result of the change, according to research published last year.Richard Kauntze, BCO chief executive, urged the government to take a “cautious” approach, saying it was “vital . . . to avoid a free-for-all.“The increase in office to residential conversions represents a growing challenge in how to satisfy office demand,” he said.Miles Gibson, head of UK research at CBRE, said the relaxation in the change of use rules was “having a significant drag effect on the growth of office stock in parts of London.“Some areas are running to stand still on the provision of new office space.”"

It aims to compete with the world’s largest property advisers, Los Angeles-based CBRE and Chicago-based JLL.Savills has also boosted its presence in the UK rural property market by buying advisers Smiths Gore and SEB Real Estate.As a result of the deals Savills’ turnover rose by more than a quarter in the first six months of 2015 to £547m, with profit before tax up 7 per cent to £26.4m.The figures cement Savills’ position as one of the world’s top four property advisory companies, alongside the combined forces of DTZ and Cushman & Wakefield. Chicago-based DTZ, backed by private equity giant TPG, agreed a deal to take over Cushman, owned by Italy’s Agnelli family, earlier this year.The biggest advisers are not standing still; CBRE this spring agreed to buy the Global Workspace Solutions division of US building management specialist Johnson Control for $1.5bn. It has also announced a series of smaller deals.Dealmaking activity among property consultancies is on the rise as the industry consolidates, driven by investors’ and occupiers’ increasing desire for global perspective from their advisers.Cash has been pouring into property around the world as investors search for yield. Real estate returns are relatively attractive in comparison to equities and bonds.With real estate investment volumes booming, prices and yields of the best-quality assets are back near pre-financial crisis levels.Reflecting this, Savills’ transaction advisory revenues rose 55 per cent year on year to £258m in the six months to the end of June.Jeremy Helsby, Savills’ chief executive, was upbeat in his expectations for the rest of the year, saying that property markets around the world “continue to be highly demand-driven as a result of the continued substantial capital allocation to real estate”.Economic growth has also benefited the company, he added. “In many markets we are now seeing rental growth and increased occupier confidence.”This offset a slowdown in the UK residential market before the general election in May this year; Mr Helsby said activity levels had recently “started to improve”.The global real estate investment boom has also boosted Savills’ competitors. CBRE recently reported an 11.4 per cent jump in its revenues in the first half of the year to $4.4bn, while JLL’s turnover rose 11.3 per cent to $2.6bn."

This is the highest level since 2007, and up 118 per cent year on year.Nearly three-quarters of buyers were backed by overseas money, CBRE found, providing the latest evidence of the significant role foreign investors have begun to play in London real estate.Cash from around the world has been flooding into the property market in a bid to benefit from the returns it can generate. Although prices and yields for top-quality assets are back near pre-credit crunch levels, the sector is still generating better returns than most other asset classes, such as stocks and bonds.Foreign investors are developing some of London’s largest sites, from Battersea Power Station on the south bank of the river Thames — which is funded by a Malaysian consortium — to the new Asian Business Port at the Royal Docks in east London, backed by Chinese capital.Four of the London market’s five biggest price tags in the three months to the end of June were paid by overseas money. The largest transaction was the sale of three sites for £428m to a partnership consisting of Malaysian investor Eco World and Irish developer Ballymore.A Singaporean and Malaysian consortium paid the second-highest price — £308m — for a pair of offices including former Express Newspapers headquarters Ludgate House.The figures include land for both residential and commercial use.

This compares with figures in 2012 showing growth of 7.2 per cent in the centre versus a sluggish 0.4 per cent in the outer ring.“We’ve seen significant growth in the outer boroughs,” said Jennet Siebrits, CBRE head of residential research. “The growth is swapping over.”Outlying boroughs where prices have increased include Waltham Forest, Enfield, Sutton and Barking and Dagenham.The surge in outer London comes as the sales of homes worth over £1.5m in London and the Southeast have dropped by 17 per cent over the year, partly under the influence of pre-election fears about a mansion tax.CBRE said it expected this market to pick up again soon, with “tentative signs of an upswing of activity over the coming months”.“The bulk of the London market (£300,000 to £400,000) remains robust and transactions have been steady over the year,” it said in a regional development report.The government’s flagship Help to Buy policy boosted house building in other parts of the country, such as the Southwest and the Midlands, where it accounts for 30 to 40 per cent of sales in some schemes, it said.House price growth in the Southwest was highly variable depending on proximity to cities where demand was high. Bristol, for instance, saw rises of 10 per cent, against 4 per cent across the region as a whole. Buy to let purchasers accounted for the greatest share of buyers, followed by those downsizing and moving on to a second home. First-time buyers were in the minority.Growth was more muted in the Midlands, with 1 per cent in poorer areas and 4 per cent in hot spots such as Solihull.Some of the strongest growth came in Scotland, with house prices rising 13 per cent in the first three months of 2015. Ms Siebrits said the resolution of uncertainty created by the September independence referendum was part of the explanation.CBRE said it was too early to draw firm conclusions about the impact of Scotland’s Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, which came into force in April 2015. However initial evidence suggested the savings it brought in a the lower end of the market had boosted transactions. For houses worth £500,000 and above, though, transaction numbers appeared to be falling as the tax kicked in.
19;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2015-07-24T15:35:28Z;Johnson Controls to split company in two;Automotive Experience businesses spun off in shake-up;Johnson Controls plans to divest the division responsible for more than half of its turnover by spinning off its Automotive Experience car seat and interiors making business, as part of a comprehensive reshaping of the group.The deal to create a new, publicly listed company would close in around a year, the company said on Friday, as it announced mixed results for the quarter ending in June.Automotive Experience accounted for $5.4bn of the company’s $9.61bn revenue for the quarter.The remaining company will be focused on buildings controls such as air-conditioning equipment and batteries.Alex Molinaroli, chief executive, said the spin-off was a “great opportunity” for the Automotive Experience business to further its position as the global leader in automotive seating and interiors.“At the same time, Johnson Controls will move forward with our multi-industrial strategies and make investments in our core growth platforms around buildings and energy storage,” Mr Molinaroli said.The spin-off follows the company’s announcement in June that it was examining the future of its automotive seating and vehicle interiors businesses.Johnson Controls (JCI) last year announced plans to form a vehicle interiors joint venture with China’s Yanfeng Automotive, a deal that completed only on July 2 this year.The newly separated company will include JCI’s stake in that joint venture — which produces vehicle interiors besides seats — as well as the seating business, which has another joint venture with Yanfeng and a separate joint venture with Japan’s Toyota Boshoku.JCI had been reluctant to commit to car seat making, an investment that automakers were demanding in fields such as reducing seat weight by using advanced materials.In March, JCI announced it was selling its Global Workplace Solutions business— which manages commercial properties — to CBRE for $1.48bn.Mr Molinaroli said the company was making “significant changes” to its portfolio to produce future growth and increased value for shareholders.“We see considerable opportunities for growth in our buildings and energy storage businesses, and expect increasing bottom-line benefits from the Johnson Controls Operating System as we leverage our scale and expertise across the businesses,” Mr Molinaroli said.The $9.61bn group revenue was 2.3 per cent down on the same quarter last year. Net income from continuing operations more than doubled, from $247m to $532m. However, net losses from discontinued operations increased from $48m to $325m and income attributable to non-controlling interests rose 70 per cent to $29m.That left net income attributable to JCI up only $2m to $178m and earnings per share up 1 cent at 27 cents.The company said it expected earnings per share in the June to September quarter, excluding transaction-related costs and non-recurring items, to jump 5 per cent to a $1 to $1.03 range.The shares, after opening up more than 3 per cent, were down about 1 per cent by mid-morning at $45.82.
20;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2015-04-26T22:59:45Z;Risk management industry must adjust to climate change loss;Sharing data is vital for countering extreme weather events;"Videos produced by the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety, in which simulated tornadoes and hurricanes tear off rooftops and force structures to collapse, make it easy to understand why climate change might prompt insurance companies to rethink their exposure to property risk.Yet, in response to the increased frequency and severity of storms and floods, insurers can do more than simply raise their premiums.The storms that appear in the US-based IBHS videos were generated using giant fans and massive tanks of water. But recent years have produced plenty of hard evidence of the damage that can be wreaked on property by actual storms, from severe flooding in Bangkok in 2011 to Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey in 2012.And these events are costly. The Thai floods led to $47bn in economic losses, according to Swiss Re, the global reinsurer, while Hurricane Sandy caused $68bn of damage across the eastern seaboard of the US, destroying more than 300,000 homes.Emerging markets are particularly at risk, since they are urbanising rapidly — often in the absence of the building codes needed to ensure that developments can withstand storms and floods.Moreover, in many cases, the insurance sector is less well developed in these countries than in mature markets.Whether in emerging or mature markets, metropolitan areas are often located near coasts, which means that threats are a central concern for insurers. And as the value of city real estate increases, so do the potential losses.For insurers, the challenge is not only to price into their risk models the greater frequency and severity of storms, but also to take account of the changing value of assets located in exposed areas.The relative vulnerability of real estate fabric is another consideration for insurers. This includes the age of infrastructure. For example, climate-resilient measures, such as water-resistant construction materials, are more often present in new developments than in older structures.However, while new buildings may be able to withstand windstorms and tornadoes more effectively, newer structures can be less resilient when it comes to flooding, since far more infrastructure, from heating and electricity systems to computer servers, is now placed underground.Tim Bunt is global head of risk management at CBRE, the property services company, and points to Hurricane Sandy as an example. “The wind damage was one thing,” he says. “But with the flooding, a number of high-value assets were impacted not just for weeks but months.”In addition to climate change, a range of other factors must inform pricing models, says Andreas Schraft, head of catastrophe perils at Swiss Re.“It’s not just climate change. Several developments are leading to increased exposure and claims,” he says. “We need to know those risks, so we can charge the right price.”From climate change and natural disasters to terrorism and cyber security breaches, property faces a range of hazards. What can governments, developers and insurers do to mitigate these risks?
Further readingSophisticated weather modelling technologies can help. “What the insurers now have is big data,” says Mr Bunt. “And their models are giving them better insight, not only as to how to price their risk but also where to take risk.”This can lead some insurers to alter the geographic emphasis of their risk portfolio.Cynthia McHale, director of the insurance programme at Ceres, a US-based coalition of investors and environmental organisations, says: “Some companies are making decisions about not being involved in a market or limiting their coverage in a certain market.”However, she adds that in highly regulated markets such as some US states, cherry-picking their coverage is not an option for insurers. “In the past, insurance companies can and have pulled out of markets wholesale,” she says. “But where the regulator might step in is if an insurance company wants to operate in only parts of a state.”To remain in certain markets, it is in the insurers’ interests to play a role in reducing the risks to property from extreme weather.“There are a few things we can do and already do,” says Mr Schraft. “We can share our view of the risks.”Swiss Re does this through reports such as last year’s “Mind the Risk”, in which it highlighted the perils facing more than 600 of the world’s largest metropolitan areas.In addition, Swiss Re publishes both a global map of flood-prone areas and a regular assessment of global insured losses from natural catastrophes.In the past, insurance companies can and have pulled out of marketsInsurers can also integrate risk engineering and consulting services into their coverage, to help cities and businesses increase the resilience of their buildings to minimise future losses. These services range from helping companies understand the risks their property assets face and producing natural hazard loss models and simulations, to developing mitigation strategies.Industry associations are also playing a role. In the UK, the Association of British Insurers hosts events and produces reports and guidance documents to help developers, planners and buyers identify and address a range of climate change threats to property.Through industry associations, insurers can help to shape zoning laws and building codes. In 2014, for example, the IBHS joined New York-based groups in advocating the adoption of updated construction and renovation codes to increase the resilience and energy efficiency of the city’s buildings.Meanwhile, the IBHS “Rating the States” report ranks 18 hurricane-prone coastal states along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast on how they have strengthened their residential building code systems since its previous study was published in 2012.Even so, Ms McHale sees a marked difference between the willingness of the US insurance industry to address climate change and that of European companies, partly because the issue is still so contentious in the US.“The industry [in the US] has been too reluctant to jump into the whole area of climate change and not only sound the alarm, but roll up its sleeves and work with cities, planners and property owners to look at where the risks are going to increase,” she says.A study of 330 US insurance companies, that Ceres published last year, highlighted this. The report found that 82 per cent of the 330 companies surveyed gained only a “beginning” or “minimal” rating in their response to climate risks.Meanwhile, Mr Schraft argues that the industry could do more to share claims information globally. “The insurance industry has a wealth of data about what can help and that is also relevant for architects and city planners.”The issue of privacy is one barrier to this, however. Additionally, much valuable information remains siloed in insurance companies, stored in everything from their claims departments to their underwriting offices.Finding ways to tap this rich vein of data could help the industry work more effectively with planners, engineers and architects on developing more resilient infrastructure. And, of course, doing so could allow the industry to remain profitable while meeting the insurance needs of the real estate sector in an increasingly risky world."

Johnson Controls will become the preferred supplier of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, building automation services and related services to the new, expanded CBRE portfolio of buildings.$26mSegment income produced by Global Workplace Solutions business for the three months to December 31“The agreement provides Johnson Controls with new channels for its offerings and when fully operational is expected to generate up to $500m of annual incremental revenue for the Johnson Controls building efficiency business,” Johnson Controls said.CBRE, meanwhile, will provide corporate real estate services to 50m sq ft of Johnson Controls properties.Mr Molinaroli said the agreement was “much more than a transaction”.“It reflects our commitment to grow our buildings business, and is a long-term arrangement with significant mutual value and a strategic partnership that will drive sustainable growth for both companies.”Bob Sulentic, president and chief executive of CBRE, said: “With GWS, we further our ability to create advantages for occupier clients by aligning every aspect of how they lease, own, use and operate real estate to enhance their competitive position.”

It will integrate SEB into its existing asset management operation Cordea Savills. This will create a European investment management business with about €15bn assets under management and €2bn in the Asia-Pacific region.The deal is part of a bid to take on larger US-based rivals with global reach such as CBRE and JLL. The move follows Savills’ acquisition of New York-based advisory firm Studley last spring.This move into the US combined with recovering European property markets helped drive transaction advisory revenues, which rose 38 per cent year-on-year.In continental Europe, Savills returned to profitability for the first time since the financial crisis. UK revenues hit a record thanks to the recovery in regional property markets.However, Asian governments’ imposition of tighter lending and controls on purchases to cool property markets hit Savills’ income in that region, with lower transaction volumes in mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore, keeping revenues flat year-on-year.Jeremy Helsby, chief executive, said he was “cautious” about the Hong Kong market, and that he expected the UK market to remain “subdued” due to political uncertainty in the run-up to the general election in May.Despite this the company has made “a solid start” to 2015, he said.Savills’ share price is back at around the previous historic high it hit at the top of the property boom in 2007.
24;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2015-02-09T11:37:56Z;Property advisers scale up to challenge dominant global players;Groups consolidate to keep pace with the large scale aspirations of occupiers and investors;"International property advisers are on a consolidation and acquisition drive as they gear up to take on the dominant US-based players in delivering a global service.The boom in global property investment is driving deals among advisory companies. In recent months groups have snapped up smaller rivals in order to boost their range of services and the locations in which they operate.The market is dominated by LA-based CBRE, which this week reported $9bn turnover in the year to end-December 2014, and JLL, which is based in Chicago and reported turnover of $5.4bn in the same period.The second tier of companies with turnover of between $1bn-$3bn includes groups such as Cushman & Wakefield, Colliers, DTZ and Savills.DTZ chief executive Tod Lickerman said that mid-ranking advisers need to get big or go boutique. “The biggest corporate occupiers and investors work all over the world so they expect their advisers to do the same,” he said.Other industries such as law, accounting and consultancy realised this many years ago, Mr Lickerman added.Bob Sulentic, CBRE chief executive, said that advisory companies now “have to be able to connect the dots from Asia to Europe to the US, in order to be the company that capital wants to work with because you have to have an informed point of view about all those markets”.Large companies are increasingly choosing which locations to locate their offices on a global basis, running standing accounts rather than paying one-off commissions, while investors are buying property across a growing number of countries, Mr Sulentic said.[Groups] have to be able to connect the dots from Asia to Europe to the US, in order to be the company that capital wants to work with because you have to have an informed point of view about all those marketsAs a result, over the past four years the average size of CBRE’s 30 largest clients has increased 73 per cent, he said.“It’s not just about bulking up [in scale], it’s about bulking up and being good and being connected, that’s what people who buy our capabilities are looking for,” he said. This meant advisers are having to invest more in technology and research.DTZ, Savills, Bilfinger, Cushman & Wakefield and Colliers have all made expansionary acquisitions in the past year.London-based consultancy Savills kick-started the dealmaking season last spring, buying US tenant advisory firm Studley for £154m. The deal is the latest of several attempts by the company — which has a strong Asian presence — to break into the US market.At the time Savills chief executive Jeremy Helsby said it would enable his company to deliver “a truly global service”.That deal was closely followed by Germany-based consultancy Bilfinger’s purchase of Britain’s GVA in a bid to build a pan-European adviser.Commercial real estate news and analysis from around

It has relocated its global headquarters from Australia to Chicago as part of the effort.Mr Lickerman said that even the biggest global advisers still have a total market share that is “only in the low double-digits”, meaning that the very fragmented market offers a wealth of acquisition opportunities.DTZ now aims to either acquire more businesses or expand organically in all 30 of its biggest global markets.It is not the only one.New York-based Cushman & Wakefield acquired US capital markets adviser Massey Knakal in December for an undisclosed sum. The company, founded in 1988, has more than 200 employees working on the financing of midsized office, retail and apartment buildings.Seattle-headquartered Colliers joined the action in the same month, buying European commercial property practice AOS Group, in a move which added 450 staff to its roster.Chris McLernon, Colliers’ Emea chief executive, said AOS’s large share of the market in France made it particularly attractive; it also works in Belgium, Spain, Morocco, UK, Netherlands, and Switzerland, and has annual turnover of $100m."

The company runs 20 Tussauds attractions including in Shanghai, Beijing and Singapore.The £4bn strength of Merlin’s covenant is expected to attract trophy-seeking international investors who have dominated London’s investment market.The building, which will be unaffected by the sale, is the largest single property asset owned by the Secure Income Reit, which listed on London’s Aim last June with a market capitalisation of £293m.Targeted at properties with long-term income streams, it owns 28 freeholds including the Alton Towers theme park, Thorpe Park and 21 private hospitals valued in June at close to £1.5bn.The attractiveness of commercial property as an asset class has seen its shares rise 74 per cent above its list price of 174p to 302p, swelling its market capitalisation to over £500m.Madame Tussauds was valued at £294m in its last accounts. Acquired as part of a larger portfolio nearly a decade ago, its sale is believed to be the first time the building has come to market as a single investment asset.Prestbury Investment Holdings, the company Mr Leslau runs with long-term business partner Mike Brown, is the external manager to the Reit and owns about a quarter of its shares.The pair took advantage of strong investor sentiment when they sold Aim-listed Max Property to Blackstone for nearly £450m last July.Mr Leslau insisted he was not calling the top of the property market, even though the sale price was equivalent to a 110 per cent increase in net asset value since Max floated in 2009.“Are we calling the top? Absolutely not,” Mr Leslau said at that time. “As Baron Rothschild once said, I got rich by selling early.”All parties declined to comment further on the sale.
26;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2014-12-21T12:46:44Z;Jeremy Helsby, Savills CEO: beyond the tweeds and Labrador;The CEO of estate agent Savills remains a London property bull;"When 33-year-old Jeremy Helsby returned to London in 1988, it was not a happy occasion.He had been sent out to Washington DC just three years earlier by his employer, the upmarket British estate agent Savills, to help launch the business in the US market. Things went well, and he and his wife Nicola decided to settle there permanently.Then the financial markets crashed. The US business was shut down and the couple arrived back in London with no house, no job and a newborn baby in tow. “They were personally dark days,” Mr Helsby says today.Savills found him a position in its City office, leasing space to commercial tenants, but it was a far cry from the early days he had loved as an agricultural investment agent, buying and selling farmland.Although his career at the time seemed to have tanked, it was his first step towards the company leadership. A Savills man for nearly 35 years, Mr Helsby became chief executive in 2008.“It said to the partners, here’s a young guy who’s prepared to get out of his comfort zone and go and do something different,” he says. “You could say I got it wrong because I had to come back here and start again, but I had tried my best. If you want to get on in life, you have to take a risk.”Since taking the helm, his boldest move has been to revisit that early US failure. Savills bought New York-based tenant advisory firm Studley in May for £154m, its biggest-ever acquisition. The move takes the London-headquartered company — which floated in 1988 — on to the home turf of larger rivals such as CBRE and JLL.It is Savills’ second major foreign expansion after it stepped into the Asian markets in 2000, buying FPD for £35m. “At the time that was a huge bet, Asia was crashing and burning, and a lot of people said we were absolutely mad. But it’s the best investment we’ve ever made,” Mr Helsby says.Savills Asia’s turnover was £354m in 2013, more than a third of the group total. It generated underlying pre-tax profit of £36m, of a group total of £75m. The UK now makes up just 51 per cent of Savills’ turnover, with the balance coming from Europe and the US.Although still smaller than the biggest US-based property advisers, Savills has outpaced its privately owned UK counterparts. It now employs 27,000 around the world, and total turnover is set to top £1bn this year for the first time.Unlike some of its bigger international competitors, Savills prefers to hire and acquire local expertise rather than rotating top managers around the world. Local knowledge is a vital asset, Mr Helsby argues.Born 1955, Liverpool, UKEducation Diploma in land economy, Royal Agricultural CollegeCareer1977: Starts his first job as a land agent in Market Harborough1980: Joins Savills in London1984: Transfers to Washington DC to help establish the US business1988: Returns to London and joins Savills’ City leasing department1993: Becomes head of the City office2001: Appointed chairman and CEO of UK commercial property division2008: Becomes group chief executiveFamily Married, three sonsInterests Waterskiing, sailing, tennis, walking his three dogsThe man on the street is still most likely to recognise the company as a purveyor of country houses and estates to Downton Abbey types — a job it has done for 155 years — but 85 per cent of turnover now comes from commercial property work. This is becoming more prominent; Savills worked on the sale of the Gherkin, the City of London’s most distinctive office tower, in November.“The tweeds and the black Labrador image was great 35 years ago, but the world is a very different place now,” Mr Helsby says. However, the longstanding residential business is still vital, bringing in private clients wanting to expand their property portfolios.“The investor today, particularly Asian investors who are one of the biggest pools of assets, see property as one asset class — not separately residential, commercial and land,” Mr Helsby says. “They want an adviser who can talk to them about land, a nice house in Belgravia and the Gherkin.”He characterises Savills’ approach as “being a one-stop shop for the global investor”. It is a lucrative business, but deals income is very vulnerable when the property cycle hits a downturn — something many agents and advisers discovered at about the time Mr Helsby became chief executive, when the financial crisis was beginning to bite.He accepted the job with some misgivings — property agents tend not to respect “corporate crap”, he says: “This business has always been wary of managers and loves fee earners.”Part of the attraction was the possibility that, in the teeth of a property market crash, being the boss could be a “poisoned chalice”, he says. “That’s what being a chief executive is about — winning the respect of the troops and steering the ship when life is tough.”Sure enough, he had to make redundancies and Savills issued two profit warnings in his first year. Explaining that to investors “was not a fun experience”, he says drily.Today, with the market back in boom times, has the property industry learnt anything? Mr Helsby is quick to emphasise that less than half of Savills’ income comes from deal fees; the rest comes from longer-term contracts such as consultancy and building management.Not that Savills is expecting a downturn. Mr Helsby is “very, very bullish” about the market, particularly in London. “What money I’ve got, I’d put it in London,” he says, making a great performance of the estate agent’s art of selling.It is almost convincing — but with London house prices 38 per cent above their previous peak in early 2008, and prime offices in the West End and the City back near record-low yields, this optimism may be in defiance of gravity.Born and raised on the Wirral in northwest England, Mr Helsby has no family background or connections in land or property; his parents were doctors. He decided to try land agency on a schoolteacher’s recommendation.‘This business has always been wary of managers and loves fee earners’His time at the Royal Agricultural College was “the best three years of my life” and it was a natural step to find employment in land trading. The countryside is still where his heart lies, although he spends much of his time away from the family home, which is a farmhouse and “a few acres” in Dorset.As the firm’s chief executive, Mr Helsby has a punishing travel schedule, spending a third of his time on the road gladhanding staff and clients.“As an adviser, we don’t own anything, the assets in this business are people,” he says. “The troops want to see me. I’m good at making them feel loved, which is absolutely crucial. Property agents are high maintenance at times, the clients demand a high level of service and it’s important they get that from people who are happy. People like it that you’ve bothered to come and say hello and thank you.”He sees his job — and that of his employees — as being about listening. “People have got to like you, if they don’t they’re not going to use you. So if you’re some arrogant little person . . . just shut up for a minute. Listen to the client tell you what they want you to do, and don’t always bang on about what you want to do.”His personality has a flipside. Mr Helsby is a perfectionist with a tendency to micromanage. His management style is assiduous charm with a touch of the martinet, according to some who have observed his career progress.“If I ring a department and the phone doesn’t get answered quickly, I get very irritated,” he says. “If I meet someone at a party and we’re selling their house and they say we don’t return their phone calls, I get extremely irritated. I have high standards and I expect other people to have high standards.”He admits that he uses events such as staff Christmas parties as a way of discovering grievances, which he can then follow up. “People coming to Savills expect a five-star service, right from the receptionist up, and yes I will meddle and poke my nose in.”Second opinion: The landlordToby Courtauld is not just a longstanding business contact of Mr Helsby’s; he is also his landlord.Mr Courtauld is the chief executive of Great Portland Estates, which built and owns Savills’ global headquarters in the West End of London.“Jeremy is well-respected, very driven and very direct, which I think is a good characteristic,” he says. “The negotiations [over Savills’ tenancy] were better for that. He is very conscious of Savills’ strengths and weaknesses, and has played to its strengths very well in the last few years.”"
27;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2014-10-07T23:11:07Z;Businesses evicted to make way for flats;Planning reforms lead to loss of office space, say councils;Businesses in the UK are losing out to housing developers, as a result of a change in government planning policy, according to local councils.The government relaxed planning rules in 2013 to make it easier to convert empty offices into homes. But a large proportion of the applications so far involve the conversion of occupied offices, leading to the eviction of established businesses, a survey of councils by the Local Government Association found.Nearly half the councils surveyed said the measures resulted in a loss of office space in their areas, while 80 per cent thought it did not bring empty offices back into use. The amount of office space available across the UK is falling at a record rate, partly because of the policy change, according to figures published in July.Peter Box, LGA housing spokesman, said organisations were being “kicked out of their premises so landlords can cash in on the higher rents they can charge for flats and houses.“Not only is there less office space available, there is also less of the vital infrastructure we need,” Mr Box said.“These changes have created homes that do not meet the identified needs of a community, which has put pressure on schools, roads and health services.”A swath of central London was exempted from the office to residential conversion policy when it was introduced but this summer the government proposed to cancel these exemptions. A number of London councils fiercely oppose the change, arguing that it will damage the capital’s economy.Central London areas such as Westminster and Islington, which have the highest house prices in the UK, have been the most affected, as developers flock to capitalise on the money to be made from converting offices to homes. But the LGA also gave examples of small businesses in relatively inexpensive parts of the capital which are being pushed out, suggesting that the reform is having a wider impact.More than 100 small businesses and charities lost their premises in the north London borough of Barnet this year, after a developer won planning permission to convert the 14-storey Premier House office building into 112 flats. Some tenants were given as little as four weeks’ notice to leave the building.In Mitcham, south London, 40 small businesses are looking for new space after the Willow Lane industrial estate was lined up for conversion into homes. Merton council had asked for the estate to be exempt from the conversion rules but the government refused.Property advisory company CBRE has warned that the loss of such relatively low-cost, flexible small business spaces will particularly harm London’s thriving creative and tech sectors.In a recent briefing note, the company said: “While previously there was an abundance of suitable, inexpensive premises just outside the centre of London, these location are fewer, and are becoming increasingly expensive as competition for business use increases.”Ian Anderson, a CBRE director, said the office to residential conversion policy was “a blunt tool” which had “some unintended consequences”.The government could consider introducing an occupancy test to protect business tenants, Mr Anderson said but that could be difficult to implement.
28;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2014-04-27T23:02:22Z;UK banks scale back property lending;;Banks are scaling back their lending to property companies despite the sharp improvement in market sentiment in recent months, as alternative investors step in to take more risk.Net outstanding loans made by UK banks to property investment companies and developers have fallen 13 per cent year on year to £175bn, according to research by law firm EMW. The amount of lending outstanding has almost halved from £247bn four years ago.Alternative lenders including insurance firms, pension funds, private equity and hedge funds have stepped in to fill the gap, helping the property industry to move back into a period of expansion over the past year.The figures do not include lending to mortgage borrowers or housebuilders, but do include lending to residential developers and investors. Hedge funds and other alternative lenders have begun to take big bets on the UK housing market by backing developers with relatively risky short-term finance.Regional property yields have begun to fall over the past year as value-conscious investors spread out from the very crowded London market in expectation of a rise in rental income as the economy recovers.Nationally, commercial property rents have risen an average of 3 per cent over the past year, and the average prime yield dropped 10 basis points in the first quarter of 2014 to 5.9 per cent, figures published last week by advisory firm CBRE showed.Aleksandra Starczynska, an analyst at CBRE, said: “The improving economic picture in the UK is being directly reflected in the performance of the commercial real estate.”Despite this, banks are fearful of the new upturn, having had their fingers burnt by risky lending in the previous property cycle which crashed in 2008.Nick Marshall, EMW’s head of real estate in London, said: “Bank lending to the property sector is still in freefall. Banks are still very concerned about risk in an industry that took such a hit in the financial crisis, and so they are continuing to take an extremely cautious approach towards property lending. The pain of the losses they suffered over the past five years or so is still being felt.”But Robert Duncan, an equities analyst at Jefferies, said that banks were merely lending a different type of finance to property companies.Banks have shifted their new lending from being secured against property to unsecured corporate debt, Mr Duncan said. This means the loans are considered less risky by the banking regulatory regime, so banks have to hold less capital against them.“Banks are shifting their lending from property to the corporate box, reducing their apparent real estate exposure and increasing their apparent lending to UK plc,” Mr Duncan said.
29;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2014-04-10T18:51:02Z;Businesses rush to snap up scarce London office space;;"London’s economic success is driving fierce competition for office space among the capital’s businesses, according to new figures.Businesses in central London are expanding rapidly and the amount of new office space they have rented is at its highest level for 14 years, data published by the real estate advisory firm CBRE shows.By the end of last month, 4.1m square feet of space was under offer in central London and a further 2.9m sq ft of deals had already been sealed in the first quarter of the year – up 14 per cent from the same period last year, CBRE found.Chris Vydra, an executive director at CBRE, said the shortage meant that employers were rushing to secure space while it was still available. “The supply crunch has started to bite and rental levels are beginning to rise,” he said.Mr Vydra cited technology as one of the main sectors behind expansion, along with banks who, he said, “are now feeling less constrained by politics, which is enabling them to make some sensible occupational decisions about relocations”. Accountants and US law firms were also in expansionary mode, he said.Jace Tyrrell, executive director of the City and Westminster Property Association, which represents developers and landlords in central London, said the demand was being driven by the capital’s increasing economic diversity.He said tech, media and telecoms businesses, medical and research companies were particular areas of growth.International businesses are also choosing to locate their regional headquarters in London, he said, citing the example of the growing cluster of fashion and retail companies at a business district being built in King’s Cross. One telling example was Louis Vuitton’s announcement last year that it was moving its UK headquarters from Bond Street to this previously rundown area in the north of the city. Google is also relocating to King’s Cross.Concerns have been raised that London’s economy dominates the UK, concentrating wealth in the south-east of England and preventing other regions from developing business clusters. In December Vince Cable, business secretary, said the capital was becoming “a giant suction machine draining life out of the rest of the country”.The supply crunch has started to bite and rental levels are beginning to rise“Britain has turned the corner and London is leading the UK’s economic recovery,” Mr Tyrell said. “The mood is upbeat and there is huge demand from companies.”As a result, availability of office space to rent fell 10 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 and vacancy rates dropped to 4.3 per cent.West End rents for the highest quality buildings rose 5 per cent to an average of £105 per square foot. City rents, on the other hand, rose only slightly to £58.50; in this part of London, there is more space and rents are generally lower.Five buildings in London had more than 100,000 square feet each under offer, and a further three had completed deals on more than 100,000 square feet in the first three months of the year, CBRE said. The biggest deal was a 205,000 sq ft letting to EY, a consultancy firm, at 25 Churchill Place in Canary Wharf."

Everyone is looking at Poland and that’s not bad for us, because we are able to target assets at attractive prices.”His company is raising an additional €200m to invest in Romania. “But if one believes in market cycles and global capital flows, yields in Warsaw and Prague will fall to such a low level that it will drive investors to our markets.”His prognosis is based on the strong increase in investment flows seen across central and eastern Europe last year.In 2013, Russia, the region’s largest market, enjoyed a 40 per cent increase in transactions to €5.2bn, according to property company CBRE. Poland, the second largest, saw a 9 per cent rise to €3bn, while the Czech Republic was up by 68 per cent at €1bn. In all, every significant market except Ukraine saw deals increase last year. Ukrainian transactions tumbled to €41m from €241m in 2012.Austria’s Immofinanz, one of Europe’s largest property companies, has written off the value of all of its investments in Ukraine and has no immediate plans to be more active in the strife-torn country, says Eduard Zehetner, chief executive. However, the company is continuing to invest in Moscow. “Moscow is like a large eastern European country in itself,” says Mr Zehetner.In addition to Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic – in essence, the greater Prague area – have long been the most resilient markets in central and eastern Europe. They attract conservative German, Austrian and US funds that like the region’s relatively high growth coupled with greater security. With yields in west European cities such as London and Paris at 3 per cent, investors can earn double in Warsaw for only slightly higher risk.“Poland is still the dominant market; it’s the sweetheart of central Europe,” says Michael Atwell, head of CEE capital markets at CBRE.Big pension, investment and private equity funds are entering the two top markets. Even sovereign wealth funds and investors from Asia and the Middle East are looking closely at the region.“With rapidly falling yields in some western markets, people are starting to put their heads up and look around in the search for better returns,” says Boris Olujic, a principal at Peakside Capital, a private equity property investor.The largest transaction of last year was the €412m sale of the Silesia City Center shopping mall in southern Poland’s industrial city of Katowice. It was bought by a consortium headed by Germany’s Allianz Real Estate.But, as institutional money continues to pour into Poland and the Czech Republic, investors with a higher risk tolerance are taking a greater interest in previously neglected markets such as Hungary and Romania.Hungary had been given a wide berth because of the unpredictable leadership of premier Viktor Orbán, while Romania was hit harder by the post-crisis downturn than most of the region.Things are now changing, however.“Hungary is a bit like Italy, in that you have politics and the economy – and often the economy has very little to do with politics. The economy is better than you read in the newspapers,” says Mr Zehetner.Some shift of investor interest towards the southern part of CEE is unlikely to have much negative impact on Poland and the Czech Republic. Mr Atwell expects that this year will see close to €4bn in transactions in Poland, approaching its previous peak of €5bn in 2006.Hadley Dean, managing partner for eastern Europe at Colliers, the property agency, says: “The mood is back. It feels like 2005 – everyone recognises the market is turning and wants to get on board.”This feeling is driven by a return to strong growth across most of the region. In the European Commission’s latest forecast, Poland is expected to grow by 2.9 per cent this year and 3.1 per cent in 2015, while the Czech Republic has shaken off its recession and should grow by 1.8 per cent in 2014 and 2.2 per cent next year. Many private sector economists are expecting faster growth.While growth is accelerating, inflation is still very low and interest rates are not generally expected to increase this year. Additionally, banks are keener to lend and developers are having an easier time getting financing with lower levels of pre-leased projects.The industrial market is also seeing renewed interest, driven in part by a revival of manufacturing, especially in cars and electronics, as well as a surge of investments in retail warehouses.The most important event was last year’s announcement that internet retailer Amazon was building enormous warehouses in Poland and the Czech Republic.“A lot of expansion plans were put on hold during the financial crisis and are now being restarted,” says Ben Bannatyne, regional head for CEE at Prologis, the industrial property developer and operator. “It is largely a matter of relocation from western Europe to central Europe.”The office market is also showing signs of strength. Much of the action outside Warsaw and Prague is being driven by continued investment in shared service and business process outsourcing centres. Many are located in secondary cities across the region, where office rents are low and there is a ready supply of cheap and well-qualified young workers.——————————————-Cyclical market: Trouble may be brewing in WarsawProperty – as anyone who has dabbled in it knows – is a cyclical game, so although Warsaw’s office market is enjoying a sharp upswing, this could be storing up problems for the future.Last year saw a record-breaking number of office completions in the Polish capital, as developers secured easier financing and were persuaded to dust off long-delayed plans in response to a surging market.About 300,000 square metres of offices were handed over to tenants in 2013, an increase of almost 7 per cent from 2012 and the highest level since 2000, according to JLL, the property consultancy. As a result, vacancies are edging up, approaching 12 per cent, and rents are drifting lower, falling about €1.5 to an average of €25 per sq m in central Warsaw last year.The problem is that at least 320,000 sq m of office space is due to be delivered during 2014.“We are going to see 500,000 sq m come on to the market in the next 18-24 months, which could create pressure on rents,” says Anna Staniszewska, head of research at BNP Paribas Real Estate. “New projects are fighting for pre-lets, which increases competition among landlords forced to offer attractive rents.”About 35 per cent of this year’s projects are already pre-let and tenants in existing buildings are being tempted to move to new quarters by builders desperate to show banks that completed projects are meeting their leasing targets.In some cases, developers are knocking as much as 25 per cent off their headline rents, notes a report by Cushman & Wakefield.That has put power into the hands of tenants, and rents are likely to decline in existing buildings, says JLL."

The people here are well travelled, and the country is an important destination for Asian tourists,” says Hans Andersson, H&M’s Australia manager.The influx of global retailers is transforming the high street where rents in Sydney’s prime shopping district are among the world’s most expensive. It is forcing a restructuring at local retailers, which until recently were insulated from foreign competitors due to geographical remoteness.But a relatively robust Australian economy – which has had 22 years of consecutive growth – has become a draw too strong to ignore, while large numbers of Chinese and Japanese tourists to the country have also attracted luxury brand retailers.“There is such pent-up demand from overseas retailers looking for retail space in prime locations that it is proving difficult for them to get into shopping centres,” says Alistair Palmer, head of retail at property company CBRE.H&M is following Zara, Hollister, Miss Selfridge, Victoria’s Secret and Topshop, which recently opened outlets and revealed expansion plans. Japanese retailer Uniqlo, UK retailer River Island and Banana Republic, owned by Gap, are all seeking a foothold in Australia.The Swedish fashion house spent three-and-a-half years identifying a suitable location for its first store in Australia and is still searching for properties in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.Colliers, the real estate group, estimates international retailers plan to introduce 235 stores across Australia over five years, gobbling up 220,000 sq m of retail space. It is part of a wave of foreign investment which dates back to 2008, when Apple opened a flagship store in Sydney.“The hiccup in the world economy caused by the great financial crisis prompted international retailers to look beyond established markets in the US and Europe towards growth in Asia,” says Michael Bate, head of retail at Colliers International.China was the big draw for many retailers in the first phase of this expansion, with H&M setting up its first store in China in 2007 and Gap following in 2010. For retailers Australia is the next logical step.“Many retailers have got their logistics in place in the Asian region. It isn’t difficult to bolt on a presence in Australia to capture the 23m consumers here,” says Mr Bate.Deutsche Bank suggests Australia can be hugely profitable for new arrivals such as Inditex, which opened its first Zara store in 2011. In 2012, Zara’s six Australian stores made A$106.8m in revenues and earned A$18m profit. Zara’s profit margins in Australia were higher than the group’s average, according to research from company filings.A boom in online sales by Australian residents has lured others, including Topshop, Down Under.“We knew from the success of our online business that brand awareness was strong, and that’s always a great position to be in,” says Paul Gould, international director Arcadia Group, which opened its first Topshop in Melbourne in 2011.Marks and Spencer, mulling setting up stores in Australia, is building a big online presence by offering free delivery for purchases above £30.Almost a quarter of the A$14.7bn online purchases made last year by Australians were from international retailers, most on offshore websites that do not charge local sales tax on items under A$1,000.Australian retailers are lobbying the government to tighten the tax rules, while a recent dip in the value of the Australian dollar has slowed the pace of overseas online sales.David Jones and Myer – Australia’s best-known department store chains – have been hit hard by overseas competition, a key factor in Myer’s decision to propose a A$3bn merger.“We’re seriously considering it,” says Paul Zahra, chief executive of David Jones.“[Australian] retailers got lazy and complacent. Consumers simply got fed up with being treated like mushrooms in a dark room.”He blames the longer-term surge of the Aussie dollar to record highs and the ability for consumers to avoid sales tax for soaring overseas online sales.Some well-established local retailers such as Brown Sugar, Fletcher Jones and Snowgum have been forced into receivership and Billabong International, the surfwear company, has similarly endured a dire few years.“Our retailers got lazy and complacent,” says Nancy Georges, founder of Magnolia Retail Marketing Solutions, a consultancy. “Australian consumers simply got fed up with being treated like mushrooms in a dark room. They moved online or went to the new international outlets.”But not every foreign invader is successful. Coffee chain Starbucks, which arrived in 2000, closed 61 of its 84 Australian stores in 2008 due to slack sales and a local love of European-style coffee.Local competitors such as Premier Investments, which owns the Just Jeans and Smiggle brands, are also upping their game. Last week it opened its first Smiggle store in the UK, and posted a 12 per cent increase in profits to $52m for the first half of the year.“It’s up to H&M and Uniqlo to prove that they can actually do it [in Australia],” says Mark McInnes, chief executive of Premier Retail. “That being said, we’re not taking them lightly.”
32;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2014-03-10T16:56:00Z;Foreign private equity firms expanding property portfolios in Bangalore;Such has been the success of Bangalore’s technology business parks that foreign private equity firms are rapidly expanding their property portfolios in the city;The quintessential image of India’s economic emergence was captured by Thomas Friedman in his popular 2005 book about globalisation, The World is Flat. Friedman starts with a visit to the 43-acre headquarters of Infosys, one of India’s premier information technology outsourcing companies, based in the southern city of Bangalore.He travels down a rutted road crowded with motorcycles, rickshaws and beasts of burden, and arrives in what he calls “a different world”. He describes the ultra-modern Infosys campus, with its massive glass-and-steel buildings, housing more than 20,000 workers, and the supersized videoconference facilities for interacting with the company’s clients and partners from across the globe. He also notes amenities such as a large swimming pool, a putting green, a health club and numerous restaurants.Almost a decade later, the Infosys headquarters, in Bangalore’s Electronic City, has not lost its ability to amaze and delight visitors, especially those from other parts of India who must deal with the country’s rickety public infrastructure and the dilapidated office buildings of its urban centres. But the campus is typical of the scale and calibre of commercial property that has been developed in Bangalore, a city that has doubled in size over the past decade.Once dubbed a “pensioners’ paradise” for its temperate climate, Bangalore today has 100m sq ft of commercial office space, more than any other Indian city. Its vast ultra-modern business parks provide tracts of space to house tens of thousands of office workers in one place. The parks are buoyed by extensive infrastructure, such as back-up power and water systems, needed to ensure global companies can keep running 24 hours a day without interruption, in a country notorious for power cuts and other infrastructural deficiencies.It is no surprise that many of India’s leading IT companies, such as Wipro, are based there, but Bangalore is also the destination of choice for the Indian operations of global companies such as Goldman Sachs, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco and Tesco. Now, as well as luring prestigious tenants, the city’s business parks are also attracting the attention of private equity firms, which have been taking stakes in completed, leased commercial property assets.Over the past two years, Blackstone, the US-based private equity group, has invested about $800m to build up an Indian property portfolio of 28m sq ft. Of those funds, half have been invested in Bangalore commercial buildings, with its partner Embassy Property Developments, based in the city. The two companies are completing a $325m deal to take control of Vrindavan Tech Village, a 104-acre special economic zone with 2.1m sq ft of leased office space and 75 acres of undeveloped land.Blackstone is not alone. Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, has invested nearly Rs18bn ($289m) in a special-purpose vehicle set up by RMZ, southern India’s largest commercial property developer. Property companies owned by Singapore’s government are also looking for potential acquisitions, and some Indian players have begun to follow suit.According to Cushman & Wakefield, the property services company, private equity investment in Indian property rose 25 per cent to Rs47bn in the first nine months of 2013, though much of that was driven by the Qatar deal.Of the Rs30bn invested in Indian property in the third quarter of 2013, Bangalore was the top destination, with Rs18.8bn of investment, while India’s national capital region, Delhi (and its satellite city Gurgaon), and Mumbai came a distant second and third, attracting Rs3.8bn and Rs3.6bn respectively.Private equity funds’ interest in Indian office space is good news for cash-strapped property developers, many of which urgently need new capital to fund future developments. “This is very encouraging,” says Anshuman Magazine, managing director of CBRE, the property services company, in south Asia. “One of the challenges in India has been an exit route for property developers. This will encourage more investment, as now they know there is a market. It brings more liquidity into the market.”The new interest in Indian office space as an investible asset class comes despite an overall economic slowdown. India’s gross domestic product growth fell to a decade low of 5 per cent in the 2012-13 financial year, down from a peak of 9.6 per cent in 2006-07, and there are few convincing signs of a pick-up. Growth in GDP between April and June 2013, typically the slowest quarter, fell to just 4.4 per cent, then recovered slightly to 4.8 per cent in the subsequent quarter.Bangalore’s overall vacancy rate for commercial property is about 14 per cent, and rents are relatively low – from Rs30 per square foot in the 1990s-era Electronic City to Rs50-Rs52 per sq ft in newer complexes along the outer ring road to Rs120 per sq ft for top-grade office space in the central business district.But with demand picking up from western companies, and development of new properties slowing due to the difficulties of acquiring large parcels of land and securing finance, industry players believe rents are set to rise over time. In some of the more desirable new locations or “micro-markets”, vacancy rates have already fallen to just 5 per cent.Tuhin Parikh, who heads Blackstone’s Indian property operations, says the private equity firm is confident that office rents in Bangalore will increase over time, given both the city’s inherent long-term demand for space and the sharply rising costs of construction. “We think rents over time will go up,” he says. “Demand may have dropped off modestly in the office market, but supply has dropped sharply, given the lack of capital.“Given what has happened to land prices, construction costs and cost of debt, it is expensive to replicate these assets. [Compared with] what you built them for five or six years ago, it costs double to build them today.”At the peak of India’s growth cycle, Bangalore saw a take-up of around 11m sq ft of office space a year, but that has now fallen to around 7.5m sq ft a year.But Ram Chandnani, head of south India operations for CBRE, says Bangalore’s property market is churning, as companies such as Cognizant, Accenture and Hewlett-Packard, with employees scattered across multiple facilities, move into dedicated, purpose-built office parks. “Existing occupiers want to consolidate their operations, and most of it is built to suit transactions – corporate occupiers pre-arrange a deal with a developer,” he says. Such moves are freeing up older space for a new wave of occupiers.Bangalore is not the only Indian city that offers ultra-modern office space. Gurgaon, near Delhi, and Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex also have large tracts of land available. But Bangalore remains particularly attractive for companies, just as it is a magnet for young knowledge workers from all over the country.
33;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2014-01-16T00:02:06Z;Investors pour into European property;;Sharply rising investor demand for European property is fuelling a battle for assets that is driving prices up and causing fears of a renewed bubble, according to new research.Investors are pushing into riskier markets such as Spain and Ireland , riskier activities such as development, and lower quality assets known as secondary property, a report by PwC and the Urban Land Institute has found.Investment in European commercial property hit the highest level since the credit crunch in 2013, separate data from CBRE show. The data show that activity was up 21 per cent year on the year to €154bn.Investors around the world have stepped up their allocations to real estate assets over the past couple of years, as low interest rates and governments’ quantitative easing programmes create a low-yield environment in which returns are hard to achieve in many asset classes. As a result there had been a “huge capital push” into Europe’s biggest real estate markets, said Simon Hardwick, a partner at PwC.But Joe Montgomery, European chief executive of the Urban Land Institute, cautioned that this demand did not necessarily reflect economic fundamentals. “With limited signs of tenant demand and rental growth [in some markets], questions remain as to how far the recovery can go,” he said.More than half of those surveyed by PwC said that prime European property had become overpriced as a result of the huge demand. “Intense competition for the limited supply of suitable property will inevitably continue to have an impact on prices, particularly in global gateway cities including London,” Mr Hardwick said.Most transactions were in the UK and Germany, but CBRE’s data showed the fastest levels of growth in peripheral economies such as Spain, Portugal and Ireland, where property markets have been severely depressed in recent years.Jonathan Hull of CBRE said: “Opportunistic investors are targeting what are seen as recovering markets. At the same time there continues to be very strong demand for core investment product in central business district markets such as central London and the major German cities.”October 2013: Enda Luddy, head of the Dublin office of property advisers CBRE, talks about his forecast of up to a 20 per cent rise in office values in the Irish capital, in a sector that still faces major problems in rural areasDespite having been a no-go area just a couple of years ago, Dublin’s property market is now one of the hottest on the continent, according to PwC’s research. With Ireland having seen a flood of deals, investors are beginning to focus on Spain, the research found.Investment into European property by Chinese investors tripled year on year to more than €3bn, new figures from Real Capital Analytics show. Joseph Kelly of RCA said: “Wealthy individuals, developers and insurers have become increasingly active across a broader range of property types, lot sizes and European locations.”China’s financial regulator relaxed overseas investment rules last May, allowing insurance companies to buy foreign real estate. The regulator also doubled the proportion of capital that Chinese insurers can place into real estate assets, from 10 per cent to 20 per cent.
34;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
35;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2013-11-17T20:02:05Z;Property: Volatility is as much at home as sky-high prices;Even parking spaces can fetch huge sums;It is a rite of passage to gripe – and occasionally gloat – about Hong Kong property prices. Companies setting up in the territory have to accept they will pay some of the highest prices in the world for office space and possibly dole out equally large housing allowances.Likewise for retailers. Burberry, the British luxury brand, pays about $1m a month in rent for its store in Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay shopping district. Ralph Lauren is heading to Hollywood Road, traditionally home to purveyors of antiques, memorabilia and general tat rather than expensive US clothing.But it is not a uniform picture of sky-high rents, as those who took space during the bleak days of Sars, the infectious disease that swept through the territory in 2003, or the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, can testify.“Hong Kong doesn’t do stable,” says Craig Shute, a senior managing director at CBRE, the real estate services adviser. “It is rare that prices remain in a 10 per cent band on either side.”That is testament to the volatility attendant upon a spit of land that effectively has its interest rates set by the US – courtesy of the Hong Kong dollar currency peg – and its demand dictated to a large extent from across the border in mainland China.Land is in pitifully short supply and government policy on land sales has mostly kept it that way. During times of high inflation, property was seen as a classic hedge.Car parking spaces have gone for $1.3m, enough to buy a street of houses in parts of England or the US. H&M, the Swedish clothing retailer, shuttered its flagship store leaving its Central District location to Zara, its Spanish rival, to take up the keys and pay double the rent.And there has been a veritable exodus of banks and businesses across the water to Kowloon, once viewed as a hinterland by many expat bankers.Recently, however, clouds have been appearing on the horizon. In February, the government took steps to cool the market, doubling stamp duty on properties worth more than HK$2m ($258,000) and introducing a lower duty on cheaper homes.At the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory’s de facto central bank, cut the maximum loan-to-value ratio to 40 per cent for commercial and industrial spaces and introduced a similar ratio for parking spaces, the latest subject of speculative investment.More recently, developers of big projects have been offering rebates and discounts which, in some cases, have served to lop 20 per cent off the price – although this “teaser” strategy has helped them to sell subsequent batches at higher prices. “Hong Kong seems to be at a crossroads,” says Mr Shute. “There are a lot of opinions on what will happen to pricing over the next 12 months or so.”In one corner are the pessimists – or optimists, depending which side of the desk you are sitting on. Barclays, UBS and Merrill Lynch Bank of America foresee a downturn, with prices falling 30 per cent or more by the end of 2015 on the back of supply increases and stalling income growth.“The magnitude of the fall is underestimated,” wrote Barclays’ analysts. “The property market is about to enter its first real downturn since 1998.” That was when Hong Kong was caught up in the sell-off triggered by the Asian financial crisis and homes lost two-thirds of their value over a six-year period.Several factors support their caution. The latest run-up in prices has been strong: the property market has more than doubled since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008.Buyers from the mainland, accounting for as much as a quarter of home sales at the peak in the fourth quarter of 2011, dropped to only 8 per cent in the first quarter of this year, according to Centaline, a property agency.CY Leung, Hong Kong’s chief executive, is on a mission to make housing more affordable for the territory’s 7m inhabitants, or at least to stem the upward spiral.This means increasing supply – a similar policy launched by one of his predecessors Tung Chee-hwa after he came to power in 1997 quickly damped exuberance.
36;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2013-11-07T21:00:26Z;Commercial property: Bold venture farther south and east to improve returns;Fewer opportunities in traditional hunting grounds is widening some investors’ horizons;"As the old saying goes, property is all about location. In central and eastern Europe that used to mean only two places: Poland and Prague – the rest of the region was deemed too economically risky and politically unstable after the crisis of 2009 to attract much investor interest.Most of central Europe south of the Czech Republic “is a step too far unless you’re an opportunistic investor”, says Mike Atwell, head of CEE capital markets with CBRE, a property consultancy. However, the global low-risk environment is changing the equation.Conservative investors, mainly from Germany, as well as sovereign wealth funds, have flooded into prime Polish and Prague property. While property yields in Germany have settled at about 5 per cent, in Poland and the Czech Republic they are 1.5 percentage points higher – for a similar risk profile.An example of that sort of interest is the region’s largest transaction this year, the €412m purchase of the Silesia City Centre shopping mall in Katowice in southern Poland by an international group of investors headed by Allianz, the German financial services group.That is forcing other investors to look to parts of central Europe that had been off their radar. Some are prospecting in non-core areas such as Polish secondary and tertiary cities for retail projects and non-Prague properties in the Czech Republic.The brave are venturing into more opportunistic environments to generate better returns. Prime office yields in Budapest are 7.25 per cent; in Bucharest they are 8.25 per cent; and in Sofia they come in at 9 per cent.“The big difference is now that Hungary and Romania are back – people are looking at them again,” says Hadley Dean, managing partner for eastern Europe at Colliers International, noting his property firm recently completed its first investment deal in Hungary in three years. The company is also working on two deals in Romania and one in Bulgaria.In a survey of regional investment activity in the first three quarters of this year, CBRE found that investments in Poland were up by 82 per cent to €2bn and the Czech Republic was up by 58 per cent to €597m. There was an uptick of activity in Hungary, which saw transactions of €129m compared with €84m in the first nine months of 2012, while Slovakia saw activity of €190m compared with only €1m a year earlier. Bulgaria saw €27m in sales compared with €9m in 2012.Romania, however, declined to €84m from €172m in 2012.As transaction volumes show, the vast bulk of business is still being conducted in Poland and the Czech Republic, but there is growing evidence that investors are looking elsewhere, even if that is not yet reflected in significantly stronger deal flows.Mr Dean notes the arrival of so-called “vulture funds”, adept at sniffing out non-prime deals and expert in timing market bottoms. “These funds that are interested in distressed assets are taking a close look at central Europe,” he says.Hungary has been the region’s biggest loser in the post-crisis flight to quality. Before 2008, it was seen as one of the core markets and attracted as much interest as Poland and the Czech Republic. However, that has shrivelled with 2012 seeing only €122m in transactions, the lowest level since the formation of the modern real estate investment market. While German and Austrian funds are not active in Hungary, entrants from the US, the Middle East and South Africa are hunting for deals. Slack investor demand has meant a lacklustre environment for construction; there have been few new office and retail developments.The situation is similar in Romania, where there was only one office transaction in Bucharest in the first half of the year, and new development has sagged. However, the core of the region shows robust activity.Poland is seeing significant office, retail and logistics construction. About 1m square metres is being added to an existing modern office stock of 6m square metres, and a significant share of that development is aimed at growing demand for office space for business offshoring centres.Logistics developments are being driven by a reviving economy, the long-delayed completion of part of Poland’s highway network, and the rapid development of ecommerce. The Czech Republic is also seeing construction, especially in Prague. In a sign of the confidence that investors have in the Czech capital, seven office projects under development are being built speculatively.While careful institutional investors are hunting in Poland and Prague, there are signs some of the slack in more marginal markets is being taken up by local investors, who have been only a limited presence in past years.In the first half of this year, Polish investors accounted for a record 17.6 per cent of all transactions. “The stronger position of domestic investors is likely to increase the stability of the Polish market and stimulate other market players to invest,” says research from Cushman & Wakefield, the property firm. In the Czech Republic, local investors accounted for 30 per cent of transactions, focusing on transactions in the €5m-€20m range. Although there were very few deals in Hungary, local investors were involved in the purchase of part of the Profi and Match retail networks, being sold by Belgium’s Delhaize."
37;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2013-10-23T16:31:15Z;Irish property market scents recovery as commercial deals rise;;The Irish commercial property market has returned to growth for the first time in six years, as economic recovery fuels a growing mood of confidence among international investors.Prices have risen in the Irish commercial property market for the first time since the financial crisis in 2007, according to figures from property data company IPD.Optimism has been rising for the past few months, with residential property already on the up. This is now feeding through into commercial prices, which rose 0.3 per cent in the third quarter.With prices still 65 per cent below their pre-crunch peak – the biggest drop ever recorded by IPD – yields of 9.7 per cent are the highest globally in IPD’s databank, and annual returns are among the highest in Europe at 7.3 per cent.However, the recovery is a two-speed affair, concentrated in prime Dublin office space. Most other commercial property is still mired in gloom.Marie Hunt, executive research director at real estate services firm CBRE Ireland, said there had been a surge in deals over the past year as Ireland’s state-owned “bad bank”, the National Asset Management Agency, began to sell off its portfolio of commercial property assets.Nama and the banks were responding to “huge appetite” from investors, she said. “The [IPD] figures are psychologically hugely important for investors, and will probably encourage further transactions.”Nama has so far sold €1.3bn of property assets in Ireland – a small proportion of its total €9bn sales globally to date. A further €1.5bn Nama assets are currently being marketed for sale.A key element in Nama’s sales strategy is the provision of vendor finance. So far €375m has been used to back six transactions in order to bring more bidders into the market, creating more pricing competition. Frank Daly, Nama chairman, last month said that this would continue to be important.Nama also plans to bundle properties into portfolios for larger-scale sales, he said.Data from CBRE shows that a total €1bn-worth of property investment deals took place in Ireland in the first nine months of 2013. More than two-thirds of investors were international, with US money making up nearly half of all deals.A shortage of supply is a key factor that has begun to affect prices, and is expected to drive further price growth in the office market in the coming months. Colin Lauder, an IPD associate, said: “Occupier demand remains a critical component of growth, and has driven the recovery in the office sector and improving returns for industrial units.”Both these sectors were driven largely by international factors, he said. Retail, by contrast, was unlikely to see much improvement amid continued subdued consumer spending, he added.
38;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;International investors return to European property market;;International investors are returning to the European commercial property market in a sign of increasing confidence that the continent’s economy has turned the corner, according to research.The proportion of commercial property investment coming to the region from outside Europe hit 17 per cent in the first half of 2013, the highest level since late 2007 and up from a low of just 4 per cent in the first half of 2009, figures from advisory firm CBRE show.However total investment volumes at €41bn are well below those seen before the financial crash, down from €93bn in the second half of 2007.These figures exclude the UK market, which has seen massive inflows of foreign investment in recent years as investors seek safe havens and solid assets.Europe’s economies have begun to show tentative positive signs in recent months, and property deals in peripheral eurozone economies rose 60 per cent quarter on quarter, figures published last month showed. Irish commercial property prices are forecast to rise as much as 20 per cent by the end of this year, according to CBRE.The biggest flows in the past 18 months have come from North American investors, with Asian investors making up the second-largest group, CBRE said.This spring Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund bought a 40 per cent stake in Milan’s new Porta Nuova business district from developer Hines Italia SGR for an undisclosed sum. Hines itself acquired the New City office complex in Warsaw, Poland, from ECI Group for an undisclosed sum.Investor Hannover Leasing paired with an unnamed Asian institutional investor to buy the Belgian federal administrative centre in Brussels, which is being redeveloped.Colm Lauder, an associate and consultant at property data company IPD, said: “Recent improvements, or at least relative stability, in the eurozone have encouraged more investors to look again at European real estate, but it is far from homogenous in performance.”He identified Germany and the Nordic countries as offering stability and lower returns, whereas heavily discounted assets in the peripheral eurozone countries offer potentially strong income returns, but also carry risk.Germany has continued to be attractive to international investors seeking yield in a stable environment. Domestic property investors say they have noticed interest from international property investors in some of the country’s core commercial centres such as Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich.Sovereign funds have been active in larger property deals, while international family offices have been interested in smaller commercial real estate opportunities, investors say.“The market is highly competitive and we definitely see a lot of interest from international investors at the moment,” says Matthias Danne, head of real estate investor Deka Immobilien.Jonathan Hull, head of EMEA capital markets at CBRE, said: “Europe will be a natural home for much of the real estate allocation from global capital flows for as long as its markets retain transparency and liquidity, while also offering diversification benefits against assets that are denominated in, or pegged to, the dollar.”
39;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2013-10-06T13:00:15Z;Irish eyes are smiling again as Dublin’s property prices pick up;;Six years after Ireland’s property bubble burst, tipping the country’s economy into crisis and causing commercial and residential prices to more than halve, the sector is showing signs of recovery.In Dublin, house prices have increased 10 per cent over the past year and commercial property prices could rise by as much as 20 per cent by the end of 2013, says property services firm CBRE.“There is a significant recovery under way, albeit it is very sector specific. Dublin has seen the most significant upturn in the past 12 months,” says Enda Luddy, managing director of CBRE Dublin.Strong demand for prime office space from multinational companies and a surge of interest from overseas property investors is driving the recovery in Dublin.And while a large number of ghost housing estates and abandoned retail units remain, fears are even growing about a shortage of prime office space in the capital.“The vacancy rate is dropping fast, particularly for grade A offices above 50,000 square feet,” says Domhnaill O’Sullivan, director of investments, Savills Ireland.“These are in short supply with companies such as KPMG, Arthur Cox and Bank of New York Mellon all seeking offices.”When the bubble burst in 2008 most property development ground to a halt. No big office buildings have come on stream since the first quarter of 2011 and no significant building work is taking place.Property experts say that while there is still an overhang of office building in suburban areas, they are the wrong size, wrong specification or wrong location for big tenants.Virtually all the new office buildings in Dublin’s “Silicon Docks” area, which is popular with technology companies, are taken.Facebook is close to signing a deal on one of the last remaining 120,000 sq ft blocks in the area, Twitter moved into a new office last week and a host of other internet and finance companies, including Yahoo, are searching for space.The shortage of prime office space is causing a headache for Ireland’s state investment agency IDA Ireland, which has enjoyed a record two years, attracting almost 300 multinational projects.“Planning and building is a two-year cycle so we really need prime office space building to start now,” says Barry O’Leary, IDA Ireland chief executive. “Office space is one of the benchmarks foreign investors use when looking at different locations to invest.”IDA Ireland has begun talks with the National Asset Management Agency, Ireland’s state-owned bad bank, which controls properties and land in Dublin, in an effort to kick-start activity.And a growing number of international property investors have begun to bet that the worst of Ireland’s economic crisis is finally over.Private equity groups Kennedy Wilson, Blackstone, Lone Star and Apollo have been active in the market, buying flagship properties and portfolios of property loans. Several high net worth individuals, including Russia’s richest woman, Elana Baturina, and US media mogul John Malone, have bought top end hotels in Dublin.“A lot of these international buyers bring a significant amount of equity [to deals],” says Mr Luddy from CBRE. “There has been a significant shift away from debt funded investment. Therefore they are a more stable investment,” he says.US private equity firm Kennedy Wilson is probably the biggest single investor to enter the Irish market since the crash. It has spent €600m on individual properties – office and residential blocks – and Irish loan portfolios.“What drove Kennedy Wilson was a fundamental belief that the Irish economy would recover. And from where we were in mid-2011 that has begun to look more likely,” says Peter Collins, managing director at Kennedy Wilson Europe.The Irish government has also helped stimulate the market by cutting stamp duty, providing relief on capital gains tax and changing the law to enable real estate investment trusts (Reits) to operate.However, the recovery is focused very much on Dublin – many provincial locations are still suffering from a big overhang in vacant housing and retail developments.“We are not seeing any pick up in the regional cities, which is where a lot of the overbuilding took place in the boom,” says Mr Collins. “I think we would need to see an improvement in the underlying fundamentals [in those areas] before we would focus on them.”
40;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2013-10-02T15:47:20Z;Experts warn of crunch in regional office space as demand rises;;"Britain’s nascent economic recovery is spreading outwards from London to its regional cities, with data showing businesses in Manchester, Glasgow and Leeds are finding the confidence to expand.Office leasing activity in the main UK regional cities outside London is at its highest for five years, according to research from CBRE, the property adviser. In the first half of 2013, 1.6m sq ft of office space was let, driven by demand for larger premises.The renewed activity is also attracting commercial property investors, who are betting that regional cities will see a strong economic recovery in the coming years. As so little new office space has been developed outside London in the wake of the last property crash, industry experts are warning of a supply crunch in cities such as Birmingham, as rising demand meets a lack of new development, leading researchers to predict this will push up office rents.London’s commercial property market has been booming in recent years, driven by an influx of foreign investors seeking “safe haven” assets. By contrast, the investment and leasing markets in most of the rest of the country have remained flat – until recently.“A large number of British cities outside London possess all the foundations to grow solidly in the coming years,” Savvas Savouri, chief economist at Toscafund. Last week, the hedge fund announced that it is planning to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in commercial property in cities such as Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield it believes are undervalued.“Some regional markets now look cheap,” said Adrian McStay, national managing director at CBRE, citing rising business confidence as a key factor in changing investor sentiment. “[Commercial property] prices are still low – they crashed by around 40 per cent in 2008 and have flatlined since then.”Keen investor interest is already being reflected in investment yields on prime regional office properties, which have dropped by 100 basis points since the start of this year, from 6.75 per cent to 5.75 per cent, according to data from BNP Paribas Real Estate.In most cities, renewed levels of activity from businesses and investors have not been matched by commercial property developers, however.Outside London, very little new office space has been developed in the past five years – except in the Thames corridor, which is strongly influenced by the London market.“Vacancy rates are trending downwards due to a lack of development, and there is a real shortage of space in some cities,” said Darren Yates, a partner at agency Knight Frank.Manchester is the only UK city to have more than 200,000 sq ft of new speculative space – in other words, without a pre-arranged tenant – under construction. While the banks have had the confidence to back property developers in Manchester, it is proving difficult in other cities.Saddled with a glut of ageing poor-quality office space, Birmingham has the highest vacancy rate of all the major cities, at 16 per cent, according to figures from Jones Lang LaSalle, with most of this made up of older buildings.“Very little is coming through the regional development pipeline in the foreseeable future,” Mr Yates added.Two new office developments that started recently in Bristol and Glasgow will be the first new supply of high-quality space outside the Thames corridor or Manchester since 2007, according to CBRE; neither is due for completion until next year. A further four schemes are in the pipeline for the following year, in Glasgow and Bristol. “It is very rare to see buildings of more than 150,000 to 200,000 sq ft being developed, so even one of those coming through [per city] would not remove the problem of the shortage,” Mr McStay said.GlasgowThough hard hit by the UK’s long downturn and still wrestling with the legacy of post-industrial decline, Scotland’s western city of Glasgow has emerged as a strong candidate to attract property investors spilling out of the London market, writes Mure Dickie.Finance businesses have largely filled the almost 2m sq ft of Grade A offices completed since 2001 in Glasgow’s central International Financial Services District, and officials have been warning of a growing shortage of high-quality space.Developments set for completion in 2015 include a £60m office building being built on West Regent Street by London-based Mountgrange and M&G Real Estate, at 143,000 sq ft one of the largest such schemes outside London.A five-year near-hiatus in construction combined with conversion of some existing stock into hotels, apartments and shops means city centre office space is actually declining, says Stewart Forsyth, Mountgrange development director.Even tighter office supply in nearby Edinburgh – which suffers a dearth of easily developable city centre sites – could help boost demand in Glasgow further.MidlandsBirmingham’s 16 per cent office vacancy rate – the highest of all regional UK cities – disguises signs of recovery in the market. Paul Bassi, chief executive of REI, an Aim-listed property investment company based in Birmingham, says there has been significant office uptake in recent months, with landlords no longer dependent on rent-free periods and other incentives to attract tenants, writes John Murray Brown.Deutsche Bank is negotiating additional space in Brindleyplace where it plans to open a trading floor – in addition to its existing back office operations in the city.However, apart from the Snow Hill development by Ireland-based Ballymore, there is little large-scale office building work under way. Argent, the UK developer, is joining forces with the city government to redevelop the Paradise Circus site as a financial services enterprise zone. But work on the first office building will only start in late 2015.LeedsThe Leeds office market has been a star property performer over the past year, says Simon Bedford, head of the north for Drivers Jonas Deloitte, the consultancy, writes Andrew Bounds.“Leeds has done very well. There is strong demand from the financial, professional and legal sectors,” he said.Yorkshire Building Society has announced plans to move some staff from Bradford, while KPMG is building a new 60,000 sq ft office near the railway station.Developments under wraps since 2008 are starting again. MEPC’s Wellington Place scheme has begun its first new building in five years and is preparing for 2015-16 when several prominent Leeds occupiers reach the end of their current leases, and are expected to move. “We will be building in 2014 to meet demand,” said Rick de Blaby, chief executive.ManchesterMichael Magrane, manager of the Midland Hotel, can measure the health of Manchester’s office market by his conference room bookings. “In 2008 they disappeared overnight,” he says. “Companies had spare rooms they could use for meetings. Now as they grow again, they are coming back to the hotel,” writes Andrew Bounds.The city has seen a few piecemeal developments and one big speculative scheme – St Peters Square, anchored by KPMG.Developer Allied London is about to start a second speculative building aimed at the technology sector at its Spinningfields development, funded by overseas institutional investors. Mike Ingall, chief executive of Allied London, said it was in negotiations with two anchor tenants for a further office scheme."
41;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2013-08-14T15:48:43Z;Two-speed UK student housing market developing;;As A-level students pick up their exam results on Thursday and discover which university town they will be heading to in a few weeks’ time, another group of individuals is also waiting anxiously for news of their future accommodation.Not the parents who will be footing the rent bills, but investors in a £1bn fund backing new student housing, which has been suspended since early July due to “uncertainty” in the UK market.Last month, the Brandeaux Student Accommodation fund stopped accepting new subscriptions or redemption requests, citing an “overhang” of student housing in the market” and “a great deal of uncertainty” caused by the failure of Opal Property Group.Opal had a property portfolio consisting of approximately 20,000 student rooms across 16 cities – 11 per cent of the total estimated by property consultants CBRE – but fell into administration in March after failing to refinance its debt.As a result, investors’ money remains trapped in the Brandeaux fund while the managers attempt to generate liquidity by selling properties.For those who enjoyed robust returns from the booming UK student housing sector in recent years, the news was as unexpected as a D grade at A-level.Only last year, student accommodation was outperforming other UK property assets, returning almost 12 per cent according to the IPD index. Shares in Unite Group, the UK’s largest student housing provider, have risen almost tenfold since 2009.Investment in the sector reached a record £2.7bn in 2012, more than twice the 2011 figure, CBRE reports.Now, the question is whether oversupply will become a wider problem and potentially depress the sector’s future returns.Some in the industry dispute Brandeaux’s claims of a student property overhang. Mark Sennett, managing director of Dartmoor Capital Management, property investment advisers, says the supply estimates include developments that have been approved but may not now be completed.Marcus Roberts, head of student investment at Savills, notes that interest in the sale of Opal’s former properties has been strong, suggesting the market is not oversupplied. For the 2013/14 academic year, Knight Frank has forecast average annual returns of 9.2 per cent.Such optimism is being fuelled by buoyant student numbers. In the past 20 years, the UK student population has roughly doubled, but there has not been a corresponding increase in the provision of dedicated housing.Even amid concerns about increased tuition fees and restrictions on international student visas, applications to UK universities are holding up. According to the latest Ucas data, the number of applicants for full-time undergraduate courses starting in 2013 is 3 per cent higher than last year. Applications from outside the EU are 6 per cent higher.The third tallest building in Leeds, one of the UK’s largest cities, is not home to a bank, but to students. However, even at 25-storeys and 90m high, the Opal 3 tower is not the highest-altitude student accommodation in the city – that honour lies with Unite’s neighbouring Sky Plaza.Opal Property Group’s flagship property was purpose-built to meet growing demand in a city that the Higher Education Statistics Agency says is home to more than 53,000 full-time students.Today, though, Opal 3 is up for sale alongside the now-defunct company’s other student halls.Read moreIn addition, student housing preferences are changing, claims James Pullan, head of student property at Knight Frank. “The majority, particularly international students, want to live in purpose-built accommodation,” he says, adding that traditional student digs are often outdated and poorly located.This demand is already filling new developments, with most private operators of purpose-built halls of residence reporting occupancy of 99 per cent or more for 2011/12, according to CBRE.Almost half of these sought after developments have been in London, however. Between 2009 and 2012, CBRE estimates that the capital accounted for 48 per cent of £5bn invested in new and existing student properties.Outside of London, the supply-demand equation is less clear.Unite, which has 42,000 rooms across 23 cities and has been investing in London through a joint venture with Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, sees further opportunities in the regions. It announced a student housing project in Huddersfield in May.“Land prices are low outside of London,” argues Paul Harris, a director at Unite, “[and] we’re looking for opportunities in places where the fundamentals [low existing supply and growing demand] are strong.”But opinion is divided as to whether regional university towns and cities can accommodate further investment.“There is a saturation of certain city markets, but not oversupply,” claims Mr Roberts. “Will all the beds in the pipeline ultimately be built? Probably not.”Others are more worried, though. Not only have cities such as Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle added thousands of student rooms in recent years but they also have a “big pipeline” of projects, according to Sarah Jones, associate director at property services group DTZ. “To develop successfully in these very mature markets, product and pricing has to be spot on,” she warns.Jo Winchester, head of student housing advisory at CBRE, also advocates caution over regional developments. “There is still headroom [in these cities] but location becomes paramount.” New projects must also beat existing stock on quality, she points out.Strong competition and low margins have already dissuaded GCP Student Living, the UK’s first student housing Real Estate Investment Trust, from expanding to red-brick university cities. “Outside of London, companies need to be lot more careful,” advises James Carswell, an analyst at Peel HuntTom Ward, a partner in GCP, shares his high academic standards. “If we were to look outside of London, supply-constrained cities such as Oxford and Cambridge are strong candidates,” he says.
42;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2013-06-23T03:57:11Z;Brookfield overtakes CBRE as top real estate manager;Toronto-based company becomes the world’s biggest real estate fund manager;Los Angeles-based CBRE Global Investors has lost its position as the world’s largest real estate fund manager.Data from Inrev, the European Association for Investors in Non-listed Real Estate Vehicles, and Anrev, its Asian peer, indicate CBRE’s assets under management slipped from €72.7bn to €69.6bn during 2012. This allowed the New York-listed group to be leapfrogged by Brookfield Asset Management, a Toronto-based alternatives house, which saw its assets jump by €18bn to €83bn.The duo edged out Blackstone Group, with assets of €67bn, UBS Global Asset Management (€49bn) and Axa Real Estate (€45.3bn).Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, formerly known as Rreef Real Estate, also fell, slipping from fifth to eighth in the rankings as its assets declined from €44.4bn to €40.6bn.Brookfield’s ascent coincides with improving investor sentiment towards the sector, with the volume of capital raised by non-listed European real estate funds rising to €11.5bn during 2012, the highest figure since 2008, although still well below 2007’s pre-crisis peak of €29.6bn.This partial rebound occurred despite deteriorating performance, with the average fund producing a total return of minus 0.6 per cent in 2012, compared with a gain of 3.6 per cent in 2011.Casper Hesp, director of research and market information at Inrev, described the inflows as “encouraging”, adding: “They indicate that investors believe the market has reached its lowest point and are committing capital once again.”A further €9.5bn was raised for separate accounts and €4bn for joint ventures and club deals. About 37 per cent of the total was invested in higher-risk “opportunity” or “valued added” funds, rather then lower-risk “core” vehicles, up from just 14 per cent in 2011.“Driven by the desire for better yields than are currently available in the oversubscribed core market, investors appear to be searching for options further up the risk curve,” added Mr Hesp.Three-quarters of all money raised for single-country funds was directed towards Germany, the UK and the Nordic countries, suggesting southern Europe remains out of favour.Pension funds were the biggest investors across all product types, with three-quarters of money for closed end funds coming from European investors.

The deal gives Oxford Properties an initial rental yield of 5.3 per cent – slightly above the average for the City of London.It represents the latest in string of high-profile London office building transactions since the start of the year – in sharp contrast to the insipid flow of deals that characterised the property market during 2012.Most of the new investment in the Square Mile has come from asset-hungry foreign investors, who now own more than half of all City of London property by value.The 246,000 sq ft headquarters of the London Stock Exchange (LSE), overlooked by St Paul’s Cathedral, was designed by Eric Parry Architects and Sheppard Robson and completed 10 years ago. The LSE has a lease on the building until the end of 2028.Paul Brundage, vice-president at Oxford Properties Europe, said: “The strength of LSE’s lease covenant will deliver secure risk adjusted returns in line with our investment objectives.” Oxford already owns the neighbouring building, St Martins Court.Oxford Properties was advised by CBRE, while Mitsubishi was advised by Cushman & Wakefield.
44;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2013-04-12T17:31:18Z;The name game;Bangkok’s branded residences are drawing overseas buyers;Bangkok has a remarkable ability to suffer adversity yet barely break stride. Just three years ago, bodies lay in the streets of the Thai capital’s choicest neighbourhoods after the showdown between troops and thousands of Red Shirt anti-government protesters who had turned the area into a makeshift camp, paralysing the business district for months.Yet, when the chaos was cleared, Krung Thep – Bangkok’s Thai name, meaning City of Angels – kept on soaring. The Thai economy powered through the global downturn. Likewise, Bangkok’s go-go property market hardly skipped a beat. According to Surachet Kongcheep, senior manager of research at Colliers, the only thing slowing condominium developments – a sector dominated by Thai buyers – is a shortage of construction labour.There was one sector of the market that faltered during the slowdown, however: interest from overseas buyers. According to CBRE, in 2008 overseas buyers made up 40 per cent of the high-end sector, and this slumped to 15 per cent in 2011. But with Bangkok’s prime and super-prime property markets picking up in the past six months, it looks like overseas investors are starting to return. Last year, foreign ownership rose from 15 to 22 per cent, with the increase coming mainly in the second half.A key trend that has given wealthy buyers the confidence to dip their toes back in the water has been the arrival of branded property linked to global hospitality chains, such as St Regis, Banyan Tree, Sukhothai, Ritz-Carlton and Waldorf Astoria – names they assess will serve as a guarantor of the highest quality.Typically, large condominiums in the best parts of Bangkok have a five-star hotel on site managing common areas and ensuring high standards, something that cannot be said of all Bangkok’s high-end properties. The dozen or so developments sit on prime land in the central business district, encompassing Rajadamri, Central Lumpini, and Sathorn-Silom.“Branding alone is not a recipe for success,” says Robert Collins, chief executive of Savills Thailand. “Location is crucial, along with accessibility and good views. We classify Rajadamri Road like Knightsbridge in London or Orchard Road in Singapore. Carrying the imprimatur of an über-brand guarantees standards in the properties will not slip, as that would damage hard-won international reputations.”The confidence hotel brands can inspire is important for international buyers. About 70 per cent of buyers from overseas now hail from Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai and Russia, according to Knight Frank. Buyers from India, the Middle East, Australia, Taiwan and South Korea make up about 10 per cent, with a tiny proportion from Europe and US because of persisting currency weaknesses.Prices in Bangkok are a fraction of those in Hong Kong and Singapore, where the imposition of special stamp duties to curb speculation has driven buyers to the Thai capital, which is still free of such taxes. Top-end properties in Bangkok averaged £3,198 per sq m, according to CBRE, while Singapore reached £16,445 per sq m, and Hong Kong £21,200 per sq m.“The crackdown in other markets and the feeling that Bangkok has been a little in the shadows in the past four or five years, while the economy and property have done well, has fuelled overseas buyers’ interest,” says James Pitchon, executive director of CBRE Thailand.Average property prices in Bangkok increased 9.4 per cent last year and Risinee Sarikaputra, associate director of research at Knight Frank Thailand, thinks the rises could continue: “In these areas of downtown Bangkok there’s a shortage of land for premium developments, which will inevitably drive up prices.”The potential for capital gains, and rental yields of about 6 per cent, is proving alluring. Buyers are often investors looking for better returns than banks offer but who also travel to Bangkok often and want a property that offers all the benefits of a five-star hotel, including a gym, spa, pool, restaurants, housekeeping and concierge services. The St Regis Residences on Rajadamri Road, with views over the Royal Bangkok Sports Club’s horseracing track and golf course, tick all the boxes. The development has a dedicated entrance to Bangkok’s Skytrain and is near shopping malls.One apartment on sale there is a 439 sq m four-bedroom 30-year leasehold on floor 33 for Bt107m ($3.7m). The facilities and swimming pool for the residences are separate from the hotel’s, and have their own elevators.Proximity to the commercial district is vital for buyers who travel to Bangkok on business. Thailand is likely to become a more important economic hub as the creation of the Asean Economic Community, which aims for economic integration of the 10-country southeast Asian grouping through a single market, approaches in 2015.For wealthy buyers who demand the best, good design is crucial. The Ritz-Carlton Residences, with accompanying boutique hotel, was designed by German Ole Scheeren while he was with Rem Koolhaas’ Office for Metropolitan Architecture. The interiors of the 194 condominiums were conceived by London-based designer David Collins.The Sukhothai Residences in the compound of the Sukhothai Bangkok Hotel was completed late last year.

According to the Local Data Company, a retail information provider, the recent spate of administrations means thousands more shops could close this year, leaving one store in six empty on the high streets.There are more than 35,500 empty shops and a national vacancy rate of 14.2 per cent in town centres. But with the recent administrations, including Jessops, the photographic retailer, entertainment chains HMV and Blockbuster and young fashion brand Republic, almost one-fifth of all British stores could be empty.Professional services firm PwC and the Local Data Company say retailers with six stores or more across the UK are closing a net – openings less closures – 28 a day and the situation could get worse. The figure for the past three months represents a significant acceleration from the average net 20 a day that shut in 2012.“The bubble has burst,” says Matthew Hopkinson, director of the Local Data Company.The difficulties are being driven by a toxic combination of weak consumer confidence and the inexorable march of the internet. Verdict, the retail research group, forecasts that this year £1 in every £8 will be spent online, about the same amount that is spent in Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer.According to Malcolm Dalgleish, chairman of European retail at property consultancy CBRE, the market has undergone seismic change over the past 40 years.In 1971, half the population shopped for non-food items in about 200 locations. Today, half goes shopping for similar goods in about 90.Consequently, the top 70 to 90 locations are where retailers are already represented or want to open new stores.“In those centres, there is still a tremendous demand for the right shop and size of unit,” he says. Then there are another 100 centres “where retailers are prepared to go as long as they are getting the right deal”.When it comes to the next 200 or so centres, the picture becomes more difficult. Mr Dalgleish notes that rents have come down significantly, and so it is still possible to let units, although not necessarily to high street retailers.James Brown, head of European consulting and research at Jones Lang LaSalle, says the big international brands are scrutinising their existing portfolios and where they want to trade from.With online platforms demanding more and more capital, and competition from retail centres outside of the UK, they are being forced to make tough choices about where to locate their stores.“Retailers are prioritising the locations that are lower risk, and provide the best return on investment. The big international brands in particular are trading from fewer stores in stronger locations, supplemented by online distribution in order to reach the majority of the population,” he says.Alan Patterson, head of research at Axa Real Estate, says there is a growing gap between locations that attract affluent shoppers and the rest of the market. “We have an increasing divergence between the higher quality stock and the remainder of the properties, whether that is between retail centres or within high streets. It’s a polarisation between the best and the rest,” he says.But while the picture may appear grim, there are some glimmers of light. “We are through the darkest moment,” says Mr Dalgleish “There is a lot of interest from retailers in the right locations in the top 70 towns.”He says there has been little development activity through the downturn, as developers shelved or postponed projects amid the financial crisis. “This means that the retailers that are doing well, and that want to take space, are going to have to bid aggressively for it.”Mr Brown says landlords are recognising that they must provide locations that are capable of competing with the internet. This means concentrating on convenience, stores selling day-to-day items that are not typically purchased onlineAlternatively, landlords and developers are merging shopping and entertainment, creating environments that “go beyond retail, they go beyond the physical transaction process and actually try to provide something that is more fulfilling”.“You can identify pockets of resilience throughout the UK, from top to bottom, centres that are outperforming because they provide that right mix of either convenience or retail and entertainment.”Some analysts and property executives believe that the death of the high street has been exaggerated. “People talk about the high street being dead. Shopping is still the major leisure activity in this country,” says Mr Dalgleish.David Lockhart, chief executive of NewRiver Retail, a real estate investment trust, says restructuring is taking place in the middle of towns with shopping centres providing the main retail offering, and drawing retailers closer to them, especially where the edge of town high street units do not meet modern shopping requirements. “It is wrong to talk about the blanket demise of the high street,” he says. “Town centre retailing is very much alive and kicking.”

That process will be completed in the next few days, according to people familiar with the matter.The refinancing of the sprawling complex, whose tenants include Pepsi, Swarovski, QVC and Tullow Oil, has been closely followed by the property market as a sign of lending appetite among mainstream banks.The deal, which will extend the debt on Chiswick Park to 2019, is being viewed by Blackstone as part of “readying the site for a sale”, one person close to the matter said.The refinancing has been organised by Eastdil Secured, while CBRE have been mandated to find a buyer for the project.Blackstone first put the site up for sale late last year. It attracted interest from a number of sovereign wealth funds, including CIC, China’s state-backed fund.If the asking price is met, the sale of Chiswick Park would also be a fillip to Blackstone. The private equity group bought the property from a consortium of Aberdeen Asset Management, Schroders and Stanhope at the start of 2011 for £480m.Blackstone announced last month that it was starting construction of the final phase of Chiswick Park. The complex is 99 per cent leased, with annual rents being arranged at slightly more than £45 per sq ft.Overseas investor interest in the London office market has risen strongly in the past 18 months. The combination of stable yields and the kudos of owning property in the European financial centre have kept the prices buoyant in spite of the problems in the eurozone.Blackstone and its advisers declined to comment on the process.
47;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2013-02-07T23:44:10Z;CBRE sees no rush to sell properties;;The head of CBRE, the world’s largest manager of property funds, has warned that the expected wave of distressed sales, for which tens of billions of dollars have been raised, will not materialise.In an interview with the Financial Times, Bob Sulentic, chief executive of CBRE, said that “buying distressed real estate is going to be much more competitive than people had predicted”.“There was a belief that there would be a flood of assets coming to market at rock-bottom prices, but it is never going to happen. Sellers of distressed real estate have learnt to be much smarter about how and when they trade and a lot more will be held through the cycle,” he added.The prediction from Mr Sulentic, whose company has $92bn of property under management, is an ominous one for the scores of private equity funds in the US and Europe that have built financial firepower in anticipation of a sell-off in real estate by financially constrained landlords.Some of Europe’s largest banks, including Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and Commerzbank, have been slow in unwinding their multibillion-euro loan books. Government-controlled landlords, such as Ireland’s National Asset Management Agency, have also held back from rushing into selling off large parts of their portfolios.The lower than expected level of distressed property sales has already put pressure on real estate private equity firms, particularly those focused on Europe. Capital raised by real estate funds focused on western Europe fell by 55 per cent during 2012, to $6.9bn from $15.2bn a year earlier, according to data published this week by PERE, the private equity research group.Mr Sulentic also said the commercial property market was increasingly drawing in large, institutional investors, including pension and sovereign wealth funds, and high net worth individuals who were tiring of the low yields on offer in the global bond markets.“Investors are more and more accepting real estate as a long-term home because it is hard to get yield elsewhere. We are seeing more competition for good quality assets,” he added.CBRE has posted its highest ever annual revenue – $6.5bn for the year, up 10 per cent on 2011. The group delivered earnings per share of $0.97 for the period, up 32 per cent on a year earlier. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 14 per cent from a year earlier to $918.4m.The better than expected performance was driven by a strong finish to the year for CBRE’s estate agency business as US property investors moved to complete transactions ahead of the introduction of President Barack Obama’s increased capital gains tax charges this year.Shares in CBRE rose 10 per cent on Thursday morning to $24.05.
48;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2013-01-24T02:45:17Z;London office deals at pre-crisis levels;;"Surging international demand for central London offices helped draw £14bn of investment into the capital’s commercial property market during 2012, marking a return to pre-financial crisis levels of activity.The total, two-thirds from foreign buyers, made spending in 2012 the third-highest level on record, after 2006 and 2007, and 50 per cent up on the amount invested during 2011, according to research for CBRE, the property consultancy.London has become the destination of choice for commercial property investors from Asia, the Middle East and the US. The combination of stable yields and transparent ownership has also attracted investment from Europe, where real estate values have waned under the uncertainty created by the eurozone crisis.The City of London accounted for the bulk of investments, with buyers from Korea, Malaysia, China and the Middle East all closing deals worth over £100m during the year. The Square Mile accounted for £7.2bn of the total invested, more than double the £3.5bn spent in 2011.The so-called Midtown area, the narrow office district between Holborn to Kings Cross, enjoyed a similarly strong year, attracting £1.6bn – its highest level since 2005. The West End accounted for £4.4bn of the total.Michael Edwards, a director at CBRE’s central London capital markets division, said the trend of overseas investors driving activity in London would probably continue this year.“If you consider the prevalence of high levels of debt at the top of the market, compared with more limited availability last year, this actually means that 2012 arguably saw a greater investment of equity in central London than ever before,” he added.Among the largest deals last year were Brookfield’s £518m purchase of six offices from Hammerson, the listed UK property company; Blackstone’s £340m deal to acquire the Devonshire Square office complex; and the £282.5m purchase of Tower 42 by South African billionaire Nathan Kirsh. The Malaysian state pension fund, Permodalan Nasional Berhad, was the largest single spender, investing £680m to buy two office blocks in the City.Tony McCurley of GM Real Estate, an agency specialising in central London, said: “London is seen as offering long secure income streams, political stability and it’s a transparent, tax-efficient mature market. It is also in vogue as many of these investors were educated here or are educating their children here.”The eurozone crisis and the shrinking of financial services companies meant the take-up of new office space fell slightly during the year, from a long-run average of almost 12m sq ft to 9.8m sq ft.Demand for property in London has soared during the past two years, decoupling the real estate market in the capital from that of the rest of the UK."
49;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2013-01-19T00:01:29Z;Croydon illustrates future for UK retail;;Entering the Whitgift shopping centre in Croydon is not unlike staring at one of MC Escher’s drawings of impossible constructions.An ill-arranged concourse of bodybuilding shops, milkshake bars and discount retailers winds through multi-exit atriums, and into shadowy dead ends.To confuse things further, the entire place appears to be in the last throes of a closing down sale. Windows brim with florid price-cut banners. Even the layout of the escalators seems at odds with logic – puncturing the mall’s three tiers at random intervals.But on Thursday, two of the UK’s largest retail property landlords, Westfield and Hammerson, ann­ounced a plan to give the Whitgift a £1bn facelift– which, when completed, will make it Europe’s largest mall.The project is the biggest bet to date on a structural change in the way Britons shop: eschewing the eclecticism of the high street, for the careful conformity of the mall.And it comes at a more poignant moment for UK retail, with high-street stalwarts, HMV, Jessops and Blockbuster all collapsing into administration in the past few days.“High streets just can’t compete realistically any more,” says Jonathan De Mello, head of retail consultancy at CBRE, the property services group.Mr De Mello says retailers will always favour the tailor-made shop-space on offer in malls, over the inflexible lots on the high street, which are mostly converted houses.“On top of that, a single owner can organise a mall to have everything shoppers want,” he adds. “In contrast, the multi-ownership of most high streets mean everyone rents to the highest bidder. The upshot is that you get a lot of phone shops and a terrible retailer mix.”However, the rise of shopping malls in the UK is a relatively recent trend.Westfield’s arrival was a turning point. The Australian developer built and opened the UK’s two largest malls during the depths of the financial crisis.International investment in UK malls, such as the purchase of a 50 per cent stake in Sheffield’s £1.5bn Meadowhall by Norway’s oil wealth fund, has also demonstrated a different dynamic to that of the wider retail property sector.The extent to which retailers favour malls is illustrated by vacancy rates. Data from the CBRE and the Local Data Company, show the average UK high street has a vacancy rate of 17 per cent. In large malls, it is just 1-2 per cent.Nevertheless, while the direction of travel would suggest good times ahead for landlords that can invest in large, edge of town malls, the impact can be devastating to already fragile high streets.Ealing, in west London, offers an illustration of the effect on the high street when one of these retail behemoths open up nearby.On Friday, with snow falling thickly across London, shoppers were hurrying along the borough’s main high street – ironically named The Mall – which is now peppered with pound shops and the occasional boarded-up premises.Shopkeepers and locals who spoke to the FT were in no doubt that they had been hit hard by the opening of Westfield’s White City mall, which opened in 2008 just a few miles east.“I’ve really noticed it,” said Ben Farah, who has run his Mr Ben barber shop on the Mall, since 2001.“I’m down around 25 per cent. We speak to customers – especially wealthy ones – who won’t shop here any more.”He used to own three shops in Ealing. “Now I’m down to one,” he said.Mohammad Mohammad-Khani, a 52-year-old cobbler who had worked in the town for 15 years, said the streams of people that used to walk past his window on Saturday mornings were no longer there.“If you’re in Acton [halfway between Ealing and Westfield] would you go to Ealing or Westfield? Even my own family says ‘Let’s go to Westfield’.”Enjoying a lunch with friends at The Sir Michael Balcon pub, Sheila Haddon, a resident since 1984, said the town centre had once enjoyed a thriving, upmarket reputation, but many high-end shops had closed or moved out in recent years. “My goodness, pound shops in Ealing?” she quipped.One of her companions, who declined to be named, said Westfield held a strong appeal for the younger generation. “My son will always go to Westfield. It’s like promenading in the old days – they go for the talent as well.”At Ealing Broadway Shopping, the local mall now dwarfed by its rival down the road, a staff ­member in the Perfume Warehouse shop said takings were down 50 per cent since Westfield opened.“People’s first priority is Westfield,” he said. “It’s a 21st century shopping planet. You can’t beat that.”
50;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-12-23T21:48:55Z;Chinese vie to buy £800m London offices;;China’s sovereign wealth fund is among a trio of Asian investors vying to buy an £800m London office campus from Blackstone, the US private equity firm, in what would be the UK’s highest value property deal since the start of the financial crisis.China Investment Corporation and government-backed funds from Korea and Malaysia have tabled bids for Chiswick Park, Blackstone’s 1.1m sq ft development, according to people familiar with the process.The sovereign wealth interest in the property underlines the growing role international investors are playing in London commercial real estate. Buyers from Asia, the Middle East and North America have ploughed billions of pounds into the offices, shops and hotels in the UK capital.If the asking price is met, the sale of Chiswick Park would also be a fillip to Blackstone. The private equity group bought the property from a consortium of Aberdeen Asset Management, Schroders and Stanhope at the start of 2011 for £480m.A person with knowledge of the situation said CIC was working with a third party investor.The $410bn fund acquired Deutsche Bank’s £245m City of London headquarters in November – Beijing’s first direct property investment in the UK– in partnership with Invesco, the asset manager. CIC owns a 9.6 per cent stake in Blackstone, having invested $3bn into the private equity group before its initial public offering in 2007.The Korean and Malaysian bids are both understood to involve consortiums of sovereign wealth and pension funds from the respective countries.Chiswick Park is also rumoured to have attracted interest from a number of Canadian pension funds and UK institutional property investors. However, it is unclear whether they have yet tabled formal bids.Blackstone and its advisers, CBRE, declined to discuss the process.Overseas investor interest in the London office market has risen strongly in the past 18 months. The combination of stable yields and the kudos of owning property in the European financial centre have kept the prices buoyant in spite of the problems in the eurozone.Earlier this week, the government of Azerbaijan confirmed it was buying a £180m office block in St James Street.Deal flow in the UK capital has been so high that the city now accounts for three-quarters of the country’s entire commercial property market by value, according to recent research from CBRE. Asian investors have made up the largest foreign buyer group coming into London, accounting for 45 per cent of all deals by value in the City during 2012, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the property advisory group.
51;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-11-09T21:35:06Z;Richemont secures its place on Fifth Ave;Jim Shi considers the logic behind the Swiss company’s $380m acquisition of prime retail space inside the St Regis hotel;Richemont’s acquisition of a prime retail condominium inside the St Regis New York hotel for the tidy sum of $380m marked a significant step for the Swiss luxury-goods company in an arena so conspicuously dominated by LVMH Moët Hennessy and PPR.The company paid $15,100 per square feet for the 24,800 sq ft space – more than triple what the condo traded for in November 2009 when Starwood Hotels & Resorts sold it for $117m (it continues to own the hotel) to raise cash and reduce debt during the recession.Fully occupied by luxury retailers, including De Beers, Emilio Pucci and Bottega Veneta, it is understood that Richemont, eager to bring such nameplates as Piaget, Van Cleef & Arpels, Dunhill and Montblanc to the St Regis, intends to open one or more of its stores at the site when space becomes available (some tenants have seven years left on their leases).A catalyst for Richemont’s purchase of the retail condo could have come from Cartier, the star jewel in its portfolio, whose lease on its iconic Neo-Renaissance Fifth Avenue mansion recently came up for renewal with the Onassis Foundation, the landlord.“It had to have been a wake-up call for Cartier when it came time to renew at a fair market price,” says Robert Futterman, chairman and chief executive of RKF & Associates, a New York-based real estate brokerage, who was not involved with the transaction. “There had to be some pain involved.”Cartier eventually renewed.Joel Isaacs, president of Isaacs and Company, says an expanded Richemont presence will further solidify Fifth Avenue as a luxury shopping destination. “Richemont certainly has the wherewithal to make this kind of long-term investment and they have the brands to fill the space,” he says.David LaPierre, executive vice-president at real estate services company CBRE, believes Richemont evaluated the idea of leasing before deciding to cut through the red tape.Or maybe Richemont simply did not want an LVMH landlord? Mr LaPierre speculates that the transaction may have had an element of vanity as well. “Where you’re positioned is a critical element of how others will look at you and your brand,” he says.Big fashion companies, primarily foreign, have become more aggressive buyers in such prime shopping corridors as Fifth Avenue. And while Richemont’s acquisition made headlines because of the rarity of location and sheer frontage, not to mention being among the largest transactions for a retail condo on Fifth Avenue, it is part of a quiet trend.On East 57th Street, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co, Chanel and Burberry all own the buildings in which their respective flagships are housed. Gucci owns 685 Fifth Avenue, which had been home to its Manhattan flagship and still houses its corporate offices. In 2011, Inditex of Spain paid $324m for 39,000 sq ft of street-level space at 666 Fifth Avenue to house its largest Zara in the US.Gene Spiegelman, brokerage executive vice- president at Cushman Wakefield, believes Richemont’s acquisition was as much a play on capital as it was on retail. “If you look at the Inditex deal, there is a clear move to redeploy capital from western Europe into the US,” he says. “A Fifth Avenue asset is a perfect Triple-A location to deploy that capital.”It is no secret that Richemont has always wanted to own its own retail block in Manhattan. It owned 20 years ago the entire street level retail condo on Madison Avenue from 69th to 70th Streets, in the former Westbury Hotel. It now occupies just the two prime corner spots, operating units for Cartier and Chloé.It is not unusual to cluster. Omega and Breguet, both Swatch Group brands, sit side by side at 711 Fifth Avenue while Richemont brands IWC, Dunhill and Panerai leased stores on Madison Avenue in the 1950s. “It creates synergy as brands support one another and bring customers who may cross shop,” says Robin Abrams, Lansco Corporation executive vice-president. “It’s about controlling their destiny.”In a field dominated by supersized flagships, the landmark St Regis, allowing a prospective tenant to create miniature jewel-box stores, is ideal for Richemont’s watch brands. There appear to be few downsides. Richemont could use the space for its brands or rent it out at $2,500 to $3,000 a sq ft.Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate, says it is unusual to see such a sizeable acquisition at this ultra-luxury level, but adds: “This is the time to shine and let the world know about Richemont and its many brands.”“When you get a price tag at that level, it’s like you’re at the casino,” says Mr LaPierre.“Fifth Avenue is the one street that has always retained its value,” concludes Ms Consolo. “Good times, bad times, all times.”
52;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-10-17T20:29:08Z;Foreign money seeks London property;;The flow of foreign money seeking a home in London’s commercial property market means the capital now accounts for a third of total European investment transactions, new figures reveal.Investors have spent almost £30bn buying UK offices, shopping centres and distribution warehouses in 2012, according to data from CBRE, the property services group.The extent of London’s dominance is shown by the capital accounting for roughly three-quarters of UK transactions by value, more than the total for any other European country.The £7.3bn of deals recorded in London in the three months to the end of October represented almost a third of all transactions across the continent, CBRE said, as more foreign investors regard the capital as a haven for their cash.This surge of activity means that London deals struck so far in 2012 are already 15 per cent ahead of the total transacted for the whole of last year. Property experts argue this means it more logical to compare London with other capital markets, rather than other global real estate markets.“Investors are searching for an alternative to the traditional bond market and London real estate is an attractive and viable proposition,” said Matthew Richards, director of international capital at Jones Lang LaSalle, the property services group.Investment yields of about 5 per cent compared attractively with the bond market, and London’s relatively high levels of liquidity made the capital “a magnet for international investors”, he added.Buyers from across the globe have poured billions of pounds into London during the financial crisis in the hope of finding a secure, long-term investment. The type of deals, typically large office buildings with long leases, have reflected this appetite for stable returns rather than capital appreciation.Jonathan Hull, head of European capital markets at CBRE, said: “International buyers have been dominant over the last twelve months and it is fair to say that they are making the market for major central London offices. What clearly shows through is the focus of investors on prime property and risk avoidance”.However, traditional investors from continental Europe, the US and the Middle East are being pushed hard by a deal-hungry new entrant: Malaysia.The southeast Asian country has been behind so many high value transactions in the City of London and West End during 2012, Jones Lang LaSalle estimates it accounts for more than 10 per cent of the market this year.Malaysia’s largest pension fund, Employees Provident Fund, is also behind an ambitious £8bn plan to redevelop Battersea Power Station.The strength of investment demand in London is causing a rapid divergence between the capital and the rest of the country. Yields on prime commercial property in London are 4 per cent in the West End and 5 per cent in the City, compared with 6.2 per cent for the rest of the UK.Outside London, the market has been propped up by a handful of international investors.The largest regional UK deal during the third quarter was Norges acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in Meadowhall, the £1.5bn Sheffield shopping centre. Other non-London deals this year, such as Blackstone’s £204m purchase of a portfolio of 17 logistics warehouses, might appear less glamorous, but have targeted properties with well financed tenants, such as supermarkets.However, without the same depth of international demand to underpin it, many investors shun the market outside of London as not being worth the risk.Malaysia may seem an unlikely origin for the piles of cash washing up in the London commercial property market, given its relatively modest size and the dominance of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese buyers in recent years, writes Jeremy Grant in Singapore.Following a string of City office deals to Malaysian investors, Jones Lang LaSalle, the property services group, forecasts that about 10 per cent of London’s 2012 property investment transactions could be driven by Malaysian purchasers.The country of 28m people is proving to be one of the few bright spots in the global economy, notching up gross domestic product growth of 5.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2012.This has been propelled by its commodity-rich economy – oil, gas and palm oil – and robust domestic demand fuelled by a growing middle class. By contrast neighbouring Singapore, which has greater vulnerability to the manufacturing cycle, is teetering on the brink of recession.But the real power driving Malaysian investors towards London property are its domestic pension funds, which are awash with cash. The country’s stock and bond markets are too small to absorb this, so the funds are hunting abroad for returns.Their firepower comes from Malaysia having one of the highest savings rates in the world, in part due to mandatory employee and employer pension contribution schemes that force workers and companies to make relatively high contributions.Malaysia’s domestic savings as a share of gross domestic product was 38.7 per cent last year, compared with 52 per cent for China and 30 per cent for Thailand, according to Moody’s, the rating agency.Employees Provident Fund, the country’s largest pension fund, is one of three investors in the Malaysian consortium planning the £8bn redevelopment of Battersea Power Station. Tabung Haji is another large fund that, aside from investing, also funds pilgrims to the annual hajj in Saudi Arabia.
53;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-09-23T17:49:26Z;Banks set to shed €20bn property loans;;Europe’s banks are on track to dispose of €20bn worth of loans backed by offices, shops and hotels this year as lenders across the continent race to reduce exposure to the volatile real estate sector ahead of tough regulatory changes.Banks, including Lloyds, Santander and the Bundesbank, have already sold portfolios worth €7.5bn during 2012. Activity is set to accelerate though, with lenders working on offloading another €11bn before the end of the year, according to data from CBRE, the property services group.The run of deals shows the pressure on Europe’s banks to shrink the multibillion-euro debt pile amassed during the continent’s decade-long property boom.Regulatory changes will increase the amount of capital that lenders are required to hold against loans secured on commercial property, adding urgency to banks’ divestment plans.“It is not a question of if any more, but only a question of when to sell,” said Keith Breslauer, managing director of Patron Capital, the property-focused private equity fund.“Banks are doing everything in their power to hold out, as they want to wait for the market to improve and pin back there losses, but, ultimately, this stuff has to go,” he added.The need to deleverage has created a propensity among lenders for packaging up hundreds of loans, usually in various states of financial distress, into single deals. The 14 portfolio transactions this year have had an average face value of over €500m.This crude approach has pushed banks into taking significant losses, however.In August, Lloyds sold Kennedy Wilson, the US private equity group, and Deutsche Bank a €360m portfolio of non-performing Irish property loans at a discount of almost 90 per cent. Even portfolios of performing loans, such as the €2bn block Société Générale recently put up for sale, are not expected to fetch face value.Philip Cropper, managing director of real estate finance at CBRE, said the number of transactions was likely to increase, but warned the difficulty of assessing the value of some larger portfolios was already creating problems.“We have seen several transactions fall by the wayside during the year due to the complexities of being able to accurately value large and intricate loan portfolios, where there are sometimes large levels of distress,” he said.The problems of unpicking the true worth of large portfolios has already led many property investors to suggest banks will change tack, targeting instead smaller, single-asset sales.
54;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-08-24T15:59:22Z;Uncertainty is the only safe prediction;The financial world is preoccupied by how little it knows;"This is the summer of uncertainty. Chief executives, money managers, analysts and central bankers are preoccupied by how little they know. With more tumult in the eurozone ahead, the US racing towards a “fiscal cliff” and China slowing down, conventional wisdom in the financial world says the future is especially unknowable right now. If you have lousy returns, blame uncertainty.The uncertainty consensus is flattering: it implies our age is uniquely on edge. But it offers no useful insight. Investors who wait for resolution will be the investors who waited too long.Evidence of the financial world’s epistemic turn is not hard to find. Companies as varied as Cargill, the world’s biggest agricultural commodities trader; CBRE Group, the commercial real estate firm; Legg Mason, the fund manager; and Kraft Foods all lament economic uncertainty in their recent reporting. Often they say uncertainty is “heightened” to emphasise the current state of doubt.Some companies have tried to outline the duration or magnitude of uncertainty. Cooper, a tyre company, “expects uncertainty to persist in the global economic environment” through 2012, though it’s not so certain about uncertainty in 2013. The chief executive of earthmoving equipment maker Caterpillar this week told the Financial Times: “There’s never been a more unpredictable set of tea leaves than right now.” The meme has even crept into the Federal Reserve. Minutes of its monetary policy meeting released on Wednesday showed its members believed economic uncertainty had given consumers and investors pause. Some acknowledged “an unusually high level of uncertainty” had blurred their own outlooks.Empirical proof of uncertainty is lacking, however. The US consumer sentiment index is sharply higher than a year ago and retail sales have strengthened, hardly signs of Americans paralysed by anxiety.Companies are not hoarding money. Among non-financial companies in the S&P 500 stock index, growth in cash on corporate balance sheets has slowed below 10 per cent a year for the first time since late 2008 as companies boosted dividends or bought back stock, according to S&P Capital IQ.The S&P 500 this week hit the highest level since May 2008. The Vix index, which tracks market expectations of future stock volatility, has declined. Meanwhile, fixed-income investors are vacuuming up higher-risk junk corporate and municipal bonds.Gold jumped above $1,670 a troy ounce but the catalyst was the Fed signalling more stimulus, not uncertainty. And metals boosters are conflicted over the meaning of uncertainty. The World Gold Council industry group attributes a decline in gold demand in the second quarter “to the particularly challenging global economic climate and market uncertainty”. But a report from a leading issuer of gold-backed funds reads: “Precious Metals in Demand as Macro Uncertainty Soars”.There are doubtless plenty of risks to be unsure about. First is the future of the eurozone as wrangling begins anew over aid to Greece. Second is the US. If lawmakers allow tax rises and budget cuts to occur as scheduled on January 1 – the so-called “fiscal cliff” – the US could fall into recession. Third is the gathering slowdown in China.But these are, as former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld liked to say, the “known unknowns”. The risk of bad outcomes is presumably priced into assets.Of greater concern are risks no one has contemplated. But these concerns are true to every age, not just ours. Indeed, investors could have used a little more uncertainty in the past decade as they bought trashy mortgage-backed securities. Interesting fact: FT archives show 2,877 stories with the word “uncertainty” in 2005 before the subprime bubble burst. Less than nine months into 2012, the story count was 3,290. Which year will prove more critical for markets?The question cannot be answered. Uncertainty is the foundation of financial markets, the source of risk and opportunity. It is not an abnormality worth dwelling upon. As the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote in his book On Certainty: “Doubt gradually loses its sense.”gregory.meyer@ft.com"
55;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Investment in student accommodation doubles;;Investment in student accommodation more than doubled to £800m during the first six months of the year, underlining the international and domestic appetite for low-risk property assets.The spending surge in the sector, up from £375m for the same period a year earlier, comes as long-term investors, such as pension funds and insurers, move to meet the financing shortfall created by the slowdown in bank lending.Student housing is among a handful of niche property types viewed by investors as exceptionally low risk, according to a new report from CBRE, the property services group. The market suffers from chronic under-supply, while the level of accommodation under construction is not sufficient to meet expected demand from UK and foreign students.“There is no shortage of investor demand, but the market is hampered by a shortage of new high-quality development opportunities,” said Jo Winchester, head of student housing advisory at CBRE.Ms Winchester added that the lending market on student housing was focused on large-scale loans secured against well-located portfolios. “But debt remains restricted for new entrants, single property deals and projects outside of London”.The lack of student housing has forced many students into private rented accommodation – usually a more expensive alternative. The number of students in private rental property has risen by 155,000 since 2007, according to CBRE. Meanwhile, the average vacancy rate of student housing is about 1 per cent.This combination of a supply shortfall and rising numbers of university applicants has attracted a spate of big deals this year.In April, Legal & General, the insurer, made its first foray into property lending and provided Unite, the UK’s largest developer and manager of student housing by units, with a £121m loan. The move is the start of what L&G hopes will become a multibillion-pound lending business, much of which will be directed at the student housing market.A week later, M&G, the fund management arm of the UK insurer Prudential completed one of the largest commercial property lending deals of the year when it agreed to finance a £266m acquisition of a central London student housing portfolio.The arrival of new lenders in the student housing sector reflects a trend across the property industry, as the slowdown in bank lending creates opportunities. The role of banks is expected to decline further, as changes to global banking regulation require lenders to increase the amount of capital held against loans secured on commercial property.“We are seeing very strong demand for student housing from investors not just across the UK, but globally,” said Charlie Cunningham, chief executive of Fresh Start Living, the student housing provider.
56;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;CBRE defies Europe slump to beat expectations;;CBRE, the world’s largest manager of property funds by assets, beat market expectations during the three months to the end of June to post a 24 per cent increase in net income to $75.9m.The US group, which manages a 3bn sq ft commercial property empire, was able to mitigate the economic slump in Europe with strong demand in its estate agency business for arranging office and warehouse transactions in its domestic market.The solid performance, underlined by revenues of $1.6bn for the quarter, 13 per cent up on a year earlier, helped lift CBRE’s shares 10 per cent in morning trading.Brett White, chief executive, said the group had benefited from a wave of outsourcing contracts and lease renewals as businesses looked to take costs out of managing their property portfolios.CBRE signed 54 outsourcing contracts – renewals, new clients and expansions of existing relationships – during the second quarter.The global commercial property industry has been laid low during the past year, with the sovereign debt crisis and worsening borrowing conditions sapping activity.“The recovery continues to progress, but at a historically slow pace and with a high degree of inconsistency and uncertainty across global markets and business lines,” Mr White said.CBRE, which has businesses spanning fund management, estate agency and advisory services, posted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $220.9m for the three months, up 28 per cent year on year.Earnings per share during the second quarter hit $0.27, up from $0.21, while net debt rose to $1.93bn at the end of the period, up from $1.64bn a year earlier.The tentative recovery in the US housing market was reflected in the performance of CBRE’s mortgage brokerage arm, which experienced a 37 per cent increase in sales during the period.The group’s European operations suffered during the three months, however, with revenue in the Europe, Middle East and Africa division declining $13m to $248.2m.Shares in CBRE rose $1.27, or 8 per cent, to $16.84.Jones Lang Lasalle, CBRE’s largest rival, reported a decline in second quarter profits yesterday after the cost of integrating recently acquired businesses offset revenue growth.JLL, which acquired UK estate agency King Sturge last year, posted a profit of $37.4m, down from $44.1m for the same period a year earlier. Shares in the company fell 1.5 per cent to $65.70.
57;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-05-27T16:47:43Z;Foreign investors shun Irish property market;;Passengers arriving at Dublin’s international airport are left in no doubt about what the country needs.A towering billboard for Allied Irish Banks’ foreign direct investment division dominates the low-slung terminal building. Above the image of grinning investment bankers, bold white letters read: “Sharing your vision for Ireland”.With the country’s mostly state-owned banks still labouring with vast debts and limited in their ability to lend, attracting overseas money is becoming an ever more crucial ingredient for reigniting the country’s sluggish economic growth.Nowhere is this felt more than in the property market. Once the backbone of the Celtic Tiger economy, Irish real estate is now the most significant impediment to its economic recovery.The difficulty for any prospective overseas investor is trying to pick the bottom of the market.Commercial property values, which fell for 15 consecutive quarters before a slight rebound at the start of this year, are 65 per cent below the peak of the market in September 2007. Meanwhile, a vacancy rate of 23 per cent in Dublin – one of the highest in Europe – will temper any rental growth in the near term.The unpredictability of the market and overhang of empty office buildings has also crushed development in Ireland. There is not a single square foot of speculative commercial property under construction in the country and bank finance for new building work is non-existent.“There is no shortage of people turning up in Ireland and saying they would like to invest in the property market,” says Guy Hollis, managing director of CBRE, the property services group, in Ireland.“The problem is they are only focused on really prime stuff, which is very limited, or the big loan books the banks are trying to sell. That leaves a lot of unwanted stock in the middle,” Mr Hollis adds.The Irish government has tried to create a regulatory environment to attract overseas investment in the property market. As well as cutting stamp duty from 6 to 2 per cent, Dublin reversed its controversial plan for legislation to allow commercial tenants to remove upward-only rent review clauses from their leases.The National Asset Management Agency, a vehicle set created by the government to purge Irish banks of €74bn of bad property debt, is also stepping up its programme of sales. The agency plans to sell its portfolio, a legacy of profligate borrowing and speculation that led to the country’s financial crisis, by 2020.However, Frank Daly, Nama’s chairman, believes the uncertainty created by the eurozone debt crisis is making it more difficult to attract overseas investors.“It reminds me of the dead market that existed when there was a debate over ending upward-only rent reviews in Ireland. Then you couldn’t price an offer,” he says.Nama faces a major challenge to recoup the €32bn in taxpayers’ money it paid to acquire the loans from the banks. A report published by Ireland’s budget watchdog last week warned the 57 per cent haircut applied to loans by Nama was not high enough and that the agency had subsidised banks to the tune of €6bn. It forecast the agency would struggle to recover the €32bn for taxpayers by 2020.“We are at the stage now where we are ready for new investors and it is unfortunate that right now which could be a pivotal point for Nama there is uncertainty. But . . . one thing about investors is they bounce back very quickly. The day they decide it is the right time they don’t hang about,” Mr Daly adds.Many in the property sector believe, though, that there are huge opportunities for those overseas investors willing to take the risk.Income return, or yield, on Irish commercial property is among the highest in the world. According to data from IPD, the property research group, income return in Ireland stands at 10 per cent, compared with a global average of 5.9 per cent and higher than Spain (5.6 per cent) and Portugal (5.7 per cent).“The government is doing everything in its power to attract overseas investment and, if you can find a good tenant, there is a once in a generation opportunity on yields,” says Phil Tily, managing director of IPD in the UK and Ireland.So far, however, the majority of interest in the Irish market has come from US and European vulture funds looking to buy single assets, or portfolios of impaired loans at rock-bottom prices.
58;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-05-13T15:50:54Z;German property owners step up sale plans;;The owners of some of Germany’s biggest residential property portfolios are stepping up sale plans amid a resurgence of investor appetite that is set to push deal volumes to levels not seen since before the financial crisis.Portfolio transactions more than trebled in volume in the first quarter to some €3bn compared with 2011, showing how interest in Germany property has rebounded in spite of tough financing conditions.“This is definitely going to be the most active year since the crisis in terms of transaction volume,” said Konstantin Lüttger, head of residential investment at CBRE in Frankfurt.Barclays and BayernLB are among the banks expected to dispose of tens of thousands of German flats this year. Gagfah, Germany’s largest listed residential landlord, also confirmed last week it was considering selling 38,000 flats in Dresden.International bidders including Goldman Sachs’ Whitehall property fund and private equity groups such as Blackstone are among those interested in buying German property, according to market participants.Whitehall is expected to be among the bidders for a 20,000 strong portfolio of homes to be sold by Barclays, people familiar with the sale plan said.German property is seen as a relatively stable asset amid eurozone turmoil. The rising interest marks a return to levels seen before the financial crisis, when a number of foreign investors used cheap debt to snap up hundreds of thousands of housing units.“The past wave of transactions was driven by financial engineering. This time the deals being done look more sustainable. They frequently involve companies that already have considerable experience and understanding of the German property market,” said Mr Lüttger.This year LBBW, the Stuttgart bank, sold 21,000 flats for €1.44bn to a consortium of pension funds and insurers led by a German property group, while BayernLB’s DKB unit sold 25,000 flats for almost €1bn to TAG, a listed German property company.Deutsche Wohnen, another quoted property company, is said to be interested in bidding for the Barclays portfolio. It declined to comment but acknowledged talks over three possible acquisitions.BayernLB has a further 32,000 flats in wealthy Bavaria that it has to sell to satisfy EU competition rules after it was bailed out in the crisis, while the German government also plans to privatise an 11,500 portfolio of flats.“There is a lot on the market but the big question for opportunistic investors is whether there is adequate financing. There are not many banks out there that are willing to lend big sums and consortium deals are more complex,” Mr Lüttger said.Some past deals require billions of euros of refinancing, with a potential crunch next year. Deutsche Annington, owned by Terra Firma, is in talks to refinance €4.5bn of debt due in 2013. Gagfah, owned by Fortress, is negotiating with potential investors to refinance €2.1bn of loans due next year and has a further €1bn to refinance connected with the Dresden portfolio.
59;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-04-26T16:19:48Z;European governments sell off property;;Sales of public sector buildings more than doubled in Europe last year, as cash-strapped governments across the continent battled to pay down debt by disposing of their property portfolios.Government-owned property sales, including schools, hospitals and prisons, hit €2.3bn in 2011 – the highest level since the start of the financial crisis – according to research by CB Richard Ellis, the property services group.The pressure to raise funds has pushed governments across Europe to look at selling off state assets.Activity has been largely restricted to those countries seen as less risky by property investors. Germany, Sweden, Russia and the UK accounted for three-quarters of all public sector sales in the continent, compared with 62 per cent of the market as a whole.“The concentration of activity was in four of the stronger European markets, which suggests that, in 2012 and beyond, those countries that are in a more unstable economic position will find it increasingly difficult to implement large-scale disposal programmes,” said Richard Holberton, director of EMEA research and consulting at CBRE.However, even governments that are seen as safer counterparties by property investors are struggling to sell down anything other than buildings that still have a use, such as prisons or government offices, and yield long-term, state-backed income streams.“Even here, however, downgrades in the credit rating of several governments have raised questions as to their covenant quality as occupiers,” Mr Holberton said.This uncertainty, coupled with the moribund real estate financing market, has meant that many assets are being sold cheaply.Another issue slowing the widespread sell off of state-controlled property assets is the lack of overseas interest. The purchaser base for public sector disposals in Europe has been 85 per cent domestic during the past four years, and rose to 90 per cent in 2011.This trend is in contrast to transactions of private property, where overseas buyers make up a significant slice of buying and selling activity.In spite of the difficulties of selling real estate at anything other than distressed prices, some peripheral European countries have launched property disposal vehicles in a bid to raise capital.The most significant of these is Greece’s Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund, which controls airports, toll roads, horse racing tracks and 70,000 properties. The fund is aiming to raise €25bn from asset sales for Greece’s stricken public finances.Italy is also looking at launching a fund to deal with the disposal of schools, town halls and local authority-owned theatres. And two Spanish regions, Andalucía and Cataluña, have organised public tenders for sale and leasebacks of assets.

London is the most popular city in the world for retailers, with 55.6 per cent of international retailers having outlets there.CBRE’s survey maps the global footprint of 326 retailers across 73 countries.Luxury and business retailers remained the most global in the sector. Retailers hailing from North America proved to be the most expansive, with 73 per cent being present in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas. This compares with 44 per cent of European retailers, and is more than three times the number for retailers from the Asia-Pacific region.“The trend for US fashion retailers making strategic advances into the UK continued in 2011,” said Peter Gold, head of Emea cross border retail at CB Richard Ellis. London is also the favourite city to be targeted by US retailers with 64.7 per cent operating at least one store there, the property consultancy said.Retail space for the largest operators has been ramped up in recent years, with the opening of Westfield London shopping centre in Shepherds Bush in 2008 and Westfield Stratford City, Europe’s largest shopping centre positioned on the doorstep of the Olympic Park, last year. This changing retail landscape has encouraged the West End, the traditional retail heart in the city centre, to look at ways of maintaining its position and entice new shoppers.Turnover from shops on and around Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street is predicted to surpass £10bn by 2020, up from about £7.5bn this year, according to a report commissioned by the New West End Company which represents businesses in the district. However, it suggests that visitors want to see reduced congestion and have better navigational tools in the area, which vies with global shopping destinations such as New York or Hong Kong.“It has to be a great place to be so people, internationally, want to come and shop,” said Dame Judith Mayhew Jonas, chairman of the New West End Company.
61;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-04-13T23:11:13Z;Singled out;Overseas buyers are contributing to property construction and price hikes in Berlin;Berlin-based estate agent Lorna O’Brien’s client wish list is a long and varied one: “I’ve been asked for flats with a room designed to accommodate a model train set, one with Roman-style baths sunk into the floor and another with a replica of Carrie Bradshaw’s walk-in closet [of Sex and the City fame],” she says.Expat homebuyers at O’Brien’s Simply Berlin estate agency may be a mixed bunch – well-to-do artists and internet entrepreneurs – but they have one thing in common: they value location and amenities over space.Overseas property hunters are contributing to the recent hikes in the value of property in Berlin. According to a report issued jointly by GSW, a local housing company, and the real estate service provider CBRE, the asking price of homes in the German capital rose by 8.3 per cent in 2011 (up from 7.9 per cent in 2010).The focus of new construction in the capital is Mitte, the historical centre of what used to be East Berlin, broadly the district in a triangle formed by the Sony Center at Potsdamer Platz and the new main railway station on its western side, and the city’s iconic TV Tower at Alexanderplatz in the east.Mitte’s price rises are due in part to the presence of a growing cluster of internet start-ups, dubbed Silicon Allee, and their usually single, childless founders. Tech sector entrepreneurs are also increasing the number of single households in Berlin, which, at almost 54 per cent, is already the highest of any large German city.“Single buyers at the top end of the market want a concierge service and a beautiful kitchen, plus secure parking,” says O’Brien. “But the kitchen is a style thing, as these people eat out almost all the time. And they will keep a car in the garage but typically get about town by bike or walking.”Mike Dawson, a copywriter from London, bought a 35 sq metre studio flat close to the Berlin outpost of the private members’ club Soho House, which opened for business two years ago in a Bauhaus-style building that served as a department store before housing the Hitler Youth and, later, the East German communists.“You could say that I was lucky,” says Dawson. “I bought the flat in 2004 for €70,000 and only made some basic improvements. At the beginning of this year I was offered €110,000 for it.”Berlin’s high proportion of rented accommodation (just 16 per cent of residents own a home) tends to distort its property market: average values are brought down by landlord-to-landlord sales of the large number of properties rented out indefinitely.It is difficult for landlords to end a lease under Germany’s tenant-friendly legislation. Some rents contracted before the euro replaced the mark are not indexed to take account of inflation, giving tenants a strong incentive to stay where they are. “Occupied flats in Berlin are best viewed as investment vehicles,” says Dawson.A 70 sq m, one-bedroom loft space in Mitte is on sale for €595,000 through Simply Berlin. The unit has bleached oak floors, a high-spec German kitchen and private parking space. The asking price for a 185 sq m new-build penthouse in Prenzlauer Berg, bordering Mitte, is €1.7m.Also in Prenzlauer Berg – one of the few central neighbourhoods favoured by families – €825,000 will secure a 215 sq m unit with four bedrooms and two bathrooms on the top storey of a renovated building dating from 1900 (through Wombacher Immobilien).In addition, a Philippe Starck-designed scheme under the Yoo brand will see 87 new condos come on the market in 2013 in a building close to the banks of the River Spree in Mitte. A split-level two-bedroom penthouse with 117 sq m of living space and a 26 sq m terrace, plus a parking space, is available for €1.695m. The project will have a spa and outdoor lounge area.In recent months the German press has documented the stirrings of a local backlash against the gentrification of some neighbourhoods, particularly Kreuzberg, a district to the south of Mitte known for its hippies and radicals. Here overseas investors have been buying up properties for use as holiday lets and are generally perceived to be driving up prices. Some protesters have even disturbed property viewings by stripping off in front of bemused house-hunters, local agents report.But Thomas Rücker, spokesman for GSW, warns against overestimating the influence of overseas buyers. “The kind of international buyer who collects properties in different cities like postage stamps, so to speak, is no more than around 3 per cent of the total high-end new build in Berlin,” he says.……………………………………………………………..Buying guidePros● Vibrant city with lots going on● Homes are good value for a major capital● Excellent public transportCons● Berlin’s economy is underpowered● Ugly tenements dominate much of the east of the city● Graffiti is a persistent problemWhat you can buy for …€100,000 A studio flat on the fringes of Mitte, ready to move in, or two tenanted studios in a secondary location in the city€1m A luxury, high-spec two-bedroom apartment with private parking in a secure, modern building in MitteContacts● Simply Berlinwww.simplyberlin.com● Yoo Berlinwww.yooberlin.com/en● Wombacher Immobilienwww.wombacher-immobilien.de● Silicon Allee blogwww.siliconallee.com
62;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-03-02T17:36:33Z;Retail: Tesco signals end to store space race;Habits are changing, and western consumers falling out of love with hypermarkets, reports Andrea Felsted;The retail property sector is poised for a further shake-up after a mixed Christmas and expectations of continued tough trading conditions this year.Malcolm Dalgleish, chairman of retail for the Emea region at CB Richard Ellis, a property consultancy, says it is difficult to generalise across the market. While some areas are struggling, others, such as luxury, are still strong.“There are always winners and losers, but since Christmas it has been tough. Consumers have not been spending unless the retailer has something special to offer …Consequently, if you had issues before, you will probably have bigger issues now,” he says.Since Christmas, a further round of shop closures have been announced, including 160 units at Bonmarché, a former subsidiary of value fashion chain Peacocks. Bonmarché has been sold to Sun European Partners, a private equity group, through a pre-pack administration. Some of Peacocks’ 600 or so stores are also expected to close, after the value fashion chain collapsed into administration in January.Thorntons, the chocolate manufacturer and retailer, has said it will cut another 60 stores after weak first-half results, taking the total to 180 over three years.According to PwC and the Local Data Company, high street chains shut stores at the rate of 14 a day last year, as they struggled with cash-strapped consumers and a rise in online shopping.There is also a trend for store groups to concentrate on a few centres rather than scattering their outlets across the country.Ten years ago, larger retailers would have needed stores in about 250 places in the UK to reach customers in most of the country. “Now, with the surge in online shopping, and with the larger centres getting stronger, many retailers can cover the country with stores in 100 centres,” says Mr Dalgleish.Sean Gillies, head of retail at Savills, the property consultancy, says the contraction is being caused by “structural and cyclical change. The cyclical part is the economic side, and the structural change is the growth of the internet and multi-channel retailing. There is also an ageing population profile.”Shrinking of store estates is by no means confined to the UK.Abercrombie & Fitch, the US teenage clothing chain, said it would shut 180 stores in its home market by 2015, to focus on top-tier properties. The group said it would pull out of secondary US malls to open stores in European and Asian shopping centres.Mr Dalgleish believes this is leading to a three-tier market.There will be centres where retailers have to be represented, and where they will fight for the best locations, driving up rents. Groups will still be prepared to trade from secondary locations, but only if the terms are right. Third-tier centres may well wither.“Clearly the exacerbation of the primary and secondary centre divide is far from just a UK phenomenon. Retailers across the world are finding they can trade in fewer locations, providing they are in the right centres,” he says.One area of strong demand over the past few years has been for supermarket space.Britain’s so-called big four supermarkets have plans to open 19m sq ft of store space over four years.However, Tesco, the world’s third-biggest chain by sales, after Walmart of the US and Carrefour of France, signalled an end to the space race, when it delivered a profit warning after its worst trading for decades.Philip Clarke, chief executive, said he expected the group to open fewer hypermarkets. Analysts expect the chain to announce it is cutting the amount of space it plans to open and to concentrate efforts on its smaller convenience stores and refurbishing existing supermarkets.J Sainsbury is also expected to trim its store opening programme.In many developed markets consumers are falling out of love with hypermarkets. They are choosing to shop more locally instead, put off from driving to large out of town centres by high fuel costs.They also want to avoid temptation – hypermarkets sell a high proportion of non-food items – lest they should deviate from their strict budgets.The trend is proving challenging for Walmart, while Carrefour is struggling to turn round its hypermarket business in Europe.However, in developing markets, such as in China and Latin America, hypermarkets remain popular. Indeed, while store bases may be contracting in developed markets, China, India and Latin America remain attractive to many food and non-food retailers.However, China has not been plain-sailing for international groups, with Tesco scaling back its ambitions to open big malls there, and Walmart facing high-profile problems.In October, police detained several Walmart store managers over allegations they had mislabelled ordinary pork as organic, and four of the group’s senior China managers have left in the past year.Elsewhere, some international retailers have been frustrated by recent uncertainty over whether India would open its retail market up to overseas groups.
63;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-02-22T15:08:53Z;Mideast money pours into London property;;Middle East investment in newly built homes in London almost doubled during the past year as political instability in the region forced investors to seek havens for their funds, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, the property consultants.In 2011 Middle East money accounted for 9 per cent of the total foreign investment in London’s new-build property, compared with 5 per cent in 2010, according to JLL’s sales data. The rise took place as the annual total foreign transaction values for newly built homes stayed flat at about £1.25bn.As revolts swept countries across the region, private investors moved to deposit their funds overseas, benefiting the likes of Dubai, which saw an inflow of capital from other Arab countries, as well as global financial hubs such as Switzerland, London and New York.“They’re seeing it as a safe haven for their money,” says Ben Stroud, associate director at JLL in London. Mr Stroud says Middle East interest in London property increased as uprisings gained pace across the region, toppling leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya.Buyers from the region have usurped Europeans to represent the second-largest investor base for newly built London homes, says Mr Stroud. However, Asian buyers remain the largest pool of capital. Most of the Middle East money has arrived from the Gulf states, where Bahrain continues to witness violent unrest and Oman has seen scattered protests.Capgemini and Merrill Lynch estimate that the wealth of the Middle East’s rich individuals totalled $1.7tn in 2010, according to their world wealth report released last summer.Jones Lang LaSalle’s biggest new-build transaction of last year to the Middle East was six London apartments to one Middle Eastern family for £22m.With oil prices sitting comfortably above $100 a barrel, Gulf governments are pumping funds back into their economies to improve job opportunities and living conditions for their citizens.However, the private investment of Gulf citizens should not be confused with the large-scale commercial investments made by the sovereign wealth funds of the region.As Richard Womack, senior director of capital markets at CBRE property consultants points out, some of the region’s sovereign wealth funds have become less active over the past year in London as the unrest has diverted funds back into the region.“They are probably being careful about being seen to invest – it’s probably not the done thing,” says Mr Womack, describing the awareness of Gulf governments towards domestic popular sentiment.Middle East investment in London’s commercial property market accounted for about 6 per cent in 2000-07 rising to 12 per cent in 2008-12, according to CBRE.Meanwhile, the typical investor from the region is looking for large family homes in London, with three to four bedrooms, priced from £1.9m to £15.2m, according to JLL. The most popular areas for purchases are Lancaster Gate, Marble Arch, Knightsbridge, Belgravia, Mayfair, Kensington, Regent’s Park and St John’s Wood. However, buyers are also starting to look at Marylebone and Fitzrovia, says JLL.
64;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-02-21T17:13:40Z;Europe’s banks in €20bn property loan sell-off;;European banks sold off over €20bn of property loans during 2011 as pressure on lenders to cut exposure to the troubled sector intensified ahead of tough regulatory changes.Lenders across the continent are also in the process of selling a further €13bn of loans, most of which were built up before the financial crisis, according to research to be published on Wednesday by CBRE, the property services group.The sales, mostly the result of disposals of large portfolios rather than individual assets, underscore the growing urgency among banks to rid balance sheets of property debt. Impending regulatory changes are set to increase the cost of holding loans secured against commercial property and many banks are slowing, or even halting new lending to the sector.“Banks now recognise that, in many cases, loan sales are the most effective way of diminishing their balance sheet leverage and exposure to real estate,” said Natale Giostra, head of CBRE’s UK and European debt advisory team.Mr Giostra added that loan sales provided banks with a quicker solution than resolving the issues with each individual borrower.CBRE recorded the completion of more than 20 portfolio sales by European banks during the year and said it had experienced a threefold increase in loan sale mandates across Europe, the majority of which were in the UK and Ireland.There was a flurry of deals during the last three months of 2011, as banks moved to unwind some of their most problematic loans.In the UK, the state-owned duo of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland completed deals to off-load portfolios of distressed property loans worth a combined £2.3bn. Irish lender, AIB, meanwhile, launched the sale of €1.4bn of debt secured against homes, offices and shops.Other banks, such as Société Générale, are taking the more aggressive approach of combining loan sales with a cessation of new lending to the property sector.However, UK banks are likely to be some of the most active in shedding their exposure to property. The Financial Services Authority, the City of London regulator, has ordered banks to improve the way their internal models measure risk or switch to more standardised calculations that could increase the cost of loans significantly.There is an estimated £280bn-£293bn of debt secured against commercial property in the UK, a very large slice of which, if not already in breach of financial covenants, is at loan-to-value ratios that would be near impossible to refinance in today’s market.

It comes as the problems besetting the wider economy in Europe and the US force businesses to reassess the way they deal with their property assets.Ann Woodall, managing director of the Salvation Army International Trustee Company, said the financial crisis had “brought a sharper focus on strategic priorities and in particular the management of our property portfolio”.“We therefore require a property adviser who can help to develop our asset base in the interests of The Salvation Army, its tenants and all the people we help across the globe,” Ms Woodall added.CBRE’s main role will be to provide advice on how best the Salvation Army can manage the assets in its existing portfolio, which extends to 124 countries and includes the church’s City of London headquarters.However, the property services group, which will work in partnership with Source8, the emerging markets consultancy, will also help the church with acquisitions, disposals and project management for new developments.As well as its commercial, retail and health service property, the Salvation Army has a substantial portfolio of houses and flats around the world.Nick Lambert, head of complex and emerging markets at CBRE, said the company would work with the church across all of the countries in which it had property and “help to drive efficiencies across their portfolio”.The Salvation Army reports its financial results on a region-by-region basis. In the UK, for the year ended March 31 2011, it reported a total income of £346m, against total charitable expenditure of £232.1m. Gains from the disposal of property and other income from its portfolio, contributed about £120m to the overall figure.The church, which employs 109,518 staff, was founded in 1865 by William Booth, a Methodist minister in London who took to the streets to preach Christian values to the poor and homeless of the city’s east end. In the years since its founding, it has grown into one of the world’s largest providers of humanitarian aid and has more than 1.5m members.The Salvation Army said it could not confirm the likely valuation of its global property portfolio.
66;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-02-07T23:50:04Z;Banks forced out of property sector, fund warns;;"The head of the world’s largest manager of property funds has warned that the pressure being placed on banks by governments is forcing them out of the property market.In an interview with the Financial Times, Brett White, chief executive of CBRE, which has almost $100bn under management, said that the scrutiny on banks, the traditional source of finance to the industry, was helping pave the way for a greater involvement of private equity funds.“It is not that [banks] don’t want to play in the real estate market any more, but rather that they cannot as they come under so much scrutiny from their governments,” Mr White said.The pressure on clearing banks, many of which are still nursing multibillion-dollar distressed-property loan books, has already led to some selling off or moth-balling of their commercial property divisions.France’s Société Générale and Germany’s Commerzbank both announced a moratorium on new lending to the sector at the end of last year. Meanwhile, CBRE’s own purchase of ING Real Estate, which it bought from ING Group for $940m last year, had been driven by the Dutch lender’s desire to slash its exposure to the global property sector.Mr White added, however, that the sell off of non-performing property loans by US and European banks had not unfolded as many had expected.“Logically, it should be a buyer’s market as the banks want to sell this stuff and there is a lot of money on the sidelines waiting to buy. But the armageddon people predicted hasn’t happened; the banks are not putting their foot down, but are instead selling slowly and very carefully,” he said.On the prospects for the wider global property market, Mr White said that a quiet year would be a “wonderful result” for 2012, adding that low levels of new buildings coming to market in the US and Europe would lead to a surge in rents once the market started to recover.CBRE, which is also the world’s largest property services group by revenues, reported a 15 per cent increase in revenues during the year to December 31 to $5.9bn. Net income for the period, after the costs of integrating ING, came to $239.2m, up from $200.3m in 2010. The increase generated earnings per share of $0.74, compared to $0.63."
67;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-01-30T17:22:17Z;Nama sells iconic London cinema;;Ireland’s National Asset Management Agency has sold off London’s most famous cinema, the latest in a string of high-profile UK disposals by the body as it seeks to shed almost €74bn of toxic property loans.Allsop, which have been working as receivers for the Odeon Leicester Square, confirmed on Monday that the cinema and surrounding buildings, including a pub and disused office development, had been sold to the Radisson Edwardian hotel group.The deal is the latest indication that Nama is stepping up its disposals of European and US property assets. The agency has sold over €6bn of assets during the past two years, 80 per cent of which have been outside Ireland.However, it is keen to push on with the process, and earlier this month, it appointed a panel of 16 advisers to help it dispose of the remainder of its portfolio.The Leicester Square site, which is thought to have sold for close to £100m, has planning permission for an extensive overhaul, which would see the existing buildings demolished to make way for a two-screen cinema, a 245-bedroom hotel, 33 apartments and four restaurants.The Odeon, which sits on the south-west corner of the square, is the largest single screen cinema in the UK. It is also one of the most recognisable cinemas in the country, used regularly for screening premieres.Peter Burns of CBRE, which was joint agent on the site with Knight Frank, said the rarity value of such a large development opportunity in central London had ensured interest.“Sites like these don’t come around more than every 10 years or so and it is a really exciting opportunity for building a valuable project in the heart of London,” Mr Burns said.Nama took on the site from a trio of Irish property investors – Pat Chesser, Pat Whelan and Paul Hanby – who bought the cinema in 2006 for £28m using loans from Anglo Irish Bank, the lender at the centre of Ireland’s economic crisis.In 2008 they lodged a planning application for a new hotel, two cinemas and an apartment development on the Odeon site in a scheme, which at the time was estimated to have a value of £200m.The three investors came from different backgrounds before turning their hands to property investment during the boom in Ireland. Mr Chesser founded one of the leading estate agents in Limerick, Chesser Auctioneers, in 1982. Mr Whelan is a former manager of the Irish rugby team and Mr Hanby was a founder of the Dublin solicitors Hanby Wallace.Mr Chesser and Mr Whelan developed the 16-storey Clarion hotel on the banks of the Shannon river in Limerick.Nama appointed receivers to Steamboat Developments Ltd., the company co-owned by Mr Whelan and Mr Chesser on March 25 2011. Nama declined to comment.
68;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-01-26T18:33:28Z;Retailers pushing for rental revolution;;The practice of shopkeepers emptying the till for their landlords every three months is enshrined in centuries of industry tradition.Historically, there was good cause for it. Property owners, often based many miles from their assets, relied on horse-drawn wagons to collect their rent.However, the traditional way of doing things has increasingly come under pressure as hard-pressed retailers fight to balance the books amid the strain of the economic downturn.During the past few months, a series of high street shops, including Monsoon, Accessorize and Sports Direct, have hit back at their landlords, demanding the right to pay rent on a monthly basis rather than paying quarterly in advance.Darcy Willson-Rymer, the new chief executive of Clinton Cards, has already succeeded in persuading half of the landlords of the greeting card chain’s 800 stores to agree to monthly rent payments.“UK occupancy costs for retailers, including rent and business rates, are among the highest in the world, plus there are strict conditions within leases, such as upward-only rent reviews,” he says. Describing an industry-wide move to monthly rents as “making total business sense,” he adds: “It’s all about working with landlords to find the best solution.”The UK is rare in still maintaining an assumption that rents will be paid quarterly in new tenancy agreements. Recent research by CBRE, the property services group, found that out of 48 countries surveyed only 7 pay rents on a quarterly basis.Aside from the UK, France, Ireland and Italy are the other European countries with a quarterly system. Denmark, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Switzerland all operate both monthly and quarterly rental agreements.The difficulties facing the high street have caused a jump in the number of UK retailers moving to monthly payments – up to 12 per cent in 2011 from 3 per cent in 2007.The expectation is that many future contracts will be structured to facilitate greater flexibility so that rents can be paid on either basis, depending on the needs of the retailer and landlord.“Landlords’ complaint is that they might have to pay the bank quarterly, so allowing the tenant to move to a monthly payment system means they have to manage two cash flows,” says Jonathan De Mello, head of retail consultancy at CBRE.Mr De Mello points out, however, that a change to a more flexible rent payment system is unlikely to offer much protection to struggling retailers.“A retailer in decline can move from quarterly to monthly or even monthly to weekly, but it will still be a retailer in decline,” he says.The tough trading conditions over Christmas have added to the pressure on landlords to allow more flexibility in their agreements with retailers. Before Christmas, many landlords allowed Clintons to stagger its quarter day payments, paying two-thirds two weeks before Christmas, and the remainder two weeks afterwards.Industry observers believe the move to monthly from quarterly payments should be easier to force through in the current climate of high vacancy rates, which stood at 14.8 per cent by the end of 2011, according to the Local Data Company. Paradoxically, though, the retailers best equipped to bully their landlords into mid-contract rent changes are often the ones in least need of the benefits the transition affords.“All tenants have a bit more leverage because of the issue of oversupply, but you need a strong balance sheet and a good spread of stores if you are going to negotiate,” says Guy Grainger, head of retail at Jones Lang LaSalle, the property services group.
69;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-01-23T03:05:20Z;New Look mulls closing 100 stores;;"New Look, the value fashion chain, could close up to 100 stores over the next three years if it cannot wring better deals from landlords.The retailer, which is owned by private equity groups Apax Partners and Permira, has about 100 leases expiring in the next three years, and has earmarked around 60 stores for closure as it migrates more of its sales online. However, it could close up to 100 if it cannot negotiate more favourable deals with landlords.New Look is the latest high street chain to review its property strategy. Thousands of high street shops stand to be vacated in the coming years as cost-cutting retail groups take a calculated gamble that the soft property market, coupled with the rise of internet and mobile sales, will enable them to strike keener deals.New Look has just completed a review of its 600-store UK estate, and is being advised by property firm CBRE and e-commerce consultant Javelin.In areas where trading is strong, it will continue its strategy of replacing small stores with bigger units, and sees the potential for up to 30 of these. However, it has too many “duplicate” stores with overlapping catchment areas, and will seek to manage its lease expiry programme to reflect this.Alistair McGeorge, New Look’s chairman, was appointed to turn round the fashion retailer last May, and has successfully launched a mobile site and “click and collect” service, where shoppers can order online, and collect in-store.In January, the retailer announced better-than-expected Christmas trading figures. In the five weeks to December 31, UK like-for-like sales rose 3.6 per cent, compared to the same period a year ago.Other retailers looking to trim their store estates include Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group, which stands to renegotiate leases on 500 stores in the next few years; Mothercare, which could close up to 150 stores; and Thorntons, which plans to exit up to 180 stores.Dixons, which is closing half of its high street stores, has been offered rents as low as £1 a year if it continues to trade and pay business rates.JD Sports, which acquired 300 Blacks Leisure stores via a pre-pack administration earlier this month, is currently renegotiating lease terms with landlords. The future remains uncertain for rival value fashion retailer Peacocks, which called in administrators last week and is now seeking a buyer to take on its 563 UK stores."
70;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2012-01-16T14:52:30Z;Nama appoints 16 advisers to dispose of loans;;Ireland’s National Asset Management Agency has appointed a panel of 16 advisers from across the financial services sector as the bad bank steps up its efforts to sell €31bn of property loans.The “loan sale advisory services” is a cluster of investment banks, lawyers, accountants, estate agents and debt restructuring specialists split into two pools to deal with European and US loan disposals.The move to assemble advisers specifically mandated to help it dispose of its loans suggests Nama is preparing to increase the rate at which it unwinds its property exposure.Property services companies CBRE, Jones Lang LaSalle, Savills and Cushman & Wakefield make up the backbone of the European and US panels, with CBRE and JLL represented in both regions.Investment banks Lazard and Eastdil Secured, a subsidiary of Wells Fargo, will advise in both regions. Meanwhile, UBS and Goldman Sachs will advise on European loan sales and Credit Suisse in the US.Also on the two panels are accountancy and administration firms Ernst & Young and KPMG, and debt restructuring companies Brookland Partners, Cantor Fitzgerald and The Debt ExchangeIt is understood that the European panel was initially going to be made up of just six advisers. However, Nama became concerned that those left out would complain and so expanded it to 13.During the past year, Nama has made some high profile disposals in Europe, including the October sale of the much coveted Audley Street car park in London’s Mayfair, which was bought by mobile-phone tycoon John Caudwell for an estimated £150m. The agency also appointed administrators to take control of its share of Battersea Power Station in November, after the owners of the 38-acre site failed to sell it.Brendan McDonagh, Nama’s chief executive, recently told the Financial Times the agency would consider moving its loans, which are secured against 35,000 properties, into a tax-efficient real estate investment trust if the legislation were in place for it to do so.Mr McDonagh said that he would be keen to see the introduction of so-called mortgage Reits in the UK, already an established feature of the property markets in the US and continental Europe.Nama, which was set up in 2009 to purge Irish banks of their toxic property loans, has spent €31bn to acquire €74bn in property loans held by the main Irish banks.The bad bank expects to take a loss of 57 per cent on the original value of the loans.In the year to October 2011, Nama sold €4.3bn of property loans, taking its total disposals to €6.2bn since being formed in late 2009.However, it faces an uphill task as commercial and residential property prices have fallen by 60 per cent in parts of Ireland and are still dropping due to the challenging economic climate.Nama was unavailable for comment.
71;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-11-03T23:11:17Z;Akelius of Sweden aims to buy 10,000 UK homes;;Sweden’s largest private housing company has launched plans to snap up 10,000 UK homes as international investors look to break into the country’s residential rented sector.Akelius, owner of 34,000 apartments in Sweden and Germany, has appointed property group CBRE to acquire mid-market apartment blocks in and around London that it could use to create what would be one of the UK’s largest rental portfolios. The company has not stated how much it plans to spend, but it is thought likely to be about £2bn ($3.2bn).International investors, from pension and insurance funds to property groups, have been eyeing the UK private rented sector as an alternative to the more volatile commercial property market.So far the difficulties of buying large numbers of homes in a concentrated area, and thus creating economies of scale, have dissuaded foreign investors from establishing residential funds.“Our goal is to create a portfolio of residential properties consisting predominantly of freehold and investments let on assured shorthold contracts. The initial geographic focus is London and nearby suburbs with good transport connections,” said Lars Lindfors, Akelius’s UK director.Mr Lindfors said the company expected the UK private rented sector to grow as more people moved away from ownership and looked for viable alternatives.“We believe tenants will be particularly attracted to rental accommodation that is owned and managed by an experienced landlord with a long-term outlook on its investment,” he added.The 10,000 homes, which Akelius hopes to acquire within five years, would represent a significant portion of the available stock in London and the south-east during the period.According to research from Savills, 21,000 homes were built in London and the south-east during 2010, suggesting Akelius would need to buy up the equivalent of 11 per cent of all the new stock coming to market to meet its target.The company is not looking to buy new-build developments, however. Instead, it will target existing portfolios from large landlords, such as Grosvenor Estates and the Wellcome Trust.Residential portfolio sales are not unprecedented. In March, Grainger, the UK’s largest listed residential landlord, bought 1,650 units from Genesis Housing Group. “The first mover often creates the confidence for others to follow and, given the scale of this company, this could open up private rented for other overseas institutions,” said Chris Lacey, head of CBRE residential investment.

Taleo Corporation, which sells human resources software to businesses, was up 7.9 per cent to $31.61. SuccessFactors, which markets business education courses, rose 9.3 per cent to $26.24.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.4 per cent to 2,699.44 at the close.The S&P 500 advanced 1.3 per cent to 1,254.20, its highest close since the start of August, and decisively above the 1,220 to 1,230 range where two previous rallies stalled in recent months.The Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 closed below 30 for only the second time since early August. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” had been above 30 for most of August and September.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent to 11,900.03.“EU debt negotiations didn’t go off the rails over the weekend, and it appears that some progress may have even been made toward an agreement,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.The rally was broadly cyclical with material and industrial stocks in the S&P 500 up 2.3 and 1.7 per cent respectively. Both sectors were helped by a better than expected “flash” purchasing managers’ index survey in China.Alpha Natural Resources, which supplies China with metallurgical coal for use in the manufacture of steel, was up 9.5 per cent to $23.79. Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan was 8 per cent higher at $23.79.The defensive utility, telecom and consumer staples sectors were the only S&P 500 components to fall.Caterpillar surged 5 per cent to $91.77, after the company reported record revenues and delivered earnings per share of $1.71, a full 15 cents higher than the average analyst expectation in a Bloomberg poll.The company raised its 2012 earnings outlook by a fifth, and said global economic uncertainty had not fed through to demand for its earthmoving equipment.Shares in health insurer HealthSpring surged 33.7 per cent to $53.71, after rival insurer Cigna announced it would purchase the company for $3.8bn.The deal values HealthSpring at $55 a share, and would give Cigna access to HealthSpring’s customer base. HealthSpring sells premium insurance to customers eligible for Medicaid, the federal health insurance programme for retirees. Cigna shares were down 0.6 per cent to $45.34.The deal helped Humana, another health insurer focused on Medicare-eligible clients, gain 4.8 per cent to $79.93.In the property sector, Citigroup analyst Josh Levin released a note arguing that “the structural excess supply of homes is exhausting itself.“The inventory of existing homes for sale [3.48m in September] has been declining on a year on year basis for the past eight months and now stands at a multiyear low,” Mr Levin told clients.Although he warned the “shadow inventory” of homes in foreclosure could yet add to the housing stock, homebuilder shares continued their strong October rally.The SPDR Homebuilders exchange traded fund, which tracks the return on homebuilders listed in the S&P 500 was up 2.9 per cent to $16.49. The ETF has risen 30 per cent in three weeks, after hitting a low of $12.30 at the start of October.Lennar Corp, considered one of the healthiest of US homebuilders because of its low debt levels, was up 1.7 per cent to $17.02, a gain of 33.6 per cent since October 4. PulteGroup, a more volatile stock carrying high debt, was up 6.3 per cent to $5.21, a gain of 47.2 per cent since October 4.Commercial property service provider CB Richard Ellis Group surged 9.5 per cent to $16.74.Lorillard, the maker of Newport cigarettes, fell 0.6 per cent to $114.97 after earnings per share of $1.94 came in below average analyst expectations. Gross profit of $563m was $3m lower than the same quarter last year, as higher costs offset increased sales of cigarettes and higher pack pricing.Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of Kleenex and other household brands, fell 4.6 per cent to $69.65. Earnings per share of $1.26 were in line with expectations, but net income fell to $432 million compared with $469 million in the same quarter last year.Sprint Nextel was down 2.9 per cent to $2.69, as a judge weighed whether to dismiss the third-largest US mobile network’s opposition to the takeover of T Mobile by its AT&T.
73;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-10-19T16:51:53Z;DTZ up for sale after takeover bid withdrawn;;DTZ, the property services group, has put itself up for sale after a takeover bid backed by its largest shareholder was pulled at the beginning of the week.DTZ said on Wednesday that it would “implement a formal sale process” in order to evaluate a number of preliminary indications of interest in acquiring the company. Oriel Securities has been appointed to oversee the sale.The company, which provides services to the property sector such as leasing and investment advice, added that it would look at other strategic options “aimed at ensuring the long-term growth of the business, addressing the capital structure and providing funds for future investment”.The agent’s shares lifted on the news of the sale but ended the day down 0.75p to 22p, reflecting a market capitalisation of just over £61m.DTZ has struggled since the crash in the property market, when it was forced to raise £48.7m in a rights issue backed by Saint Georges Participations (SGP), an investment vehicle of the French Mathy family, which now owns a 52 per cent interest in the company.The group has remained hampered by debt and the after-effects of cost-cutting implemented by former Barclays banker Paul Idzik, brought in as chief executive at the beginning of 2009. In spite of this aggressive restructuring, DTZ still made a narrow loss at the end of its last financial period even as rivals have returned to growth.Mr Idzik stood down earlier this year during the bid negotiations with SGP, which had hoped to take over the company and merge it with the real estate services arm of BNP Paribas, the French bank.On Monday, the majority shareholder withdrew from bidding for the consultancy after more than five months of takeover talks, which raised questions about the future of the company. DTZ blamed economic conditions on the failure for the deal, although BNP Paribas declined to comment on the process.Although only now officially on the market, DTZ has in effect been in play for some time even if most in the market expected its majority shareholder to be in the strongest position. Other property groups such as CB Richard Ellis, the world’s largest by revenue, have already considered making bids, although are likely to be most interested in parts of the business rather than the whole.The Asian operations, in particular, where DTZ’s brand still carries weight, are seen as attractive for other agents looking to bolster their business in the region.The Takeover Panel has granted a dispensation so that interested parties will not be required to be publicly identified, or be subject to the 28-day deadline. DTZ asked potential suitors to contact Oriel “without delay”. Acceptable offers will then be given access to a data room and to management.
74;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-10-03T22:43:50Z;Property investors drawn to London;;London has taken the lion’s share of inward investment into European commercial property over the past 18 months, as concerns about the health of the eurozone continue to rattle investors.A mixture of non-European governments, private equity investors and pension and insurance funds poured more than £8bn into buying offices and shops in the UK capital in the 18 months to July, according to research by CB Richard Ellis, the property services group.The figure is almost five times the £1.63bn invested in Paris, the next most popular city, and accounts for 39 per cent of the £21bn that came into the Continent’s commercial property market as a whole.After London and Paris, the German cities of Berlin and Frankfurt received £700m and £600m respectively during the period.The strength of interest in London suggests that international investors are unconcerned about its status as a financial centre and fears that regulatory changes could lead to a banking exodus.Peter Damesick, chief economist for Europe, Middle East and Africa at CBRE, said: “It is the first place that comes up on the radar when investors look to Europe and clearly they do not think changes to the regulatory environment will stop it from being the financial centre that it is.“London also tends to be used as a springboard to get into the rest of the Continent so will often see the first uplift of new investors coming into Europe.”One of the key attractions of the London property market is the structure of leases in the UK. Regular upward-only rent-reviews mean landlords can increase rents more often than in other European countries. The market for large office and retail buildings in the capital is also highly liquid.The mix of investors has changed, however, as sovereign wealth, pension and insurance funds look to diversify away from government debt in their search for investments that offer a steady yield. Unlike some of the opportunistic funds that bought into the market during the boom, these investors look for already occupied buildings with a long lease in place to match their long-dated liabilities.However, interest in London has also helped fuel new developments, such as the Middle Eastern-backed 64-storey Pinnacle in Bishopsgate. The appeal of the capital is also reflected in the city’s residential market, where overseas investors account for an increasingly large amount of transactions for both prime and middle-market homes.North American investors were the largest non-European buyers of European commercial property during the 18 months, spending £11.2bn, while Asia spent £4.2bn and the Middle East £3.6bn.
75;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-09-27T23:12:55Z;‘Citizen Kane’ studio goes up for sale;;"The Culver Studios, where a mocked-up Atlanta burned to the ground in Gone With The Wind, will go up for sale this week with its owners hoping that the history of one of Hollywood’s oldest independent lots will attract a $150m-plus offer from a trophy-hunting international business mogul.Built in 1918 by Thomas Ince, the silent movie pioneer, the studios have been owned by Cecil B. DeMille, RKO’s Joseph Kennedy and Howard Hughes. Their 13 sound stages have been home to epics including King Kong, Rebecca and Citizen Kane; more recent films including State of Play; and television series from Lassie to America’s Next Top Model.Pacific Coast Capital Partners, Lehman Brothers and Picbengro, a private vehicle for an undisclosed New York investor, bought the studios from Sony for $125m in 2004, later selling a series of office buildings for about $50m.The owners tried to sell before the 2008 financial crisis, attracting offers of more than $150m, but were caught out by the market collapse that brought down Lehman, said Jamie Cella, chief executive. It is expected to announce within days that it has appointed CB Richard Ellis, the property agent, for the sale.“This is an iconic trophy. I’ve always felt I was a steward of history because it’s been owned by all the kings of Hollywood,” Mr Cella said. “The interest in 2008 came from entertainment entities and some real estate opportunity funds, but now we see the market being driven by more international players.”The sellers hope to attract wealthy emerging markets bidders, Mr Cella said. “It’s like when [the Sultan of Brunei] bought the Beverly Hills Hotel [in 1987]. It made no sense financially, but he was right and I was wrong. Over time, the value has increased.”Kevin Shannon, a vice chairman with CB Richard Ellis, said studio properties were outperforming the weak office market. “The fundamentals for entertainment have been improving and the trend for this studio specifically has been improving,” he said.The Culver Studios represented an unusually large site with potential for development in west Los Angeles, “LA’s most desirable sub-market”, he said, and “an emotional property”Mr Shannon said he expected “entertainment moguls and high net worth people” from nearby Beverly Hills and Malibu and from “several continents” to show interest. Ren-Mar Studios, where I Love Lucy was filmed, was sold last year to the entrepreneur behind Oakley sunglasses.Mr Cella would not disclose details of the Culver Studios’ finances but said the current owners had increased profitability as they cut staff from about 60 to 48, erected new buildings and secured permission to build another 200,000 square feet of new office space. Known in the RKO years as “40 Acres”, the site never covered more than 29 acres and is now 14 acres.Despite a growing television production market, sales had dropped since the financial crisis set in as big studios make fewer films and Hollywood faces more competition from other US states and international locations offering tax breaks to filmmakers.“It’ll come back, because California is where filmmakers should be. The weather is better and you can fake a lot of places in California. You can fake New York in LA, where you can’t do that in New Mexico or Georgia,” Mr Cella said. “Other places don’t have the city grit New York or Chicago have. You see something shot in Toronto and think ‘that’s too clean’,” he said.The sale comes after Pinewood Shepperton’s largest shareholder was blocked by another investor this summer from taking the UK studio behind James Bond private. Viacom’s Paramount Pictures last week announced plans to spend $700m over 25 years to improve its 62-acre Hollywood studio lot and neighbouring properties.● Paramount announced a restructuring on Tuesday that will combine its home entertainment, digital and licensing businesses into one division, reporting to Dennis Maguire, its current home entertainment president. Viacom released no details about the financial impact of the move, which reflects a fast-changing film market where DVD sales are declining and online streaming services from companies, including Netflix and Amazon, are gaining ground.The changes will also centralise global theatrical management operations in Los Angeles and fold Paramount’s online games and digital content creation activities into other businesses."

Citigroup was up 4.3 per cent to $29.83 and Morgan Stanley rose 2.7 per cent to $16.77.Financials was the best-performing sector in the S&P 500 index, down only 0.5 per cent. But, in a reminder of the sector’s ongoing legal problems, Citigroup and Bank of America were both among the 11 banks sued by broker Charles Schwab for manipulating Libor rates by underestimating borrowing costs from 2007 onwards.Apple shares declined 0.7 per cent to $373.72 but still outperformed the market, despite the news that Steve Jobs will resign as chief executive. Mark Moskowitz, analyst at JPMorgan, said “A CEO change had [already] been partly discounted.” He reiterated his “overweight” rating, adding: “We expect the stock to be under pressure but not encounter a downdraft.”Some dissent was offered by Mike Abramsky, of RBC Capital Markets, who said Mr Jobs’ departure added “above-average risk” to his “outperform” rating.“Investors may start to fret ‘what’s next’? Can Apple – now the largest company in tech – keep its ‘cool’ and wow factor? Can they remain unassailable?”The broad S&P 500 index was down 1.6 per cent at 1,159.27, dragged down by worse-than-expected jobless claims data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.5 per cent at 11,149.90.“Bank of America and Apple are just a sideshow,” Canning Smith, manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund, said. “The BofA deal will hopefully put banks on a more even keel but markets are trading on the macroeconomic situation right now and all eyes are on Jackson Hole tomorrow.“A note by Nomura strategists Ankur Mehta and Ohmsatya Ravi predicting an Obama administration initiative to allow government-backed mortgage holders to refinance at low rates, pushed homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.8 per cent to $4.24.Shares in online property search firm Zillow also jumped 15.2 per cent to $30.25, after the company reported a profit in its first quarterly results as a publicly traded company. Zillow defied the housing market slump to post revenue of $15.8m, up 116 per cent year on year.That was welcome cheer for tech investors, after four scheduled tech initial public offerings had been put back in recent weeks due to market volatility. Zillow is now trading well above its $20 IPO price, despite recent market turbulence.But traditional commercial property manager CB Richard Ellis was down 9.2 per cent at $13.76 on the web start-up’s success. Research in Motion was off 1.2 per cent to $28.22 after announcing a new music streaming service for its BlackBerry handsets.Verizon Communications was off 1.9 per cent at $35.77 after it announced the acquisition of CloudSwitch, a cloud software provider. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Verizon also announced it would allow businesses to process credit card payments via smartphones and tablets through an alliance with Intuit. But Intuit shares dropped 2.7 per cent to $44.62.Verizon’s competitor, Sprint Nextel, dropped 6.4 per cent to $3.23, as positive sentiment, stemming from reports the network will offer the iPhone 5 later this year, ebbed.Three companies to report earnings before the bell were among the biggest fallers in the S&P 500.Applied Materials, a manufacturer of semiconductor parts, lost 4.9 per cent to close at $10.81 on quarterly earnings per share of 36 cents, exactly four times the equivalent figure for the same quarter last year, and 2 cents above most expectations.Hormel Foods, which sells ready-made food staples, was down 7.3 per cent at $26.36, despite reporting quarterly earnings per share of 36 cents a share, 4 cents higher than the same quarter last year.Patterson Companies, a medical, dental and veterinary supplies company, dropped 10.2 per cent to $26.87 after reporting quarterly earnings per share of 42 cents, 3 cents lower than the previous quarter.
77;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;UK retail: demise of the high street;The move out of town is driven by high rents and changing habits;"Doling out blame for Britain’s dilapidated high streets is like detonating a cluster bomb – everyone is hit. Among the casualties are town planners and their parking restrictions, which discourage people coming into town. Then there are price-cutting supermarkets, which have killed independent stores, and also internet retailers, which have made people lazy. The government is now so concerned about the trend it has commissioned an investigation. And to prove the government’s steely resolve on the issue, it has asked Mary Portas, who offers retail consulting on a reality television programme, to run it.Britons’ shopping habits are changing. Although strolling through a quaint olde worlde-style high street full of “shoppes” is romantic, out-of-town shopping centres based around large grocery chains are cheaper and offer wider ranges. Indeed, Britons now make 14 per cent of their non-food purchases at grocery stores, three-quarters more than in 2003, says consultants CB Richard Ellis. And the recession has exacerbated the shift. The amount of space proposed for out-of-town centres has increased by two-thirds compared with pre-recession levels; town centre proposals have remained constant.Critically, high street landlords have not adjusted their expectations to these changing habits. Outside London, prime high street property is still sold at an average 5 per cent yield (20 times expected rental income), says DTZ Research. This is similar to pre-recession levels and makes these properties more expensive than some of London’s best office towers, whose blue-chip tenants are far more secure. Some high street stores have been empty for two years or more because landlords are unwilling to taper their expectations. Eventually they will, but the longer they hold out, the more customers will accept shopping is done out of town.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
78;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-05-16T21:31:03Z;Retail-exposed cannot depend on recovery;Companies need to generate income growth;Given the blood being shed on the high street by distressed listed retailers, it is remarkable how little has been lost by the larger shop landlords. Tales of woe from the sharper end of the consumer slowdown have been hard to miss, but confidence in the listed property sector has been unaffected in spite of the fact that about two-thirds of the portfolios of the property majors are invested in the retail market.This is well illustrated by the level of short selling. It is no surprise that retailers account for eight of the top 10 of stocks most borrowed that would be available to sell short, according to Data Explorers, with almost 20 per cent of stock in Dixons and HMV out on loan. There might naturally be a correlation between retailers and the owners of retail, but investors have been unfazed. In terms of the amount of stock out on loan, property stocks with high exposures to retail are generally in line with the average of between 1 and 2 per cent. Such stocks are trading at very narrow discounts to net asset value, reflecting the wider improvement in sentiment to a property sector that has seen a considerable recovery in asset values.This confidence appears justified, even if asset values across the retail property market as a whole appear dislocated to the occupier outlook. Hammerson’s occupancy rate was only narrowly below its 97 per cent target, and the other large Reits are expected to show similarly high levels when they report in the next two weeks.There is no doubt, of course, that property owners have been affected as retailers have cut store numbers to remain profitable or else simply gone bust during the past four years. The list looking to shred high street store bases is long, and likely to lead to a net reduction in UK retail space. Shopping centres have seen the largest rental correction this year, according to CB Richard Ellis, with rents down 1.1 per cent.But it is not that simple as retailers also want to grow, but only in the right places. The listed sector owns some of the UK’s best property and should benefit from retailers’ moves to switch out of less-profitable areas. There are new-store requirements from retailers such as Dixons, Mothercare and Waterstone’s, who are also looking to shrink store portfolios. There is net expansion demand from department stores such as John Lewis, as well as food retailers and overseas groups such as H&M, Forever 21 and Hollister, which want newer and larger outlets.Investors have been able to buy into this trend in the large Reits, which own or have stakes in more than half of the UK’s 25 largest centres, and are less exposed to the high street than to retail parks, which have proved a stronger part of the market. And this is where there has been the overseas demand, in particular, which has chased yields higher.However, as safe as it seems, there is now a question about future growth for the sector, particularly as yields reflect an overly positive view on rental inflation. Most lettings are actually being struck below estimated rental values and there is little prospect of strong growth outside London, while the bounce in capital values has slowed to a standstill, according to Investment Property Databank.Companies cannot rest with their prime portfolios but need to generate income growth, and this means taking some risks in places. There is even a need to acquire vacancies with new purchases, as counter-intuitive as that sounds, as this is where they can use tenant contacts to create competition, undercut rivals and drive value growth through good lettings.Companies cannot rely on the simple recovery play for growth.Swirling services sectorThe property services sector consolidation continues with DTZ finally in open play, although there is no certainty over its future shape, in spite of interest from SGP, the French company that owns a 55 per cent stake. With DTZ also comes talk linking another property group, King Sturge, with Jones Lang LaSalle of the US, in a deal of more than £150m.SGP has teamed up with BNP Paribas, which owns a sizeable real estate consultancy. There are obvious cost savings in combining DTZ and BNP. But a merger would also cause conflicts between staff, clients and brand. Meanwhile, DTZ has also been talking to buy-out and sovereign wealth funds in recent months.It would be wise to take the group private after 25 years on the exchange. Perhaps the clearest lesson from the travails of DTZ, whose share price has languished even in a property recovery, is that people businesses are often poorly suited to the public markets, particularly when carrying debt. Other private firms rumoured to be thinking of flotation – such as GVA – could well take note.dan.thomas@ft.com
79;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;European property: shopping spree;Investors snapping up retail-based real estate;"Money is pouring into the European retail sector but not into retailers themselves. Rather, commercial property investors are snapping up retail-based real estate, such as shopping centres, in the hope that shoppers have returned for good. Indeed, in the first quarter, retail-based real estate accounted for more than two-fifths of the €28bn spent on European commercial real estate. That is a higher proportion than before the financial crisis. At the same time, demand for office properties has fallen to a corresponding low, according to CB Richard Ellis, the consultants.What gives? After all, retailers are hardly strong performers. The S&P European retailers index has moved sideways during the past year and is still 20 per cent below its 2007 peak. Furthermore, the average prime retail property yields a rental return of about 5.5 per cent – a little lower than equivalent office buildings.Real estate investors are not merely living in hope; their money is going to proved ground. Almost three-quarters of all retail investments in the first quarter were shared between Germany and the UK. The gross domestic product of Germany, Europe’s strongest economy, is at an all-time high and, given that UK retail sales in April grew at their fastest rate in five years, the depressed spending levels seen at the beginning of the year may be history.But, as during the financial crisis, the debt used to fund the deals could be their undoing. The average purchase in the first quarter was plumped up with 60 per cent borrowed money, a fifth higher than last year. Low interest rates cause temptation even though buyers are sensitive to any increase – the mere threat of such by the European Central Bank helped suppress property investment in the first quarter by almost half compared with the previous quarter. Investors in property trusts should be cautious; the eyes of many property investment managers are still bigger than their stomachs.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
80;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-05-11T15:24:30Z;DTZ soars on takeover interest;;DTZ, the global real estate consultancy, has received approaches that could lead to a potential offer for the debt-laden company.Shares in the group, which have halved in the past year even in the midst of a property recovery, leapt ahead of an announcement about the approach, trading 23.4 per cent higher at 39.5p on Wednesday afternoon.DTZ said on Wednesday that it had received a number of approaches for investment in the company’s stock. There have been rumours of interest in DTZ for the past few months, in part because of the sharp fall in the share price, but also because of the dominant 55 per cent stake owned by SGP, the French family-run firm.DTZ confirmed that it had received “a number of approaches for investment in the company’s shares including a possible offer for the shares in the company”. It said that it was holding discussions with the various parties, adding that discussions were at a very preliminary stage and there was no certainty that any structure will be progressed or any offer will be made.The company’s market capitalisation has shrunk to less than £90m, but it employs more than 4,500 people worldwide and is seen as one of the best brands in real state consultancy. It also owns a large business in Asia, which is one of the fastest growing real estate markets.Traders on Wednesday suggested that rivals such as BNP Paribas Real Estate, the bank-owned consultancy, and CB Richard Ellis, the US real estate giant, could be interested. There was also talk of that the business could be taken private by SGP.DTZ declined to comment.DTZ suffered alongside its peers during the crash but has failed to recover as quickly, although the company was saved from a potential breach in its debt covenants in 2009 after SGP backed an emergency rights issue.The management was also changed, with former Barclays chief operating officer Paul Idzik stepping into the chief executive role with a mandate to turn around the company’s fortunes.Mr Idzik, who brought in former colleagues to help him run the company, has carried out a strategic review that has achieved cost savings of £75m. However, analysts still see the company as labouring under too much debt even after debt facilities were restructured at the end of last year.The group made a pre-tax loss of £6m for the six months ended 31 October 2010, although was narrowly profitable at an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation level. Net debt was £80.1m, up from £47.5m at 30 April 2010.
81;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-05-09T02:09:04Z;Property fund targets defined contributions;;The first specialist UK property fund for defined contribution pension investors is to be launched next week with a target to raise more than £1bn ($1.6bn) as it exploits the wider changes in the pensions industry.CBRE Investors has created a vehicle to tap into the rapid growth of demand among defined contribution (DC) pension investors as further traditional final salary schemes close.The fund, which has been in planning for more than five years, will be the first time that defined contribution pension investors can access a fund run by an investment manager solely focused on real estate. There are products available for pooled investment at many larger pension and insurance groups, however.Nick Preston, senior director at CBRE Investors, said the launch was in reaction to high demand among investors for a fund run by a specialist manager that knows the property sector.The CB Richard Ellis UK Property Fund has been designed to meet the needs of DC pension investors under FSA supervision and is a non-UCITS retail scheme (NURS) that will be priced and traded daily.The fund’s goal is to build a portfolio of £1bn, although Mr Preston said that the fund could grow larger depending on demand. He said that the first platform to use the fund would be announced next month. He added that the fund had been met with enthusiasm by investment consultants and platform providers who serve the DC pensions industry.The structure also has the capability to take in portfolios of direct property assets from mature DB pension schemes looking to exit their property investments in an orderly manner.It will be structured as a property authorised investment fund (PAIF), a tax efficient vehicle for UK real estate investors. It is the first daily traded PAIF to be launched, and it has a dedicated feeder fund for DC investors.The fund will invest mostly in physical property assets, although it will also invest in property equities and some cash products in order to provide daily liquidity for investors wishing to sell.Open-ended real estate funds were criticised during the crisis for not being able to cover the withdrawals from departing investors as they were not able to sell property fast enough in the falling market. This led to some blocks on redemptions and fire sales of assets.
82;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-04-18T16:05:07Z;Abu Dhabi property begins to compete;;"The price of living and working in Abu Dhabi is gradually becoming more competitive with neighbouring emirates and countries as new office space becomes available and the city’s housing costs continue to slide.Average residential rents have fallen 40 per cent in Abu Dhabi since the market’s peak in 2008, say analysts with Jones Lang LaSalle, the consultancy.The estimated 16,000 new homes scheduled to come on to the market this year – double the number of 2010 – will drive rents down further, although not enough to meet local demand for middle-income housing.“Rents will fall, but it makes Abu Dhabi more competitive with the rest of the region and internationally,” says David Dudley, the head of Jones Lang LaSalle’s Abu Dhabi office.High housing prices, particularly in 2008, were “a real concern” for companies weighing the costs of placing new employees in Abu Dhabi, says Matthew Green, a researcher with CB Richard Ellis, the property group.“Now that we’ve seen rents come off [their peak], some of that consideration is less prominent,” he says.In Dubai, a relatively ample supply of residential property relative to demand has kept prices much lower than in Abu Dhabi and pushed thousands of office workers to make the
90-minute daily commute between the two emirates, says Mark Morris Jones, a director with CB Richard Ellis.While the relative vibrancy of Dubai is likely to maintain its attraction for many of those commuters, analysts estimate that falling prices and the improving quality of homes will gradually draw some back to Abu Dhabi.Because of a lack of supply in Abu Dhabi, says Mr Morris Jones, “the premium to being in central Abu Dhabi is equivalent to being in a high-end apartment.“You have a pretty rubbish-quality product which is letting at astronomical prices,” he adds.New office space, such as the development of Sowwah Square, the first phase of which is expected to be completed this year, is also likely to help Abu Dhabi lure new companies while reducing the rent that developers can command.Jones Lang LaSalle estimates that new commercial developments will bring more than 300,000 sq m of high-quality office space to the market this year.“[Abu Dhabi’s] going to be able to compete more with Dubai, which has had that quality office space for a while,” says Mr Green.Yet falling prices and new developments are not expected to fulfil the city’s growing need for middle-income housing.The museums, including the Louvre Abu Dhabi, being built on Saadiyat Island, aim to establish a local arts community, and an expanded industrial zone will bring in more office workers as the city attempts to diversify its economy away from government employment and the oil and gas industry.The government has said that new developments must include some affordable housing offered on long-term leases.Developers say that this new policy, and the shift of the market’s focus from property investors to residents themselves, means the demand for reasonably priced housing is more prominent than before.“From that perspective, there is an opportunity and a need for it,” says Sami Asad, the chief executive of Aldar, the property developer.“You focus on the actual need of the market and you move accordingly.”"
83;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-03-23T16:40:14Z;Stamp duty: the word of the day;But there was no announcement of a reform of the overall stamp duty system;Stamp duty seems to be the ‘word of the day’ when it comes to how the budget will impact the property market.The government has announced that it will a) crackdown on stamp duty land tax avoidance schemes b) reform the stamp duty land tax rules applied to bulk purchases for residential properties c) announce in the autumn the outcome of its review of the stamp duty relief for first-time buyers.Frustratingly for the property industry and consumers however, there was no announcement of a reform of the overall stamp duty system.As Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said: “The current ‘slab’ system results in the bunching of transactions at prices just below the thresholds. It’s time Stamp Duty in its entirety was reformed.”Most have welcomed the government’s attempt to stimulate investment into residential property by reforming the stamp duty paid on investment portfolio sales.The change will mean that investors will pay tax based on the individual property prices rather than the total purchase price.Property experts say this will remove a significant barrier to institutional investment in the private rented sector.According to Mark Collins, head of residential at CBRE, its research suggests that institutional investors have allocated around £7.5 billion worth of funds towards residential property. “So by removing what was a large disincentive we should see more of this money invested in the sector,” he said.

Germany, closely followed by Central and Eastern Europe.Combined, the two regions picked up more than half the vote in the annual CBRE survey, completed by 340 investors.Peter Damesick, CBRE’s chief economist for Emea, says strong German economic growth is attracting investors.“Poland, the Czech republic and Slovakia are being pulled along by the German locomotive,” he explains, adding these are the most sought after investment locations in the CEE region.Another surprise thrown up by the research is that retail investments have pipped offices to the top spot in terms of investor desirability.“Prime offices in core markets have repriced quickly,” says Mr Damesick. “Retail markets in Poland, the Czech republic and Slovakia have a small amount of retail space when compared to the size of their growing consumer economies, hence the attraction.”

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
86;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-02-27T22:28:02Z;Interest soaring in London land;;Competition for land in London is hitting pre-recession levels, as international investors prepare to inject more than £5bn into the city’s lucrative residential property market.The money, more than £1bn of which has been raised since the start of the year, will target high-end developments and could lead to the construction of about 10,000 homes in the capital. The wave of interest is causing land prices to soar, as the investors bid aggressively for new sites, according to the companies operating in the capital’s already congested housebuilding market.“That money just wasn’t there before the beginning of the year and has really started to appear as people move from protection to investment mode,” said Rob Perrins, chief executive of Berkeley Group, London’s largest housebuilder.“The upshot is that we are now seeing a lot more of these people at land auctions and it is pushing up the cost of getting hold of sites which already have planning consent and can be developed quickly.”London is particularly attractive to investors because its property market has been relatively insulated from the pressures felt elsewhere in the UK on the back of the government austerity measures.Rents have grown strongly in the past year on solid tenant demand, although this rise has recently tailed off.Even so, it is forecast that as many as one in five households will live in privately rented accommodation by 2015, an increase from one in seven at present.The challenge for investors is to find developers with the capacity to build enough to create economies of scale in a relatively low-yielding asset class. One strategy has been to focus on the niche, high-end residential sector, where supply is short and demand from overseas buyers high.Carlyle, the private equity group, last year agreed to buy and fund the development of a new block of prime residences in Chelsea, which is expected to be the first of several such deals.Mr Perrins said his company, had not been approached as a development partner. However, other London-based housebuilders have entered into ventures.Aviva, the insurance group, last year teamed up with east-London developer Telford as part of a bid to create a £1bn portfolio of new-build rental apartments.Barratt, the UK’s largest housebuilder by volume, last week said it was keen to find a partner to build up a rental portfolio.As well as the £5.3bn targeting London, investors have raised £2.2bn to set up residential developments in other parts of the UK, according to new research published by CB Richard Ellis, the world’s largest property services group.“The total level of interest from investors in the UK residential market relative to the overall level of investment and development is clearly significant, but pinpointing the investors that are ready to commit and at what cost of capital is the key,” said Chris Lacey, executive director at CB Richard Ellis.
87;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-02-27T20:52:45Z;Traditional lenders quitting property;;More than a third of the lenders that once backed UK property have left the market following the crash, contributing to a growing shortage of debt to the sector.There are 107 senior lenders that have a commercial real estate loan book in the UK, according to a new report, but of these only 69 are still actively lending with the rest having pulled out since 2007.Debt provision to real estate investment and development is now dominated by German Pfandbrief lenders – banks that issue covered bonds. However, the traditional UK clearing banks have the greater share of the market in regional cities.The situation is expected to get worse in the next year when the introduction of the Basel III rules will require banks to hold more capital against loans and the huge wall of loan maturities coming through this year, according to CB Richard Ellis (CBRE), the property consultancy.It expects debt from almost all types of lenders to decrease and to become substantially more expensive in 2011. There has already been a jump in the cost of longer-term debt given expectations of interest rate rises.Of the 69 lenders open to business in the UK, CBRE says that a number are lending only cautiously and most are employing conservative criteria against which they assess opportunities.Natale Giostra, head of European debt advisory at CBRE Real Estate Finance, said: “There are lots of lenders with appetite to lend, but they are being very selective and there will be a lot of cherry-picking in the loans they are willing to make.“There is no one bank that is willing to offer every type of loan now. Whereas before, if you were a UK borrower, you would go to Royal Bank of Scotland for everything, or if you were Irish you went to Anglo Irish, now borrowers need to cherry-pick themselves and approach specific banks with specific types of deals.”However, the insurance sector appears to be gearing up for a greater involvement in real estate debt. CBRE predicts a structural shift in the market as non-traditional lenders enter, with insurance companies likely to have the greatest impact and gain the most market share fastest.“The arrival of new debt providers is encouraging, but also brings complexity as borrowers will need to establish new relationships as several European and big UK banks have effectively withdrawn from new lending for the time being,” said Ms Giostra.German Pfandbrief banks and UK banks are the largest groups of lenders to the market and are expected to continue to hold a dominant position for some time.Since the onset of the downturn, 38 lenders with UK exposure have closed to new lending, of which 70 per cent were European banks, building societies and investment banks, the traditional providers of debt to the industry.
88;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-02-15T22:19:45Z;CBRE to buy ING real estate business;;CB Richard Ellis, the world’s largest property services group, has agreed to acquire the majority of the real estate investment management business of ING Group for $940m.The cash purchase will make CBRE the largest real estate fund manager in the world with almost $100bn under management. It includes almost all of the ING Real Estate (ING REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as Clarion Real Estate Securities, its US global real estate listed securities business.The ING operations will be merged with CBRE’s Global Investment Management business, CBRE Investors, which will continue to be an independently operated from its advisory and services units.CBRE said the businesses “fit together exceptionally well” given CBRE Investors has primarily focused on value-added and separate accounts and ING has primarily focused on core funds and global listed real estate securities funds.It expects little overlap in the client bases, with a majority of CBRE Investors’ clients in the US and a majority of ING REIM’s based in Europe. CBRE expects to incur pre-tax transaction costs of $150m, including financing, retention and integration costs. The acquisitions are expected to close in the second half of 2011 and are subject to approval by stakeholders.CBRE will also acquire $55m of equity investments in funds from ING and potentially interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia. It will not acquire ING’s US private market real estate investment management company.ING’s business will add $59.8bn of funds under management to CBRE’s existing investment platform, CBRE Investors, which has $37.6bn of assets under management. The ING acquisition includes $29.5bn in Europe, $5.1bn in Asia, $19.4bn in listed securities and $5.8bn in global fund of funds.Brett White, chief executive of CBRE, said: “ING will provide us with a significantly enhanced ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programmes and strategies. The combined enterprise will further diversify our revenue sources and, as the global market leader, we will redefine success in real estate investment management.”CBRE will finance the acquisition with cash and borrowings under its secured credit facility.ING will also sell one its real estate units, Clarion Partners, to management for $100m. The sales are expected to deliver an after-tax gain on disposal of €500m ($674m).Jan Hommen, chief executive of ING Group, said: “With these transactions we continue to deliver on our strategic objectives of reducing exposure to real estate, simplifying our company and further strengthening our capital base.”ING Insurance has agreed to continue its asset management mandate with CBRE as the manager of the funds. ING Bank will continue to have an equity interest in some funds in Europe, Asia, the US and Australia. These will be sold over time as it reduces its exposure to real estate.
89;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2011-01-14T17:16:51Z;CBRE in talks to create $100bn property group;;"CB Richard Ellis, the US-listed property services firm, has emerged as favourite to acquire the majority of ING’s real estate group to create the world’s largest property funds business with more than $100bn under management.CBRE, the world’s largest property consultancy with 29,000 staff and more than 300 offices worldwide, is the frontrunner to buy the global real estate investment management platform in a deal valued at about €1bn, according to sources close to the negotiations. Final terms are expected to be agreed in the next few weeks.ING, the Dutch pension company, has been in exclusive negotiations over the past two weeks to sell the business, which has more than €65bn of assets under management across the world. It is not known at this point if the talks will result in the sale of all or the majority of the business. CB Richard Ellis is being advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch; ING is being advised by Morgan Stanley.If successful in completing the deal, CBRE is expected to merge the ING real estate business with its existing fund management platform, called CBRE Investors, which already has about $36bn in assets under management. Other bidding parties included Vornado Realty Trust, the US real estate investment trust, and Jones Lang LaSalle, a rival property services group.The deal would be a transformational for the US group, catapulting it to become the world’s largest investment manager as well as the largest adviser. The stable fee income from the property fund management platform is expected to complement its advisory business, which traditionally generates fees through instructions on investment sales and leasing that is strongly linked to the volatile property cycle.ING Real Estate Investment Management, part of ING Group, has been considering offers for the business over the past year as it seeks to raise funds from the sale of non-core businesses. A spokeswoman declined to comment on the process. A spokesman for CBRE also declined to comment.The company manages a €65.3bn on behalf of other ING units, as well as third party institutional investors and listed property funds.CBRE Investors manages direct real estate investments for separate accounts and closed-end vehicles as well as real estate debt and real estate-related debt securities across 20 offices in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Middle East.The fund management group has been able to leverage CBRE’s market knowledge as the leading real estate services company in the world, although it sits separately from the consultancy group owing to avoid potential clashes with other clients.Having gone through a testing time during the global downturn in property during 2008 and 2009, when some fund managers were blamed for poor asset selections and use of too much debt, the industry has recovered strongly in 2010 with solid growth in assets under management as investors have sought out the income yield from real estate investment."
90;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-12-13T22:10:40Z;Leading retailers shop for new space;;The UK’s largest property companies have instigated talks with retailers about kick-starting a new wave of shopping centre developments.Retail expansion plans have been curtailed by the shortage of development in the UK since the end of the last boom, which has led to a build-up of demand property companies hope to exploit in dusting down plans for new malls.Hammerson, the Anglo-French mall owner, has started negotiations on lease terms with retailers across several shopping centre developments that had been frozen during the recession. These include regional malls such as the £600m Sevenstone in Sheffield and the 1.5m sq ft Eastgate Quarter in Leeds, as well as the expansion and reconfiguration of an existing mall in Glasgow.David Atkins, chief executive of Hammerson, said: “Compared to this time a year ago there is definitely more interest in new space from existing and prospective retailers. Having emerged from the recession in relatively good shape, many of the country’s successful retailers, and expanding international retailers, are increasingly keen to secure units in the best retail locations in order to grow their sales.”Land Securities, the UK’s largest property company, has begun talks over a shopping centre in Glasgow, having already announced plans to start building a new mall in Leeds– the first major retail development to be confirmed since the end of the recession. This comes amid interest from overseas investors in prime UK retail property, most notably the interest from US mall owner Simon Property in Capital Shopping Centres, and the recent sale of half of Westfield’s new centre in Stratford.Other than Westfield’s mall, which will be opened next year, there are few new major retail schemes in development after most projects were halted during the credit crisis.Construction activity has fallen to just a quarter of 2007 levels. Although there is a pipeline of consented schemes totalling 61.2m sq ft, according to CB Richard Ellis, the property consultancy, construction has yet to start on about 90 per cent of them. CBRE predicts the pipeline will fall back to about 40m sq ft as planning consents expire.About 8m sq ft of shopping centre space was completed in 2008 as schemes started during the boom were finished, including Westfield London. By 2009, this total was less than 3.5m sq ft and is expected to be between 2m and 4m sq ft for the next two years. Other than Stratford, there are only two other significant schemes opening in 2011.This lack of new space has caused growing frustration among major retailers keen to expand by opening more stores. In the past, expansion targets have been in part predicated on opening in new retail centres.Large department stores – often known as “anchor” tenants – such as John Lewis and Marks and Spencer are keen to expand into new schemes. Almost two years ago, John Lewis said it was being forced to scale down its ambition to open at least half a dozen department stores as developers shelved plans.Jeremy Collins, property director of John Lewis, said: “The economic recession dramatically changed the financial profile and viability of major development projects and, unfortunately, our projects were not immune from that.”Mr Collins says the hiatus in developments “has obviously slowed down our expansion programme in terms of our department store coverage”.He said John Lewis still had ambitions to open stores in cities such as Leeds and Oxford, where the Crown Estate and Land Securities have acquired the Westgate shopping centre and were working on plans for an extension.“There are a number of projects that were on hold that are starting to gain new momentum,” he said. “But it’s too early to determine when these projects may actually start to be built. We are certainly seeing a lot more activity in that development pipeline now.”There is also considerable demand for new shopping centre space among the fashion brands, from recent entrants such as Forever21, Apple, Superdry, Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister and Gilly Hicks, which are looking to gain market share, to more established retailers such as Next, New Look, Primark and Zara.Malcolm Dalgleish, chairman of European retail at CB Richard Ellis said retail demand was focused on modern, well-located centres. “Retailers rely on space being built for expansion and to roll out new formats. They don’t want the wrong space, which means secondary towns and centres are likely to remain under pressure. This pent-up demand for the right space will mean developers will probably be able to drive harder terms on new centres.”Retailers have less interest in taking space in older shopping centres. Research by DTZ, a property agency, shows only about 100 of the 840 centres in the UK would be regarded as prime. This has caused an overhang of poorer quality centres – the legacy of the 1980s development boom.

Coming out of an equally brutal financial downturn, those buildings are proving valuable. Indeed, commercial real estate in central and eastern Europe is experiencing a renaissance. In the third quarter, transactions in the region rose almost two-thirds, while Europe in aggregate saw a 6 per cent drop, according to property consultants CB Richard Ellis.Foreign investment in eastern European commercial property is nothing new. During the pre-crisis boom, managers sick of investment yields of 4 per cent or less in developed markets found half as much again behind the former iron curtain. After a recessionary hiatus, they are returning. This is not surprising. Prime office property in the region now yields almost 10 per cent, compared to typical yields of about 6 per cent in the west. Rents should be on a rising trend: gross domestic product is expected to increase twice as fast in Poland and Russia, the two most popular eastern destinations, as in the eurozone.The overall volume of transactions in the east is still small – in the third quarter they comprised about 7 per cent of the value of European deals – but their increase indicates real estate investors’ desire for diversity. That has paid off, even without eastern European exposure. Over the past three years, the shareholder return provided by pan-European funds such as Unibail-Rodamco, and Klepierre have comfortably outperformed those of region-specific peers British Land and Land Securities.The main hurdle for eastern European investment remains financing. The travails of lenders familiar with the region such as Hypo Real Estate have blunted lending, and thus investment potential, while stable banks have been reluctant to risk the “unknown unknowns” the former communist states can harbour. But for those who can buy in, the future looks bright.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
92;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-11-15T01:59:12Z;UK remains a target for world’s retailers;;The UK is set to remain a target market for overseas retailers, as store groups ramp up their expansion plans in Europe, the Middle East and Africa amid increasing confidence, according to a property consultancy.CB Richard Ellis said confidence had returned to retailers in the EMEA region, with more groups intending to extend their store networks next year.It found that 77 per cent of the retailers surveyed were planning to open more than five stores in the EMEA region by the end of next year. This is a significant increase from 12 months ago, when half of the retailers intended to open less than five stores this year.More than half of the retailers surveyed intended to open between one and 20 stores, with the average at about 30 stores.“Intentions are much greater for 2011 than they were for 2010,” said Peter Gold, head of cross-border retail, EMEA, at CBRE.The supermarket sector is set to be the most active, followed by coffee and restaurant chains, as well as the value and denim fashion sector.CBRE found that 28 per cent of mid-range fashion retailers are aiming to open 30 or more stores in 2011, higher than the 16 per cent reported a year earlier.Germany is the most popular country for expansion given its populous cities. Retailers are also eyeing Poland, France and Spain, where property is more affordable.The UK is the fifth most popular market, with 29 per cent of the retailers surveyed targeting the country.A number of overseas retailers, including Coach, the US handbag and accessories retailer, Victoria’s Secret, the lingerie chain, and young fashion groups Forever 21, and Vero Moda are expanding in the UK.Mr Gold said overseas retailers used the UK as a “stepping stone to broader international [expansion]”. A presence in the UK also provided retailers with “international credibility”. “Everyone has a plan for the UK,” he added.However, retailers are also eyeing emerging EMEA markets, which accounted for more than half of the top 20 target cities.CBRE found that retailers preferred to consolidate and expand into new cities in countries where they already have a presence, instead of entering new markets.
93;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-10-19T18:23:00Z;Blackfriars tower site in administration;;A 52-storey skyscraper project on London’s South Bank backed by Sergei Polonsky, the Russian property tycoon, has been put into administration by Royal Bank of Scotland.The Beetham Organisation, a Liverpool-based developer, and Mirax, the property company founded by Mr Polonsky, planned to build a large mixed-use scheme on Blackfriars Road that was once expected to have an end value of as much as £1bn.The site has planning consent for 64 luxury apartments as well as a 261-bedroom Jumeirah hotel. The project was expected to cost £500m to build.Beetham said RBS had appointed administrators to the One Blackfriars Road project “following the breakdown of the relationship between RBS and Beetham’s Russian partners”.Beetham said that it hoped to take the project out of administration “in association with new investors”, but acknowledged that the site could be sold. BDO Stoy Hayward has been appointed administrator. Beetham said that it would ask for bids of more than £150m should the site come to market.Knight Frank has been instructed to act on behalf of Beetham and Mirax, while CB Richard Ellis is acting for RBS. The original loan was provided by RBS, although it has been shared with other banks.There have been question marks over the future of the tower following the impact of the property crash on investors behind the scheme.Beetham is more broadly seeking to refinance loans on projects once valued at more than £1.7bn. This includes the debt behind an office scheme near Aldgate, which has been transferred to Nama, the Irish real estate loan vehicle.The scheme is the latest real estate venture to be pushed into administration by either RBS or Lloyds, which are both carrying large exposure to the property sector, having been the main lenders during the boom.
94;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-10-04T03:04:25Z;Cross-border investment centres on London;;Almost half of the €23bn (£20bn, $31.6bn) invested across international regions in real estate was committed to just five cites since the beginning of 2009, with London by far the most active with more than a quarter of such investments.Cross-border real estate investment has been unusually restricted as global investors have narrowed search criteria to focus on safe property assets in key financial capitals.London has been the main beneficiary of this search for quality assets, with groups outside Europe committing €6bn since the beginning of 2009, according to CB Richard Ellis (CBRE), which is more than six times greater than the next city, Paris.CBRE said that investors outside domestic markets gravitated towards the largest, most liquid commercial property markets. London was also the most international market, with buyers of 27 different nationalities completing acquisitions over the period.London has been targeted in particular by Asian investors looking to diversify funds into prime property, with a number of large deals carried out by the state pension funds of South Korea and Malaysia in recent months.Last week, Oxford Properties, the real estate arm of a Canadian pension fund, purchased a half stake in Watermark Place from UBS for £200m.Such large investments have helped boost the recovery in prices for real estate in London over the past year.Overall inter-regional investment since the beginning of 2009 was down 83 per cent to €22.4bn from the boom period of 2006 and the first half of 2007, which showed that the market’s volumes remained depressed.Five cities accounted for 43 per cent of inter-regional investment, including Paris, New York and Sydney.Jonathan Hull, head of capital markets for Europe at CBRE, said: “As the market becomes more stable over the coming months, we expect that the major inter-regional investors will broaden horizons and that London will become less dominant as a destination for international capital.”According to separate research by King Sturge, the property consultancy, there are other European office markets in recovery outside London that may be more in focus going forward.In western Europe, the clearest office markets in recovery are London, Geneva and Paris, benefiting from the recovery in the financials sector.In eastern Europe, the emerging economies of Russia and Turkey have seen a rebound in offices owing to a recovery in exports and commodity prices.●Savills, the property agent, has identified just 12 real estate lenders willing to lend larger amounts above £20m to the sector, including Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander as well as nine German banks.
95;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-09-24T19:21:03Z;Aviva eyes new rental homes fund;;Aviva is in talks with a London housebuilder to build US-style mass-produced rental homes for a new fund.The life assurer has approached a number of leading builders in south-east England with offers to fund and build privately rented accommodation.It has identified a large site owned by Telford Homes to the east of London as the first in its plans to create a £1bn ($1.58bn) portfolio of new-build residential rental properties for the first fund of its type in the UK.Aviva wants to create a new investment fund to buy and rent out swaths of new-build residential property in partnership with CB Richard Ellis, the property consultancy, and a leading US residential manager. It will fund the construction of purpose-built rental residential blocks of 100 units or more in the south-east.Aviva is said to be aiming for the first close of its equity raising by the end of the year and wants to have lined up potential “seeding” sites for the fund by then.Telford has been approached by a number of different investors interested in developing rental accommodation.A person familiar with the company’s thinking said: “There is demand for secure and affordable rental options and there are discussions going on with a number of interested parties.”The strategy is part of a wider push to create a new UK asset class for investors in large-scale multi-family rented housing to alleviate the pressure on the under-supplied housing market.The previous government and the Homes & Communities Agency, the housing quango, have encouraged institutions to invest in the sector, although plans were dealt a blow this month after the Treasury ruled out the introduction of financial incentives.However, institutional fund managers are confident that they can raise and successfully invest funds in the sector, with those close to the discussions describing government financial support as a “useful but not essential”.“This has to stand on its own feet,” said one investor.There are also funds being planned by asset managers such as LaSalle Investment Management, while a joint venture between Aegon and Terrace Hill would be framed around an existing portfolio of rental properties rather than new-build.
96;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-09-22T15:23:42Z;Supply stymies UAE property recovery;New homes and offices curb prices;Like many residents of the United Arab Emirates, Richard Bath, a structural engineer for Aecom, a US contracting group, works in Abu Dhabi but lives in Dubai, where rents are cheaper and there are more lifestyle options.After a property crash last year, rental declines have slowed in Dubai, but accommodation costs in Abu Dhabi have dropped more than 25 per cent this year, says CB Richard Ellis, the consultancy. This is tempting Mr Bath to move to the UAE capital, where he is working on the Cleveland Clinic project on Sowwa Island.“It’s still not as cheap as Dubai, but a lot of property is coming on to the market, which has brought prices down,” he says. “And it would be nice not to have to do the commute.”If enough of Dubai’s residents decide to move closer to jobs in Abu Dhabi, this could put further pressure on housing prices and rents in Dubai, stymieing government hopes of a property recovery there next year.Colliers International’s house price index for Dubai fell 4 per cent quarter-on- quarter between April and June this year, the first contraction in 12 months. The consultancy warned that the completion of new housing units – coupled with declining rental incomes – would continue to weigh on house prices.The consultancy estimates that another 33,000 units could be released on to the market by the end of this year. Even if not all are completed on time, “the market simply cannot absorb the additional supply unless the population grows and/or the release of stock is slowed down”, Ian Albert, Colliers’ regional director, said in the report.The inflow of former Abu Dhabi residents partially stemmed the rents and price declines in western parts of Dubai, such as the Dubai Marina, Jumeirah Beach Residences and Jumeirah Lake Towers. These areas are now among those most at risk of further price and rental declines if enough residents return to Abu Dhabi, analysts say.“Increasing supply of housing and lower rental prices in Abu Dhabi will place further downward pressure on Dubai rental prices,” says Monica Malik, chief economist at EFG-Hermes. “Why would you make that drive every day if you could help it?”While Abu Dhabi may not yet be suffering from the same extent of oversupply – rents remain 30 per cent to 50 per cent higher than in Dubai, according to various estimates – the UAE capital’s property market is also spluttering.Tasweek, a local real estate consultancy, estimates that 12,000 to 15,000 apartments will be completed within the year.A glut of commercial property coming to the market could exacerbate the residential rental declines, as some companies have previously had to be based in villas. The consultancy predicts that Abu Dhabi’s office market will be over-supplied by the end of this year, and record an additional 1.2m sq m of supply before the end of 2012.Farouk Soussa, chief economist for the Middle East at Citigroup, says Dubai will continue to benefit from its haven status for residents of nearby countries such as India, Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan, and argues that Abu Dhabi has “pent-up demand from many that have been forced to share accommodation”.Nonetheless, analysts and economists say the overall UAE property market is still far from a recovery, given the amount of residential and commercial units expected to hit the market in the next few years.“I can’t see a convincing reason for why prices and rents should not continue to drop for the foreseeable future. Demand is in limbo, while even more supply continues to come online,” says Mohamed Jaber, an economist at Morgan Stanley in Dubai.“Either they bring in more people [into the country], or oversupply will continue to pressure prices and rents,” he adds.
97;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-09-06T18:41:32Z;Top-end retailers snap up Bond St premises;;Upmarket retailers have accounted for more than three-quarters of property acquisitions in Bond Street in the past year as demand for luxury goods grows.Retailers are linked to more than £250m ($385m) of the acquisition of properties around the prime West End spot, says CB Richard Ellis, the property consultancy, helping to send capital values past their previous peak for well-located buildings.International shoppers continued to flock to the west End for luxury retail goods, which has meant that some retailers in the sector have been eager to expand into property ownership as well as occupation of the well-placed outlets in the best parts of Bond Street and Oxford Street.Retailer owners now represent about a quarter of the key jewellery quarter between Conduit Street and Piccadilly, for example, according to CB Richard Ellis, up from less than 15 per cent of ownership on the street two years ago.Active retailers have included Hermès, Max Mara, Chanel and Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, while other deals have been completed by more mainstream retailers such as H&M and Bestseller.Some retailers have acquired stores for their own use, looking to own the buildings in which they spend tens of millions of pounds on glamorous interiors. Others have seen acquisitions as a hedge against the high rents that they are paying elsewhere, allowing them to generate income from competitors.Phil Cann, executive director for retail capital markets at CBRE, said the move into ownership reflects a spike in rents.“The competition for key retail stores is so great that retailers are prepared to take a long-term view to secure representation through ownership of prime buildings. The rental increases have been driven by investment by retailers in improving their stores and lease premiums, the cost of which often represents a large proportion of the value of buildings.”Rents in the area have broken records in recent months on the back of the strong retail sales growth, with a rental spike of 25 per cent in the core jewellery pitch in the past year.Many of the sellers have been Irish investors needing to dispose of properties to help solve financial problems. This has meant that more property has come to the market than usual in an area noted for long-term ownership.Irish investors represented £240m of recent disposals. The National Asset Management Agency, the Irish “bad bank” that holds the troubled loans made to property investors, is expected to be crucial to the future of market volumes, with CBRE research suggesting that it could come to control about £400m of assets in the area.
98;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-09-02T22:52:41Z;Suitors line up for Regent Street;;The Crown Estate, which controls sovereign land and property in the UK, has drawn up a shortlist of potential investors in its £1.6bn Regent Street estate.The group, which owns almost all of the property on Regent Street, is in talks with four parties about selling a 25 per cent stake for more than £400m.The list of investment partners is thought to comprise sovereign wealth and state pension funds from Europe and North America, including the Norwegian government’s pension fund and at least one of the major Canadian pension funds.The Crown Estate declined to comment on the identity of parties on its shortlist but said they were all groups that would prove suitable partners for the long term.It said that it would remain the landlord to the almost 1,000 leaseholders around Regent Street. “We have shortlisted parties for a 25 per cent stake in Regent Street. Four parties will make detailed proposals to us this autumn.”The organisation, which controls a £6.6bn portfolio that has been handed down the centuries by the Royal family, is seen to have a preference for a passive and long-term investor such as a sovereign-linked fund. It would also be seen as a neat fit given its own sovereign status.The Regent Street estate includes some of the most desirable retail outlets in the UK, with the Crown having gradually replaced tourist stores with retailers such as Apple over the past few years. Stephen Hubbard, deputy chairman of CB Richard Ellis, is advising the Crown.Briefing notes detailing the process are expected to be sent to retailers and stakeholders on Friday. The Crown is keen to emphasise that the control of the estate will not be handed to another group. The partner will be given a share of a head lease created for the estate, with the Crown retaining the freehold and management.The Crown Estate wants a partner to help fund improvements and future developments. It is not allowed to borrow and returns revenue surpluses to the public via the exchequer, which means that it is constrained in raising money for new developments.It had considered a public flotation of a vehicle such as a real estate investment trust that could have owned the Regent Street property, although these plans were shelved last year.
99;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-07-28T21:00:03Z;Wall St falls on durable goods data and poor forecasts;;US equities fell on Wednesday after lower-than-expected orders for durable goods, a mixed picture from the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book and cautious outlooks from Boeing and ArcelorMittal weighed on market sentiment.The S&P 500 closed down 0.7 per cent at 1,106.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to close at 10,497.88 and the Nasdaq was 1 per cent lower to close at 2,264.56.Before the opening bell, data showing unexpectedly low orders for durable goods added to concerns that economic growth may have slowed in the second quarter. New orders for long-lasting US manufactured goods dropped 1 per cent in June after a revised 0.8 per cent fall in May, making the decline the largest since last August. Analysts had expected orders to rise 1 per cent.But the markets did not fall any further when the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book was released later in the day. The Book, which is a wider survey of business, said that the US economy was growing but that there were signs of a slowdown in some regions over the past two months.The S&P has hovered around its 200-day moving average for a third session in a row. Ray Velazquez, managing director of Mizuho Securities, said that in spite of a better than expected earnings season stocks would trade in a tight range for the next quarter or two. He said concerns about the economy meant investors would pay little attention to a stock’s fundamentals until unemployment came down.Both Boeing and ArcelorMittal beat expectations in the second quarter but were cautious about the rest of the year.Boeing reported a second-quarter net profit of $1.06 per share, beating the forecast of $1.01 per share. But the aircraft manufacturer said its profit outlook was lower than analysts’ consensus. The shares dropped 1.9 per cent to $67.32.US-listed shares in ArcelorMittal fell 2.8 per cent to $31.11 after it was also cautious about its outlook, warning that the combination of slowing growth in China, a seasonal drop in activity and higher raw material costs would push down third-quarter earnings by up to 30 per cent.The world’s biggest steelmaker beat expectations in its second quarter, with net income at $1.7bn, after a loss of $792m for the same quarter of last year.Century Aluminum plummeted 9.3 per cent to $9.57 after it reported lower-than-expected net earnings of $5.1m for the second quarter, which were helped by a gain on forward contracts.Some companies did rise after reporting earnings, with Sprint Nextel nudging up 0.2 per cent to $4.84. The US mobile phone carrier said its net loss had widened to $760m, or 25 cents a share, from $384m, or 13 cents, a year earlier. But fewer monthly bill-paying customers left than analysts had expected.The world’s largest commercial real estate broker, CB Richard Ellis Group, jumped 7.6 per cent to $16.58 after it moved into the black and reported its strongest revenue growth since 2007. It announced earnings of 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of 2 cents per share a year ago.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil and gas group , was flat at $54.44. It reported better than expected profit for the quarter and said it would sell its stake in Lukoil, Russia’s largest independent oil company.Shares in CVS Caremark, the largest US provider of prescription drugs, rose 3.1 per cent to $31.54 after the company signed a 12-year contract with Aetna, the health insurer, and in spite of it lowering its forecasts. For the full year, earnings excluding some items will be at least $2.68 a share, compared with an earlier minimum of $2.77.Comcast shares rose 1.2 per cent to $19.56 after it reported a better than expected 6 per cent rise in quarterly revenue. But the cable company’s profit was cut by fees paid as part of its acquisition of NBC Universal, falling to $884m compared with $967m for the same period a year before.In deal news, American Oil & Gas gained 6.3 per cent to $7.11. Hess Corporation will acquire the oil and gas exploration and development company.
100;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-07-27T23:09:57Z;CBRE upbeat on global recovery;;CB Richard Ellis Group, the world’s largest real estate consultancy, has reported the strongest growth in revenue and earnings since 2007 as it has benefited from the global recovery in commercial property activity.CBRE, whose main business is advising on the acquisition and leasing of commercial property around the world, has been one of the main beneficiaries of improving market conditions. Commercial property markets slumped for almost two years after peaking in 2007, but have stabilised in most countries over the past year.Brett White, chief executive of CBRE, told the Financial Times that the rebound in global commercial real estate was progressing apace. “We are a good proxy for the global property market. Virtually all global economies are in early stages of recovery and others such as China are in full-blown expansion phase, and [so] the majority of property markets are either flat or slightly improved.”Mr White said that occupiers were more optimistic on the mid- to long-term horizon, with a more normal market for lease terms, which tended to be a forward indicator for job growth. He pointed out that rents were rising in 48 of the 55 markets tracked by CBRE in Europe, while yields – which measure rental income as a percentage of property value – on property transactions had begun to narrow again.The US saw a strong increase in transactions over the past year, while Europe also produced robust growth in the period, fuelled by recovering property sales markets in the larger economies such as the UK, Germany and France. Asia-Pacific sustained strong growth that had begun late last year.This recovery boosted CBRE’s second-quarter results. Property sales rose globally by 61 per cent year-on-year, led by a 93 per cent improvement in sales in Europe and 67 growth in Asia Pacific.One side effect of the recovery in the market has been that the number of distressed owners of property being forced to sell has been lower than expected, although CBRE said that it was still marketing more than $7.5bn of distressed assets in the US, and had sold more than $1.3bn of such assets since the beginning of the year.Mr White predicted that there would be no new wave of distressed property sales as banks were working with borrowers rather than foreclosing on property backed by bad debts.

The portfolio was refinanced by a securitised debt deal of more than £1.1bn issued by White Tower 2006-3 that defaulted last year after a revaluation put the buildings’ value at less than £1bn.The properties, including 60 Victoria Embankment and Alban Gate, both let to JPMorgan, total more than 1.6m sq ft and generate more than £62m of annual rent.Robert Hodges, managing director of Carlyle’s European real estate business, said that the acquisition was a rare opportunity to acquire six landmark assets in strong locations, let to a number of global high-quality occupiers.The acquisition, which used debt provided by BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe Générale, was made on behalf of the Carlyle European Real Estate Partners III fund. AXA Real Estate Investment Managers also participated in the financing of the portfolio.Two other buildings that were backed by the White Tower bonds were sold last month. CB Richard Ellis Loan Servicing has acted as special servicer to the loan.
102;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-06-11T18:39:26Z;Goodman venture to invest £800m;;Goodman, the Australian property group, has set up two investment ventures to buy and develop up to £800m ($1.2bn) of warehouse schemes across the UK and Europe.The company has agreed a joint venture with CB Richard Ellis Realty Trust (CBRE), the US-based property group, to set up two logistics development vehicles. They will invest in pre-let schemes over three years, with 80 per cent of the equity provided by CBRE.The UK joint-venture will be seeded with two Goodman schemes valued at £22m, and then will have the right of first refusal on any projects by Goodman.The European vehicle will invest €400m (£332m) in three years, focusing on the western European markets of Germany, France and the Benelux countries. It will purchase three German development assets from Goodman with a total value on completion of €45.1m.Goodman has a £4bn development pipeline in the UK and Europe and assets under management of £3.5bn. The company will provide asset management, development and property services to the ventures.Greg Goodman, chief executive, said: “Our focus remains on building strategic relationships with leading global investor groups, such as CB Richard Ellis Realty Trust, to deliver on our key objective of matching new third-party capital with Goodman’s development pipeline.”The industrials sector has been seen as an increasingly institutionally acceptable asset class, according to CBRE. It now accounts for about 10 per cent of the European property investment market compared with 6 per cent in 2006.The UK, in particular, has seen recent strengthening in investment volumes and accounted for more than half of last year’s total European industrial investment activity.Richard Holberton, director of European research at CBRE, said: “Prime yields over the past 10 years have been about 70 basis points lower than the long-term average, based on a 20-year history. Spreads between logistics and office yields have also narrowed.“These factors will influence investors’ views on potential future returns from the sector.”
103;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-06-06T22:03:17Z;Goldman HQ sale price set to top £300m;;The City of London flagship building of investment bank Goldman Sachs will be put on the market by its Irish owners with a price tag of more than £300m as investors continue to tap into the rebound in prime London real estate.River Court, which will be put up for sale this week, is the larger of the two linked offices that form Goldman Sachs’ European head office on Fleet Street. The 425,000 sq ft River Court houses the bank’s auditorium, restaurants and gym. It was formerly the headquarters of the Daily Express newspaper, retaining part of its facade from that period, while the neighbouring Goldman site of Peterborough Court once housed The Daily Telegraph.River Court is privately owned by a syndicate of Irish investors, who bought it from Itochu, which constructed the building for Goldman Sachs, for £246.5m in 2000. Stephen Down, the property agent, is advising on the deal. All declined to comment.The owners are said to be keen to take advantage of the boom in prime London office prices, particularly should some experts be right in predicting a cooling period after an unexpectedly strong bounce since this time last year.Capital growth for UK property slowed to 0.7 per cent in May, according to CB Richard Ellis, although London offices continued to outperform with a rise in capital values by 1.4 per cent.Overall, total returns from commercial property have been almost 25 per cent in the past 12 months, led by London offices.According to Jones Lang LaSalle, there was £11.8bn of property transactions in London in the past year, only slightly less than the £14.2bn across the rest of the UK.However, some fear that the rebound could be losing steam.There is more than £2bn of City of London properties of varying quality on the market – a potential glut of supply, although there is expected to be support for the best given the lack of quality office space available to tenants.Buildings such as River Court have an advantage given the security of income from the lease with Goldman Sachs, which pays £16m a year and runs until 2025.There is still high demand from investors for such good London offices, with funds being launched to buy such stable assets.This week, Henderson Global Investors will announce that it has raised an initial £90m from European and North American institutional investors for a London office fund, providing it with about £200m for acquisitions, including debt.Henderson said there was investor demand for a further round of fundraising in the second half of this year.Clive Castle, the fund’s manager, said: “With the lack of new Grade A space coming to the market over the next few years we will soon be approaching a period of rental growth once again.“We think there is a current opportunity to acquire assets in need of improvement, to conduct these improvements, and to sell into an upward moving market.”
104;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-06-05T00:27:01Z;Low-rise elegance;;"It is not hard to spot signs of Bahrain’s bustling residential property market and the enthusiasm for the free market that drives the country’s building programme. The short drive from the international airport on this desert island’s northern tip into the capital, Manama, takes you past billboards promoting lush, landscaped new housing schemes carved into the desert. They are interspersed with hoardings proclaiming Bahrain as the world’s 13th most free economy and the most free in the Middle East, according to the latest annual Index of Economic Freedom.Then there are the cranes. The kingdom eschews the construction bling of Dubai, 300 miles east, and prefers low-rise elegance to high-rise statement. Even so there are plenty of building sites and with winter daytime temperatures nudging 25°C – rising to 40°C in summer – work goes on overnight on many schemes.These are early days for Bahrain’s housing market, which is seen as a key element in the long-term diversification of the economy. Oil accounts for about 25 per cent of gross domestic product but the kingdom is developing a large financial services sector and the Bahrain Development Bank actively encourages multinational industrial and service firms to relocate. A large attraction is the low-cost migrant labour pool, chiefly from India and Pakistan.Bahrain’s current population of about 750,000 – 60 per cent expatriates – needs 16,000 new homes annually until 2015 to make up for the present shortage and to meet future demand, claims property consultancy CB Richard Ellis.In recent years Bahrain has completed only 10,000 each year. That shortfall has been worsened by the downturn. Mortgages are harder to get and more expensive; cash-strapped suppliers cut back, creating a shortage of building materials last year; and unemployment is still above average. “It remains to be seen whether job creation can reach the levels of the recent boom. If the return is quick we could soon see a return of appetite for house purchases but this will need to be supported by reasonably priced mortgage products,” says Mike Williams, senior director of CBRE in Manama.Few residential schemes were abandoned during the recession but most were rescheduled, although all have resumed construction. Arguably the most impressive project is the Bahrain Financial Harbour, a 380,000 sq metre area of reclaimed land just off the main King Faisal Highway. This will be the country’s new financial district – banks and institutions are currently peppered across Manama – and by 2014 there will be homes for 7,000 residents.Reef Island is a man-made outcrop being built off Manama by the Bahrain-based Mouawad Group at the cost of $1.2bn. From the air it will appear like a figure nine and will have more than 1,200 apartments and villas, almost all with waterfront or lagoon views, as well as a 250-room, five-star hotel, a marina, a shopping mall and an exhibition centre. One of the relatively few residential-only developments is Riffa Views, a scheme of 1,000 prestigious homes costing a total of US$300m and built in three differently styled estates around a PGA championship golf course.“Schemes like these are really well built and populated almost entirely by expats here for several years. There’s surprisingly little renting in these newest schemes, which bodes well for their long-term capital appreciation,” explains Patricia Callander, an Australian former estate agent now working with an oil firm and soon to be an owner of a Riffa Views golf villa.Bahrain’s relatively stable property prices – down about 10 per cent since 2008 compared with 30 per cent or more in Dubai – mean the kingdom is now one of the more expensive locations in the Middle East. Apartments vary from $200,000 to more than $1m; villas go from $350,000 to $4m. Rents doubled from 2005 to 2009 but have now stabilised.Visit a show apartment or villa and you could be in any high-specification scheme in, say, Florida or Marbella. Granite, marble, glass and chrome dominate, and high-end refrigerators are likely to be stocked with food from UK retailer Marks & Spencer. This is quite deliberate as Bahrain wants to establish itself as a global real estate destination and accepts that that requires an international approach to design, tenure and marketing.Overseas buyers can now apply for residency, renewable every five years, which allows them to buy “western style” freehold, while global real estate names such as CBRE, King Sturge, Knight Frank and Cluttons operate on the island.Manama’s street corners are populated by western and Arab businessmen using the free WiFi at coffee café chains and the malls are anchored by large stores familiar to British shoppers, such as Debenhams, Virgin and even BHS, as well as high-end designer boutiques such as Gucci and Burberry. Alcohol is sold in selected shops and with meals in restaurants and hotels.Bahrain’s government is keen to avoid any signs of development frenzy and potential oversupply, for fear of deterring overseas investment, but occasionally problems occur. More than 60 burial mounds, some 4,000 years old, have been razed by developers in a Buri village, which Bahraini authorities wanted to win UN designation as a world heritage site. There has also been adverse publicity about living conditions for Indian construction workers.These hiccups notwithstanding, Bahrain offers a more restrained alternative image to Dubai’s oversupply of homes and faltering finances. It has no large tourism base but instead seeks an industrial and business infrastructure to underpin its future. It deserves to succeed in its quiet way – quiet, that is, apart from those signs on the road from the airport.………………………………………………….Estate agencyCB Richard Ellis, tel: +973 16556600, www.cbre.bhDevelopmentsReef island, tel: +973 17562810, www.reefisland.comRiffa Views, tel: +973 80008222, www.riffaviews.com"
105;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-04-30T21:32:52Z;Lloyds acts to reduce HBOS property debts;;A £500m ($764m) portfolio of properties backed by loans from sold-off lender HBOS has been put on the market.The move is the latest sign that Lloyds, which bought HBOS in 2009, is taking a tougher line with real estate customers in order to reduce its loan book to the sector.Targetfollow, a Norwich-based property developer managed by Ardeshir Naghshineh, has approached investors with details of the properties, which are all backed by HBOS loans.They include the Centre Point tower in the West End as well as a large City of London office development dubbed the “Can of Ham”.There are loan facilities of nearly £700m behind the properties that will mature this year. The debt is unlikely to be rolled over, which means Targetfollow needs to sell in order to recoup some of the value of the loan.The facilities were put in place in 2007 near the peak of the market, and values are still lower in spite of a recovery.The sale is expected to raise about £500m, helped by the strength of demand for prime, well-let London properties such as Centre Point.This could lead to a loss of about £200m for Lloyds, although any deal is expected to be structured with clauses that would allow the bank to benefit from longer-term profits made on the properties.It is the latest of a lengthening line of sales of properties backed by former HBOS loans as Lloyds looks to unwind many of the highly leveraged positions made during the boom of the market.This week has seen the sales of portfolios of industrial units by Warner in a deal expected to be confirmed next week, and buy-to-let residential properties from a failed joint venture with Grant Bovey.CB Richard Ellis is advising on the sale, which is thought to have attracted interest from property companies such as British Land and Land Securities.Mr Naghshineh told the Financial Times that expressions of interest had been received from a number of parties and were being evaluated.He said: “Targetfollow has for some time been in constructive discussions with its principal bank lender, Lloyds Banking Group, with regard to its current banking facilities.“At the same time, the group is reviewing its future funding options and considering the sale of assets.”The Lloyds-backed properties are thought to comprise about two-thirds of the overall Targetfollow mixed portfolio of properties.● Royal Bank of Scotland has narrowed the bidders for the £500m sale of the Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane to a shortlist that is understood to include the Candy brothers, the property developers, with backing from investors from the Middle East.
106;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-04-28T23:03:22Z;London is top spot for world’s retailers;UK attracts more international brands than China, says survey;The UK has been the most attractive market for international retailers owing to the strength of London’s shopping demand, according to a survey of the world’s top retailers.The UK has attracted 58 per cent of international retail brands, more than any other location, and almost all of these are present in London, according to the annual global retail report by CB Richard Ellis (CBRE).This comes in spite of a difficult year for retailers across the world, as well as the growing interest among retailers in tapping into the increasing wealth in emerging markets such as the Middle East and China. The second most popular country was the United Arab Emirates, where 54 per cent of international retailers are present.London is the most popular city in the world for retailers, with 56 per cent of international retailers having opened shops, although Dubai is a close second with 55 per cent.CBRE’s annual survey maps the global footprint of 294 of the world’s top retailers across 69 countries. Overall, Europe continued to dominate the top 20, with all five of the largest European economies featuring in the top 10 international retail destinations.The top 20 list has become considerably more global in the past year as retailers target key emerging markets in addition to the more established retail destinations. China is in the top five for the first time, with 47 per cent of retailers having opened.Luxury and business retailers have been the most expansive even in the economic slowdown, followed by value and denim and other clothing retailing.Peter Gold, head of EMEA cross border retail at CB Richard Ellis, said: “The UK market continues to attract international retailers and maintain its existing array of international brands.”Almost half of all retailers had a presence in each of the three main global regions but their footprint varied widely. The most expansive retailers have a presence in more than 60 countries and 170 cities.Luxury retailers continued to expand in Asia but markets that saw most new retailer arrivals attracted a wide range of retail sectors.The Middle Eastern markets also saw strong growth from the fashion sectors but with the majority of entrants coming from the luxury and business retailers. By contrast, the majority of openings in Central and Eastern Europe were led by value and mid-range retailers.

Personal spending rose by 0.3 per cent, as expected, for the fifth consecutive month.“The good news is that February’s US personal income and spending figures suggest that households have at last started to participate in the economic recovery,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “The bad news is that they also suggest this is unsustainable.

108;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-03-28T21:47:27Z;Lloyds to begin search for new City HQ;;"Lloyds Banking Group is to begin a search for a new headquarters in the City of London, underlining the part-nationalised bank’s new-found confidence in its financial prospects.Lloyds is also planning to reduce sharply the number of its corporate buildings – including offices and call centres – over the next few years in an effort to cut operating costs.It will create a series of regional hubs in the UK’s main cities, such as Edinburgh, where its head office is located; London, where its top executives are based; and Manchester.The move is part of a wider consolidation of the Lloyds and former HBOS businesses around the UK. The bank occupies about 300 offices, which are expected to be cut down to 150. This is in addition to a plan, already announced, to sell 600 branches, following a European Commission state-aid ruling against the bank.The most high-profile office search will be in London, where Lloyds occupies a number of large but ageing buildings, including its Gresham Street London headquarters, which it does not plan to sell or exit. The bank began a tentative search for a new London HQ last year but abandoned it. One agent close to the search said the move was put on hold as “a move to a shiny new tower in the City would look politically inexpedient at best”. Lloyds had looked at Watermark Place – now taken by Nomura – and also Minerva’s Walbrook scheme, which is still available. However, the bank’s sense of confidence has seen interest in a new London HQ revived, and a search is expected to start this year. It is not thought the bank would consider a move to Canary Wharf.This month, Lloyds surprised the markets with a trading update predicting a return to profit in 2010. Only three weeks earlier, the bank had disappointed investors with results for 2009, which included a £6.3bn loss and a deterioration of loan losses in the fourth quarter. The shares have rallied by more than a quarter in March.Lloyds currently occupies about 700,000 sq ft of offices around the City, either wholly owned or with various lease expiries, which means the bank could consider taking a pre-let on a development that could be completed in the next few years, particularly as there is a dearth of available existing buildings. Those close to the search say the move would come at the right part of the property cycle. Rents in the Square Mile are now rising, but are still lower than their long-term average.The bank is expected to keep its head office at the Mound in Edinburgh, although it is likely to bring together the majority of its staff in that city into a new corporate HQ at Fountainbridge in the next five years. The bank has appointed Allan Murray, a leading Scottish architect, to work on plans for the site bought by HBOS at the height of the property market.CB Richard Ellis, property consultancy, is advising Lloyds. Lloyds declined to comment."
109;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-03-24T17:10:53Z;Manhattan office sector poised for rebound;;Commercial property in Manhattan could see a revival this year after activity staggered to a halt in 2009, offering hope that the struggling sector might not be as severe a threat to the economy as feared.According to a report by CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services company, investment in Manhattan’s office sector is poised for a rebound, with prices and vacancy rates stabilising as the US economy recovers.Last year office sales volume plunged to the lowest level since the early 1990s, with only eight properties worth more than $30m changing hands, while prices per square foot fell by 59 per cent from 2008. CBRE noted that the rate of price declines has slowed significantly and predicted that office rents in New York will rise by 2.2 per cent in 2010.“There are many buyers waiting to purchase quality assets and these investors have been frustrated with the lack of opportunities for sale,” said Sean White, research analyst at CBRE. “When the quality properties come to market, the large number of investors competing for this limited supply of properties for sale will result in increased pricing.”Meanwhile, vacancy rates, which doubled from 2008 to nearly 10 per cent in 2010, are expected to fall back as the labour market improves. CBRE also predicted that the threat of a wave of distressed assets creating a complete collapse in the market might have been overstated, as lenders have shown an increasing willingness to offer loan extensions and workouts.Sam Chandan, chief economist at Real Capital Analytics, said that the uptick in leasing activity does not yet suggest a sharp increase in businesses requiring more space but is actually a result of companies taking advantage of a trough in rents.Manhattan’s office sector recovery comes as the US commercial real estate market is showing signs of life. Earlier this week the Moody’s/REAL commercial property price index showed prices rising by 1 per cent in January. That was the third consecutive month that prices rose and they have climbed by 6.3 per cent since reaching a bottom last October.In spite of the recent upturn, Moody’s warned of the potential for future “turbulence”, noting that lower-quality properties remain under pressure and that prices could soften as regulators look to sell assets and loans that they absorbed.“A few months of price gains does not necessarily indicate a sustainable trend, particularly in these difficult times,” said Nick Levidy of Moody’s.
110;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-03-17T02:36:48Z;Europe’s €200bn problem loans on property;;There is more than €200bn ($275bn) of problem commercial real estate debt sitting in the books of European banks following profligate lending practices during the last property boom.The worst of this is found in the UK and German markets, according to a report to be launched at the annual property festival in Cannes on Wednesday, with bad loans set for a lengthy 10-year workout through restructuring, forced sales and potential further bank writedowns.CB Richard Ellis, the property consultancy, will on Wednesday say that there is about €970bn of debt outstanding. Almost half will mature before the end of 2012 – averaging €155bn per year – and need to be repaid or refinanced in a still difficult lending market.The greatest problem, it says, is the €207bn pool of loans secured at high loan to value ratios on poor quality real estate, where the value of the property may well have fallen beneath the value of the debt, or breached covenants.Germany and the UK account for more than half of the €970bn total, it says, with 24 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively. About half of the UK debt sits in the books of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland.CBRE said the UK and Germany were more exposed to problem loans, having been at the vanguard of the booming European market. The concentration of debt secured on poor-quality property is about 30 per cent in both, compared with 12 per cent in the rest of Europe.The UK’s Financial Services Authority warned last week that banks could decide not to renew loans, highlighting the £160bn of UK commercial property debt set to mature over the next five years. This could force liquidations and force properties on to the market, it said, possibly triggering further price falls.There has been a recent recovery in the price of prime properties in certain countries, such as the UK, leading to hopes some debts would be recovered more easily, although much of the property in the banks’ books is of inferior quality.Iryna Pylypchuk, CBRE associate director, said: “Rising values are less likely to rescue loans secured against secondary properties and the majority of this pool will struggle to see significant capital value appreciation in the near or even medium term.”Asset protection schemes in Ireland and the UK could see a phasing of the release of poorer-quality assets, however, which CBRE predicts will stop a flood of secondary assets.Robin Hubbard, executive director of CBRE real estate finance, said: “While the scale of the problem may be large, with the help of government backing, equity issuance, and rapidly rising profitability, lenders are generally taking a methodical approach to recouping value.”
111;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
112;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-03-12T22:36:22Z;£1.15bn real estate workout sale begins;;The workout sale of the largest real estate debt default in the UK began on Friday after the owners of £1.15bn of loans behind a large portfolio of central London properties began talking to potential buyers.CB Richard Ellis Loan Servicing, which is acting on behalf of the bondholders of the securitised debt, said that eight of the nine properties could be sold for as much as £800m, including offices such as Alban Gate, Leadenhall Court and 60 Victoria Embankment. Five will be sold as a portfolio with an asking price of £466m – a 9 per cent net initial yield.The decision marks the beginning of the end for the largest debt default since the real estate crash in 2007, with most of the more senior lenders behind the portfolio set to have their money returned, although others will lose out.The portfolio of offices, which was owned by Simon Halabi, the wealthy private property investor, was valued at close to £2bn in the months leading up to the 2007 crash, but has since halved in value. It was given a valuation of £929m in June 2009.The portfolio was backed by a securitised loan of £1.15bn originated by Société Générale. There was an additional £300m mezzanine loan. CBRELS said the sale of the eight assets would allow the full repayment of the £678.5m of class A notes and a significant proportion of the £171.5m of class B notes.There have been at least two attempts to derail the sale process with knockout bids by Helical Bar and London & Stamford last year. Knight Frank and CB Richard Ellis are advising on the sale.There is expected to be a growing wave of defaults on property loans that have seen values drop below the debt, with a further crunch coming as the debt behind buildings comes up for maturity and so needs to be repaid.The Financial Services Authority this week warned about the UK commercial property market and its impact on the wider economy. It said that £160bn of commercial property debt would mature in the next five years and that it was likely that banks would increasingly decide not to renew loans after terms expire.The report said: “This could force liquidations and release commercial properties on to the market, possibly triggering further price falls. Leveraged loans to UK companies that were subject to buy-outs also face a maturity hump and present similar refinancing changes to the banks in this sector.”
113;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-03-11T22:53:27Z;Higher rate tax rise increases Alpine appeal;;A sudden surge in inquiries from finance, manufacturing and pharmaceutical companies wanting to move jobs to Switzerland has been triggered partly by a revolt over the 50p income rate, according to an international property adviser.CB Richard Ellis, the world’s largest property agency, said dozens of companies had asked for relocation advice this year. John Wilson, executive director of global corporate services, said none of the clients had yet changed their minds. “All the indications are that this is a serious trend.”Switzerland has tapped into growing discontent over the UK corporate and individual tax regime on the part of big companies, which have warned the government that Britain is becoming a less attractive location for employment and investment. Mr Wilson said: “The cantons’ economic development people are touring the UK on a regular basis. They are being very proactive. They are doing it very efficiently.”CBRE warned that in some cantons steps to discourage property speculation meant a temporary shortage of office space and high-quality housing. Also a shortage of spaces at international schools in some areas had prompted expats to use local schools. Mr Wilson said: “If you talk to relocation consultants they say there is always a solution but there must be a point where this must be an issue.”Although the relocations will involve some senior executives moving from Britain, they often mean jobs moving to Switzerland from a range of global locations. In many cases, only a tenth of the employees would be asked to relocate, with most jobs going to local people. Mr Wilson said: “A lot of relocations are not relocating people but the job.”Switzerland appealed to individuals who liked to work hard and enjoy an outdoors life, said Nick Compton, a CBRE life science specialist. “I don’t think its boring tag stands much scrutiny.” But he warned that in spite of lower personal tax rates, high living costs meant the advantages of a move were not “a clear cut case” for individuals unless they were at the top end of the earnings scale.Mr Wilson said the breadth of industries seeking advice surprised him. Financial insurers, commodities traders, investment banks, asset managers, hedge funds and the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors had shown particular interest.
114;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-03-08T01:07:08Z;Prime real estate to beat other asset classes;;Returns from investing in prime real estate this year are forecast to beat most other asset classes as strong demand from a broad range of investors helps the market rebound sharply from the record losses suffered during the downturn.Prime property in the West End of London is expected to deliver total returns of more than 20 per cent this year, according to a report from Colliers CRE, given limited availability and interest from overseas investors seeking trophy assets.This is almost double the basic returns from the wider real estate market, which Colliers says will deliver a total return of 11.6 per cent this year, driven by further falls in yields across all property sectors.Other areas are also expected to outperform. Retail property is forecast to deliver total returns of about 17.5 per cent, according to a separate report from CB Richard Ellis, with a central forecast of about 15 per cent to be delivered by all property over the year.There have been a number of recent deals showing the strength of the property recovery. In the most recent, Land Securities is understood to be buying the O2 shopping centre in north London for more than £100m ($152m), marking a significant profit for the consortium of Anthony Lyons, Simon Conway and Brett Palos that bought it for £92.5m less than a year ago.This group has become the latest to “flip” a property at a profit, with some deals in the West End being done at yields of near 4 per cent, close to where prices were during the boom years of 2006 and 2007.Stewart Colderick, executive director at CBRE, said that the retail investment market was expected to continue to grow throughout the first six months of 2010, but added that the occupier market remained under pressure, which could undermine prices.Colliers was also wary in the medium term, as slow growth and higher interest rates are anticipated. Even so, further falls in yields in the first half of the year will produce positive capital growth, it said, again in spite of declines expected in rental values in almost all sectors.Colliers said that the limited availability of stock in areas such as core London and retail has meant that the regional markets were also benefiting for the first time.The market has turned sharply from this time last year, when investors were still reeling after more than 40 per cent was wiped off values and the outlook for commercial property appeared bleak.
115;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-02-15T03:02:26Z;Poland shows signs of real estate recovery;;For central and eastern Europe’s crisis-hit property markets, the year could not have had a better start.In the biggest regional property deal since 2007, MGPA, a real estate company backed by Australia’s Macquarie Group, last month acquired two Polish shopping centres and took an option to buy a third for more than €235m ($341m).For investors it is evidence of a recovery that began late last year, following a revival in west European prime commercial property and gains in global financial markets.But property experts warn the rebound is fragile and limited, with investors concentrating on Poland and the Czech Republic and on prime office and retail properties. Real estate markets in countries still in recession, such as the Baltics, remain depressed.Sylvia Gansser-Potts, director of property at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, says: “There’s not a lot of activity because investors are still sorting out portfolios and banks are reluctant to lend. But there has been an improvement over the last quarter. Poland stands out as the most attractive country. But other countries, such as the Baltic states, are another story.”Property in central and eastern Europe (CEE) boomed pre-crisis, with investors driving prices close to west European levels, believing the region was rapidly converging with the wealthy west.With banks offering cheap finance, investors flooded into the less developed markets of the Baltics, south east Europe and Ukraine.But in mid-2008, when the global financial crisis erupted, panic hit CEE and its property market. Prices collapsed, yields soared, banks cut credit lines and investors ran into trouble. In Austria, the IATX property stock index, including companies with heavy CEE exposure, fell almost 90 per cent from peak to trough in early 2009. The IATX has since trebled but stands at only 30 per cent pre-crisis levels. Property companies forced into restructuring include some of the biggest names, such as France-based Orco .But west European banks which dominate banking in CEE (except in Russia), have stood by subsidiaries.With recovery in prospect – CEE is expected to see 2 per cent growth in gross domestic product this year after last year’s 7 per cent fall – bankers’ confidence is up though they remain cautious, not least over mounting non-performing loans.The economic outlook varies, with Poland and the Czech Republic expected to do well, and the Baltics, Hungary, the Balkans and Ukraine in the doldrums.Jos Tromp, head of CEE research at CB Richard Ellis, the property consultancy, says prospects reflect the macro-economic outlook. “In general there has been an uplift in investment activity which is good for confidence.”Investors are encouraged by the recent recovery in prime commercial property in western Europe. Neil Gregory-Eaves, head of CEE investment services for Colliers International, the property agency, says: “We have funds calling saying they’ve missed the boat on London but that they want to invest in Poland.”Finished building prices are buoyed by the construction slump. CBRE estimates the CEE office development pipeline, counting planned completions over the next 18-24 months, has shrunk 30 per cent since 2008, with a 48 per cent drop in Warsaw.Developers are now reviving plans, though often on a reduced scale. Eli Alroy, chairman of GTC, a large regional property developer, says GTC recently started building two shopping malls after freezing most developments two years ago.“We want to be ahead of the curve,” he says. “2010 will still be challenging but we feel there will be a turnround by 2011.”But Karl Wallner, head of CEE project development at Raiffeisen Evolution, a property company part-owned by RZB, the Austrian bank, says money remains tight. “If you need financing now, you have to bring the consortium together yourself. The bank won’t do that for you. And if it’s not pre-rented, you won’t get financing at all.”In Budapest, where the economic crisis began earlier than elsewhere, property agents report glimmers of recovery. But in Bucharest, the market is weak. Troy Jahaver, Bucharest managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle, the property agency, says that, with few transactions, investors are unsure about pricing risk. Jones Lang puts office vacancy rates in Bucharest at 16 per cent, against 18 per cent in Budapest, 12 per cent in Prague and only 7 per cent in Warsaw.In the Baltics, agents say the market has bottomed out, but prices are still 60-70 per cent below pre-crisis peaks, with little prospect of a quick rebound.Valdis Ligers, chief executive of NAI Baltics, an adviser, says: “It’s too early to talk about recovery.”But even in the Baltics and the Balkans, cash-rich investors are sometimes bottom-fishing. Dinu Patriciu, the Romanian billionaire, has been consolidating quoted property companies through his Black Sea Global Properties.However, no one expects another boom. CEE property markets, like the region’s economies, are still expected to catch up with western Europe – but more slowly than before.At the EBRD, Mrs Gansser-Potts says: “Before the crisis, the market got ahead of itself and I don’t think it will return to where it was before the crisis.”But the need for commercial, residential and industrial property investment remains. Mrs Gansser-Potts says: “Fundamentally, there is still a lot to be done.”Additional reporting by Dan Thomas in London, Jan Cienski in Warsaw, Chris Bryant in Vienna and Andrew Ward in Stockholm
116;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-01-17T19:18:56Z;European commercial property rebounds;;Commercial real estate investment has risen by more than 40 per cent in Europe in the past three months to the highest level since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.More than €25.7bn of property deals were sealed in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of 42 per cent on the previous quarter and double the levels traded in the first two quarters of the year, according to CB Richard Ellis, the property consultancy.This is the highest quarterly trade since Lehman’s collapse and the beginning of the sharpest point of the property slump.The data support anecdotal evidence of a rush back to property investment by a range of institutions after a bounce in values in markets such as the UK since the summer.The jump in fourth-quarter activity brought total 2009 turnover to €70bn, still lower than the €121bn in 2008.Almost every European market saw an increase in investment activity in the fourth quarter.The UK took by far the largest share of the new investment, with more than a third spent on British property.Investment in the UK increased by 64 per cent in the second half compared with the first six months of the year.The next largest market was Germany, which accounted for about 15 per cent of investment activity.The fourth quarter is generally one of the busiest periods owing to the rush of deals being completed towards the end of the year, although CBRE said the turnround was expected to be sustained into 2010.Michael Haddock, CBRE’s director of European research and consulting, said the upturn started in the most important European markets but was spreading.The strongest growth occurred in central and eastern Europe, an area traditionally seen as higher risk than more established markets in western Europe, though the pick-up came from a lower base.There was a rise in cross-border investment in the second half, in contrast to the preceding half, which was dominated by domestic investors.German open-ended funds alone spent more than €1bn in December, with at least 13 acquisitions across seven markets.Sovereign wealth funds from outside Europe contributed to the rise in activity.The biggest acquisition in the second half was the purchase of HSBC’s headquarters in London’s Canary Wharf by South Korea’s National Pension Service of Korea.Mr Haddock said: “Despite the increase in investment activity across Europe, investor interest is still fixated on prime product and the most liquid markets.”
117;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2010-01-05T22:41:56Z;Coutts headquarters part of £475m sale;;The headquarters of Coutts, the private bank for wealthy customers, on the Strand in London has been put up for sale as part of a £475m portfolio of properties occupied by Royal Bank of Scotland.The portfolio, which comprises 55 properties let to RBS until 2037, is being sold by Telereal Trillium. the property company of the London-based Pears family.The planned disposal will see Telereal become the first large property owner to explore the demand for real estate this year after the market staged a sharp recovery in the second half of 2009.The sale is the majority of a portfolio of 63 properties acquired by Telereal in a £800m sale-and-leaseback in November 2007. Other properties include the Drummonds’ headquarters on Trafalgar Square and Child & Co headquarters on Fleet Street. More than 45 per cent of the income of the portfolio is generated by London properties.CB Richard Ellis is to advise on the sale.Graeme Hunter, property director, said: “We have had regular inquiries from many parties interested in acquiring single assets. Since the summer, however, the level of interest in a larger portfolio transaction has increased dramatically and as such we see the time as being right to test the market’s appetite.”But it has not been as easy for the investment market as the recovery in values last year would suggest. It has emerged that the £110m sale of a luxury hotel development also on the Strand, which was in administration, received only one satisfactory bid above the minimum price.The two other shortlisted bidders were unable to find funding, which meant that it was sold over Christmas to the only party left – a subsidiary of BBVA, the bank that pushed the property into administration. This was in spite of 140 expressions of interest, according to PwC, the administrator.Even so, King Sturge, the property consultancy, on Tuesday forecast that 2010 would see the best returns for property investors for four years, although it warned that values could fall again in 2012.King Sturge predicted 2010 will produce total returns of 12.8 per cent, but said that there was a possibility that this could be a “false dawn”.The gap in values and occupier demand between London and the rest of the country is expected to widen, with the capital leading the office market recovery in 2010.Shop rents are forecast to decline for another two years. Christmas was only a temporary respite for retailers, according to King Sturge, with underlying sales remaining fragile and erratic. Even so, it says vacancy rates will slowly recover from a near-20 per cent nadir this year.
118;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-12-29T16:56:17Z;UK commercial property recovery to hold up;;The recovery in the UK commercial property market is expected to be sustained into 2010, according to leading forecasters, in spite of the unexpected strong bounce in the sector that caught out many investors this year.UK commercial property values rose 2.4 per cent in November, the largest monthly growth in 15 years, according to the IPD index. Capital growth in the year to date was -8.4 per cent, but total returns stood at -1.4 per cent and were heading for a positive finish to the year. This bounce in values would have been unthinkable just six months earlier in a sector that was reeling from the sharpest falls on record.The market rally since August has caused considerable uncertainty for the year ahead, particularly as it has defied fundamental reasons for price restraint such as flagging occupier demand and rental declines.However, while few expect prices to rise at the same pace, many predict that next year will be positive for returns from property. The consensus view is broadly that capital values will plateau, with total returns settling at 6 to 10 per cent for the next two years. There is a range of other opinion, however.William Hill, head of property at Schroders, predicted that the sharp turnround in the performance of UK commercial property would continue through the first six months of 2010. After that, however, he said that the picture was less clear, with economic uncertainty meaning that the market was likely to experience further volatility over the next two to three years and potentially a fall in values in 2011.Harm Meijer, an analyst at JPMorgan, expects property prices to bounce by 15 per cent between June 2009 to June 2010, before settling into sluggish growth or a modest decline for two years.This will give a compound price growth of 4 per cent a year over a five-year period.He said that the rally in real estate stocks was over, but that there was expected to be a 12 per cent total return from the European listed sector next year. His picks in the UK were Big Yellow and British Land.CB Richard Ellis, the property consultancy, also believes the market is not in the grip of an unsustainable “mini-bubble”, saying that many measures of yield and value were still in comfortable territory relative to long-run averages. The UK, it predicted, looked likely to lead other markets in its recovery.There is expected to be about €60bn (£55bn) of investment activity in the European commercial real estate market in 2009, roughly half of the total from the previous year.CBRE expects there to be a steady rise in activity in 2010, although this will be restrained by the focus on prime property, which is in relatively short supply.Leasing activity in 2009 is likely to be about a third of 2008 levels, but CBRE expects this also gradually to recover as economic prospects improve during the latter half of 2010.King Sturge, a rival property agency, predicted that the UK investment bubble would soften in the first quarter. It said prime property had shown growth of 20 per cent in values in the past year, but the impact of an end to quantitative easing, higher tax rates, election uncertainty, unemployment, the Dubai crash and better savings rates would take the steam out of the market.“Whether it is a VW, or a ‘corrugated’ recovery, it is not a straight line up from here,” said Neville Pritchard, head of UK investment at King Sturge, echoing the sentiment from many veteran investors such as Nick Leslau and Mike Slade.Secondary stock will continue to languish, he added. “Those who anticipate a substantial rebound in poorer quality stock are mistaken.” He said that central London offices and the best quality retail parks will continue to find favour with risk-averse investors.Savills, the real estate adviser, also said that the London market was set to fare well. In a report published alongside Oxford Economics, the economic forecaster, Savills said that London would re-emerge as the fastest growing large European destination and one of the fastest expanding global financial centres, exceeding New York and Tokyo in the medium term.John Rigg, head of international investment at Savills, said: “Concerted central bank action and the fall in sterling combined with London’s intrinsic attractions are causing a rapid recovery to certain markets.”
119;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-12-21T09:22:06Z;Commercial real estate;;"Real estate agents are famous for their relentless optimism. But while the residential market enjoys a recovery of sorts, good news in commercial property is glaringly absent. Vacancy rates in New York, London and Paris have almost without exception deteriorated every quarter this year; the average in Europe is now almost 9 per cent. Meanwhile, rents in key New York districts are down one third compared to last year, and the European EU-27 office rent index is still falling at its fastest rate this decade, according to property consultants CB Richard Ellis.Owners are rightly worried. Highly leveraged bets made during the credit bubble mean landlords now sit on a mountain of debt. In the US $3,400bn is outstanding, of which $1,400bn matures by 2012. Lenders are also in a sweat. Loan to valuation ratios during the debt bubble ran as high as 70 per cent or more, leaving many banks with more at stake than the owners they financed. In the UK, commerical property debt in default or breach of covenant has doubled since last year to around £30bn, and £100bn needs to be refinanced over the next three years. In the US, the Federal Reserve believes lending banks have been “slow” to take losses.To cope, landlords and their banks are having to forge a kind of symbiotic relationship. Lenders can keep borrowers afloat by easing loan terms, which in turn helps them avoid short-term write-downs. If commercial rents recover before the cash runs out, everyone may even scrape home. But while this “extend and pretend” strategy is not illegal, it is illusionary. What used to be perceived as one of the safest classes of loans is turning into a bet on future rental prices; in effect, a leveraged trade on the derivative of an underlying asset.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially"
120;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-12-18T19:42:50Z;Halabi forced to count cost of UK downturn;;"During the spring of 2007 the wine bars frequented by London’s property agents were abuzz with one topic: would Simon Halabi, the billionaire real estate investor, establish a new UK record by selling a group of London buildings codenamed the “Protractor portfolio” for as much as £1.8bn?More than two years later, the question is broadly the same, only this time the price could be less than £1bn, and the sellers will be CB Richard Ellis and Ernst & Young – now in control after a £1.15bn securitised debt that backed the portfolio went into default because of the slump in property values.Mr Halabi, who lives between Switzerland, the south of France and London, is a figure of mystery to many in the property industry, rarely attending industry events or talking to the press, and choosing to work with only a handful of trusted advisers.He was still estimated by Forbes this year to have had a fortune of $2.8bn and has the trappings of a modern property mogul, including a vineyard and chateau in France, a yacht moored at Portofino in Italy and an office full of antique furniture in London’s Mayfair.The interests of the family trusts, to which he is an adviser, were valued at as much as £5bn during the boom, with a wide-ranging portfolio from a stake in the Buddha Bar in London to the Esporta gym chain to Mentmore Towers, a gothic estate in Buckinghamshire.But some of the empire is gradually being broken up and Esporta is in the hands of its bank.Several properties have come up for sale in recent months, including the Grade I-listed building on Piccadilly once occupied by Lord Palmerston where Mr Halabi planned the UK’s first six-star hotel. Another building, Kings Reach on London’s South Bank, has gone into receivership, and is set to be sold in the next few weeks. However, a £30.5m home in Mayfair has been withdrawn from sale this week.The nine London offices in the Protractor portfolio – which includes JPMorgan’s 60 Victoria Embankment and the Aviva Tower – were the largest single part of the family’s UK property empire.The size of the portfolio has made Mr Halabi one of the more prominent victims of the property downturn, although it is likely the brunt of losses will be borne by the lending institutions behind the portfolio that have seen the value of assets fall beneath the level of debt.The £1.15bn securitised loan defaulted following a slump in the value of the portfolio of almost 50 per cent. It was last valued at £929m. Buckingham Securities, which advised the offshore family trusts, has gone into liquidation.Mr Halabi is said to be trying to salvage the portfolio, however.In a conference call to noteholders in October, CBRE said it had held a dialogue with Mr Halabi, who had shown a willingness to “move forward with some form of restructuring/recapitalisation solution”. However, in a further conference call on Thursday, CBRE said it had not “heard anything about” any putative bid. All bids to date had been below advised valuation, it added.However, Mr Halabi would probably now need to compete with market offers for the properties, with values once again rising for such trophy assets.In its rich list entry, Forbes quotes Mr Halabi as saying: “I’ve fared no worse nor better than peers with the majority of their assets in real estate.” Mr Halabi was not available for comment; Buckingham Securities would not comment.Parts of the Halabi business outside UK property include the Château Cantenac Brown vineyard in France, where there are plans to create a luxury hotel. Those who have worked for Mr Halabi in the past received the chateau’s wine at Christmas. It is unlikely many banks will be among the recipients of his generosity this year."
121;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-12-09T02:01:20Z;Effects of property crash seen until next year;;There will be another year before the effect of the property crash has come to an end, according to the UK investment forecasts of a leading consultancy.Capital and rental growth are both expected to be negative next year, according to Colliers CRE, although total returns from property are still set to rise to 5.7 per cent as the recovery continues to drive yield compression across prime property. Colliers is forecasting a total return of 3.4 per cent in 2009.Colliers said that it has improved forecasts owing to greater price increases and smaller rental growth declines than expected.On Tuesday, there was further evidence of the recovery of the UK real estate market after a monthly index compiled by CB Richard Ellis showed a total return of 3.4 per cent, the strongest month in its history. Capital values rose by 2.7 per cent during the month. Colliers said that price growth was expected to slow but continue on the better quality property into 2010.However, it warned that there was uncertainty over whether the “wall of money” from investors chasing property will continue to drive performance, which it described as reminiscent of the previous boom period. Rising interest rates and the potential release of distressed stock on to the market pose the largest downside risks to capital values, Colliers added, while rental values will not support capital values until 2011 at the earliest.Russell Francis, head of valuation, said: “We have had a massive bubble this year that has taken everyone by surprise but only the better properties have been moving. We are saying that this will continue next year, with prime property remaining strong but the secondary properties still under pressure and keeping the market down as a whole.”Rents are set to fall by 7.7 per cent overall, having already fallen by about 10.2 per cent this year.By 2011, the decline is forecast to be a marginal 0.8 per cent, before rising again to 3 per cent in 2012, 4.8 per cent in 2013 and 4 per cent in 2014. Offices are set to see the strongest recovery.Capital value falls are expected to moderate to 1.7 per cent next year, from 2.9 per cent in 2009 and 26.3 per cent in 2008. A recovery in subsequent years is predicted, with modest growth of 0.3 per cent in 2011, 2.3 per cent in 2012 and 5.8 per cent in 2013. The annualised growth between 2010-2014 is 2.4 per cent.Even with these declines, the income return from property is expected to grow, rising from 6.5 per cent this year to 7.6 per cent next year and in subsequent years.
122;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-12-06T19:45:27Z;Nakheel creditors ponder bare cupboard;;The property developer Nakheel once epitomised Dubai’s rise, turning elaborately arranged man-made islands into some of the most sought-after properties in the emirate and launching a bold bid to build the world’s tallest tower.But as creditors investigate how to respond to parent company Dubai World’s decision last month to delay the December 14 repayment of Nakheel’s $4bn (€2.65bn, £2.4bn) sukuk, or Islamic bond, they are likely to discover that the once high-flying company may have few assets that they can get their hands on.Nakheel is groaning under an $8bn debt mountain and has been forced to slash projects and staff amid a calamitous real estate crash. The company has referred all questions about its condition to Dubai World, which in turn has declined to comment. Government-owned Dubai World has said it is seeking to restructure $26bn in debt, including Nakheel’s obligations.While they have tried to distance themselves from the company and its debts, authorities in the United Arab Emirates have sought to stress that the company will come good on its debts eventually. Sultan bin Saeed al-Mansouri, the UAE’s economy minister, last week said: “It is a matter of time before the company restructures its debts and honours its commitments as per a scheduled plan.”In Nakheel’s end-2008 financial statement, it reported assets of Dh153bn ($42bn, €28bn, £25bn) against liabilities of Dh64.2bn. But gross profit of Dh8.4bn was cut to Dh495m as it made impairments on property values, paid off redundant staff and paid more for its debt.But since then, analysts say, the value of the company’s assets, most of which are located in Dubai, are likely to have suffered as a result of the halving of real estate prices across the emirate. The pricking of the real estate bubble has put the company under severe financial distress throughout the year, forcing it to make fire sales and slash staff to keep its head above water.Some buildings in low-income projects Discovery Gardens and International City have been sold to other parts of the Dubai government, including Emirates airlines and Dubai Duty Free, according to CB Richard Ellis, a real estate services provider.The company has land available for sale but there are still few takers given Dubai’s property supply glut. And much of the company’s undeveloped land is part of projects that have taken downpayments from customers, so is a liability. “Elsewhere there isn’t much left in the cupboard,” says Nicholas Maclean, regional managing director of CB Richard Ellis.Cash flow has dried to a trickle, with the company’s incoming cash flow barely enough to cover salaries and electricity bills, say two former employees.Contractors are owed as much as Dh11bn, the former employees say, even after some suppliers decided to take 75 cents on the dollar earlier this year as the government disbursed bail-out funds to the developer. “I was told ‘take the haircut and sign non-disclosure forms, or go to the back of the queue’,” said one consultant. “Luckily I took the money.”Nakheel has also been encouraging customers on projects far away from completion to shift to developments that are finished or approaching handover. Buyers of expensive villas on Palm Jebel Ali, which was to be the developer’s second luxurious Palm island and is now permanently delayed, are being offered studio flats in lesser developments as compensation.Nakheel, analysts say, still needs a cash injection to bring some of its projects to fruition. Refinancing the company could form part of any deal struck with bondholders and bank creditors as part of the nascent restructuring discussions.The government is aware that it needs to restructure the company’s short-term liabilities with its long-term development assets. For many with inside experience of Nakheel, the very public airing of its troubles has been long overdue.Poor construction practices in one of the company’s early developments left the site a ghost town, and purchasers have complained about the quality of other projects.Dubai’s residents have spent the past year coming to terms with the new realities of Dubai’s property sector. Nakheel’s creditors may be about to learn the same grim lesson.
123;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-11-09T23:23:34Z;UK commercial property values surge;;A rapid recovery in UK commercial property values from the deepest slump on record to near bubble-like conditions could see the sector turn positive this year, a leading property consultancy has forecast.Real estate values are set to overturn most of the losses suffered in the first half, according to research by Colliers CRE, as booming investor demand has taken prices back to near peak levels in some sectors.The strength of the rally could lead to a second price correction, Colliers cautions, with analysts warning that a bubble is being created.Colliers has upgraded its forecasts significantly for this year and next, estimating that the total return – the movement in property values plus rental income – for 2009 will be 0.4 per cent, a rapid recovery from just a few months ago when the sector was still reeling from its heaviest slump. Colliers’ previous forecast was of minus 7.3 per cent for 2009.Recent trades in property derivatives have also reflected flat returns for 2009, according to Philip Ljubic, derivatives trader at Royal Bank of Scotland.UK property capital values rose 2 per cent in October, according to CB Richard Ellis, the property consultants – the strongest growth in the history of its index. Total returns climbed 2.7 per cent, the fourth consecutive month of growth. Prices remain much lower than peak – by about 40 per cent on average – but prime property has experienced a remarkable return.Russell Francis, head of valuation at Colliers, said: “The speed of the recovery in capital values for many properties has been quite dramatic.”However, analysts are worried there could be a second price correction. Prices have been driven by a shortage of supply, which could change quickly given fears about the amount of property debt maturing.There is as much as £135bn ($226bn) of debt to be repaid in the next few years, which could force sales from banks and owners. Drivers of value such as rental growth are also still weak.Charlie Foster, analyst at Oriel Securities, said: “It is too early to write off the systemic risk of the high degree of indebtedness across the sector, and the continued downward pressure on rents arising from weak occupier demand and the recent falls in rental value.”
124;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-10-26T23:27:43Z;Savile Row cuts a dash in real estate;;Savile Row, the home to London’s tailoring profession, is fast becoming the centre of a fledgling property industry, given the number of start-ups and funds to have set up shop in the neighbourhood.Property is a naturally ego-driven and entrepreneurial sector and the first sniff of a rising market has given many the confidence to leave larger firms to make money of their own.Out of the recession has come innovation and a sense of adventure. New businesses range from fund management groups, such as that of Simon Holley and Simon Blake, former CBRE agents, and Cording Capital, set up by ex-Millar Kitching partners, to consultancies such as H2SO and Hanover Green, manned by former partners of large agencies. Indeed, these are just the ventures set up by agents – more are on the way given further high-profile departures.Nearby, former property fund managers and bankers have set up on their own and are looking after funds. Some of the former stars of the real estate investment trust sector will also soon set up on their own, including Mike Hussey, former Land Securities London chief, and Andrew Jones, who is leaving British Land. A business has even been set up to nurture other people’s start-ups, with Robert Houston, former ING Real Estate chief, taking a different route with his St Bride’s Business Alliance in providing a home to companies of various property disciplines.Many propco entrepreneurs were tied into contracts in large firms of agents or asset managers, but have been able to walk with no legacy problems and the prospect of pocketing all the fees. That is, of course, if they can secure the backing from investors and clients. Many investment businesses are based around a fairly simple concept of looking for opportunities at a low point in the market, be it retail parks or City offices, with debt or without, and the equity available from investors is finite for such strategies.Fund managers say it is a difficult time to raise equity in spite of evidence of a turn in the market. Investors say that only those with a strong record will succeed. The desired experience is not making big returns in a hot market, but rather safe investing for secure income, which is appreciated by funds that have become averse to risk, particularly given questions over the sustainability of the recovery.Some have turned to the public market for equity, but again the pot is not big enough for everyone. It is a good time to be cautious about expectations. Bankers still talk about NewRiver, which ended up raising a 10th of the upper limit of its target this summer. The flotation last week of LXB Properties, in comparison, looked good, having exceeded its target.It is interesting that Index Linked Properties, an opportunity fund with a deal already lined up to buy £400m of Tesco properties, finally felt moved to officially announce its intention to list on Monday. A FTSE 250 aspiration gives a target of more than £250m, much less than the £1bn being talked about in the market, which was causing negative commentary. Bankers say there are dozens of funds waiting in the queue behind ILP.Outside the challenges of raising equity, these are still testing investment conditions. Transactions are still low. One manager looking to raise money said the question asked by investors was: “How do you know that you can spend the money?”Limited sales are attracting large numbers of bids, sometimes forcing prices beyond what more cautious investors are prepared to pay at this point of the economic cycle. High return targets are not easy in this environment and there are concerns about the so-called “winner’s curse” – paying too much for an over-rented building with worrying lease breaks because funds need to be deployed.Property investment can be simple on paper: buy a building, extend the lease or improve the space, and sell at a higher price. During the boom, many even missed out the middle bit, relying on yield compression to do the work. Now, asset management has become very important, but also harder given falling rents and rising vacancies.Investors are not looking for a good fund manager as much as a good property manager. The two are not the same. The best of the entrepreneurs will not have a problem raising cash – in particular those proved to have generated money from property regardless of conditions – and others will find enough thanks to a key contact or loyal client. But some wannabe fund managers will end up consultants, and eventually will recirculate into agency or banking worlds.Ironically, the successful will also probably end up back where they started – but only after selling businesses or portfolios near the peak of the next cycle for big money and golden handcuffs that last until it all starts again. Such is the way that millionaires are made in real estate management.dan.thomas@ft.com
125;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-10-02T15:02:59Z;CMBS market: ‘A rolling loan gathers no loss’;;The packaging and selling of chunks of real estate debt during the boom could be one of the biggest threats to a sustained recovery in the market.The securitisation of real estate debt was becoming a dominant means of financing investment only in the last few years of the property boom. Unfortunately, this also meant that these commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS), often sold to hundreds of different investors, were generally made at high loan-to-value ratios.The subsequent fall in values has left much of this debt in or nearing breach of covenants, but the complicated nature of CMBS makes this a particularly hard problem to tackle.About $40bn in loans have been moved into special servicing in advance of default in Europe, according to DTZ, the global property adviser, and this represents a huge headache for the market.More than 5 per cent of the total CMBS debt outstanding is now in special servicing, it says, and either needs new finance for the existing structure, or properties to be sold to repay the loans.Refinancing is a particular problem, according to Philip Cropper, executive director of CBRE Real Estate Finance, as few banks are willing to commit new money to covering bad loans.CBRE predicts that there could be a huge equity gap between the available finance and the funding needed to cover loan defaults. The alternative is to try to secure bondholder consent for a restructuring of the loan or to push out the maturity, but neither is simple, given the numbers of investors involved and the sometimes opaque paperwork governing loan administration.Michael Cutteridge, director in corporate finance at DTZ, says: “At present, many investors are attempting to renegotiate the terms of their debt, especially on the CMBS side.“However, we expect that a significant quorum of overleveraged borrowers will also selectively hand back the keys, in those cases where the potential for restructuring does not exist, or where the long-term profile of the asset’s cash flows makes it difficult to realise a positive total return over any type of reasonable holding horizon.”As property values decrease further, the deterioration of loan performance is expected to accelerate and defaults increase. Even if values stabilise, most loans will be highly leveraged at maturity, leading to increased refinancing risk given a shortage of available new finance.There have already been attempts to roll over some European loans due for refinancing, with one investor summarising the position in an increasingly used phrase, “a rolling loan gathers no loss”.The battle of the tranches complicates matters further, with senior bondholders potentially looking for liquidation to recover whatever cash is left, but junior bondholders naturally keen to hang in and extend the loan to see if they can return to the money.Despite mounting problems in outstanding loans, bankers are hard at work trying to wedge the securitisation market open again to provide finance to the debt-starved property market. A back-to-basics approach for securitisation is being held up as crucial to kick-starting investment.More than £1bn ($1.6bn) has been raised since July in the CMBS market, comprising two issues by Tesco and one by Land Securities based on a building let to the Home Office in London.Bankers say it is only a matter of time before the door opens to more of these products, although they caution that the demand is for the sort of very safe products that bear little resemblance to those that were issued during the boom years.
126;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-09-18T21:51:03Z;Blackstone buys Broadgate;;"Transatlantic marriages of convenience are blossoming in the real estate market. After months of courtship, British Land has off-loaded half of its flagship Broadgate property to private equity house Blackstone. The 16-building office complex, home to UBS, Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland, is valued at £2.2bn. But with debts almost equal to book value, Blackstone will only invest £75m from its European distressed real estate fund to attach its name to one of Britain’s most prestigious business addresses.As a partner, Blackstone brings extensive real estate experience and financial clout. Meanwhile, British Land cuts its net debt to assets by a quarter, to about 30 per cent, and reduces its office market exposure by a third to 21 per cent. The deal may dilute annual earnings by £28m, but this is merely an insurance cost against further market falls.For all its appeal, though, 20-year-old Broadgate needs some tender care. With about a third of its leases falling due over the next few years, including its biggest tenant, UBS, the refurbishment necessary to maintain premium rents will be expensive; £110m has been allocated to the cause, but spread across 16 buildings this looks light.Alongside Songbird Estates, which is spending £113m to buy an extra 9 per cent in Canary Wharf, Blackstone hopes it has called the bottom of the market. Office rents have dropped by a third in two years, according to CBRE research. Broadgate’s current yield of more than 7 per cent could rise to 8 per cent if the buildings are fully let; only two years ago some commercial office space was 40 per cent more expensive. British Land chief Chris Grigg has found a good partner. Now it is time for the hard work to begin.British Land has completed the sale of half the £2.2bn Broadgate office complex to Blackstone, the private equity group, as it prepares for a fresh push into the UK property market.The UK’s second-largest real estate company finalised on Friday the cash-and-debt deal, which created a joint venture with Blackstone to hold the 32-acre City of London estate.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter"

128;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-07-26T22:37:45Z;Scene set for UK rented housing boost;;The UK is set to experience a boom in American-style mass-produced rental homes as part of proposals by a consortium that meet a government call for greater institutional investment in the residential market.Aviva insurance group,is to launch an investment fund with as much as £1bn to buy and rent out swaths of new-build residential property in partnership with CB Richard Ellis property consultancy and a big US residential manager.The venture will order purpose-built residential blocks of 100 units or more in south-east England to rent out, mainly near big transport hubs and on significant regeneration sites that have stalled because of the economic downturn.The partners have based their strategy on a US model of large-scale, multi-family rented housing. They say that it will be the first of its kind for the UK, providing thousands of homes for the private rental market, which is dominated by amateur landlords and buy-to-let investors. Rental property is a much bigger business in the US and across northern Europe.Andrew Appleyard, head of UK specialist property funds for Aviva Investors, said: “We are looking to do something here that has not been done before. We feel that the economics are right given where the market is heading. There is appetite for renting that hasn’t been there before.”Aviva is concluding an agreement to bring one of the largest US residential managers to the UK to import its professional skills in running a standardised high-quality rental operation.Large institutional investors have been deterred from making any significant focus on the residential rental market in the UK because of management costs and difficulties in creating a large portfolio, but they have recently been encouraged by the government.Aviva is working closely on the plans with the Homes and Communities Agency, the government’s national housing body, which in May called on institutions to help galvanise house building and provide quality rental property. The HCA has received more than 60 expressions of interest, and hopes there will be many more similar schemes.The vehicle, to be launched next month, is expected to be open to investors outside Aviva’s clients, such as other pension funds, and private wealth vehicles. It could eventually be turned into a listed vehicle, such as a real estate investment trust.
129;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-07-26T22:37:45Z;Identical flats to stimulate sector;;A tenant could soon be able to walk into a block of flats in almost any town in the UK and find identical features and quality, under plans to introduce US-style mass-produced rental accommodation.Backers of standardised rental want to provide an alternative to navigating the hazardous UK market, which is dominated by individuals and small businesses. The option will move the country closer to the US, northern Europe and parts of Asia, where this sort of rental experience is widespread.Aviva Investors is one of a number of institutions looking to raise funds to create an asset class out of rental homes in the UK. In doing so Aviva – and others likely to follow its lead – will be answering the government’s call for greater involvement in the private rental sector to bridge the funding gap left by the banks’ retrenchment and for a sales route to stimulate house building.Many institutions have explored the idea of investing in the UK rental market in the past, particularly during the buy-to-let boom when private investors made large profits.But most institutions have been discouraged by barriers such as management costs, difficulties in piecing together a large portfolio and the uncertainty of income.Aviva, with adviser CB Richard Ellis, is expected to raise about £500m in equity, matched by a similar amount in debt. That will give it the firepower to buy thousands of flats and houses built for rent.The group is focusing on rental income, rather than capital value increase, to generate returns. In theory, rental income should provide a long-term yield similar to a gilt.“It is the UK taking on the US model for the first time,” said Nick Jopling, head of residential at CBRE. “This is not a short-term, opportunistic model for distressed property.”The business model is predicated on growth of the rental market, and partners expect that first-time buyers will continue to struggle to find deposits and families will increasingly turn to quality renting.About 13 per cent of UK homes are rented, according to Mr Jopling, compared with 68 per cent under private ownership and the remainder in social housing. A small increase to about 15 per cent, he said, would mean more than 450,000 additional rental homes.“We anticipate a significant increase in renters. For the first time in my lifetime, this market has a chance to take off. The buy-to-let model is largely broken and this has a real chance of replacing it,” Mr Jopling said.Other institutions, however, say the government would have to do more to mitigate risk for the model to succeed.In May, the Homes and Communities Agency called for investment proposals for the UK private rented sector. So far, the HCA mostly provides strategic advice, but it is thought to be considering providing public-sector land and potentially some form of rental guarantee.Sir Bob Kerslake, HCA chief executive, said: “There has been a long-held view that institutions should go into residential but it hasn’t happened for a whole host of reasons. This will kickstart site development.”There were social benefits too, he added. “There are people not eligible for social housing but that cannot afford to buy. They might have to put up with lower-quality rental through buy-to-let.”Nigel Hugill, who chairs the HCA’s housing finance group, said attracting institutions into the sector was crucial. “We need to leverage new money into the sector … The long-term aspiration is to create a separate institutional residential sector,” he said.
130;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-07-20T00:38:37Z;Real estate: Are prices at the bottom?;;A smattering of construction workers amble around the Jumeirah Lake Towers development in Dubai, but the roads are somnolent and the ubiquitous desert dust wafts around the development, undisturbed by human habitation.JLT is a landmark mixed-use development of 87 towers along the arterial Sheikh Zayed Road, and was supposed to provide housing and offices for tens of thousands of residents and workers. But the partially-completed buildings are largely empty and serve as a potent example of the ferocity of the property meltdown.Collier International’s house price index of off-plan residential property fell 41 per cent in the first quarter of 2009, and prices are now back to the levels of mid-2007. Deutsche Bank estimates that property prices, – both commercial and residential – have halved since August last year, and could fall a further 15-20 per cent this year. A cull of jobs across the emirate is exacerbating the property crash.Dubai’s population will shrink 17 per cent in 2009, according to EFG-Hermes, a regional investment bank, and empty homes and offices are now legion.Saud Masud, a real-estate analyst at UBS, estimates that the vacancy rate of residential property could double to more than 30 per cent by the end of 2010, and forecasts that residential property prices could in total fall 70 per cent from their peak.Is any support for prices in sight? After the dizzying drop in house prices in the first quarter, Ian Albert, Colliers’ regional head, says he expects the consultancy’s house price index to soon show signs of stabilisation.The outlook has improved in part thanks to a cheap $10bn loan from the federal Abu Dhabi-based central bank – part of a $20bn bond programme launched this year.“You can actually see quite a few projects being completed, thanks to the injection of government bond funds going into Dubai, and liquidity starting to filter down into the contractors,” says Chet Riley, a real estate analyst at Nomura. “So it’s not the dust storm that some people think.”However, while the worst may be behind Dubai’s property market, it is still facing a fraught couple of years, analysts say.Developers are still trying to finish projects and analysts also fear that many expatriates may not return after the summer.“The summer period, and how we emerge from it, will be critical,” says Nicholas Maclean, regional managing director at CB Richard Ellis, the property and real estate services adviser.Mr Riley estimates that the combination of new units and a “summer exodus” of expatriates will flood the market with 40,000-50,000 residential units.The outlook for commercial property is even worse. While certain areas of prime commercial real estate are stabilising, overall the demand for offices will remain weak for the foreseeable future, says Mr Albert.Dubai has attempted to entice investors by extending the duration of visit visas for people who own property in the emirate to six months, and new laws aimed at stimulating the market are expected this summer. However, the property downturn has thrown up some legal issues that threaten to tarnish the longer-term reputation of Dubai’s real estate sector.Graft scandals started to emerge last year, but the sector has also been tainted by disputes between investors, developers and contractors. These range from disgruntled retail investors in planned developments that are unlikely to materialise, to contractors complaining of missing payments.The Dubai Chamber of Commerce admitted in May that its arbitration centre handled 80 dispute cases and received 322 requests for business mediation in the first four months of the year. In 2008 it handled 28 dispute cases, and 182 mediations.Major state-linked developers are reportedly offering just 65 per cent of money owed, and no payment until 2010. One expert estimates the total unpaid bills of Dubai’s state-backed developers at about $12bn.Analysts say that professional investors are starting to scout select segments of Dubai property for potential investments. But many longer-term international investors also have currency risks to contend with, as the UAE dirham is pegged to the dollar – which is expected to be affected by the US quantitative easing policy.“In order for liquidity to come back into the market you need cash and confidence,” says Mr Riley. “And at the moment we’re lacking in both.”
131;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-07-05T22:32:00Z;Nomura shifts to the Square Mile;;Nomura is in exclusive talks to move its UK business, including teams acquired from Lehman Brothers, into an office development in the City of London.In the largest office deal in the square mile since 2005, the Japanese investment bank is to move its 4,000 UK employees into Watermark Place, an office being built on the Thames.In what will be a blow to Canary Wharf, where Lehman was based, Nomura has decided to move back to the City because it sees the area as better for clients and staff.For Nomura’s Japanese management, a shift to the Square Mile is symbolically important. Kenichi Watanabe, chief executive, is keen to brand the bank as a traditional City institution.The 525,000 sq ft glass and steel building can house 5,000 people, giving Nomura room for expansion. The bank has been ramping up recruitment in the UK after the Lehman acquisition last year more than doubled staff numbers.Nomura has grown from 1,500 employees in London last September to more than 4,000. The bank has added 400 employees since January.The building, owned by Oxford Properties, the property arm of an Ontario pension fund, and UBS, was chosen for its three large trading floors and an outdoor roof terrace overlooking the Thames.Knight Frank and CB Richard Ellis are advising the owners.Nomura is said to have struck good terms on the deal given the slump in the City office market. The bank is said to have agreed several years without rent as part of a 20-year lease.The decision will provide a boost to the moribund City property market, where rents have fallen more than a third since the peak in 2007 and vacancies have risen.Nomura acquired Lehman Brothers’ European operations last autumn and quickly brought together many of the two groups’ bankers at Lehman’s old Canary Wharf HQ.But critics, including bank insiders, say Lehmanites have yet to identify themselves as Nomura bankers, in spite of “swear boxes”, fining bankers £5 a time for using the Lehman name in meetings.Nomura declined to comment ahead of an announcement due this month. Nomura is also expected today to announce that it has been granted a licence to operate in Saudi Arabia, the first Asian bank to have received approval.
132;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-06-10T20:45:54Z;Wall St slips on disappointing US debt sale;;US stocks slipped on Wednesday afternoon after a disappointing auction of government debt triggered a slump that was then erased by some positive economic news from the Federal Reserve.Equities had been drifting during the day, but took a noticeable dip after the end of the auction, which failed to attract the kind of bids the market was hoping for, exacerbating fears that high bond yields would push up interest rates.They then recovered after the Fed said that there were signs the that the economic contraction in some areas of the US was moderating.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite both closed down 0.4 per cent at 939.15 and 1,853.08 respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 8,739.02.“The economy is not falling quite so fast, but the big question is not how fast do we recover but how far do we recover. That is why stocks can’t break out of this range,” said Kim Caughey, investment analyst at Fort Pitt.Fears that rising interest rates would curb consumer spending took their toll on financial and consumer stocks.Morgan Stanley, which had been trading lower throughout the day after Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of rival Goldman Sachs, said the recession would be long and protracted, dropped further. Its shares closed down 5.6 per cent at $29.26. Goldman was 1.8 per cent lower at $146.68.Investors were particularly worried that mortgage rates would continue to rise on the back of higher bond yields. The recent climb in rates saw mortgage applications fall more than 7 per cent last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said on Wednesday.“Rising yields have been keeping a lid on stocks recently as falling bond prices attract investors away from equities,” said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo Advisers.Charles Zhang, managing partner of Zhang Financial, said inflation remained a serious long-term worry. “The US government will have to increase yields to make Treasury bonds attractive,” he said.Citigroup rose however as it got its long-awaited $58bn stock swap under way, the day after the board met Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in an effort to diffuse growing tensions between the two parties. The shares rose 2.1 per cent to $3.48.Big name consumer stocks also suffered, including McDonald’s, which dropped 1.2 per cent to $58.36 and Disney, which lost 0.9 per cent to $25.10.Even the home improvement retailers, which had performed well in the morning after Home Depot improved its full-year profit outlook on better profit margins, later slipped back. Home Depot finished 0.2 per cent up at $24.39 while rival Lowe’s dropped 0.4 per cent to $20.37.Brown-Forman was one of the few consumer stocks to hold onto its gains after it reported better results than expected.The company, which owns the Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort drinks brands, saw sales fall less than analysts had predicted and its shares climbed 3.3 per cent to $46.74.Earlier energy companies had risen on the price of oil, which briefly topped $71 for the first time since October.Despite losing some gains ExxonMobil hung on to gains of 1 per cent to $73.84, while ConocoPhillips rose 0.5 per cent to $45.76.Metal producers had initially fared well on rising raw materials prices, but later in the day, only steel manufacturers continued to hold their gains. AK Steel was 5.2 per cent up at $20.09 while US Steel gained 6.1 per cent to $40.13. Meanwhile Ameriprise became the latest in a long line of financial companies to announce that it would issue shares in order to raise further capital. The financial services company said it might use the money to make acquisitions, although it did not name specific targets. Its shares fell 7.3 per cent to $26.33.Elsewhere, shares in real estate broker CB Richard Ellis rose 13.6 per cent to $9.25 after the company said it would raise $400m by selling bonds and a further $100m by selling shares to Paulson & Co, the hedge fund. It said it may use the money to repay debt.

By mid-morning US crude was up $0.97 at $70.98.This boosted energy stocks, including Chevron, which gained 1.8 per cent to $71.43 and ConocoPhillips, which picked up 1.9 per cent to $46.40.Other commodities also continued the week’s gains, with rising metals prices driving shares in Alcoa, the aluminium producer, which rose 3.1 per cent to $11.50 and Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, which advanced 2.6 per cent to $60.47.Materials ane energy stocks drove the benchmark S&P 500 index higher, and after half an hour of trade, it was 0.4 per cent up at 946.44.

134;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-06-08T16:05:39Z;Alternative investments: Expected bonanza yet to arrive;;When the credit crisis hit in the summer of 2007, investors saw an opportunity. Suddenly, those that could went to market and raised billions of dollars of capital in the hope of gaining assets on the cheap from distressed sellers.Real estate – the sector at the heart of the credit crisis – was hit first and hardest. Private equity saw an opportunity to take advantage of the distress.In 2008, private equity real estate debt funds raised record-breaking volumes of capital for such opportunities. According to data provider Preqin, 166 funds raised $116.73bn.Many were targeting distressed real estate and debt. Those investors are now chasing equity-like performance in the debt markets, with returns of more than 15 per cent.In 2008, more than a quarter of the capital raised was for this purpose. In 2006 it accounted for just 7 per cent. The trend continues into 2009, with 36 per cent of total capital raised looking to take advantage of the slump in real estate prices, but also capitalise on opportunities to provide debt to, or buy portfolios of real estate debt from, distressed sellers.But so far these funds, like many funds focused on distressed debt, have not seen the activity they might have expected.“Debt funds are struggling to invest at the pace they envisaged because the market has stalled – there is only limited new buying or selling of properties,” says Robin Hubbard, executive director in Real Estate Finance at CB Richard Ellis in London.“Moreover, the opportunities for these funds to step in to provide rescue financing is not yet materialising because lenders have decided to extend the maturity of credit facilities and hike up margins and fees, rather than potentially take a capital hit by selling their debt.”Private equity fund Carlyle Group’s real estate team has been active in Europe since 2000.In 2008 they raised a €2.2bn ($3.1bn) fund. Robert Hodges, managing director in the UK real estate group at Carlyle, says so far only 30 per cent of the fund is invested, with no investments made in the past eight months.However, he expects the market to be active for the next 24 months.Last year the fund bought a €1.1bn portfolio of commercial mortgage backed securities from Lehman Brothers. The portfolio continues to perform well despite the deterioration in the market. “When we buy a portfolio of debt we consider whether or not we would mind owning the underlying assets, we take a property view, we do not look at them like financial instruments we can trade out of,” says Mr Hodges.But Alexander Strassburger, an associate director at the fund, admits buying more debt is difficult. “Banks are still not willing to make big write-offs so they are keeping assets, restructuring them into different vehicles and waiting. The first quarter of 2009 has been very quiet in terms of debt trading.“When it comes to opportunities in Europe, the US banks are more inclined to discuss potential debt trades at a discount than the European banks, who will not even consider them at the moment,” says Mr Strassburger.Real estate funds focused solely on debt investments have further problems. “Debt-only funds face challenges because real estate debt opportunities are currently pricing at a level that is also attractive to equity funds, so there is increased competition for limited deal flow,” says David Finkel, managing principal at Westbrook Partners, which has $2.5bn of fresh capital to invest.Partners at Westbrook also say that initial estimates of how much debt would be traded in Europe were wrong because many of the banks held on to assets.“The flow of distressed real estate debt will depend largely on the ultimate form of government-backed restructuring initiatives, such as the proposed “bad bank” in Germany or the asset protection scheme in the UK, and the implications that will have for the banks’ future strategies,” says Zubin Irani, also a managing principal at Westbrook.Investors remain positive. The first quarter of 2009 saw the launch of two of the largest distressed and debt vehicles ever, according to Preqin. Lone Star has been looking to raise $10bn for Lone Star Real Estate Fund II to invest in distressed commercial assets and $10bn for another fund to take advantage of distressed residential mortgages as well as distressed corporate debt.“When you hit the bottom of the market no one raises a flag and blows a trumpet – it is not a clear event, but we can see we are close enough to the bottom of the market to make it interesting now,” says Carlyle’s Robert Hodges.“Some of the best opportunities will be investing directly into property. In the UK, prices have come down so much, more than in any other European market. Against 10-year averages, prices look cheap today. I expect valuations to start to recover in 2011, 2012,” he adds.Banks and other lenders are soon expected to have to deal with the troubled assets they may have so far left alone.“The important issue now for those in troubled situations, whether they be a borrower or a lender, is to get fresh capital into existing deals sooner rather than later,” says Mr Hubbard.“If you’re hoping the property market will bail you out later and it doesn’t, you will be at the end of a potentially very long queue waiting with a lot of people for only a finite amount of capital, the terms of which won’t be attractive.”
135;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-05-28T23:16:49Z;Credit Suisse begins London property sale;;Credit Suisse has begun a sale of its London property estate that could raise as much as £500m (€572m) as part of a strategy to focus on core banking operations.The investment bank this week instructed CB Richard Ellis to begin marketing the smaller of its two buildings in Canary Wharf, with indications that its landmark tower at Cabot Square is also likely to be brought to the market before the end of the year.In total, the sales of the two buildings – 20 Columbus Courtyard and 1 Cabot Square – could raise more than £500m, depending on the terms set by the bank on the length of its occupancy and rent.The move comes as other banks and companies look to sell off non-core assets, with property advisers forecasting that several billion pounds of sale and leaseback deals will be completed in the next few months.HSBC, which occupies a neighbouring building on Canary Wharf, is conducting the largest transaction, with just weeks to go before the bank is expected to pick a buyer for its $2bn global headquarters portfolio.The sales by the banks come in spite of the slump in the property sector, which has left some advisers questioning the timing of the offerings given a drop of almost half since the peak in 2007.The move by Credit Suisse to sell the real estate was part of a longstanding strategy to focus on core banking operations, people close to the bank said. They said the bank was under no pressure to sell if it did not find sufficient value.Credit Suisse has a tier one capital ratio – a measure of a bank’s financial strength – of more than 14 per cent, towards the higher end of the banking sector.Credit Suisse would not comment directly on the sale process, but added: “Credit Suisse regularly reviews its global property portfolio in order to ensure we are maximising the efficient use of capital and resources. A sale and leaseback of our Canary Wharf buildings in London is one option that we review on a regular basis.”HSBC, meanwhile, is in talks to sell three of its office buildings in London, New York and Paris in a deal that is expected to raise about $2bn. Potential buyers are said to include a number of wealthy families, who are interested in the fixed income from the rents on offer, as well as sovereign wealth funds and other institutional buyers.

137;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
138;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-05-11T20:29:46Z;Bank stocks a drag on Wall Street;;US stocks fell on Monday, giving back almost all the gains made on Friday in the wake of the government’s stress test results.Investors remained focused on financial stocks after three companies said they would issue shares to raise capital to pay off government bail-out funds.The results of last week’s stress tests had revealed that Capital One, BB&T and US Bancorp would not need new capital to survive the government’s adverse economic scenario. But the companies said on Monday that they would raise money to free themselves from government restrictions.Capital One said it would sell 56m common shares and its stock fell 13.5 per cent to $27.10. US Bancorp said it wanted $2.5bn from its issuance, sending its shares 9.9 per cent lower to $18.50.BB&T said it would use the additional $1.5bn it planned to raise also to boost tier one capital, an effort supported by a deep cut in its dividend. The company fell 7.6 per cent to $24.34.Other banking stocks also lost ground after last week’s impressive gains, even though reports over the weekend indicated the banks may need less capital than estimated if their earnings remain strong.Wells Fargo lost ground after it said it could fill its remaining $13.7bn deficit with earnings alone by November, having taken $7.5bn from a public offering on Friday. Its shares avoided the worst of the selling but slipped 5.9 per cent to $26.53.Even Morgan Stanley, which also successfully raised capital from a stock offering on Friday and which was upgraded by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Monday, lost ground. Its shares fell 7.6 per cent to $26.07, even though Bank of America said its shares would do well on “long-term earnings power”.Prudential, the life assurer, was a particularly heavy faller after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to “neutral”, slashing its price target. Goldman upgraded the company just over two weeks ago, triggering a 10.8 per cent rise in its shares. They lost 12.3 per cent to $40.33 on Monday.Principal Financial, Prudential’s rival, also slumped after saying it would offer 42.3m shares, valued at over $1bn, in order to bolster its capital position. The shares lost 14.1 per cent to $20.34.Huntington Bancshares was one of the few financial companies to find gains as Bank of America said the company would start posting a profit in 2011. Its shares jumped 9.8 per cent to $5.71.The S&P 500 fell 2.2 per cent to 909.24, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8 per cent to 8,418.77.“If the S&P can get through the first half of this week without breaking through 900 it will be a win for the bulls,” said David Kreinces, portfolio manager at ETF PM.The Nasdaq Composite index fell a relatively modest 0.5 per cent to 1,731.24, however, amid resilience from technology stocks.Microsoft lost 0.5 per cent to $19.32 after the company said it would sell debt in order to take advantage of its rare triple-A credit rating. It has resisted taking on debt for years.“The fact that Microsoft is issuing debt suggests they must think the environment is pretty good and rates are going to be going up because the economy will improve,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors.Intel rallied ahead of the European Union’s decision on whether to approve action against the company on allegations that it abused its dominant market position. Lawyers forecast that any potential fine could be one of the heaviest implemented in Europe but the stock edged 0.5 per cent higher to $15.37.Energy producers lost ground as the price of oil fell following its recent rally, during which it reached new highs for the year. Chevron lost 3.4 per cent to $68 and ExxonMobil dropped 1.6 per cent to $69.27.CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services company, was one of the S&P’s biggest fallers after the company was downgraded by Goldman Sachs to “sell”. Its shares dropped 10.6 per cent to $8.38.General Motors was another heavy faller as Fritz Henderson, chief executive, said it was “more probable” that the company would file for bankruptcy by June 1 in his latest update on the car company’s restructuring efforts. Its stock gave up 10.6 per cent to $1.44.

But the companies announced on Monday they would offer $1.5bn or more in stock to free themselves from government restrictions.All three fell in early trade on the prospect of unexpected shareholder dilution. Capital One gave up 9.4 per cent to $28.39, while BB&T lost 4.3 per cent to $25.19 and US Bancorp dropped 4.2 per cent to $19.68.Other banking stocks also lost ground after last week’s impressive gains, even though reports over the weekend showed the banks may need even less capital than announced by the government if their earnings remain strong.Wells Fargo said it could fill its remaining $13.7bn deficit by earnings alone by November, having taken $7.5bn from a public offering on Friday, which was more than expected. But its shares fell amid the wider profit-taking, losing 2.6 per cent to $27.45.Even Morgan Stanley, which also successfully raised capital from a stock offering on Friday, and which was upgraded by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Monday, lost ground. Its shares fell 4.6 per cent to $26.91 even as Bank of America said the company’s shares would do well on “long-term earnings power”.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported its worst quarterly loss in at least two decades as the company looked to regain losses after buying shares in energy producer ConocoPhillips shortly before the price of oil crashed. Its shares lost 2.1 per cent to $93,300.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8 per cent to 912.39 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.4 per cent to 8,451.35 points. The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 1 per cent to 1,721.08 points.“The rally in the financials is stretched, but players are gaining exposure believing the banks are solvent and capital needs will be met. We believe the market is ahead of itself,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global Research.CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services company, was the S&P’s biggest faller in early trade after the company was downgraded by Goldman Sachs to “sell”. Its shares slumped 12.1 per cent to $8.24.General Motors was another heavy faller after Swedish news agency TT said the company was currently considering two bidders for its Saab unit. This followed reports last week from Reuters that the struggling car maker was running due diligence on 10 bidders. Its shares gave up 5.6 per cent to $1.52.Energy producers lost ground as the price of oil fell back following its recent rally, during which it reached new highs for the year. Oil was trading $0.96 lower at $57.67 per barrel of US crude early on Wall Street, while Chevron lost 2.9 per cent to $68.36 and Exxon Mobil dropped 1.7 per cent to $69.18.Intel rose ahead of the European Union’s decision on whether to approve action against the company after a decade-long investigation into allegations that it abused its dominant market position to force out its main competitor from the market. Lawyers predicted any potential fine could be one of the heaviest ever implemented in Europe, but the stock edged 0.6 per cent upwards to $15.38.Elsewhere in the sector Microsoft slid 0.6 per cent to $19.31 after the company that it would sell debt in order to take advantage of its rare triple-AAA credit rating. The company has resisted taking on debt for years.Target slipped slightly ahead of an impending shareholder meeting at which Bill Ackman, the billionaire activist investor, was due to call for the replacement of several board members, saying they do not have relevant expertise to compete with rival retailer Wal-Mart. Its shares declined 2.4 per cent to $42.76.Investors responded negatively to News Corp’s plan to charge users of the Wall Street Journal’s website by the article. The “micro-payments” system would mark a change from current subscription models, but investors avoided the stock on Monday, sending it 2.4 per cent lower to $9.43.European stocks were down early on Wall Street, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index faling 1.6 per cent to 852.17 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, led by a 0.2 per cent rise in the Nikkei to a on a six-month closing high of 9,451.98 points.Bond yields were down.

140;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-04-19T17:15:23Z;Green shoots appear on stony ground;;"The unveiling of plans for a new £193m central library in Birmingham has provided the city’s battered property sector with a rare piece of positive news.Private developers have toppled like ninepins under the impact of credit scarcity and weak demand for office and residential schemes. As a result, the property industry, which at its peak surpassed manufacturing in its contribution to West Midlands GDP, is looking to the public sector for salvation.The library designs have been published after years of wrangling over the form and location of the building, which would replace a concrete monstrosity that London-based aesthetes are mounting a rearguard action to preserve.The development, encased in a metal lattice alluding to the city’s manufacturing heritage, would boast 20 per cent more space and a home for historic archives. Dutch architects Mecanoo designed the new structure that would be built by contractor Carillion and project manager Capita Symonds.However, bringing the scheme to fruition depends both on securing planning permission and on Birmingham City Council making land sales to private investors.The library is therefore a microcosm of the development environment in the city. About £20bn in new schemes have been approved but they will take a long time to realise without improving investor sentiment.The council, whose re-sources are not infinite, figures as the key backer for many schemes. For example, it recently announced a £20m loan supporting the £32m redevelopment of Edgbaston cricket ground by Warwickshire County Cricket Club. The club sees the revamp as crucial to securing future Test matches and the revenue they generate. However, planning permission was refused following complaints from local residents.Even the briefest tour of central Birmingham illustrates the jarring cyclicality that afflicts real estate. Monuments to overshoot include the Royal Mint, a stalled luxury apartments scheme; and Edgbaston Galleries, a mixed-use development proposed by Calthorpe Estates, whose cleared site is doing more prosaic duty as a car park.Another landmark, in the city centre business district, is Colmore Plaza, ranked as the UK’s largest speculatively built office block outside London when it was launched last March. The 300,000 sq ft development, owned by US private equity group Carlyle, has let little more than the single floor secured at launch.“We are in a very tough market for office space, but it is not all bad,” says Philippa Pickavance, partner at property consultants Drivers Jonas and chairman of the Birmingham Office Forum, a local industry body.She points out that 2008 saw the highest uptake of office space in Birmingham – 1m square feet. This included law firm Wragge & Co taking 256,000 sq ft of the New Snow Hill Development and Deutsche Bank leasing 68,000 sq ft at Brindleyplace for its back office.It is unlikely 2009 will set any records, except perhaps for price falls and stagnation. However, “the mood is beginning to improve,” according to Will Ventham, associate director at CB Richard Ellis, “But we are still in a very tough market. Many agents do not think that we will get to even half the take-up of last year.”Birmingham is not unusual among British cities in the scale of its empty office stock – about 2.6m sq ft out of a total of 18.7m sq ft. Prices for grade A space have dropped from a £33 per square foot per year to £28 or below.Mr Ventham says: “We are offering an opportunity for office relocations out of the south-east that will be predominantly public sector.”But many other towns and cities across the country are pursuing the same taxpayer-backed customers.Among the green shoots appearing is the Kettle Works in Birmingham’s historic Jewellery Quarter, a 250,000 sq ft office development by Coventry developer Deeley Group that recently secured planning permission.Tim Hurdiss, a director at Deeley, believes the glut of grade A space is counterbalanced by a shortage of cheaper offices. The completed Kettle Works will be marketed at about £15 per square foot.John Dodds, Midlands director of quoted developer St Modwen, says business parks in which the company specialises are weathering the economic storm better than city centres. He reports that business is picking up aided by greater flexibility of terms. He says: “If an occupier cannot get finance we are granting leases with an option to purchase later.”The tentative optimism in regional property markets is consistent with other early signs of an economic rebound. But it will take years for city centres such as Birmingham’s to clear their glut of office space."
141;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-03-13T15:24:31Z;Property: Funding debate is one for after the slump;;The property market faces a potential crisis in marrying the very different demands on green issues and production levels. The question that many are asking is: who pays? There are few willing to take on the additional costs that inevitably result from greener buildings, be it offices and shops, or houses.Commercial property appears to be the easier target than residential, in the UK, given that the government does not have the same incentives to provide offices in the way it does housing.Martin Francis, director of BNP Paribas Real Estate Investment Management, points out the immediate problem of funding: “There is clearly a cost issue to environmental efficiency and who is going to pay for the cost of improving the environmental performance of buildings, on both new and existing stock.“Will it be landlords, tenants or through government incentives or a combination? In the current economic climate, and without legislative pressure, I expect this agenda to be delayed.”These delays are unwelcome, given that 44 per cent of carbon emissions in the UK is estimated to come from buildings. About 18 per cent is attributed to non-domestic property, through energy use, waste and water production.The problem of payment comes mainly down to the cost of construction so, initially, the onus is on the developer. According to research by CB Richard Ellis, the commercial property company, the basic levels of certification raise costs by about 2 or 3 per cent but the development of a significantly greener building is likely to add between 5 per cent and 7.5 per cent.CBRE estimates that the development of a zero-carbon building could add a premium of about 12.5 per cent, a significant additional cost for an industry in which profit margins can be tight.With developers likely to be unwilling to take this cost without reward, the question is then whether tenants will pay extra. Undoubtedly, there are those asking for better-quality offices. It is becoming a key part of corporate social responsibility given that about half of a company’s CO2 emissions are believed to be produced by its real estate.CBRE says there is evidence of higher rents for greener buildings in the US, and there is also the added benefit of lower running costs. Depending on the level of improvement, it says, savings at least exceed 10 per cent and could be well more than 50 per cent.These factors are so far untested to any real extent in the UK, however, and during the next few years of economic uncertainty there will be fewer willing to commit themselves to significant capital expenditure on new modern offices while cutting costs elsewhere. Research by Knight Frank suggests factors such as rental cost and retention of staff are more important to tenants than energy efficiency. There needs to be a leap of faith on the part of the developer to take the extra costs in the expectation that rents will be higher – or be forced into line by legislation.Much of this debate is moot, however, given the downturn in the commercial property market. Chris Jofeh, director of Arup, says that existing buildings should be the focus, rather than new builds with the emphasis on cost saving, rather than doing environmental good.“There are numerous relatively simple, quick wins such as making behavioural changes, that can save up to 20 per cent on energy bills [and emissions] immediately. The cost of doing nothing is likely to far outweigh the cost of change, or the penalty for regulatory non-compliance.”Hermes Real Estate will this year fund an initiative that will challenge experts to come up with a sustainable re-design of existing buildings.There is also confusion over the multitude of sustainability policies, regulations, tools and standards for the sector, which recently prompted the UK Green Building Council to call on ministers to draw up a single framework. The problem of payment is just as acute for residential: who pays for these green improvements in a market where prices for all property are spiralling ever lower, and no private sector developer wants to build any sort of housing?With completions expected to drop beneath 80,000, compared with a government target of 240,000 a year, a decision will have to be made about which is more important – volume or green house building. In order to do both, the question remains: who pays? It is an important one, given the government’s demand that all housing be zero-carbon by 2016.CBRE points to a study conducted at a sustainable residential scheme in Reading that revealed four-fifths of residents would pay up to £3,000 ($4,171) for each group of green features – but this was less than the cost of installation. The majority valued the “envirohome” below its full cost. This study was in an affluent neighbourhood at a time of rising prices, suggesting that this is going to be the best possible result for some time.Given that many buyers are struggling to afford a home, let alone one with extra costs for green features, there are unlikely to be any big steps until after the housing slump.The question of funding will remain central – but debate is likely to begin in earnest only when development starts up again.That will not happen until builders become more confident, which may take some time.
142;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2009-02-19T22:56:14Z;Hong Kong property;;"Property is a classic hedge against inflation. So no surprise that Robert Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe – where inflation reached 98 per cent a day in November – has reportedlyblown over $5m on a home in Hong Kong. But surely any logic ends there?Hong Kong, the world’s fifth most expensive property market, has suffered as wealthy speculators and tenants evaporate. Luxury home prices on Hong Kong island fell by a third, quarter-on-quarter, in October-December, and 19 per cent year-on-year, according to CB Richard Ellis. On the Peak, once home to colonial government mandarins, prices had the sharpest decline since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. Transactions have slowed dramatically, with just 258 deals in January compared with 734 a year ago. Lowlier purchasers, too, are feeling the pinch. New mortgage loans drawn down fell 11 per cent month-on-month in December to one-third the levels of December 2007. Rising unemployment, reluctant lenders and an exodus of foreign investors (plus shoals of expat bankers) imply further declines.Yet, on this score at least, Mr Mugabe may not be completely barmy. Luxury residential prices are still at roughly double the lows chalked up during the Sars virus and 1998. While markets can test previous lows, the fundamentals look better this time round. The territory’s banks are highly liquid, with just over half of all deposits lent out. New mortgage applications approved rose 23 per cent month-on-month in December. Mortgage payments as a percentage of household income are virtually one-third those of a decade ago, according to UBS. Rental yields are a decent 3.5-4.5 per cent at the luxury end. There is little real distress. Delinquency rates are a negligible 0.05 per cent and fewer than 11,000 homes, worth an aggregate $3.2bn, are in negative equity. Mr Mugabe may not turn a quick profit, but he probably isn’t going to take a bath either.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

143;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-11-27T23:32:27Z;Race is on to sell Woolworths stores;;The race is on to start selling Woolworths’ 800-strong stores portfolio ahead of the next rent bill which is due by Christmas.Retailers from Asda to Iceland have voiced some interest, while discount chains Aldi and Lidl are also looking to expand aggressively.On Wednesday afternoon the administrators appointed CBRE to sell the stores in what is expected to be a quick process.Malcolm Walker, chief executive of Iceland, said that he would be interested in buying a tranche of stores.The retailer, which in September fronted a consortium led by Baugur, had offered about £50m for the stores but that approach was swiftly rejected by Woolworths’ board.Speaking from the middle of the Atlantic where he is sailing, Mr Walker said: “To run Woolies as Woolies, which is what we wanted to do, is now a lost opportunity.“We’d be keen to buy some stores though for Iceland. I guess lots of people will be interested, even in this climate”.One retail executive said he thought the administrators would have to seal deals by the middle of next week.“We are coming into the busiest days of the year. When the quarterly rent payment comes round [on December 25] there will be no stock left and no money to pay the rents, so this has got to be a 3½- week job.”Another retailer said that the administrators faced an invidious choice if they failed to sell on the stores before the next rent payment was due.“The dilemma then will be do they pay the rent or do they put the stores into receivership and terminate the leases?”Retailers have already been picking off the cream of Woolworths since the chain started touting some of its stores around a year or so ago. Tesco bought nine stores from the variety chain in October for £9m which will be turned into Tesco Express sites. Waitrose also bought four bigger sites from Woolworths in the summer for £25.5m.Having agreed to buy up the stores earlier this year, Tesco would have already taken a close look at the portfolio. But with those stores under its belt, it is unlikely that the retailer would now be in the market for more than a small handful of sites in the existing estate.Asda, the second-largest supermarket chain in the UK, was also quick to play down its ambition, saying: “We wouldn’t rule out being interested in a small number of stores, but that said, our strategy is not to be in convenience retailing on the high street.”
144;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-11-19T03:30:54Z;Asia focus: Hope remains for a little more resilience;;"As growth faded in the western economies last year, there was much talk of Asia escaping the global cycle of boom and bust.The concept of a decoupled regional economy appears to be debunked now, with many countries facing harsher economic conditions in the wake of the financial meltdown.Yet, many investors hope the region’s property markets, along with other sections of their economies, will prove more resilient than in other parts of the world.There has been a wave of fund-raising among global investors hoping to target rates of return that are still attractive compared with western countries.Last month, Merrill Lynch completed a $2.6bn fundraising for its Asian opportunity fund, its first dedicated to real estate in Asia. It follows similarly large raisings by LaSalle Investment Management and MGPA, taking the amount of equity raised this year in Asia above $10bn.Invista Real Estate has raised a £50m ($75m) fund to invest in Asia-Pacific, mainly Japan, while Grosvenor, the property company owned by the Duke of Westminster, has launched a $600m fund to invest in shopping centres in China. It joins investors such as China Real Estate Opportunities.Nicholas Loup, chief executive of Grosvenor Asia, says the fund plans to benefit from China’s domestic consumption, expected to grow with the local economy. He points to a limited supply of shopping malls.This is the main target for property investors and developers: tapping into the underlying growth not just in population but also in the affluence of consumers who should ultimately support the property market.More jobs mean more office space; more money means more spending and more shops; more development means greater infrastructure and the need for hotels, restaurants and other modern conveniences.Stuart Webster, head of international property at New Star, the fund manager, says the region is not decoupled from the global recession, but identifies positives, such as the emerging middle class and less reliance on the west for exports.There is also potentially stronger demand and less supply than in the west, he says, but the picture varies, with more mature markets seeing pressure on pricing owing to their greater liquidity and transparency.Mr Webster favours Japanese offices, because of tight supply, steady demand and underlying land value growth. He also likes offices in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Thailand. However, he says Korea is too tight to get sensible prices, despite good fundamental reasons to invest.William Hill, head of real estate at fund manager Schroders, sees opportunities in buying from distressed sellers, particularly in Australia and Japan, while there are potentially good investments in unlisted funds looking for prime assets in the region, according to Adrian Baker, of CBRE Investors.“Such opportunities should produce strong annualised returns while taking on minimal risk,” he says. “Markets with more risk exposure, such as India, will see less investor appetite in the short term, as a result.”However, for all the intent among investors, property markets across the region have deteriorated, with falls being recorded in prices, transaction levels and rents.There has been a particularly sharp fall-off in sales volume, according to Real Capital Analytics, down by 68 per cent in the third quarter, compared with the same period the year before.Australia experienced the greatest drop, a 74 per cent fall in volume, with similar declines in south-east Asia, China and Japan.Real Capital Analytics says some of the fall in transactions in China resulted from new regulations intended to slow speculation and land hoarding.“Early on, investors flocked to Asia,” it says, “thinking it might be immune to the credit crunch. They drove property yields lower, however cap rates on recent transactions are now up 25 basis points.”Andrew Ness, executive director for CB Richard Ellis Asia, says Asian banks are generally better placed to withstand a downturn, but they have become conservative in providing loans and, as a result, property sales are falling.For the office market, the problem is that, even as prices slide, there is no longer any certainty over income levels from tenants as the period of stellar rental growth appears to be over.Meanwhile, supply is increasing in cities such as Hong Kong, Brisbane and Perth, and, in the medium term, Singapore, Seoul and Kuala Lumpur.According to CBRE, office vacancy increases have been recorded in 14 of the 16 big regional office markets in the third quarter.Confidence has been shaken, even though corporate bankruptcies and job cuts in Asia have been less severe to date, Mr Ness says. Many companies have postponed plans for expansion.The region’s leading financial centres are to be more severely impacted, with further consolidation in the financial sector resulting in additional downward pressure on rents.The retail market also shows signs of caution amid concerns at a dip in tourist arrivals, increased operating costs and a drop in consumer spending.Mr Ness says Asia has “changed with surprising rapidity from being a buyer’s to a seller’s market”, as capital-strained banks and institutions come under pressure to dispose of real estate assets.As elsewhere in the world, highly-leveraged investors have largely stepped out of the region’s markets, while core investors, including pension and sovereign wealth funds, have adopted a more cautious stance.Mr Ness concludes that opportunities remain for investors over the longer and medium term, as those starved of financing are forced to offer attractive deals, but the short term may prove more of a struggle.……………………………………………………………………..Poised to benefit from the bottom of the US marketAs if the credit crisis were not enough, the US commercial property market faces a fresh set of problems, writes Daniel Pimlott.With gross domestic product shrinking in the third quarter, unemployment soaring and consumer spending falling, tenants are delaying making decisions or going out of business. A glut of space is building and deadlines for paying off loans are looming.“In 2009, US commercial real estate faces its worst year since the wrenching 1991-1992 industry depression,” the Urban Land Institute, a Washington think-tank, says in its annual report on real estate markets.Price have fallen at least 15 per cent from the peak in late 2007, according to a report from CB Richard Ellis, in places as much as 40 per cent. The property industry is retrenching, focusing on keeping tenants, trying to fill vacancies, managing properties and pushing off debt commitments. “Cashflow rules,” says Earl Webb, head of Jones Lang Lasalle capital markets.While the dearth of credit and the slowdown hit weakened investors, those with cash to spare want to know when the turning point is, hoping for opportunities.Michael Pralle, president of JE Robert Companies, cautions: “We tend to be in the bottom longer than most people expect and also longer at the top.” A recent survey by Ernst & Young, found 58 per cent of real estate investors planned to buy next year, with only 8 per cent saying they would sell.Mr Pralle says: “The buying opportunities are going to be the best in my lifetime”."
145;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-11-13T21:42:21Z;Wall St surges at end of volatile day;Traders snap up battered stocks;A spectacular rally late in the session allowed Wall Street stocks to rebound from a fresh five-year intraday low hit earlier in the day.All sectors surged when bullish traders snapped up battered stocks across the board in the hope the market had set a new bottom.The volatile trading came as investors weighed another round of bleak corporate and economic news with the prospect that such developments may force the government to take further action to galvanise growth.The market shrugged off grim unemployment figures that showed benefits jumped past half a million to levels not seen since the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks, and snapped its three-day losing streak.Yet the benchmark S&P 500 index swung between gains and losses throughout the session and was at one point down as much as 3.9 per cent.“It got kind of ugly out there,” said Richard Parower of J&W Seligman.Some bearish technical strategists feared that now the market has breached the psychologically signifcant barrier hit last month, it could retest previous lows and slump to levels not seen since 1997.The S&P rocketed to stand 6.9 per cent higher at 911.29, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 6.7 per cent up at 8,835.25 points and the Nasdaq Composite index 6.5 per cent ahead at 1,596.7 points.“Volatility remains unabated,” said Tobias Levkovich, strategist at Citigroup.The energy sector was in particular favour, surging 11.1 per cent overall as oil rebounded above $59 a barrel.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart provided at least some reassurance that the drop in consumer spending may not be as spectacular as some feared. Although the world’s largest retailer trimmed its full-year profit forecast, the group remained optimistic about the current quarter, which includes the vital festive season. Its shares added 4.4 per cent to $54.93.CB Richard Ellis Group surged 43 per cent to $5.39 after the commercial property broker successfully raised about $180m through a public sale of shares at $3.77 a piece.Ford gained 3.3 per cent on rising hopes Washington may bail out the automative sector.Yet General Motors finished 4.2 per cent lower at $2.95 after Goldman Sachs dropped its coverage on the stock. Earlier this week, Deutsche Bank set a price target of zero for GM shares and recommended clients sell them.Technology was the worst-performing sector early on Thursday, pushed lower by a warning on revenue and margins from sector bellwether Intel, but the sector later rallied with the market and finished 6.1 per cent higher.The chipmaker closed up 6.1 per cent to $234.88 even though JPMorgan analysts told clients that demand for Intel’s products was “going down the drain”.“We expect this to happen to every semiconductor company,” they said.National Semiconductor also lowered revenue guidance, but its shares added 9.2 per cent to $12.37 after the company unveiled plans to cut about 5 per cent of its workforce. Citigroup said the move could save up to $13m a quarter.The development prompted another sell-off of hardware manufacturers such as Dell, which slid 2.2 per cent to $10.27.Goldman Sachs added the world’s second-largest personal computer maker to its “conviction sell” list and forecast earnings would deteriorate further.Google, which in the previous session dropped below the psychologically significant $300 mark for the first time in more than three years, recovered 7.2 per cent to $312.08.The gain came even though analysts at Jefferies and Co became the latest to cut their forecasts due to expected lower demand for its advertising space.Financials – one of the biggest victims in the previous session after the US government abandoned its plan to buy toxic assets – recovered 7.1 per cent overall.CIT Group surged 26.2 per cent to $4.24 after the commercial finance group became the latest institution to seek approval to become a bank holding company as well as funding under the government’s recapitalisation programme.American Express, which did both earlier in the week, gained 3.6 per cent to $20.78 even after Barclays estimated charge-offs on the group’s US credit cards would reach 10 per cent by the fourth quarter next year.
146;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-10-30T14:21:52Z;Property: Builders move on to difficult ground;;It is not always easy to pinpoint the moment when a property market turns. But for the office property market in Edinburgh one such moment was when it emerged during the summer that part of the big Springside project was being put on hold.Springside is a project to redevelop the site of Scottish & Newcastle’s brewery at Fountainbridge, half a mile west of the city centre. The scheme, by AMA, Grosvenor and Royal Bank of Scotland, is to build 600 new homes and 140,000 sq ft of office space on what has been called Edinburgh’s largest brownfield site.Now, with construction work already under way, the office space to be built is to be halved and the developers are considering building a hotel instead of offices. According to Hamish Sutherland of the property company Colliers CRE, “if the developers had known what was going to happen in the property market they probably wouldn’t have gone ahead in the first place.”The global credit crunch began in August 2007. The supply of credit by banks and lending institutions was tightened, but the effects only recently became apparent on the ground.Cameron Stott, of Jones Lang LaSalle in Edinburgh, says: “We were pleasantly surprised in the summer at how well the market stood up. The developers are now getting more nervous, but there’ve been no actual cancellations. The first sections of the Quartermile – [a massive scheme to build 1.6m sq ft of flats, offices and retail outlets on the 19-acre site of the old Edinburgh Royal Infirmary] – are nearing completion.”Elsewhere in Edinburgh the financial structure of some property schemes is being changed, with new financial partners being brought in, which is likely to reduce the profit that the developer initially envisaged.But Mr Stott says: “The good thing is that Edinburgh doesn’t have the oversupply of office accommodation that cities like Manchester and Birmingham have. That’s partly because five years ago we didn’t have new schemes. Supply is still relatively tight and that means we are still predicting rental growth.”The office property markets in Edinburgh and Glasgow are roughly the same size and top rents for Grade A space in each city have in recent years come closer together, though Edinburgh is in the lead, at £29 ($46) per sq ft compared with £27.50 in Glasgow. But there is a big difference in the type of market that each city serves. Demand in Edinburgh has been driven by its hitherto strong financial sector though the professional services sector is now a significant source of demand.In Glasgow demand for office space comes from a bigger range of users. It has benefited from inward investment, supported by development assistance from the government and the European Union. It has also been boosted by the decentralisation policy of the previous Labour administration in the Scottish government, under which civil service departments were ordered to move from Edinburgh.Glasgow has had a vibrant office property market in the last few years. “2007 was extremely strong,” says Mike Buchan of Jones Lang LaSalle’s Glasgow office. “There was a very high rate of take-up of space, and several new schemes were started. New developments were coming out of the ground and quickly being occupied.”The take-up of completed grade A office space continued into 2008 but at a slower rate than in 2007. Take-up in Glasgow’s central business district was 167,900 sq ft in the first six months of the year, compared with 457,000 sq ft in the same period of 2007, according to Richard Ellis, the property consultants.As the credit crunch started to bite, property developers began feeling nervous. “The high cost of borrowing money, combined with greater construction costs, are now putting developers off,” says Mr Buchan.Just as is predicted for Edinburgh, he expects a gap between the supply and demand for new office space in Glasgow emerging in 2010 after the current wave of completions comes to an end. “This position is challenging but it’s not desperate.”While Edinburgh and Glasgow are starting to feel the effects of the credit crunch, things are different in Aberdeen. Although the price of crude oil has declined from this year’s peaks, the office property market remains strong, driven by an underlying shortage of grade A office space in the centre. New capacity has come onstream and been snapped up, and the top rent achieved has reached £30 per sq ft, putting Aberdeen ahead of Scotland’s two leading cities.Meanwhile a new arrival is emerging on the office property scene. Midway between Glasgow and Edinburgh, a new office development is being constructed close to the M8 motorway at Eurocentral, Scotland’s European freight hub. The location is the former Chunghwa Picture Tubes plant, a big inward investment project of the 1990s which fell spectacularly short of expectations.In a £330m investment the developer Maxim Properties intends to create 756,000 sq ft of office accommodation in 10 high quality office buildings – the first of which will be finished in November with another due to be ready in December and others following during 2009. Maxim sees the project as serious competition to the office markets of Glasgow and Edinburgh.Looking at the office market in Scotland as a whole, Alan Stewart, the property partner at the solicitors Maclay Murray & Spens, says: “The reality is that we are moving into difficult and uncertain territory. The property market is not immune from the wider economic uncertainty. We will see some development activities slowed down.”

The Nasdaq Composite index was 3 per cent lower at 1,505.90 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.4 per cent at 8,175.77.Energy stocks were the biggest laggard, under pressure from oil’s fall to a fresh low for the year, down 5.7 per cent overall. ExxonMobil and Chevron, which report results later in the week, lost 4.3 per cent to $66.09 and 3.4 per cent to $61.71, respectively.Among the industrials, Caterpillar lost 1.6 per cent to $32.78, after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “buy” to “hold”.General Motors shed another 8.4 per cent to $5.45 after Moody’s downgraded its rating on the motor group.Meanwhile, reports emerged that the government was considering providing financial assistance in a possible merger between GM and Chrysler. Separate reports, however, suggested aid could be limited in a McCain administration.Technology came under pressure on reports that tech financing defaults rose sharply this year, down 2.5 per cent overall. IBM and Oracle fell 3 per cent to $79.66 and 2.7 per cent to $15.77, respectively.The market’s decline came as interest rate futures priced in total certainty that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, edged up 0.6 per cent, indicating continued signs of extreme distress.Elsewhere, Lowe’s fell 2 per cent to $16.85 after the diversified conglomerate’s third-quarter earnings slid into the red, hit by losses at its CNA insurance division, in which Lowe’s said it would inject $1.25bn.The market had clung on to positive territory for much of the day and rose as much as 1.9 per cent after figures showed an unexpected rise in sales of new single-family homes, which were lifted as prices hit a four-year low. Housebuilders were buoyed by the news but later retreated along with the wider market, down 3.3 per cent overall. Morgan Stanley said the housing market was helped briefly in September by the Treasury’s move to provide mortgage finance assistance.Elsewhere in property, CB Richard Ellis – hard hit in recent sessions – rose 4.7 per cent to $4.64 after William Blair upgraded its recommendation on the real estate services group to “outperform”.Among more institutions that accepted government cash under its banking recapitalisation programme, Fifth Third Bancorp and Regions Financia jumped 5 per cent to $8.47 and 11.3 per cent to $9.95, respectively, and were among the biggest winners in the S&P. The regional banking index was 1.6 per cent higher.Earlier in the session, sentiment was helped as further details emerged of the vast series of measures to help the banking sector. The Federal Reserve began buying the debt under its plan to shore up the commercial paper market.“We are starting to see the initial signs of a thaw [in credit markets], but it is going to take some time,” said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at The Hartford.Elsewhere in financials, Goldman Sachs lost 7.5 per cent to $92.88 after the Financial Times reported that its chief executive last month sought tie-up talks with Citigroup. Citi fell 3.4 per cent to $11.73.Telecoms was the only sector to find positive territory, up 1.6 per cent overall. It was helped by well received third-quarter results from Verizon Communications, which soared 10.1 per cent to $27.61.Analysts were divided as to how much attention investors were paying to company results amid unprecedented market volatility.Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to clients: “Emotions remain the primary driver of recent stock market performance, in our opinion. As a result, we believe fundamentals are being cast aside by investors.”
148;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-10-17T20:44:04Z;Wall Street ends in red in volatile session;;A wild week for Wall Street stocks that saw their biggest gain since the Depression and worst sell-off since 1987 drew to a close with another highly volatile session that ended in the red.Relatively upbeat earnings and a further easing of strain in money markets failed in the end to outweigh a fresh batch of gloomy economic data and renewed concerns over the health of some financial institutions.The market swung between gains of as much as 4 per cent and losses that hit 2.9 per cent as last month’s options and futures expired.Big name financials including Metlife and State Street endured heavy losses towards Friday’s close and finished down 9.2 per cent at $31.14 and 9.6 per cent at $40.76 respectively.Housebuilders, home furnishers and real estate services were among the key losers on Friday from grim construction and building permit data. DR Horton, CB Richard Ellis and Leggett & Platt were among the biggest drags on the market, down 8.3 per cent at $6.77, 4.8 per cent at $6.32 and 12.3 per cent at $16.29, respectively.The S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent at 940.56 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,711.29 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.4 per cent at 8,852.22 points.Yet the benchmark S&P still finished the week up 4.6 per cent – its biggest gain since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 – with the Nasdaq up 3.7 per cent and the Dow 4.7 per cent higher.In each session, an overwhelming number of trades took place in the final few minutes of trading, which traders put down in part to a wave of fund redemptions.Defensive names were among the favourites as investors dipped their toes back into the market after stocks’ worst weekly sell-off since the Depression. Wal-Mart gained 5.5 per cent over the week to $53.77. Healthcare topped the sectoral leaderboard, up 8.8 per cent. St Jude Medical, which gained 13.9 per cent to $37.03, helped sentiment with well received results.Financials climbed 5.8 per cent over the week, lifted by the fresh $250bn plan to shore up US banks. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – among the biggest institutions in which the government is set to buy equity stakes – advanced 11.4 per cent to $23.24, 28.7 per cent to $114.30 and 5.5 per cent to $14.88 respectively.Amid plenty of third-quarter earnings, PepsiCo was one of the relatively small number of companies to undershoot analyst forecasts. The shares fell 6.8 per cent over the week to $53.88.Figures from Coca-Cola, up 6.5 per cent to $44.20 over the week, were better received. So too were those from Intel and Peabody Energy, which gained 2 per cent to $15.50 and 11.8 per cent to $32.03 over the week.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history. However, it finished the week down 1.2 per cent at 69.45.Technology stocks were down after three companies in the sector reported better than expected results after the bell on Thursday.Google rose 5.5 per cent to $372.54 after the internet search group’s profits surpassed Wall Street forecasts. Eric Schmidt, chief executive, warned of “uncharted territory” due to the financial crisis. Advanced Micro Devices and IBM added 2.2 per cent to $4.21 and lost 0.8 per cent at $90.78 after both surprised Wall Street with third-quarter earnings ahead of expectations.Aerospace and defence stocks fell after Honeywell trimmed its guidance for the rest of the year. The diversified manufacturer, off 5 per cent to $29.37, did so even after it became the latest company to overshoot quarterly earnings forecasts.Caterpillar fell 7.2 per cent to $39.32 after Credit Suisse cut its price target from $66 to $46 while Potash eased 0.4 per cent to $74.43 after Citigroup cut its price target.

There’s still a list of things weighing on the economy.”Grim job figures on Friday added to a glut of downbeat economic data from manufacturing to mortgage applications released in the week.“All the evidence suggests a massive retrenchment in US consumer spending in September,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley.Regulators extended a temporary ban on short selling of financial stocks that had been due to expire after Thursday’s session.Throughout the week, the index compiled by Bloomberg of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list hovered around the level of when the ban started last month and fell 1.4 per cent on Friday.Bucking the negative trend, JPMorgan reached its highest level in more than a year during the week, although it reversed course and fell 7.9 per cent on Friday to $45.90.Bank of America reached its highest level since May during the week but fell
5.2 per cent to $34.48.General Electric’s need to raise $15bn capital highlighted the risks the credit crunch posed for corporate America. GE fell 14.6 per cent over the week and threatened to reach an 11-year low.Other industrials suffered sharp falls. Railways – heavily owned by hedge funds, whose redemptions observers said pushed several stocks sharply lower – erased much of their gains for the week. CSX and Union Pacific lost 15.4 per cent and 15.6 per cent over the period.Big name technology companies, also heavily owned by hedge funds, sustained losses. Yahoo sank 15.4 per cent over the week after recovering 2.7 per cent to $16 on Friday."

In addition, German open-ended property funds have about £16bn in spending power.Sovereign wealth funds can spend up £32bn, according to the report, while about £28bn has been raised by recovery funds aiming to exploit the repricing taking place in the European market.However, the report concludes that while there is a significant allocation to property from investors, many are waiting to see how far values have to
fall. The German open-ended funds have so far been among the few to actually begin buying property, acquiring several buildings in the past few months in the City of London.European investment activity in the second quarter fell to €27bn (£21.4bn), a 32 per cent drop on the first quarter. The first half of 2008 saw €66.5bn spent in total, a 46 per cent drop on the €123.8bn invested in the first half of 2007."
151;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Derivatives look to next stage of evolution;;Traders in property derivatives were the only section of the real estate investment community to raise a smile last week after it became clear that the seismic events in the banking sector would have a lasting and almost certainly negative impact on the commercial property market.Brokers reported that activity picked up significantly as traders hurried to make sure that deals that had been made with Lehman were re-established, and to capitalise on a further drop in prices as market sentiment took another knock.The derivatives sector has been in good health throughout this year, in spite of the freeze in the physical market, as investors have looked to hedge existing exposure and capitalise on predictions of future prices.Trading volumes on the property derivatives market almost doubled in the second quarter, rising from £970m to £1.62bn in the UK, where the market is still the most mature.The main banks in the sector are now looking to take the derivatives market to the next stage of its evolution, with plans for the formal establishment of trading prices for institutional investors. A formalised closing price is hoped to bring greater transparency and encourage more trading from direct property investors in the market.GFI, a leading derivatives broker, is to provide the closing price on a monthly basis from September, supported by its partner CB Richard Ellis and data provider IPD. Prices are provided on an ad hoc basis at the moment, which can often depend on which broker is asked, and it is seen as important that banks have the chance to mark their books to an official market price at least once a month.The plan is to introduce a standardised weekly closing. Similarly, it is hoped one day to introduce a single price for the subsectors such as offices, retail and industrial.The latest results from Iceberg, the hedge fund operated by Reech and CB Richard Ellis, bear out the benefits of investing in the area. The fund, which also invests in other areas of the indirect property market, has returned about 8 per cent in the year to August, an impressive performance compared with sinking values in the direct property market.Other hedge fund groups are also now exploring the sector with a view to launching similar vehicles – and new funds are promised by Reech/CBRE – but derivative traders are much more excited about the prospect of new users from the institutional investment market.There have been indications of interest from direct property investment groups such as Legal & General. Pension funds are now talking to the banks about setting up dedicated derivatives desks, sitting alongside their direct property colleagues.Michael Levi, head of property derivatives at GFI/CBRE, said that a lot more “end users” were coming to the market in order to hedge their direct property exposure but more importantly they also saw the chance to make comparatively low risk returns. Volatility in Reech/CBRE’s hedge fund, for example, is very low.A reliable barometerOne of the more interesting debates about the derivatives market remains how accurate a barometer of the future direct property market it is. Opinion differs, but so far it has been reliable as an indicator.At the beginning of the year, derivative prices were showing total returns for 2008 as low as -12 per cent, a level that was regarded as unlikely by many of the more bullish investors. Last week’s events saw prices fall further, with brokers reporting that there was a shift of some 100 basis points on most contracts.Total returns for 2008 are now sinking below -15 per cent on current trading prices, while there is a prediction of -5 per cent in 2009, and then 6 per cent in 2010, equivalent to almost flat capital growth. The market only really recovers in 2011, when total returns are forecast at about 9 per cent.Prices were hit by the demise of Lehman and the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB. The combination of a more tightening on lending terms, and the dumping of billions of pounds of equity stakes and debt in the market, will further hit the investment market.More important to the development companies exposed to the London office market will be the 1m sq ft of Lehman office space coming to the market, as well as uncertainty among the other banks. Many have suggested that the derivatives markets are negative. Now, pricing is starting to look realistic, if not optimistic.dan.thomas@ft.com
152;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-08-11T00:05:02Z;Managing exposure to bricks and mortar;;After the subprime collapse in the US and the subsequent fiasco in which, it turned out, a lot of people who should have known better had bought financial instruments they did not understand, one might think property derivatives would be treated with suspicion as an asset class.In fact, the total volume of property derivatives traded globally (outside the US) rose to £1.9bn (€2.3bn, $3.7bn) in the second quarter of 2008, an increase of 42 per cent from a year earlier.“They’ve been a very useful tool in terms of hedging risk,” says Michael Levi, head of CB Richard Ellis’s property derivatives joint venture with broker GFI.Property derivatives have existed for just four years, so the pioneers of the concept are still working hard to educate potential users. The UK is the main focus of activity, perhaps unsurprisingly given it was where the idea was first mooted. It is also where Investment Property Databank, whose indices underlie almost all the derivatives, is based and has the best quality data.Their proponents see derivatives as an obvious add-on to the property market for professional investors. “Derivatives start off as risk management tools,” says Graham Barnes, a senior director in the CB Richard Ellis real estate finance team who also manages a small fund investing in property. “Real estate has particular problems with risk transfer because buildings are very non-homogeneous and the individual buildings are very illiquid.”In normal market conditions, it takes between three and six months to sell a commercial building. “In this kind of market, what’s the liquidity period?” asks Mr Barnes rhetorically. “Do you want to name a number? It could be measured in years.”Instead of just watching a property portfolio lose value for all this time, a canny investor can enter into a total return swap on the IPD All Property Index, the form of derivative that makes up 95 per cent of transactions. The investor can hedge away the risk of the UK market without the cumbersome work of selling the building.“It’s for people who want to manage their exposure tactically as opposed to those who want to get out of property strategically,” says Mr Barnes.The obvious users of property derivatives would be the developers, who may not wish to be exposed to market prices during the long building process, and the physical owners of real estate, the property managers.Then investors start to enter the picture. They can gain exposure to the commercial property market in a number of ways. Listed vehicles are popular but, however diversified they are from most equities, they are still affected by the general movement of equity markets, with discounts to net asset value tending to widen when equity markets slide. If you are investing in property largely because its returns are uncorrelated with your equity allocation, this can undermine the point of the exercise.Open-ended structures have pitfalls that reveal themselves in times of market volatility as they can become as illiquid as their underlying assets. Allocating to a general property fund can be expensive and, like a direct property portfolio, has the problem of investing only in a particular, tiny subset of the market, so adding specific risk rather than the diversification the investor is seeking.“The idea that one might get smaller allocations of risk through broader diversification is well-trodden in all other asset classes,” says Mr Barnes. He suggests that property derivatives are a very well diversified proxy for the physical market.Iain Reid, chief executive of property investment company Protego, and also credited by many with the original development of property derivatives, believes property investors will become increasingly interested in derivatives.“One reason I’m particularly confident about this is that, unlike derivatives in more liquid asset classes, there can be a significant difference between the price of the index and the derivative.” Since it can be very expensive to move in or out of the physical market, “it makes the derivatives a much more powerful tool in responding to changes in valuations”.Mr Reid was instrumental in developing property index certificates, the forerunners to property derivatives, in the mid-1990s. These instruments, which are still used, are, in effect, bonds, functioning like a fully funded version of the total return swap now available.“I knew that, if you wanted to sell it to the property industry, you’d do much better if it didn’t look like a derivative,” he says of his decision to override opposition from product developers within BZW Property Asset Managers where he worked at the time. In 2004, sufficient interest had developed that he and a number of other interested parties, including Paul MacNamara, head of research at Prupim, lobbied the Financial Services Authority to allow true property derivatives. Mr Reid thinks they are now largely being used for inter-asset class allocation although other market participants say that property investors are also using them. A number of property-focused hedge funds use them as well as non-specialist hedge funds.The one thing that is clear is that the UK is the most-developed market. France and Germany are slowly following this course while other markets such as Spain, Canada and Switzerland have seen isolated trades.The development of a market in property derivatives is dependent not only on demand but also on the existence of a reliable and transparent index. It is the latter that has held up development in the US market, where a number of index providers are attempting to win custom.“What an emerging market needs is clarity,” says Nick Nabarro of IPD, the monopoly provider in the rest of the world.
153;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-07-23T20:09:09Z;New US tax regime to aid property derivatives;;The nascent US property derivatives market is expected to attract much more interest from US and foreign investors following a recent ruling by the US Internal Revenue Service that reduces taxes paid on such investments.The IRS decision “opens up the industry dramatically”, said Philip Barker, senior vice-president at GFI Group in New York. GFI, a derivatives brokerage firm, which has teamed up with CB Richard Ellis in the US and the UK to help develop the property derivatives market in both countries.Mr Barker said trading in property derivatives in the US lagged far behind than in the UK. “It’s occurring here, but it’s slow. In the UK, it has advanced at a much faster pace,” he said. Estimates are that only about $2.5bn in both commercial and residential property derivatives have traded in the US over the past two-plus years, compared to £7.2bn ($14.2bn) worth of such trades in the UK last year alone.Last month’s IRS ruling removes an uncertainty that had surrounded property derivatives: they are now not considered “real property” for tax purposes. That means the more stringent tax laws that apply to foreign investors in US property – most notably a 10 per cent withholding tax on the proceeds of a deal – do not apply to investors in derivatives.Property derivatives – typically involving over-the-counter trading in swaps, options or futures based on the returns of a property index – allow an investor to gain or limit exposure to real estate.Development companies, pensions or other institutional investors with property holdings, and hedge funds are derivatives’ prime users. Experts in the US said the property derivatives market remained under-developed.“We generally favour having such tools available to add flexibility and liquidity to our investor real estate programmes,” said Rob Kochis, principal at property investment consultancy Townsend Group. “But that market is in its infancy in the US and not yet developed to the point where it has been useful.” Mr Barker from GFI believes the IRS ruling will change that. He expects a sharp uptick in property derivatives investing from the UK and other countries. That will add a needed jolt of liquidity to the market, prompting more US investors to join in. “We’ve arranged a number of deals for pension funds and portfolio managers,” Mr Barker said. “But there are scores of people sitting in the sidelines, waiting for the market to develop in terms of liquidity.” Also slowing the development has been the lack of a dominant index for the derivatives to be based on. However, there are now generally agreed-upon indexes for both the commercial and residential sectors – the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries Property Index and the Residential Property Index, respectively – and this has served to accelerate trading. And the recent sharp price drops in both of those sectors could push some investors toward derivatives as a hedge against further declines.Scott Brown, principal and head of global property at investment consulting firm Ennis Knupp and Associates, also thinks that development is coming. “The real estate derivatives market in the US is young, and I fully expect it will develop and become more robust as investors become more comfortable with the capabilities and contracts,” he said. The “more favourable tax treatment” for foreign investors, he added, “should serve to accelerate the growth”.The UK market began to grow when a few large pension funds announced they had hedged their property portfolios with derivatives, Mr Barker said.“In the US, we’ve had nothing of the sort. Most of what we’ve seen has been under the table, with no real transparency.” The tipping point, he thinks, will be when the US market sees “a few high-profile trades” that encourage other investors to take the plunge as well.The US market for property derivatives could one day be a $1,000bn industry, though it’s tough to say how long that may take, Mr Barker noted. “It’s difficult to make any forecasts. But we and CB Richard Ellis believe this asset class needs and is ready for derivatives to help expand the opportunities that are out there.”
154;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-05-18T18:02:53Z;Iceberg returns 29% net in debut year;;One of the first specialist hedge funds in the commercial property sector will on Monday tell investors that it has significantly outperformed the broader market recession in its debut year.The Iceberg Alternative Real Estate Fund recorded a 29.12 per cent return net of fees in the 12 months to May in spite of the sharp fall in property values across the market since summer last year.The fund delivered a performance of 0.87 per cent for the month of April, net of fees, and 4.09 per cent year to date.All property returns fell almost 12 per cent in the year to April, according to benchmark index IPD at the end of last week. Real estate shares have fallen even more heavily over the past year, with the real estate investment trust sector down by 6 per cent since January alone.The fund, which is part of a joint venture between property fund manager CB Richard Ellis and US hedge fund manager Reech AiM, uses complicated derivatives to take positions on property markets in Europe as well as trading equity stakes both long and short in listed companies and investing in unlisted funds.“Who said you can’t make money in real estate at the moment?” said Martin Samworth, managing director for CB Richard Ellis in the UK, adding that there were plans for further funds to be launched in the sector in the coming year.The fund has also recently begun buying and selling discounted commercial mortgage-backed debt for the first time and now intends to allocate about 15 per cent of the fund to this sector in the future.The Iceberg fund has grown to more than £200m. CBRE reports that the level of inflows are picking up rapidly every month as investors become more secure with the concept and performance data of the property hedge fund.The Iceberg fund was established in May 2007 with the aim to return to investors 15 per cent over the rate of Libor, at which banks lend to each other, with an annual volatility of 10 per cent irrespective of the direction of the underlying real estate markets.“This fund is not about taking risks or picking directions. It is there to take the opportunities that the current market has thrown up,” said Christophe Reech, chief executive of Reech.“In June last year, there was a pretty dramatic change to the property curve that has been very favourable to Iceberg. There are now a number of strategies we can pursue.”
155;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-05-12T22:26:37Z;Pik builds property portfolio;;Pik Group, the London-listed Russian residential property developer, has unveiled a significant expansion of its property portfolio since flotation last year.In its first significant revaluation, the company said there had been a 40 per cent increase in its portfolio’s market value to $12.3bn (£6.27bn) as at January 1, up from $8.8bn at the beginning of 2007.The company also revealed that total net saleable space increased 61 per cent to 14.2m sq m, from 8.8m sq m in January 2007.On flotation, the company promised to build on its land bank significantly and has undertaken a rapid expansion into Russia’s regions to take advantage of prices outside Moscow that have stayed relatively low. Pik also intends to begin building in Ukraine.Pik’s float was one of the largest by a European property developer last year, raising $1.9bn and making paper dollar billionaires of its two founders.There are now a number of large Russian developers listed in London following a spate of public offerings to tap into the appetite among investors eager to invest into Russia’s economic growth story. The country is seen as having a chronic shortage of affordable housing, in particular.Pik is one of Russia’s largest developers, specialising in low-price, prefabricated homes, mainly in Moscow. The revaluation was carried out by CB Richard Ellis, the commercial property consultancy.Kirill Pisarev, chief executive, said: “We are very pleased to have delivered on one of our key IPO promises, namely to invest in building a strong land bank for the future.“Focusing mainly on expansion into Russia’s regions, we have invested in a high-quality development pipeline that we believe will deliver attractive returns for shareholders,” Mr Pisarev added.The group’s annual results are due to be released on May 19.Pik has 449 properties under development. During the past four years, the company has completed more than 4m sq m of housing, equivalent to more than 59,000 units, in Russia.
156;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-04-25T16:52:47Z;City job cuts drive rents lower;;There has been a sharp fall in rents demanded in the City of London as landlords prepare for the prospect of rising vacancy levels caused by job losses in the financial district.Rents have slipped more than 10 per cent since their peak last year and are set to fall by a further 10 per cent before the end of this year, according to one of the most downbeat forecasts yet on office occupation from global property consultancy CB Richard Ellis.CBRE predicts that rents could then stagnate for a further three years, until a recovery towards the end of 2010.The consultancy based its estimates on a projection of 25,000 jobs lost in the City, which will lead to empty office space and pressure on rents. There was a further wave of job cuts at banks in the City this week, including at Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse.Stephen Hubbard, deputy chairman of CBRE, said rents on prime office space in the City had now fallen to about £57 a square foot, including incentives, down from £65 a square foot at the peak last year.Mr Hubbard forecast a drop to £52 a square foot by the year end, although most worrying was the prediction of a flat market until 2011.Rental growth is crucial to the property industry because it underpins the value of the buildings in the investment market.The forecast marks a considerable shift from the benign outlook given by CBRE in its last update in September.“These numbers are totally driven by job losses,” said Mr Hubbard, “which no one saw in September.”In the West End market, where sky-high prices have been paid by hedge funds, CBRE says rents will fall by a more modest 5 per cent this year and the same again next year.Mr Hubbard said the West End benefited from a shortage of quality offices, unlike the City where some 8m sq ft of new office space was poised to hit the market.Property analysts are also predicting falling rents in the London market, although some take hope that there is still a relatively low vacancy rate and far less speculative development compared with the last economic downturn.Morgan Stanley analyst Martin Allen said he was forecasting a peak-to-trough fall of 23 per cent in City rents and a 17 per cent fall in West End office rents.This week, ratings agency Moody’s also downgraded its outlook on the City office market, warning that demand had fallen and supply was increasing.
157;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-04-18T02:52:22Z;Spending on commercial property drops;;The amount of money being spent on commercial property in Europe dropped by more than a third in the first quarter of 2008 as continental markets caught up with the problems affecting the UK.European investment turnover totalled €37bn (£30bn, $59bn) in the first quarter of this year, according to research out on Friday from CB Richard Ellis, compared with €58bn in the final quarter of last year.Lower levels of activity were reported across most of continental Europe, according to the agent, although the UK was one of the least affected, partly because this was where the slowdown had emerged earliest.The commercial property investment market is reliant on the debt markets to fund acquisitions, and the shortage of easy borrowing has had a huge impact on activity levels. This has been most obvious in the UK market, where prices have fallen sharply as a result, but Europe has been more resilient to date.“The European investment market has started to see a correction in pricing in the first few months of the year,” said Michael Haddock, research director at CB Richard Ellis, “with the prime segment of the market having seen an outward yield shift of somewhere between 25 and 50 basis points”.In the UK, turnover remained at a similar level to the fourth quarter, at approximately €10bn. The UK has seen a sharper correction in pricing than other markets, says CB Richard Ellis, and lower prices have already started to attract the interest of equity investors.The continent’s two largest markets – Germany and France – saw lower volumes than in the previous quarter or in the equivalent period of last year.Yields in France are still among Europe’s lowest, which has meant that buyers are waiting to see if values will follow the UK. Activity in some markets remained healthy, however, including Finland and Italy.
158;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-04-10T07:37:17Z;International retailers target India;;India is the favoured prospect for international retailers looking to move into emerging markets to offset worsening economic conditions in developed countries, according to a new survey.CB Richard Ellis, the property agents, and GfK, the market research company, surveyed 300 international retailers about the markets they intended to enter in 2008 or had entered for the first time last year.In spite of restrictive rules on foreign retailers, India emerged as the preferred destination for 27 per cent of respondents compared with 24 per cent selecting Ukraine and 22 per cent picking Russia, according to the report due to be published on today.However, delegates to the World Retail Congress expressed frustration about rules on foreign direct investment that oblige most retailers to operate with an Indian franchise partner.“We are happy to be one of the biggest franchisers all over the world,” said Jose-Luis Duran, chief executive of Carrefour, the French supermarket group. “But in India [we would have to place in the franchisee’s] hands 100 per cent of our brand name, know-how and credibility. I’m going to wait as much as possible until I find the right partner.”Mr Duran’s sentiment was eclipsed by stronger resistance to the Indian model expressed by Anders Dahlvig, chief executive of Ikea. “We can only have 51 per cent ownership at the moment…We don’t think that is sufficient.”Mr Dahlvig said he was working to persuade the government to loosen the restrictions but until the law changed he would not open Ikea stores in the country.Peter Gold, head of cross border retail in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at CBRE, said: “We believe India will maintain its position as a popular new location for retail expansion as further trade restrictions are lifted. And, in the same way that Ukraine is now benefiting from retailer interest in Russia, retailers will again be looking to expand to adjacent markets around other emerging destinations.”Although entering India is a focus for retailers, China was a more talked about country at the conference in Barcelona with store groups excited about the growth prospects and pleased with the government’s looser restrictions on investment.
159;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-03-24T22:43:42Z;Forecasts for City construction cut by half;;Forecasts of office development in the City of London have almost halved during the past 12 months in the expectation that developers will review plans amid a worsening occupier market and stagnant financing conditions.CB Richard Ellis and Jones Lang LaSalle, the two largest property agents operating in the City market, have downgraded their forecasts for City development significantly to take account of the shift in confidence among developers in London. So far, no developers have said that they will stop their building programmes but agents say that certain schemes are likely to be delayed, with initial ground work already taking longer than expected.CB Richard Ellis now expects about 6.3m sq ft to be built in the City between 2009 and 2011, a significant reduction from the 13.5m sq ft that it expected to be built during the period this time last year.Jones Lang LaSalle, meanwhile, predicts that the maximum potential pipeline for 2008-11 fell by 17 per cent last year.The agent’s development expectation for 2011 has more than halved in the past 12 months because it be-lieves that those not already on site are far less likely to start.Neil Prime, head of Jones Lang LaSalle’s City office, said: “The combination of impossible-to-get speculative funding, rising construction costs and uncertainty in the occupier market has meant that there are few willing to put a shovel in the ground right now.”Kevin McCauley, director of CBRE, said: “Ironically, we were seeing construction starts pick up at this time last year.” Mr McCauley said that the debt crisis had had a profound effect on development through its impact on financing, end-value expectations and occupier demand.Land Securities said in its most recent interim statement that it would look to reduce the risk from development of the so-called “walkie-talkie” building at 20 Fenchurch, which could include waiting for a letting or seeking third-party money, depending on market conditions. British Land has been more bullish, declaring its intent to carry on with its big speculative tower at Leadenhall street.Other developers such as Minerva, Gerald Ronson’s Heron and Hines, are committed to their City schemes, while two of the largest towers – the Shard at London Bridge and the Pinnacle at Bishopsgate – have also been given public backing by their developers.Agents are reporting that landlords are already accepting less than their stated rents on certain buildings in the City, the first sign that the occupier market may be weakening.One agent, who asked not be named, said that certain new buildings on Cheapside were likely to accept lower rents than publicly stated. “The past two months have seen landlords alter their expectations,” he said, pointing to predictions of as many as 10,000 job losses in the Square Mile.This comes after a period of rental growth in the financial district, with rents for prime buildings now on average about £62.50 per sq ft.There had been hopes that rents in the City market might reach more than £70 per sq ft this year before the credit crisis hit last year.
160;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Risk of rise in distressed property sales;;The chief executive of CB Richard Ellis, the world’s biggest real estate adviser, says there is a possibility that distressed sales of commercial property could rise if the turmoil in the credit markets persists through the end of this year.However, Brett White, chief executive of CBRE, said conditions in the commercial propery market currently are fairly stable, noting that the default rate is less than 1 per cent and rents are “good” after many years of increases.“There really isn’t a lot of stress in the ownership market right now,” he said. “The mortgaging or the financing that most of these owners put on their buildings is pretty good.”He said the potential problem involved owners who took out relatively short-term mortgages with the hope of refinancing. They could face problems if turmoil in the credit market fails to ease by the third or fourth quarter of this year, he said.“The issue is that loans come due. A lot of people have shorter-term loans and its going to be hard to replace them,” Mr White said. “The longer it goes on, the worse it gets.”CBRE said it expected that credit markets, including the securitisation of commercial mortgages, would improve in the third or fourth quarter of this year, based on previous credit market turbulence, but that conditions were extremely unpredictable.“We really have no clue when its going to come back,” Mr White said. “Of the last three [credit crises] the largest lasted six months. It’s been nearly six months already.”Sales of commercial property have slowed dramatically since August, as the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) has dried up. CMBS made up 25-30 per cent of all commercial real estate lending in the US at the height of the market last year, according to Dan Fasulo of Real Capital Analytics.But December issuance of CMBS was down nearly 75 per cent from its peak in March, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert. Volumes of US office properties sold dropped 42 per cent in the final quarter of 2007, according to data from Real Capital Analytics.Mr White said big markets, such as midtown Manhattan, have yet to suffer falling prices, but that in secondary and tertiary markets, such as New Jersey or suburban commercial property, prices had dropped by as much as 15 per cent since August.CBRE expects trends in US leasing to worsen throughout early 2008, and then pick up in the second half of the year. “People are really scaling back on their leasing now,” Mr White said in a call with analysts on Wednesday. “It’s just a stressed environment right now.”One possible boost for commercial property lies in the weakness of the dollar, which is attracting more foreign buyers and sovereign wealth funds.“They are very prevalent buyer and they are very aggressive…particularly sovereign funds,” he said.CBRE reported a 14 per cent drop in sales in the fourth quarter in its Americas business, with worse performance in the US in particular. Vacancy rates are expected to rise in office and industrial properties, the company said. However, it still expects rents to grow this year, albeit at a slower pace than the 10 per cent rise last year.
161;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-01-23T17:56:58Z;Great Portland Estates joins slide in asset value;;Great Portland Estates has become the latest commercial property company to be hit by the downturn in the market, suffering a 6.5 per cent fall in net asset value during the last quarter.The central London office developer said property values dropped 4.1 per cent in the three months to December, wiping almost £73m off its £1.7bn portfolio.But the company reassured that the fall represented a significant outperformance compared with the average property return during the last quarter.Toby Courtauld, chief executive of GPE, said a focus on good quality properties, with asset management potential located in prime London locations had contributed to the strength of its performance.“Our properties are normally bang in the middle of town, where the dynamics are still strong. Occupier demand remains fine, rents are rising and there is still a shortage of supply of good office stock,” Mr Courtauld said.However, he predicted further pressure on property prices as a result of continued investment market turbulence. He said a further drop of 25 basis points by March would not be surprising.Mr Courtauld said that GPE was not actively looking for corporate activity in the current market climate. The company had been close to completing a merger with rival London Merchant Securities before talks broke down at the end of 2006.Anything clearly accretive to the company’s balance sheet would be considered, he added, both for corporate takeovers and direct property acquisitions. The shares fell 1½p to 496p.GPE has 81 per cent of its portfolio in London’s West End. The company has moved out of most of its holdings in the City, an area Mr Courtauld predicted would continue to bear the brunt of losses.Rental values grew by 2.6 per cent across its portfolio, while the void rate – the level of empty space in its buildings – dropped from 4.6 per cent in September to 3.6 per cent by the end of the year.Miranda Cockburn, property analyst at Cazenove, said the fall in the net asset value was “no surprise, given the dramatic downturn in the direct property market”.She provisionally cut her forecast for net asset value at the March year end to 600p and for March 2009 from 608p to 583p.CB Richard Ellis, the agent, on Wednesday reported that the average prime yield on property – the combined value of the rent and price – showed the largest quarter-on-quarter shift out since 1990 as a slide in prices had been exacerbated by slowing rental growth. Central London markets were among the worst hit.
162;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-01-21T17:13:37Z;PIK joins GIC to develop Russian urban township;;PIK Group, the London-listed Russian property developer, has secured the backing of the Singaporean government to develop a $1.3bn (£667m) town near Moscow.GIC Real Estate, the property investment arm of the Government of Singapore, has acquired a 25 per cent stake in the project for $233m (£119m).This is the first time that GIC has invested in the Russian market and marks a departure from its traditionally cautious investment strategy in European real estate.“This investment provides GIC Real Estate with a strong entry into the Russian real estate market,” said Seek Ngee Huat, GIC president.“We believe in the potential of the market.” The deal shows that even cash-rich sovereign wealth funds are looking further east to secure higher returns.Russia is still seen by most property investors as one of the more “pioneer” countries, where high returns can be found but at a higher risk than in more developed western European markets.Having a local partner is seen as the key to avoiding local regulatory and planning hurdles.In the UK, GIC has recently been taking stakes in listed property companies rather than direct real estate, raising its shareholdings in British Land, the property developer, to more than 3 per cent two weeks ago.The PIK/GIC partnership will develop a large urban township in the city of Mytischi, located to the north-east of Moscow.The development will span about 114 hectares and comprise about 1.14m sq ft of space across 50 high-rise apartment buildings, 13 low-rise commercial buildings, five elementary schools, seven kindergartens and two medical clinics.The project is expected to be completed in 2013. It has a pre-tax market value of $1.33bn, according to the most recent valuation by CB Richard Ellis.PIK is one of Russia’s largest developers and listed in London last summer.
163;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
164;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-01-12T02:26:29Z;Sharpest commercial decline;;Commercial property values saw the sharpest falls on record last month as the market continued to struggle to regain its footing after a bruising few months of losses.About 4.3 per cent was wiped off the value of property across the UK in December, according to agent CB Richard Ellis, the worst monthly performance since its records began in 2000.“This level of repricing is more aggressive than ever before recorded,” said CBRE’s Michael Keogh, who pointed to new fears of a slowdown in occupier demand exacerbating the effects of the credit crunch on the market.The sharpness of recent price falls is seen by some as a sign that the downturn will be short-lived, however. The last property recession in the early 1990s was particularly painful as it was spread across three years.Mr Keogh said the severity of price cuts should see the market recover before the end of this year. There are a number of investors waiting to return to the market when prices fall to a more sustainable level.Prevailing negative sentiment is also affecting the development market. According to a commercial development activity index compiled by Savills, December saw the sharpest rate of decline since the survey began in March 2003, with a drop in activity of 15.4 per cent. About a quarter of commercial construction firms reported a fall in activity.The market is still active, however. Morley Fund Management and Quinlan Private on Friday revealed details of a joint venture to fund the development of an office building at Paddington Central in London’s West End. The development value of the project is £275m.The transactional market has also started the new year more briskly with a number of sales lined up.
165;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2008-01-05T01:09:53Z;Shopping centres’ prospects polarise;;More retail space combined with a more nervous consumer is an uneasy cocktail for all landlords and shopkeepers but the losers are likely to be down-at-heel high streets and bulky goods parks.Malcolm Dalgleish, head of European retail at CB Richard Ellis, the estate agents, said new developments such as the Westfield centre at White City in London or centres in Bristol and Liverpool would perform strongly and attract shoppers’ cash from more dowdy neighbours.“It’s not the new space that’s the problem, it’s what happens with the old space,” he said. “White City will have less of an effect on the West End than it will in Hammersmith or Brent Cross …It is what retailers want because they get the right size, space and the right environment and tenant mix.”Mr Dalgleish is predicting a starker polarisation between “two markets”: “The market where the retailers really want to be – the right size and the right location – and then there’s the other areas …in the secondary towns or the secondary units.”“Just like in retail itself there will be winners and losers in retail property,” said Land Securities, the property owner that is landlord to many retailers and remains more confident about the prospect for secondary locations.“There are some shopping centres that aren’t premium sites that are trading very well because it’s the best in that area. It might not be a Meadowhall or a Bluewater but it’s just right for the area it’s in.”Whatever the prospect for individual shopping centres in 2008, relations between retailers and landlords are likely to become more fraught in tougher conditions.Almost all retailers have leasehold rather than freehold property and some will be blaming rent – and the inability to exit onerous leases – if there is a spate of shops entering administration.
166;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2007-12-13T01:55:48Z;Property suffers terrible month;;Capital values in UK commercial property fell by 4.1 per cent in November amid what experts believe is the most rapid correction ever seen in the sector.The total return from the sector – which includes rental income – was minus 3.7 per cent in the month, according to figures from CB Richard Ellis, the world’s biggest property advisory group.The data have emerged ahead of Friday’s figures from the Investment Property Databank, the most reliable source of information for the market.Philip Ljubic, a property derivatives banker at ABN Amro, said the CBRE figures tended to foreshadow the IPD: “Generally this is a very good guide of what the IPD numbers will be.”A total return of minus 3.7 per cent would easily be the worst monthly return for either residential or commercial property in the past two decades. Until now, the lowest monthly total return for commercial property since the IPD started in December 1986 was a negative 1.76 per cent in May 1989.The biggest hit to capital values in the UK housing market was a drop of 1.3 per cent in October 1992.There is much debate about the appropriate pace at which valuers should adjust property portfolios during a correction.Many experts believe that there is not enough transactional evidence at the moment because the credit squeeze has put paid to many debt-funded deals.DTZ, another firm of agents, has published a total monthly return of minus 1.6 per cent for November, which is not on the same scale as CBRE’s estimate.Mr Ljubic said this was the first time there had been such a major discrepancy between agents’ figures, which are closely watched by property derivatives traders ahead of the IPD data – on which these financial products are usually based.CBRE are valuers to New Star, the fund manager, which this week stunned the market with an 8.2 per cent cut to the value of its £1.7bn property unit trust. The vehicle is down by 17.8 per cent since July.Central London offices were the biggest fallers in November – because of fears about bank lay-offs – with capital values down by 6.4 per cent according to CBRE.
167;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2007-10-25T05:27:27Z;Property: One-way trip for retail therapy;;There have been many milestones on Liverpool’s journey back to economic health but May 29 2008 will represent a more important stop than most.This is the closely-guarded – and until now unreleased – date when Grosvenor aims to open the 70 shops and two department stores that mark the first phase of its 43-acre, £950m ($1.946bn) Liverpool One redevelopment of the Paradise Street area.More than 30 individually designed buildings, a five-acre park, new hotels and restaurants will, Grosvenor hopes, make for a shopping trip with a difference.The 1.6m sq ft scheme, anchored by John Lewis and Debenhams, is currently 75 per cent let by floor area, according to Neil Barber, head of retail leasing at Grosvenor.“The shops are nearing completion and we are on to the steep curve of getting deals done,” says Mr Barber. “We expect to be almost completely let, with maybe half a dozen units left that we could have to hold for retailers that we really want but who won’t make up their mind until they see it open.”Liverpool certainly needed Grosvenor, having lost retail spending to Manchester, the Trafford Centre and Chester for many years.Grosvenor’s efforts have spurred other retail investment in the city. Milligan, the emerging retail developer, rescued the former Post Office between Whitechapel and Victoria Street from dereliction and converted it into a fashion arcade. This was sold in August to Anglo Irish Bank Private Banking and Alanis Capital for a reputed £85m. The city’s first Primark opened in September. Land Securities is planning a £100m makeover of the St John’s Centre and Clayton Square. A joint venture between Merepark and Ballymore will start on site with a big retail-led scheme at Central Station in December.The rebirth of Liverpool’s retail fortunes is matched only by the increased supply of offices in the past decade.Once seen as an economic basket case, Liverpool’s business community has started to puff out its chest and walk with a swagger not seen for 100 years.Office rents are leaping at the rate of 30 per cent a year although they still have some way to go to match those of other UK secondary cities. Where regional counterparts are nudging £30 per sq ft, Liverpool broke through £20 only in the past 18 months.The current ceiling of £22 was achieved by Rumford Investments at the eye-catching 20 Chapel Street, a RIBA award winner, close to the famous Pier Head waterfront and one of several large office developments around the commercial quarter.Chris Lloyd, associate director at DTZ, a letting agent on 20 Chapel Street, says the real barometer is the overall level of stock, not the rental value. “Liverpool is only catching up with other regional cities and will reach parity in 2014 when it will have around 10m sq ft of offices,” he says. “Only then can it say it has a proper office market ready to compete on the same level as everyone else.”A handy 1m sq ft of new offices is planned by English Cities Fund at Pall Mall, following its popular St Paul’s Square on Old Hall Street. Major refurbishments at Exchange Flags, The Plaza and The Capital are all helping to expand the market.Take-up is keeping pace and could produce another record this year with around 500,000 sq ft predicted, compared with a five-year average of around 400,000 sq ft. Encouragingly, the private sector increasingly dominates demand, accounting for 79 per cent of all space acquired in 2006, according to figures published jointly by the Merseyside Property Forum and Liverpool Vision. Traditionally, the public sector would have accounted for around one third of take-up.Investment in offices has followed suit, with Liverpool attracting institutional investors for the first time in a generation. Beetham’s 101 Old Hall Street was acquired last year for £39m by Henderson Warburg, reflecting a net initial yield of 5 per cent. This was soon topped by London & Capital’s purchase of City Square, Tithebarn Street for £49m, at a yield of 4.7 per cent.Recently-mooted deals at India Buildings and No 1 Moorfields have wavered in this summer’s credit squeeze but at least the city is back in the grip of global financial cycles.“The large amount of new-build stock and the rapid rental growth mean Liverpool is likely to see further deals even if the investment market slows elsewhere,” says Simon Wood, director of investment at CB Richard Ellis.The key element the office market is lacking is sizable inward investment. There have been notable successes in Liverpool in recent times but relatively small deals: JP Morgan, Coutts, Maersk Line and Panmure Gordon, among others, have taken fresh space.One saviour in this respect may be Peel Holdings, the transport and property company, which controls vast swathes of the Port of Liverpool, Manchester Ship Canal and Liverpool John Lennon Airport.Peel’s directors accompanied the city’s political leaders on a trip to Shanghai this year (the cities are twinned because of Liverpool’s Chinese trading roots) and came back with plans to build a 60-storey Shanghai Tower on Liverpool’s Princes Dock aimed at Chinese companies.Peel, controlled by John Whittaker, plans 40m sq ft of new business and residential space on hundreds of acres of surplus dockland in north Liverpool and Birkenhead, Wirral, over the next 40 years. The £10bn Liverpool and Wirral Waters plans could take five more years to win planning approval from the government.Peel is already reaping the benefits of development away from the city centre to the south. It has seen land values in the booming Speke Garston area multiply from £30,000 to £300,000 per acre in five years. Other parts of Merseyside have copied Speke’s publicly primed model, with Bootle, Bromborough, Widnes and Knowsley all boasting new, active business parks.Liverpool and its hinterland is established as a growth city region with momentum firmly in its favour.The reduction of European grant handouts and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets should do little to slow its progress.
168;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2007-10-08T05:36:08Z;PIK: High-rise suits the aspirational Muscovite;;Living conditions are adequate but far from glamorous in a skyscraper built by developer PIK on the northern fringes of Moscow.Standing on the balcony of a two-bedroom flat on the upper storeys, you can look out across the city suburbs for miles.But your path of vision is occupied mostly by other towers, one after another, in similar pastel shades of mustard and red, stretching on in the middle distance.This is Novokurkino, an 81-hectare complex of worker apartments where one day, it is hoped, 40,000 people will live.So far, one phase out of three has been finished but already it feels like an enormous cluster of high-rise buildings. When the whole project is finished in 2010 about 40 towers will provide more than 11m sq ft of space.To the western eye there may seem something a little bleak about the site, not least because the landscaping and facilities are not finished. For Muscovites, however, this type of project is a big step up from many of the apartment blocks in the city, many of which were built decades ago during the communist era and have not stood the test of time well.PIK, which floated in Moscow on June 1 with a dual listing in London – through the issuance of GDR (global depositary receipts) is one of the biggest companies taking advantage of the need for new residential space in Moscow and many other Russian cities.In fact, at a market capitalisation of $14.5bn, it is the largest listed developer in Russia and the largest listed non-Reit property group in the world.The flotation made billionaires of founders Kirill Pisarev and Yury Zhukov, who each still own 42 per cent of the group. Other shareholders include Temasek/GIC, the Singaporean state groups, with 5 per cent.The group suggests that its IPO was popular with Asian investors because they may be more familiar with high-rise residential living than Europeans.In an interview in an ornate suite within the Ritz-Carlton, Moscow’s newest and possibly most fashionable hotel, Mr Pisarev describes the rapid growth of the company since it was set up in 1994.Back then, the pair were acting as financiers for development companies, but by the end of the decade they were building residential apartments.The leap in scale came in 2001 when the pair bought SK1, a factory making prefabricated housing. The deal was cheap, at $20m, coming in the wake of Russia’s financial liquidity crisis. It was followed by the $300m purchase of SK3, a similar plant, in 2005.This gave PIK the ability to create more than 1m sq m (10m sq ft) of prefab housing a year, allowing it to build vast residential estates. The prefab model has various advantages over traditional “poured concrete” construction: it is cheaper and can be carried out even in the cold depths of the Russian winter.PIK takes the Financial Times on a visit to SK1, a massive factory with four large workshops built 47 years ago. There you can see concrete panels, which will soon be forming the outer walls of skyscrapers, being created and placed in a huge furnace to dry for up to 24 hours.By manufacturing the components in the factories, PIK needs only six people on-site to put them together with cranes.Meanwhile the company has been building up a portfolio of sites to develop in the future. Its landbank now stands at 8.8m sq m with a market value of $8.8bn, according to a January valuation by CBRE. Some analysts believe the landbank may now be worth $11bn after acquisitions and rising land prices.Sales have grown from $783m annually in 2005 to $1.55bn in 2006 and are predicted to be $2.7bn this year. Earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) were $70m in 2005, $486m in 2006 and are expected to be $990m this year.Increasingly, the group will not only develop buildings but will also maintain them, which should create a different source of earnings.Mr Pisarev believes that the business will be buoyed by wider factors in Russia – the rapid depreciation of much of the existing housing stock, families’ demand for more space and rising prices. After a big sell-off of government homes there is now a waiting period for social housing in Moscow of 20 years. PIK’s sites are typically 95 per cent pre-sold before completion.“Traditionally people lived in really restricted conditions, with too many people per square metre,” says Will Andrich, an independent director of PIK. “Now they have higher aspirations.”PIK’s share price is still above the $25 at which the group floated in June (towards the lower end of its target range). Mr Pisarev points out that this is in contrast to the decline in shares in many European and US real estate groups.“It was always seen that emerging markets were the riskiest and the developed markets were the most safe,” he says.“But because of such debt and leverage in those countries their risk profile has really changed. In emerging markets such as Russia there is very little debt.”
169;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2007-10-03T07:26:02Z;Property: Foreigners are clamouring for a place in the sun;;Whether it be a pied-à-terre or a Paris office block, foreigners are buying France hand-over-fist.Last year, foreign investors poured €12bn ($17bn) into the Paris office market, accounting for 63 per cent of turnover, by value.Meanwhile, British, German and Dutch families have been buying up French holiday homes at a remarkable rate. No one knows quite how many homes in France are owned by foreigners – statistics are not collected.But it is commonly estimated that 500,000 Britons alone own houses there.Supposing the average price were €100,000, that would amount to a €50bn inflow into the French property market, spread over 20 or 30 years.Many of these buyers settle permanently. Britons are now estimated to make up 1 per cent of the population in the Dordogne, for example. While 300,000 French citizens are estimated to live permanently in Britain, a similar number of Britons are believed to be resident in France, according to embassies in their respective capitals.Though some settlers in France are retired, others launch businesses. David Sayers, a tax partner at Mazars, a leading French accountancy firm, says his clients include Britons running a hotel in Champagne, and a sportsman setting up a training centre for athletes.Inward investment of this kind often turns conventional decision making on its head. Commercial and industrial investors seek market proximity or skills, and use climate as a final deciding factor in location decisions.Lifestyle investors, by contrast, tend to acquire a property in a region where they want to live, then figure out how to make it pay. It is an entrepreneurial attitude that sometimes works out – and sometimes does not.But the professional property investors who continue to pour large sums into the Paris market, and increasingly into provincial centres, do so for sound commercial reasons, says Olivier Gérard, head of investment at Cushman & Wakefield France.Thanks to increasing transparency, market liquidity, and the adoption of professional tools by property professionals, investment in commercial, retail and distribution property has become far easier, and more certain. Property advisers, lawyers and banks have globalised, or formed networks, and the same firms can be used in markets globally.“Before 1997, we had a market that was old-fashioned, where the investors were mainly individual institutions – banks, acquiring buildings, with a finger in the wind,” says Mr Gérard. “Now, all the main global markets use Anglo-Saxon methods. Investors can measure the fundamentals of the market.”So individual investors, in France as elsewhere, have been supplemented by sophisticated property funds and professionals.The Paris office market, benefiting from stability afforded by distribution of planning consents according to forecast demand, and a vast park of let properties, has become a top-three global investment destination, behind London, but possibly ahead of New York. With an estimated 50m sq metres of space, it is almost as big as the Tokyo market, but more liquid. Inflows of foreign investment have been gathering pace since the end of the 1990s.In 2006, says Mr Gérard, total investment in the Paris office market was €19bn. Of that, less than half came from French investors. During the first half of 2007 the investment turnover in France was €15bn of which 37 per cent came from French institutions. North American companies and funds made up 28 per cent of the total, British investors 12 per cent and German investors were back, snapping up 11 per cent.Spanish and Irish investors have become active over the past three years, each accounting for 3 per cent of the market in 2006. This year, attention in Paris property circles has focused upon the arrival of Australian investors, lead by two investment banks, Macquarie and Babcock & Brown, and Westfield Group, a leader in shopping malls.Despite instability in credit markets, the Paris office market remains attractive. Prime rents have topped €800 per sq m, though the average is closer to half that. The vacancy rate is 5 per cent.According to another firm of agents, Jones Lang Lasalle, yields during the first quarter this year were falling gently. In central Paris, they varied from 3.75 per cent to 4.25 per cent. In La Defense, a massive office complex west of the centre, the range was 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent, while on the slightly riskier periphery, they were typically 4.75 per cent to 5.25 per cent.The pattern of rising yields, the further you are from Paris, may explain increasing activity by foreign property investors in the French regions.A study in April this year by another firm of property agents, CB Richard Ellis, found that though total investment in regional business property during 2006 was only €3.2bn, yields were often attractive, averaging 6 per cent for prime properties, but occasionally exceeding 10 per cent. Recent office transactions offered yields of 8 to 8.75 per cent in Marseille, 6.9 to 7.3 per cent in Toulouse, and 8 to 9.5 per cent in Lille. Yields on regional distribution properties were typically higher. A regional break-down shows foreign investors are often remarkably active.In Lille, 55 per cent of commercial property sales and 15 per cent of purchases were by Britons. In Lyon, Germans accounted for 11 per cent of purchases. In Nice, and its neighbouring high-tech town of Sofia Antipolis, German buyers accounted for 36 per cent of volume, whilst they also bought 26 per cent of the floor space traded in Toulouse, in the south-west.Maybe the shrewdest move, for northern Europeans seeking a change in lifestyle and a place in the sun, would be to buy a provincial French office building and live in the caretaker’s flat.
170;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2007-09-20T03:59:00Z;Professional services: Healthy mix of global, national and local firms;;Contrary to expectations, the inexorable decline in Scotland’s base of quoted companies has not slowed demand for professional services in Scotland. Indeed, the country continues to punch well above its weight in most professions, including law, accountancy, actuarial consulting and chartered surveying.In each of these areas the main cities – Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen – can offer a healthy mixture of global, national and local firms. Almost across the board, the professional firms have been thriving over the past three years, with the reduced number of listed companies being more than offset by the boom in financial services, property and mergers and acquisitions.Roddy Bruce, a partner in law firm Dickson Minto, concedes that having the headquarters of large banks such as HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh has been a definite boost to the sector as a whole. “That is the foundation upon which a lot else is built,” he says.In law, having a separate legal system has historically also been an advantage, not least because it helped prevent incursions by English firms.Today Scotland is home to at least 10 sizeable commercial legal firms, including Dundas & Wilson, McGrigors, Maclay Murray & Spens (MMS), Shepherd & Wedderburn, Dickson Minto, Brodies, HBJ Gatley Wareing, Burness and MacRoberts. Most of the larger ones have, over the past two decades, been seeking to transform themselves into truly UK-wide law firms through the opening of London offices.Magnus Swanson, chief executive of MMS, which opened its London base in 1988, says: “In order to be a leader in the quoted and financial services markets out of Scotland, we realised that we had to be in London.”Dickson Minto was even quicker into the English market, establishing a London office in March 1986, just a year after Alistair Dickson and Bruce Minto founded the firm. Mr Bruce jokes: “Alistair moved down there in 1985 and he never came back.”The firm’s early decision to focus on advising private-equity houses and banks on leveraged buyouts also paid off handsomely. Today it is one of the leading players in its market sector at a European level and is frequently asked to advise on complex transactions in multiple jurisdictions. It is also among the top five firms in the UK when ranked by profit per equity partner.However Philip Rodney, chairman of Burness, says that other firms which are focused on building up their London arms have been neglecting their Scottish operations. “I get the impression some of their Scottish clients are beginning to feel unloved, which has presented some clear opportunities to firms such as Burness,” he says.Another recent trend has been for English law firms to venture north of the border. CMS Cameron McKenna and Bond Pearce both have offices in Aberdeen to service the extremely active oil and gas sector, while DLA Piper and Pinsent Masons have been building more broadly-based practices across the Central Belt. One advantage for clients is access to their international networks.In accountancy the “Big Four” firms are, if anything, even more dominant in Scotland than in other parts of the world, particularly in the key areas such as auditing, tax and corporate finance.Craig Anderson, head of KPMG in Scotland, believes that one reason national and local firms have struggled to grow as fast as they would like is because of their lack of international networks. “There are very few businesses that do not have some international angle to them. Most would prefer to deal with a firm that can offer an international network where the quality is consistent across the world.”He adds: “We think one reason our business has grown by about 60 per cent in the past three years is that unlike the other members of the Big Four in Scotland, KPMG has always retained a strong relationship with mid-sized Scottish businesses.” KPMG claims it is the Scottish leader in tax, restructuring and forensic accounting.Even so, Deloitte – which was boosted by its 1999 acquisition of local success story Rutherford Manson Dowds – is “ahead of the game for corporate finance in Scotland”, according to Mr Bruce at Dickson Minto. The firm expanded its Scottish practice by an impressive 22 per cent last year, achieving growth across all its service lines.PwC is growing at a slightly more modest pace, but still remains the largest accountancy firm in Scotland. Frank Blin, Scottish managing partner, says: “One of our key focuses in Scotland has been in risk assurance services, particularly treasury and internal audit, where we are seeing burgeoning demand, mainly from the financial services sector.”Hywel Ball, Ernst & Young’s recently appointed Scottish managing partner, says he is committed to usurping PwC’s number one slot in the Scottish market through a focus on growth in assurance, transaction advice and tax.The strength of the Big Four has meant some of the so-called “national” firms – including Grant Thornton and BDO Stoy Hayward – have struggled to build a Scottish presence of scale. The nationals have also been squeezed by the success of a number of indigenous firms such as Aberdeen-headquartered Johnston Carmichael.Focused mainly on serving owner-managed businesses, this is Scotland’s largest independent accountancy firm, with 10 offices across Scotland and a turnover of £20.2m. Already the UK’s 24th largest accountancy firm, and ahead of all the nationals in Scotland, it recently unveiled plans to target London-based clients in its core sectors of food, construction, hospitality, energy, agriculture and fishing.Sandy Manson, Johnston Carmichael’s chief executive, says: “We’re seeking to explode the myth that accountants are just there to deal with the numbers. Instead what we’re offering is pro-active business advice.”Other home-grown accountancy firms of scale include Scott-Moncrieff (which is Edinburgh-based), Henderson Loggie (based in Dundee), Campbell Dallas (based in Glasgow but with other offices in Scotland) French Duncan (Glasgow) and Anderson Anderson & Brown (Aberdeen).In management consultancy there is a distinct lack of locally grown success stories, and a shortage of global players such as McKinsey and LEK, which have not felt the need to establish a presence in Scotland. Scotland is better served by IT consultancies. Accenture, Capgemini, LogicaCMG, Sopra and Xansa are all increasingly making their presence felt in the core cities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen, and are keen to secure outsourcing projects from the Scottish Executive, which is committed to making efficiency savings.Having mostly hived off their management consultancy arms in 2001-03, the Big Four accountancy firms are also slowly re-entering the management consultancy space, this time with a focus on financial management and performance improvement.Scotland is also well served by actuarial and pensions consultants, with Glasgow-based Hymans Robertson being the dominant local player. Global or UK providers with a presence in Edinburgh and Glasgow include Aon Consulting, Hewitt Associates, Jardine Lloyd Thompson, Mercer, Punter Southall and Watson Wyatt. All these firms benefit from the region’s preponderance of qualified actuaries.There is also plenty of choice of providers in chartered surveying and property consulting. International players such as Jones Lang LaSalle, CB Richard Ellis, DTZ, Montagu Evans and Cushman & Wakefield have a strong presences in Scotland’s major cities, where they are given a run for their money by local players Ryden and DM Hall in some market sectors.
171;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2007-07-17T07:27:31Z;Hammerson links with Singapore fund;;Hammerson, the UK-based property company, has set up a joint venture with GIC Real Estate, an arm of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, to which it is selling a 50 per cent stake in Southampton’s West Quay Shopping Centre for £299m.The companies will each hold their respective 50 per cent interests in the 76,200 sq m site in a joint venture partnership.Hammerson, which would be retained as asset manager, will use the proceeds of the sale to finance its ongoing development programme, the company said on Tuesday.John Richards, chief executive, said: “This sale demonstrates the continuing demand for prime retail assets and is in line with our strategy of recycling capital.”The deal also illustrates GIC Real Estate’s ambitions to increase its holdings of UK retail property.West Quay, which has John Lewis and Marks and Spencer as anchor tenants, was valued at £588m on December 31 and produces annual net rental income of about £25m.It was developed in a joint venture between Hammerson and Barclays, whose 50 per cent stake was bought by Hammerson in December 2004.Hammerson was advised by CBRE and GIC Real Estate was advised by Strutt & Parker.
172;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2007-07-13T21:50:24Z;Henderson to launch $1bn Asian fund;;Henderson Global Investors is poised to launch a $1bn (£500m) fund focused on Asian real estate.The fund manager's move is the latest sign of institutions warming to global property. Henderson Asia Pacific Indirect Property Fund (Pagoda) will invest in listed and unlisted property vehicles in the Asia-Pacific region. Its exposure will cover established economies such as Australia, Japan and South Korea and emerging markets such as Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.Chris Reilly, head of Henderson Property in Asia, said there would be a strong focus on India and China, the region’s two dominant economies. The fund will be targeted mainly at pension funds and other institutions in the UK and Europe, although Asian investors will also be approached.The shares of global listed property securities, which rose 341 per cent in the four years from March 2003, fell during June after interest rate rises in most leading economies. Real estate markets are sensitive to borrowing costs as investors are often highly geared.The Asia-Pacific region was not immune from the trend, with Japanese real estate investment trusts and other property securities losing value last month. But Mr Reilly said there remained strong opportunities in the region: for example several Hong Kong Reits with dividend yields of 8 per cent.Occupier markets in Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo were also on an upward swing with low vacancy rates and rising rents, he said.The launch comes amid anecdotal evidence that many UK institutions are moving part of their real estate allocations from the domestic market towards other countries offering a positive gap between debt costs and yields.Increasingly, they are gaining overseas exposure via indirect vehicles such as funds of property securities.CBRE Investors, the fund management wing of global agents CB Richard Ellis, is poised to announce that it has raised €542m (£367m) from 22 British pension funds for a mainland Europe property vehicle called The Alpha Fund. “As the UK property market prospects continue to flatten, there is a clear and growing trend for institutional investors to invest more of their property portfolios internationally,” said Jeremy Plummer, managing director of CBRE Investors Global Multi Manager. UK property unit trusts had “queues” of investors six months ago but no longer, he said. “In most cases capital is being reallocated to Europe, all of the big UK multimanager houses...have started to recommend, with the support of consultants, new allocations towards overseas property.”Signs of a change in sentiment towards UK property funds have emerged in the past week as several big vehicles have changed their pricing policies to cope with slight net outflows. Standard Life, New Star and Prudential are among fund managers to have switched from “offer” to “bid” pricing on certain property funds.
173;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2007-05-02T20:33:32Z;Wall St rises amid earnings, M&A;;Wall Street rose on Wednesday with earnings reports, better-than-expected factory orders and buy-out activity extending the market’s spring bullish streak.Leading the charge were big companies with international operations, seen by investors as being in a sweet spot as a growing global economy compensates for a slower pace in the US through the conduit of a weaker dollar.One example was MasterCard, whose first-quarter profit soared 70 per cent compared with the same period last year to a record $214.9m. The world’s No.2 credit card provider attributed 2.5 per cent of its rise in revenue to the stronger euro versus the dollar. MasterCard jumped 10 per cent to $127.35, eclipsing its previous 52-week high of $118.07.“Enthusiasm for stocks continues and multinationals are riding the global economy,” said Peter Cardillo, strategist at Avalon Partners. He said stocks were overextended but he was not looking for a hefty correction at this juncture.The bullish mood pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average further into record territory and 25 of the blue chip barometer’s 30 stocks closed higher on Wednesday.The Dow rose 0.6 per cent to 13,211.88, its seventeenth record close this year and set an intraday record high of 13,256.33. The Dow’s gain of 6 per cent since the start of January has outpaced broader US benchmarks.A boost for the Dow was Verizon, up 3.4 at $39.81. The telecom set a new 52-week high of $39.72 as investors cheered evidence of its growing market share at the expense of rivals.The S&P 500 index rose 0.65 per cent to close at 1,495.93 with stocks in the telecommunications, materials and consumer discretionary sectors setting the pace. The Nasdaq Composite rallied 1 per cent to finish at 2,557.84.Investor sentiment faces a test when the April employment report is released on Friday.Analysts say a weak re-port could fan fears that the slowing housing market is weighing on the economy, while evidence of steady labour gains would probably underpin the recent ad-vance in stocks.A stronger-than-forecast factory orders report for March also buoyed stocks, which had already opened higher amid deal activity.The Dolan family made a $22bn bid for the shares in Cablevision that they do not already own, in their latest effort to take the cable operator private. The company said its board had approved the Dolans’ offer of $36.26 a share and the stock rose 8.6 per cent to $35.48.Shares in USG jumped 5.8 per cent to $48.66 as speculation of a buy-out for the maker of building materials mounted.In other deals, Citigroup said it would buy Bisys Group for $1.47bn. The financial services outsourcer rose 2.1 per cent to $11.71.Beckman Coulter raised its offer for Biosite by $5 a share to $90 and stocks in the healthcare company rose 1.6 per cent to $93.75.Investors were also waiting for the next stage of the battle for Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, to unfold.Late on Tuesday, the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones via a dual share structure, rejected a $5bn unsolicited bid from News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch.After soaring 54.7 per cent to $56.20 on Tuesday, shares in Dow Jones fell 0.4 per cent to $56 on Wednesday. Shares in the company rose to their highest level in four years after News Corp launched its hostile $60 a share bid.Shares in News Corp rebounded 2 per cent to $23.46 after falling 4.2 per cent on Tuesday.Although many other newspaper and media shares rose sharply on Tuesday and continued to rise on Wednesday, CreditSights cautioned that prospects for the sector were not linked to the News Corp move.Jake Newman, an analyst at CreditSights, said: “If the value of Dow Jones is based on potential synergies with other News Corp properties, the high valuation cannot be applied to general-interest newspaper properties.”In other earnings news, Time Warner said first-quarter earnings had fallen 18 per cent from the same period last year but the result exceeded analysts’ forecasts.The company raised full-year earnings guidance. Its shares gained 3 per cent at $21.20.Sprint Nextel swung to a first-quarter loss, as the third-largest wireless network in the US said operational investments cancelled out gains from sales.Its shares rose 2.9 per cent to $20.59.Shares in CB Richard Ellis jumped 14.1 per cent to $38.39, after the real estate broker’s earnings beat estimates.Ahead of quarterly results on Thursday, Nortel said it expects to sales of $2.48bn, above the consensus call of $2.37bn. Shares in the telecom equipment maker rose 8.9 per cent to $25.12.Yum! Brands reported a 14 percent increase in first-quarter earnings as its international fast-food chains KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut performed well. Shares rose 6.1 per cent, to $66.96.
174;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2006-11-09T21:37:56Z;GFI moves into US property derivatives;;GFI Group, the inter-dealer brokerage, is to start trading US commercial property derivatives in a bid to exploit interest in the huge US market.The company has opened trading on the products in London and more recently Hong Kong and expects strong interest from dealers, hedge funds and other investors in trading derivatives based on the US commercial property market, estimated to be worth about $5,300bn, or 35 per cent of the global market.“Real estate is the largest asset class and the opportunities in derivatives look very promising,” said Phil Barker, vice-president of real estate derivatives at GFI. He hopes trading will start early next year. GFI is developing the new business in conjunction with property manager CB Richard Ellis.GFI is moving into a market that is in its very early stages, particularly in the US. The company pioneered broking on credit derivatives a decade ago and in the past few years this market has been the fastest expanding area of risk management.“There are half a dozen banks looking at the US market and this is being driven by the interest of institutional investors such as insurers and pension funds,” said Mr Barker.He added that growing volumes in the UK commercial property derivatives market over the past year, where some 14 banks now actively trade, was fuelling interest in developing the US market. GFI and CBRE launched a joint venture in the UK market in 2005.The collaboration between the two companies in the US will be known as CBRE Melody/GFI. This year, GFI teamed up with real estate consultant Colliers International to provide derivatives coverage in Hong Kong.As banks explore the idea of trading derivative contracts, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plans listing US commercial real estate futures and options contracts in the first quarter of 2007. “Pension funds, insurers and other institutional investors are looking at diversifying their portfolios by taking exposure to commercial real estate,” said Sayee Srinivasan, associate director for product development at the CME.Mr Barker of GFI said the advent of futures contracts would raise the profile of property derivatives in the broader derivatives market.Derivative contracts for real estate mainly involve exchanging the capital and income returns on property for floating interest payments. Capital appreciation swaps, which protect principal or provide profit as real estate prices fall or rise, are also utilised. Options and futures are also available.Listed futures and options contracts that reference residential property prices in 10 major US cities have been trading on the CME since May 2006.
175;CBRE;CBRE Group Inc;2005-07-14T21:50:09Z;CBRE to service loans in Europe;;CB Richard Ellis (CBRE), the world’s biggest property advisory group, is to set up a new loan servicing business in Europe aimed at portfolio lenders and the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market.Loan servicing involves the collection of loan payments and the administration of “escrow account activities” such as dealing with taxes and insurance, on behalf of lenders.The UK, Spain, France and Italy are the first target markets for the new group, named CB Richard Ellis Loan Servicing.The European market for CMBS, while much smaller than in the US, has grown in leaps and bounds. It is estimated that issuance has increased at a compound annual rate of 44 per cent since 1999, with at least £20bn to be issued this year.Property-backed bonds have proved popular in recent months, with financial buyers seeking relatively high-yield bonds rather than shares.As a result, yields fell earlier this year to record lows compared with the cost of gilts.In the US, most CMBS servicing is done by the commercial mortgage bankers, who also originated the debt.However, there is a growing opportunity for third-party groups in servicing pooled CMBS loans, as well as some portfolio loans.The US market is dominated by GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corporation, which services $133.8bn of loans.CBRE operates via GEMSA Loan Services, a joint venture between its subsidiary LJ Melody & Co and GE, the financial giant.The group is the fifth largest participant in the country, servicing $58.9bn of debt.Originally set up mainly to service GE loans, the venture’s clients now include 90 portfolio lenders and 150 securitised pools.CBRE hopes to use GEMSA’s servicing platform – which includes new loan set-up, borrower billing, collection and payment posting, cash management and investor reporting – to roll out the business in Europe.The new group is already in talks with several financial services institutions as possible clients.The European market already plays host to a range of third party loan servicing groups such as GMAC, Hatfield Philips and Crown Mortgage Management.CBRE says its competitive advantage is that it has expertise in property, unlike some of its rivals in this market. “CBRE has over 2,000 property professionals across Europe, supported by world class research and the most comprehensive market intelligence,” said Philip Cropper, who will oversee the initiative in Europe.Other rivals were unlikely to launch themselves into the market because of the high cost of entry, said Martin Samworth, UK managing director.In the US there are more than 100 groups in the market but the top five have about 80 per cent of market share.
