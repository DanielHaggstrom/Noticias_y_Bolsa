0;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-17T19:00:42Z;Altria chief departs after Juul investment debacle;Howard Willard, recovering from coronavirus, steps down after 28 years with tobacco group;Altria, the tobacco company behind the Marlboro brand, said chief executive Howard Willard is leaving after less than two years at the helm, a tenure marred by a troublesome investment in e-cigarette maker Juul Labs.The 56-year-old, who was recovering from Covid-19, moved aside on Tuesday, Altria said in a statement on Friday.Billy Gifford, who most recently served as chief financial officer and vice-chairman and has a long background at the company, has been tapped to succeed him.Under Mr Willard, Altria aggressively pursued new opportunities including investments in Juul Labs and Canadian cannabis company Cronos. But it has struggled to make a successful shift away from traditional combustible tobacco. Altria paid $12.8bn paid for a 35 per cent stake in Juul at the end of 2018 but has been forced to write down the value of the investment by more than two-thirds. Juul faced a political backlash and regulatory scrutiny over the marketing and health effects of its e-cigarettes and is now mired in litigation.This month, the Federal Trade Commission sued to unwind Altria’s investment on the grounds that it had bought the stake to unlawfully eliminate competition.Altria withheld Mr Willard’s 2019 bonus, citing the impact the Juul investment has had on shareholder value. He said this year that he was “highly disappointed” by Juul’s performance, but that there had been “a number of unexpected outcomes” since Altria agreed to take the stake.Erik Bloomquist, an investment and strategy consultant, said large investors had lost confidence in Mr Willard. The company had overpaid for assets at inflated prices and been blindsided by the crackdown on e-cigarettes by US health officials, he said.“If I were one of [Altria’s] long-term institutional investors I would have been livid,” Mr Bloomquist said.Mr Willard, who had spent 28 years at the Virginia-based company, disclosed his coronavirus diagnosis to staff and the board last month. Mr Gifford, 49, took over the chief executive’s duties while he took a temporary medical leave of absence to deal with the illness.As well as announcing Mr Willard’s departure, Altria also said on Friday it was separating the role of chairman and chief executive, a move it said was in the best interests of its shareholders. Independent director Thomas Farrell, whose background is mainly in the energy sector, becomes chairman.Mr Willard will receive about $8.8m in cash in lieu of the outstanding stock awards granted to him in 2018 and 2019, but will not receive cash payments for the 2020 stock awards he has forfeited, Altria said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The company also said Mr Willard would receive a prorated payment of $537,900 under its 2020 incentive plan, and salary and pension benefits for a period of roughly a year.Altria shares, which are down 19 per cent year-to-date, rose more than 2 per cent.
1;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;America’s bankers: Uncle Sam picks his advisers;Boutique Wall Street banks to oversee government aid for airline and aerospace industries;"FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.In a world crippled by an epic healthcare crisis and without any real mergers and acquisitions, the most coveted mandates for Wall Street advisory firms are the ones being handed out by Uncle Sam. PJT Partners, Moelis & Co and Perella Weinberg, three leading boutique investment banks, were selected on Thursday by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin to help the federal government administer the $50bn rescue package for the airline and aerospace industry.It’s a huge win for the three New York firms as they faced competition from several other boutique advisers which specialise in restructuring and turnrounds. For instance: Roger Altman, the founder of boutique adviser Evercore, had been rumoured as a potential lead administrator of Boeing’s bailout programme. PJT, which was launched in 2015 by former Morgan Stanley rainmaker Paul J Taubman after being spun out of Blackstone, was selected for the coveted role of managing the rescue of US passenger airlines, which includes American, Delta and United. These US airlines have been badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic, with fear and travel restrictions knocking demand for air travel. Airlines for America, a lobby group, said US carriers were burning through $10bn in cash each month.Moelis & Co, whose founder Ken Moelis has in the past represented companies of US president Donald Trump that were facing bankruptcy, will focus on troubled cargo carriers and contractors. (Oh, former house Republican leader Eric Cantor is the vice-chairman of Moelis. Some cynics might think that helped the advisory firm win the mandate . . .)Perella Weinberg, which was founded in 2006 by the godfather of dealmaking Joe Perella and former Goldman Sachs royalty Peter Weinberg, probably has the toughest of all jobs: helping national security companies and saving Boeing.The defence contractor and commercial aircraft maker had already been facing large cash outflows before the outbreak because of the worldwide grounding of its workhorse jet, the 737 Max, following two fatal crashes.You can rest assured that with more than $2tn of taxpayer money earmarked to support all sectors of the US economy impacted by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, there will be plenty more jobs for Wall Street folks left with no more M&A deals to work on. Watch this space.When Altria bought a 35 per cent stake in the e-cigarette start-up Juul Labs in late 2018, it appeared the Marlboro maker was preparing to leap into a post-cigarette future. The $12.8bn deal valued Juul at $38bn, including the new cash infusion, making it one of the most valuable start-ups alongside the likes of WeWork and Uber. Altria also promised Juul top-tier shelf placements and advertisements in its cigarette packets, potentially undermining its own products.“We’ve got the biggest manufacturer of cigarettes in America to hasten their own decline,” Dan Thomson, managing director of Juul UK, told the Financial Times in April last year. “No one has ever done that.”Now Altria’s investment is looking more and more like an expensive roundabout trip.This week the Federal Trade Commission sued Altria to unwind the investment, saying the transaction had squashed competition in the e-cigarette market.The announcement came in the wake of federal scrutiny around Juul and its marketing practices, which had caused an uproar over the rise in teenage vaping.It is unclear how exactly the FTC would unwind the deal, but Altria would likely have to find a commission-approved buyer for the shares — Juul or otherwise.Close watchers will note that Altria had already begun distancing itself from Juul earlier this year, announcing a $4.1bn writedown on the investment while ending sales and distribution agreements. Altria also said it would, in some cases, be able to resume the development of its own e-cigarette products.It’s anybody’s guess at this point what price Juul’s shares would command in a sale. Chief executive KC Crosthwaite pegged the company’s internal valuation at $20bn as of the fourth quarter, while Altria implied a roughly $12bn valuation with the latest writedown. The latest news is unlikely to help.At this point, it feels like decades ago when Altria and Philip Morris explored a blockbuster $200bn merger premised on the rise of cigarette alternatives. (It was just eight months ago.)DD knows some in our target audience remain ardent Juulers through all of this. Feel free to sound off in an email.With M&A firmly off the agenda for almost the entire world, the question of how companies spend their money is increasingly under scrutiny. That has shifted attention towards dividend payments, a capital return from companies to their investors that is now in the crosshairs of governments and regulators moving to rescue troubled industries.Already this week, the UK’s largest banks were forced by their top financial regulator to halt dividend payments, while their European counterparts were urged to do the same by the European Central Bank. In Germany, top manufacturers including Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler were branded on Thursday as displaying the “ugly face of capitalism” for planning to hand €7.5bn to investors while relying on public funds to pay more than 200,000 workers, according to the FT’s Joe Miller, Olaf Storbeck and Guy Chazan. Those accusations came from Angela Merkel’s junior coalition partner, the Social Democratic party, which criticised companies preparing to pay dividends for profits made before the coronavirus crisis hit.One group of companies that isn’t backing down on their dividend policies are US banks, such as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. In an interview with CNBC television on Thursday, Goldman’s chief executive David Solomon explained he had no intention of slashing the bank’s dividend. The scrutiny over dividends and its impact on pension funds and the investment community is the focus of this piece by the FT’s Attracta Mooney.Your chances of sipping a Luckin Coffee at a WeWork any time soon have just become slimmer as both multibillion-dollar start-ups face mounting existential threats. WeWork’s future is up in the air — once again — after SoftBank said it would not complete a $3bn tender offer for shares in The We Company, parent of the US flexible offices group. The Japanese tech investor pulled the plug on the offer, which was set to provide a lucrative payout to WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann (pictured above), Benchmark Capital and company employees, claiming “certain conditions to the tender offer were not satisfied”.The alleged breaches include: failure to obtain the necessary antitrust approvals; existence of new criminal and civil investigations; and actions imposed by governments to fight the spread of coronavirus, which is impacting WeWork’s operations.Benchmark Capital and Neumann aren’t happy and will most certainly litigate the matter. In the meantime, it’s unclear for how long WeWork can operate in an environment where most people are working from home. Luckin, which listed its shares in the US last year and at some point hit an equity value of more than $12bn, it was commencing an internal investigation into allegations that an executive had been “fabricating certain transactions” — which is never great news.But the truth is that many short-selling analysts had long raised questions about the veracity of the eye-popping growth at Luckin, which was touted as China’s rival to Starbucks, as it was hard to work out how a coffee delivery company could ever make money.Two darlings of global investors are now seriously in trouble. Our Lex column says there is a lesson to be learnt here.Entrepreneurial over-reach is always with us. So is the tendency of bankers, lawyers, accountants and public relations professionals — and even some business journalists — to go with the flow, permitting or hyping-up bad business propositions. The difference is that these guardians of capitalism rarely suffer personal consequences when it all goes wrong. As the next set of scandals emerge, it is time that changed.Citigroup has hired Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former head of Nato and Danish prime minister, as a special adviser in Europe with a focus on the Nordic region. Gambling group William Hill has hired Matt Ashley as its replacement for outgoing chief financial officer Ruth Prior, who is joining Element Materials Technology. Ashley joins from National Express. Stephen Parry will join as chief operating officer from rival Flutter later in the year.Simpson Thacher & Bartlett has hired Ravi Purohit from Blackstone as a partner in its energy and infrastructure practice in Houston.Former Delaware US Bankruptcy Court judge Kevin Gross joins the bankruptcy and restructuring practice at Richards, Layton & Finger.Eileen Murray, the outgoing co-chief executive of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, was appointed to the board of directors of real estate start-up Compass.Low-ego prodigy Rishi Sunak is a teetotal, practising Hindu who is in the second most-powerful seat in the UK government even though he is not yet 40 years old.

2;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-02T00:41:43Z;US agency sues to unwind Altria’s $12.8bn Juul investment;FTC alleges tobacco group and e-cigarette maker went from ‘competitors to collaborators’;The Federal Trade Commission sued to unwind Altria’s $12.8bn investment into Juul on Wednesday, alleging the tobacco giant bought the stake to unlawfully eliminate competition in the sale of e-cigarettes.The claims are the latest blow to a troubled deal first struck in 2018 when Altria acquired a 35 per cent stake in Juul, a start-up whose vaping products dominated the US market.Since then, Altria has written off the majority of its investment as regulatory scrutiny over Juul’s marketing and the health effects of their products has mounted.The FTC alleged Altria bought the stake in Juul in an attempt to defuse the start-up’s challenge to its own line of e-cigarette products. In addition to the stake, the 2018 deal gave Altria board access and included a six-year non-compete agreement.“For several years, Altria and Juul were competitors in the market for closed-system e-cigarettes. By the end of 2018, Altria orchestrated its exit from the e-cigarette market and became Juul’s largest investor,” said Ian Conner, director of the FTC’s bureau of competition, in a statement.“Altria and Juul turned from competitors to collaborators by eliminating competition and sharing in Juul’s profits,” he added.“We believe that our investment in Juul does not harm competition and that the FTC misunderstood the facts,” said Murray Garnick, Altria’s general counsel, in a statement. “We are disappointed with the FTC’s decision, believe we have a strong defence and will vigorously defend our investment.”A Juul spokesperson declined to comment.The claims, made in a complaint in the FTC’s internal administrative court, follow a $4.5bn writedown Altria made to that investment last year and a subsequent $4.1bn charge in January, when it also scaled back its partnership with Juul.Altria, the parent of Marlboro-owner Philip Morris USA, has ceased the sales and distribution services it had provided the San Francisco-based company.The amended agreement announced in January also allowed Altria to resume developing e-cigarettes in certain circumstances, including if the value of its investment in Juul fell below $1.3bn, a more than 90 per cent drop on the initial deal.Juul, which was valued at $38bn following Altria’s initial investment, has suffered a steep drop as federal and state authorities have increased scrutiny of vaping among teenagers.KC Crosthwaite, Juul’s chief executive, told employees this year that the company’s internal valuation stood at $20bn at the end of the fourth quarter, down from $24bn in the previous quarter.The start-up’s flavoured e-cigarette products have been credited with driving widespread vaping by young people. Juul discontinued most of its flavoured line last year ahead of a federal ban on flavoured e-cigarettes earlier this year.E-cigarette makers are in the process of seeking Food and Drug Administration approval for their products to stay on the market.The FDA this week asked a federal court for a four-month extension to a May deadline for submissions by e-cigarette companies, saying the global outbreak of coronavirus had halted necessary laboratory work.The attempt by the FTC to unwind the investment comes as it increases scrutiny of completed deals involving start-ups. In February, the agency announced a study into a decade of such transactions by large technology companies.A copy of the FTC’s complaint, which was approved by all five commissioners, was not immediately available.
3;MO;Altria Group;2020-02-03T15:45:46Z;Juul investors face writedowns after Altria decision;Fidelity and Tiger Global have already cut value of stakes but may cut again;US tobacco group Altria’s decision to write down its stake in Juul has raised the spectre of further revaluations at the venture groups, mutual funds and lenders with stakes in the private e-cigarette company.The fund giant Fidelity and $36.2bn investment firm Tiger Global Management are among the investors facing potential markdowns after Altria disclosed a $4.1bn impairment charge and said it would alter the terms of its partnership with Juul. “My guess is they’re all re-marking this position, and a lot of them have also taken material capital off the table,” said Barrett Cohn, chief executive of Scenic Advisement, an investment bank serving private companies. Juul has faced mounting problems since Altria’s $12.8bn investment in December 2018 valued the company at $38bn, including the new cash. Altria’s purchase price implied it paid more than $300 per share.The Marlboro maker attributed the latest writedown to mounting litigation against Juul, which is under pressure from lawmakers and regulators following a rise in teenage vaping. The change gave Juul a new valuation of about $12bn. That estimate is lower than where several other large investors — and Juul’s own executives — have recently marked the company, adding to questions about the reliability of valuations in private markets.Juul chief executive KC Crosthwaite told employees the company’s most recent quarterly internal valuation stood at $20bn, down from $24bn at the end of the third quarter.Juul’s common shares changed hands at $90 in private secondary markets late last year, however, one person briefed on the matter said, implying the investors had valued the company nearer Altria’s new estimate.Fidelity last valued Juul’s shares at about $143 apiece at the end of November — implying a valuation of about $19bn — down from near $273 at the end of May, according to documents posted on its website.Tiger Global, one of Juul’s earliest investors, reduced their valuation of the company by half to $19bn at the end of September. It said in a letter to its investors at the time that Juul faced “increasing uncertainty on the regulatory front”.A spokesperson for Tiger Global declined to comment on Altria’s latest writedown.Lenders to Juul, including the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, could also face hits to their investments.BlackRock’s TCP Capital business development company loaned $35m to Juul in early August, its chief executive Howard Levkowitz said during a third-quarter earnings call. A separate BlackRock business development company invested another $17.5m, which was part of the same deal, one person briefed on the transaction said.Mr Levkowitz told analysts the investment had “a very low loan-to-value [ratio], cash well in excess of our debt and successful business operations in multiple locations”, but would be monitored following Juul’s recent controversies.BlackRock declined to comment on the status of the investments.As well as writing down the value of its stake, Altria said last week that it would stop providing sales and distribution services to Juul. The amended “relationship agreement” between the companies will also allow Altria to develop its own e-cigarettes in some circumstances.“As the landscape continues to change, our number one focus will remain on pursuing a course that sets us on a long-term path of successful pursuit of our mission,” Mr Crosthwaite wrote in a company email. 
4;MO;Altria Group;2020-01-30T17:16:47Z;Altria slashes value of Juul stake and loosens ties;Tobacco group takes $4.1bn writedown and ends distribution deal with e-cigarette maker;Altria has laid bare the scale of the losses on its investment in Juul, taking a $4.1bn writedown that slashed the value of the e-cigarette company to one-third the price at which the Marlboro maker bought in little more than a year ago.The New York-listed tobacco company blamed the latest impairment charge in large part on litigation against Juul, which has borne the brunt of a political and regulatory backlash following a surge in teenage vaping.Howard Willard, Altria chief executive, said on Thursday that he was “highly disappointed” by Juul’s performance, but that there had been “a number of unexpected outcomes” since Altria agreed in December 2018 to pay $12.8bn for its 35 per cent stake.In a sign Altria is scaling back its involvement in Juul, the company also disclosed on Thursday changes to the terms of its investment.Altria is to stop providing sales and distribution services to San Francisco-based Juul. Mr Willard said that having personnel from both companies involved in the same projects had “created confusion”. Instead it will focus on helping Juul deal with regulation.The amended “relationship agreement” will also allow Altria to develop its own e-cigarettes in some circumstances, including if the value of its investment in Juul drops to below $1.28bn — a tenth of what it paid.Juul employees had shared a $2bn bonus pool as a result of the deal with Altria, and the price paid raised eyebrows at the time. Some analysts described the valuation as unusually high.KC Crosthwaite, the former Altria executive who was appointed chief executive of Juul last year, said in a statement on Thursday: “As we continue to reset the vapour category, we are committed to advancing the long-term potential for harm reduction for adult smokers while combating underage use. We are focused on building a company for the long-term.”Altria reduced the valuation of its investment by $4.5bn in October, and the non-cash charge disclosed on Thursday has brought the value of its investment down to $4.2bn. Shares in Altria dropped 5.4 per cent in morning trading in New York.Mr Willard said that the appearance of a serious lung injury linked to vaping was the “hardest to have forecast” in advance, adding that the health problems had been caused primarily by black market products rather than Juul’s own.“I do think that they are well positioned . . . to have more success in the future,” he said.US medical experts have already connected hundreds of cases of lung damage to vaping, although they have not blamed Juul specifically. Health officials have said the problems are related to products containing Vitamin E acetate, used in cannabis vaping devices, but have also said they cannot rule out the contribution of other chemicals.The Trump administration this month revealed long-awaited curbs on the sale of some flavoured e-cigarettes, although critics complained the restrictions did not go far enough. Flavoured vaping variants have been blamed for encouraging underage use and getting a new generation addicted to nicotine.Altria said the number of legal cases pending against Juul had risen more than 80 per cent since October, adding that it had not made any assumptions regarding the merits or likelihood of success of these cases.The Juul writedown pushed Altria into a $1.8bn loss for 2019, compared with a $1.3bn profit the previous year. Revenues for the calendar year fell 2 per cent to just over $6bn.In addition to the writedown, Altria also lowered its forward guidance because of a “current expectation for no equity earnings contributions from Juul through 2022”.Between 2020 and 2022, adjusted earnings would now grow between 4 per cent and 7 per cent, down from a previous forecast of 5 to 8 per cent, the tobacco group said.
5;MO;Altria Group;2019-10-31T18:02:22Z;Altria/Juul: coughing up;Until the smoke clears on the vaping regulatory front the pain is unlikely to ease;"Altria has been burnt. The US tobacco behemoth has written down its $12.8bn investment in e-cigarette group Juul Labs by more than a third. The resulting $4.5bn charge pushed Altria into a $2.6bn loss for the quarter — its only loss since at least 1993. Ouch.As Lex argued last month, a writedown was inevitable. Altria paid nearly $13bn for a 35 per cent stake in trendy Juul last December. The deal valued the business at about $38bn, or more than twice its valuation just five months earlier. Since Altria made its lavish investment its money has gone up in smoke. Concerns over teen addiction and a public-health crisis marked by the outbreak of a mysterious lung disease unleashed a government crackdown on vaping, undermining Juul’s heady valuation. The backlash over Juul was big and scary enough to prompt Philip Morris International to abandon merger talks with Altria last month.Taking the hit now is one thing; whether it is enough to draw a line under the adventure is quite another. Lawsuits are already being filed against Juul and the outcome could further erode the value of Altria’s holding. Altria’s bid to contain the damage by replacing Juul’s CEO with one of its own executives last month was tantamount to shuffling the deckchairs on the Titanic.Altria bulls argue the $4.5bn is a non-cash charge and will not affect its operating cash flow. But Altria funded its investment in Juul entirely through debt, adding an additional $530m of annual interest expense, according to Morgan Stanley. That eats up about 5 per cent of last year’s operating profits. Altria has said the cost-cutting will offset this.A slide in traditional cigarette sales (down nearly 7 per cent year-on-year during the third quarter) exacerbates the problem. Altria shares deserve the 30 per cent discount to erstwhile suitor Philip Morris International, based on forward earnings. Until the smoke clears on the vaping regulatory front that discount will not close. "
6;MO;Altria Group;2019-10-31T11:45:58Z;Altria writes down Juul investment by $4.5bn;Tobacco group’s decision comes amid increased concern about health effects of vaping;Altria wrote down the value of its investment in Juul by $4.5bn as the e-cigarette start-up comes under increasing pressure from regulators over the health effects of vaping.The tobacco group, parent of Marlboro-owner Philip Morris USA, valued its investment in Juul at $12.8bn at the end of June but said in a statement on Thursday accompanying its third-quarter results that it had booked the non-cash, pre-tax charge on the start-up.Altria said its decision to record the impairment was driven by the cumulative effect of various e-vapour bans in certain US cities, states and some international markets, the increased likelihood of the Food and Drug Administration removing flavoured vaping pods and “other factors” rather than a “single determinative event or factor”.E-cigarettes had previously been lauded as a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes. US medical experts have tied at least 30 deaths and more than 1,600 hospitalisations in the country to vaping-related illnesses.Uncertainty over Juul’s future was a big factor in Altria and Philip Morris International in September calling off talks about a $200bn merger and the sacking of the start-up’s chief executive.Altria agreed to pay about $13bn for 35 per cent stake in Juul last December. The price paid raised eyebrows at the time, with some analysts describing the valuation as “unusually high”. Juul employees shared a $2bn bonus pool as a result of the deal.Since then Juul has been caught in a political, regulatory and legal backlash over vaping. US medical experts have tied hundreds of cases of lung damage to vaping, although they have not blamed Juul specifically. Flavoured vaping variants have been blamed for encouraging underage use and getting a new generation addicted to nicotine.“Of course, we’re not pleased to have to take an impairment charge on the Juul investment,” Howard Willard, chairman and chief executive, told Wall Street analysts. “While we had a range of scenarios when we made our investment in Juul, we did not anticipate this dramatic a change in the e-vapour category.”Some regulatory changes, he said, had been “on the extreme end of what we might have expected”.However, he added: “Juul is set up in the longer-term to continue to be the winner in e-vapour. And because of that, we continue to be supportive of Juul’s business and look forward to them working through the changes.”Juul this week laid out plans for a restructuring. Between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of Juul’s 4,000-strong workforce is set to be cut. Several executives, including its chief financial officer, are leaving.The investment in Juul had been among several initiatives from Altria to safeguard its long-term future. Tobacco groups are fighting over a share of the market for alternatives as consumers in western markets reject traditional cigarettes at an accelerating rate.Altria said its net revenue in the three months ended September 30 rose 2.3 per cent from a year ago to $5.4bn, which edged ahead of Wall Street forecasts, but its impairment on Juul saw it swing to a reported loss of $1.39 a diluted share.The company affirmed guidance to increase adjusted earnings by between 5 per cent and 7 per cent a diluted share in 2019 and also announced a new EPS growth objective of 5 per cent to 8 per cent for the years 2020 through 2022.Shares in the company were down 1.5 per cent in morning trade on Thursday.
7;MO;Altria Group;2019-09-27T17:09:31Z;Regulators should not snuff out vaping industry;Research shows e-cigarettes are a powerful weapon against smoking;Makers and users of e-cigarettes have had a turbulent few weeks. A spate of illnesses have been linked to vaping, with at least 12 deaths reported. US president Donald Trump called for a ban on flavoured vapes amid concerns over teenage addiction to nicotine. The growing regulatory threat to e-cigarettes prompted Philip Morris International to call off talks on a $200bn merger with Altria, and saw the vaping company Juul sack its chief executive and suspend US advertising.There are reasons to be wary of vaping. It has become worryingly common in schools in the US, and more trials are needed to assess long-term health effects. Yet as a tool to reduce rates of smoking, e-cigarettes offer clear benefits. A regulatory scalpel based firmly on science is needed to deal with the risks surrounding e-cigarettes — not a sledgehammer guided by public fear.The deaths and illnesses linked to e-cigarettes are disturbing, but it is unclear whether they stemmed from chemicals added by users or third parties rather than manufacturers’ products themselves. Researchers have repeatedly shown traditional cigarettes are far more dangerous. Clinical trials also found that in concert with expert support, vaping could help smokers to quit. This is no small benefit: even in 2017, nearly 80,000 deaths in the UK were attributed to smoking.More questionable is how e-cigarettes have been marketed. Kevin Burns, the now ex-chief executive of Juul, told non-smokers not to use his products. In practice, they have been all too popular among younger users. Campaigners warn that sweet and dessert-based flavours are appealing to teenagers, echoing the alcopops of the mid-2000s. The association with Big Tobacco — which seized on vaping as a lifeline — has also done the new technology’s reputation few favours.There are clear steps that can make the industry safer for all. Most urgent is research into the causes of the recent deaths in the US, to determine whether hidden risks exist that need to be addressed. For now, regulators should tighten rules on how e-cigarettes are advertised and marketed, to discourage teenage use. Sales of flavoured vape products should be ended.Scientific research should also continue into the longer-term impacts of vaping. The full health consequences of smoking took years to become clear and even longer for the industry to accept. It will be decades before studies can truly claim to have found all the effects of vaping. Users themselves should be urged to avoid adding potentially dangerous chemicals to vapes.Yet banning vape sales, as San Francisco did in June, is excessive. Public Health England has argued against such a ban, in part because of vapes’ usefulness in helping smokers to stop. Controls are needed, but vaping should not be regulated out of existence.
8;MO;Altria Group;2019-09-27T10:30:38Z;The new Juul chief sent to ‘douse fire’ of vaping crisis;Tobacco veteran KC Crosthwaite must guide e-cigarette brand through public health storm;He has spent his entire 22-year career working for a tobacco company but KC Crosthwaite is keen to demonstrate he is no Marlboro Man.As he resigned from Altria, which makes the top-selling tobacco brand, to take charge this week of Juul Labs, the vaping company that has pledged to render cigarettes obsolete, he recognised that the start-up’s employees “may have questions” about his background.“The answer is simple,” Juul’s incoming chief executive wrote in a memo to staff. “For over a decade, I have believed that the future lies with alternatives to combustible cigarettes.” He added: “On every level — personally and professionally — I believe in this company’s mission.”Questions about Juul’s links to Altria, which had already taken a 35 per cent stake, are among many that Mr Crosthwaite is facing as he takes charge of a company whose explosive growth is suddenly under threat.Fifty-five years since the US surgeon-general estimated that smokers were almost 10 times as likely to die of lung cancer as the rest of the population, e-cigarettes — once lauded as a less harmful alternative — are at the centre of their own public health crisis.“He has a very tough job because he has to douse the fire,” said Jonathan Fell, co-founder of Ash Park Capital, a consumer goods investment house that holds Altria stock.US President Donald Trump has threatened an outright ban on flavoured versions of the devices that have been blamed for encouraging underage vaping and getting school pupils addicted to nicotine. US medical experts have tied hundreds of cases of lung damage to e-cigarettes. At least 12 deaths have been reported.While public health officials have not blamed Juul for the mysterious illness, as the country’s most popular brand it is nevertheless in the middle of the regulatory crosshairs.“Juuling” has become a verb, synonymous with vaping. Campaigners seized on Mr Crosthwaite’s appointment as evidence that the San Francisco-based company is just another cog in the Big Tobacco machine.Yet his supporters say deep experience managing often delicate regulatory relationships is just what is needed for youthful Juul, formerly run by ex-Chobani yoghurt executive Kevin Burns.Mr Crosthwaite’s job move was certainly the talk of the Global Tobacco & Nicotine Forum — the “Davos” of the sector — in Washington this week.Originally from New York, KC — short for Kevin Carlyle — joined Philip Morris, as Altria was previously known, in a sales role in 1997 after attending Milwaukee’s Marquette University. Over the next decade he worked his way up the US business with positions including district manager and director of new and smokeless products under the Marlboro brand.After a stint as marketing director of John Middleton, the cigars and pipe tobacco unit, he moved to Zurich for his first international assignment at Richmark, a non-combustible start-up Altria launched with Okono, an affiliate of a nicotine chewing gum company.By 2013, he was back in Richmond, Virginia, overseeing the company’s core product as general manager of Marlboro. After just over a year as chief executive of Philip Morris USA, Altria chief executive Howard Willard picked Mr Crosthwaite in May 2018 to be the group’s chief growth officer — an atypical job title in an industry whose main product is in terminal decline.Altria’s $13bn agreement to take a stake in Juul followed by the end of the year. Mr Crosthwaite became an observer on its board, as well as a director of Cronos, the cannabis company in which Altria also invested.The Juul deal has brought questions from Altria investors. The price tag raised eyebrows when it was announced last December and the recent furore over e-cigarettes has only heightened scrutiny of the decision.Uncertainty over the future of Juul was a big reason for the breakdown, announced within minutes of Mr Crosthwaite’s job change, in $200bn merger talks between Altria and Philip Morris International.Wall Street views another project in which Mr Crosthwaite was closely involved more favourably: Altria’s partnership with its former stablemate PMI to bring IQOS, a different type of product that aims to replace traditional cigarettes, to the US.Juul credits Mr Crosthwaite for navigating Washington’s regulatory labyrinth and helping to convince officials to grant regulatory approval to the “heat-not-burn” device, which is due for an imminent US launch.An early riser, often seen in the gym at 6am, the 44-year-old is also fond of golf but spends most of his time outside work with his family in Richmond, Virginia. Friends describe him as a hardworking straight shooter.As he seeks to balance Altria’s interests with those of Juul’s non-tobacco shareholders, the new chief executive will be hoping he can forge a similar reputation among the company’s varied stakeholders.Howard Willard, Altria’s chief executive, said the new Juul chief took a “collaborative and co-operative approach” to his work, “which I think is going to be necessary”. Mr Crosthwaite was, he added, “well equipped to help them navigate what I think anybody would say is a challenging environment”.
9;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;MO;Altria Group;2019-09-26T17:17:19Z;Changes at the top of Juul Labs give tobacco veterans upper hand;E-cigarette start-up faces legal hurdles as it grapples with backlash over vaping;With a sleek product that became a hit among 20-somethings and a headquarters in a trendy part of San Francisco, e-cigarette start-up Juul Labs long occupied a different world from Big Tobacco. As it grapples with a public backlash over teenage vaping and the emergence of mysterious health problems linked to the habit, however, the company is increasingly having to become more like the industry it set out to upend.This week, grizzled veterans of tobacco’s protracted legal and regulatory battles moved closer to taking control of Juul. Nine months after Marlboro maker Altria struck a $12.8bn deal to acquire a 35 per cent stake, Kevin Burns has been replaced as Juul’s chief executive by the tobacco giant’s chief growth officer, KC Crosthwaite.The change was announced just as talks ended over a $200bn merger between Altria and Philip Morris International, a collapse caused in large part by investor worries about the former’s investment in Juul.For all the immediate drama, Altria remains hopeful its investment in Juul will pay off in the longer term. Give it five years, predicted Altria’s chairman and chief executive Howard Willard after his company’s talks with PMI broke down without a deal, and Juul will be back on the front foot.By then, Mr Willard told the Financial Times at the Global Tobacco and Nicotine Forum in Washington, “I believe Juul will have navigated the challenges” associated with a surge in vaping among American schoolchildren.“They’ll be a highly responsible player that leads in the US e-vapour market, and a leader in many markets overseas. But it’s going to take a significant amount of work — and a significant amount of investment — to navigate the next year or two,” he said.For now, there is no let up in the scrutiny of Juul. Nancy Brown, head of the American Heart Association, said the installation of Mr Crosthwaite — who has taken charge with immediate effect — showed Juul was “fully embracing its identity as a tobacco company that prioritises profits over public health”.We have more compelling non-combustible tobacco products in the US than we’ve ever had, and we have a regulator that stands ready to authorise new productsUS medical officials have linked 805 cases of lung damage, and 12 deaths, to e-cigarette use. They have not blamed Juul — indeed, in many cases, they have found that those who have fallen ill inhaled products containing THC, a psychoactive compound in cannabis — but as the largest and best-known vaping company, it has borne the brunt of the backlash.Tony Abboud, executive director of the Vapor Technology Association, said: “If the current hysterical narrative from public health officials continues, people will be smoking many more cigarettes than they are. The narrative is scaring people away [from alternatives].”Juul is also blamed for getting a new generation hooked on nicotine, despite the company’s efforts to restrict sales to youngsters. The National Youth Tobacco Survey found about a quarter of high school students had vaped in the past month.President Donald Trump has threatened to ban flavoured e-cigarettes, while regulators in several states from New York to California have laid down plans for their own restrictions. Moreover, in a sign the regulatory uncertainty is enough to hurt sales, US retailer Walmart, which stocks Juul, said last week it would stop selling e-cigarettes altogether.Juul’s explosive sales growth has recently begun to moderate, according to Nielsen data cited by Wells Fargo. Year-on-year sales rose a third in the four weeks to September 7, a slowdown from the 50 per cent expansion recorded during the previous four-week period. Even so, many in the industry are sceptical that Mr Trump will follow through on his threat for an outright ban, not least because of Republican opposition.And while campaigners were critical of Mr Crosthwaite’s appointment, having a longstanding tobacco executive in charge could ultimately work in Juul’s favour. Part of the company’s recent problems, said industry consultant Erik Bloomquist, was down to it underestimating the degree of opposition from anti-tobacco activists.Mr Bloomquist, who at one time consulted for Juul, said it had been run by “very smart people from top universities”. He added that Mr Burns, a former president and chief operating officer of Chobani, “had a really strong operating background in yoghurt . . . But there were very few people in the business with tobacco experience”. By contrast, he said, Altria was “adept at aligning itself with regulatory concerns: it works well with regulators and has longstanding relationships with them”. In announcing Mr Crosthwaite’s appointment, Juul noted its incoming chief had “played a key role” in convincing the US Food and Drug Administration to give the regulatory thumbs up to IQOS, another cigarette alternative device Altria is to start selling in the US in partnership with PMI. “He’s one of the reasons I continue to have confidence in the investment in Juul,” said Mr Willard, adding he was “comfortable” with Altria’s existing 35 per cent stake in the company. Mr Crosthwaite has “significant experience dealing with a highly regulated industry, addressing concerns from a variety of stakeholders”.Industry lobbyists have voiced concerns that the regulatory crackdown on vaping could encourage smokers who are trying to quit to revert, yet Mr Willard said he was doubtful.“In the long-term, I don’t think that’s the pattern I would expect to see,” he said, predicting that a decade from now traditional cigarettes would account for less than half the market.“Consumers are highly likely to move. We have more compelling non-combustible tobacco products in the US than we’ve ever had, and we have a regulator that stands ready to authorise new products.” Should Mr Willard be proved correct that Juul’s long-term future is bright, some analysts believe PMI could eventually resume its tie-up talks with Altria. Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo, said she “wouldn’t be surprised” if the pair tried to revive their deal “when the environment is better”.
11;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Just say no to destructive mergers and acquisitions;The collapse of PMI-Altria talks is a rare bright spot amid dealmaking juggernaut;"Wednesday’s announcement that Phillip Morris International and Altria had walked away from talks about a $200bn tobacco company merger is both unusual and praiseworthy. Mergers and acquisitions involving large companies often take on a life of their own, despite decades of studies that suggest that half or more of these deals destroy shareholder value.No self-respecting chief executive would contemplate placing a large part of their shareholders’ funds on a roulette wheel in Las Vegas hoping that it came up red; the 50:50 odds would be a reckless gamble. Yet companies worldwide effectively do that, repeatedly.Despite what should be unacceptable odds, the first half of 2019 saw $2tn of deals, and today in boardrooms around the world directors are actively reviewing plans for large acquisitions. They may be vaguely aware that deals often cost more than they return in synergies but, too often, executives believe their company will be the exception.This collective delusion has many sources. Shareholders who routinely vote to approve deals bear some responsibility. Perhaps the most embarrassing modern example is the more than 90 per cent shareholder approval Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays each enjoyed for their separate bids for the Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007, even as the foundations of the financial system were wobbling alarmingly. RBS’s ultimate victory helped push the lender into needing a taxpayer rescue.Management and directors are also clearly culpable. Their inclination is to expand their businesses. Acquiring things can speed that up. Ironically, the thornier and more challenging their own business, the more beguiling a shiny new toy may appear. And there is, of course, a well-documented relationship between the size of a company and CEO pay packages.But there is a third set of actors who are often overlooked: the advisers. Bankers are supposed to be there to advise. Yet in almost all M&A situations, the amount of money they receive is not linked to the quality of their advice but rather to the success of the transaction. And the fees can be eye watering; JPMorgan’s bankers are poised to collect a world record $123m success fee if shareholders of pharma group Allergan vote next month to approve its $63bn sale to rival AbbVie.For bankers, success does not mean that the deal actually rewarded shareholders. They are paid when the transaction goes through. Further fuelling this distorted definition of success, there are industry league tables based on these completion fees. The fact that more than half of the deals will ultimately fall short is merely an inconvenient truth ignored at awards ceremonies and celebratory deal closing dinners.So what is the solution? Clearly shareholders would be well advised to take a more sceptical view of deals, be cognisant of the odds and use the deal approval process less as a rubber stamping exercise and more as an opportunity to reject proposed deals. The collapsed PMI-Altria negotiations are a prime example of how this could work. Though the companies blamed a changing regulatory environment, investors had given the original announcement a chilly reception and made clear that winning approval would not be easy.Management and directors should be much more critical of potential deals, remaining mindful that the odds are stacked against them. Lastly, much responsibility also lies on the shoulders of the advisers, whose role should be more like that of a coach and less a cheerleader. One might try to link the success fee to the acquisition itself working, with clawbacks built in if the deal fails to meet expectations. But it may prove too difficult to define success and failure clearly enough to make that work.Shareholders could instead insist that some of the company’s advisers work on a fixed fee, regardless of whether the transaction happens or not. Indeed, a 2018 paper from Legal & General Investment Management, one of the UK’s largest investors, recently argued for exactly that. It urged boards to appoint advisers who would report directly to them and be paid a flat fee. This would result in more honest and less conflicted advice, but would also require company management to actively embrace the idea of working with a truly independent adviser.Despite the PMI-Altria example, ultimately, giving up gambling is hard to do. Richard Grace, who is the inventor of several systems to beat casinos, put it this way: “The two toughest things to do at roulette is to walk away when you are winning and to walk away when you are losing.”The writer is a banking consultant at Veritum PartnersShareholders cannot take a view without all the facts / From Wayne Kitcat, Abinger, Surrey, UKRecent studies show M&A from another perspective / From Dr Valeriya Vitkova, London, UK"
12;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Tobacco burns: a $200bn merger collapses and a CEO is ousted;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.One scoop to start: WeWork is in talks with SoftBank to renegotiate a $1.5bn capital injection the Japanese telecoms-to-technology group has agreed to plough into the property company next year, according to multiple people briefed on the matter. The FT’s Eric Platt and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson have the full story here. It has been a rough week for chief executives at two of America’s most talked about and richly valued private companies. Just one day after WeWork’s board gave chief executive Adam Neumann his marching orders, Juul Labs boss Kevin Burns announced his resignation after coming under fire from regulators following a spike in vaping-related deaths. Taking over from Burns is KC Crosthwaite, the chief growth officer at Altria, which owns a 35 per cent stake in Juul. It may come as a surprise but the personnel change was actually a move by Altria to rescue an attempted $200bn reunion with Philip Morris International. That transaction, which DD has been bearish about from the start, hung in the balance as regulators took aim at the burgeoning e-cigarette industry. By installing an Altria executive to lead Juul, the company wanted to show that it could handle the backlash. Welp, that didn’t work. The regulatory crackdown on e-cigarettes prompted PMI to call off talks with Altria, which would’ve brought the domestic and international makers of Marlboro back together. You can’t escape the irony of it all. It was Juul and the vision of a smoke-free future that prompted the pursuit of the mammoth deal. PMI was going to use cash flows from its traditional cigarette business to help fund an e-cigarette expansion that would secure an advantage over rivals. Whether you smoked cigarettes or alternatives you were going to buy them from PMI/Altria.But once burnt, twice shy. It looks like PMI doesn’t want to go back to where cigarette makers were a decade ago, dealing with years of painful litigation and pending regulation. History is repeating itself in the e-cigarette industry. And we hate to say it, but DD called it when the deal was first announced at the end of August. Signs of a bigger blowback were already hanging in the air. San Francisco by then had banned the sale of e-cigarettes and vaping-linked lung illnesses were rising daily. Juul tried to offer more concessions by saying it would suspend all its broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the US and refrain from lobbying the Trump administration on its moves to scale up regulation.PMI shareholders breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday and the stock jumped more than 5 per cent. The FT’s Lex said PMI was right to walk away. The company’s own heated e-cigarette, IQOS, received US marketing approval earlier this year and should gain from the vaping crackdown. For Altria, things are a little more complicated. Just hours before Thomas Cook finally declared itself bust, the UK travel group still hadn’t given up hope that last-ditch meetings would find the extra £200m demanded by its banks.Half a million holidaymakers were relying on the company to bring them back home.But by the time that chief executive Peter Fankhauser emerged blinking through the loading bay at City law firm Latham & Watkins on Sunday night, he knew that it was all over, prompting the biggest ever peacetime repatriation. The government refused to offer the company a £250m lifeline, ending hopes of bringing its lenders and largest shareholder, China’s Fosun, behind a carefully constructed £1.1bn restructuring deal.If the end appears rapid, rest assured the 178-year-old company was facing turbulence for many years. Successive managements and an ill-fated 2007 merger with UK holiday company MyTravel, which brought with it a tour operator and airline, left the travel group vulnerable. Thomas Cook was still writing down a final £1.1bn goodwill from MyTravel in May this year. At the same time customers started moving online and away from the concept of a packaged holiday for more adventurous pursuits. Thomas Cook was left with a strategic crisis and a financial black hole as debts mounted beyond £1.9bn. Customers are still wondering who’s to blame for the company’s collapse?Is it the fault of the banks for demanding the extra £200m equity headroom? Or did management act too slowly while they happily pocketed millions in wages as the ship was sinking? Perhaps the blame lies with the bondholders, who were threatening to veto the deal unless they got a payout on their credit default swaps? What about the UK government for not supporting a British business? The sting in the tail: just days later the German government gave its domestic Thomas Cook business a €400m lifeline, twice what it would’ve taken to save the entire group.Or can we blame the advisers, racking up big fees while failing to find the restructuring solution? And should PwC and EY face accountability for not taking action over the company’s accounts?

13;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;PMI/Altria: the vape escape ;Souring taste of Juul cuts appetite for deal ;Philip Morris International has seen the future - and it is not in vaping. Not in the US, anyway.The company has ended merger talks with Altria, from which it split 11 years ago. A deal would have created a tobacco heavyweight with a market worth of more than $200bn.Juul, the hip vape startup, appears responsible for the breakdown of the takeover talks it had prompted. With cost savings modest and world sales of coffin nails falling, a merger was predicated on a joint push into “reduced-risk products”.Altria’s $13bn bet on Juul looked promising. The purchase of a 35 per cent stake last December gave it immediate exposure to a fast-growing company with more than 70 per cent of the US e-cigarette market.Since then, the outlook for Juul has soured. Citing growing public alarm over the rise of teen vaping, the Trump administration earlier this month said it planned to ban all flavoured e-cigarettes. These products make up more than 80 per cent of Juul’s sales. Several important international markets that Juul had been eyeing — including India — have already banned e-cigarettes. A last-ditch attempt on Wednesday by Altria to salvage the talks by ousting Juul chief executive Kevin Burns and replacing him with an Altria veteran was not enough.PMI is right to walk away. It was doing just fine without Altria. Excluding currency headwinds, sales and profits were up during the last quarter. Its gross margins have consistently been higher than Altria’s. It carries less debt, with net borrowings to adjusted ebitda at 2.1 times, compared to Altria’s 2.6 times. Its own heated e-cigarette, IQOS, received US marketing approval earlier this year. IQOS should gain from the vaping crackdown.Before the news of a potential tie-up, PMI shares traded at 15 times forward earnings, against 11 times for Altria. The gap should widen.For Altria, the short-term outlook is fraught. Juul once made it feel cool, like a vaper at a teenage party. The near-$13bn investment now looks overvalued and ill-timed. A writedown seems inevitable.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Click here to sign up.
14;MO;Altria Group;2019-09-25T13:30:22Z;E-cigarette crackdown prompts shake-up in tobacco sector;Juul ousts CEO and suspends US ads as Philip Morris International and Altria end $200bn merger talks;The regulatory crackdown on e-cigarettes has prompted Philip Morris International to call off talks about a $200bn merger with Altria and sparked a shake-up at vaping company Juul, which sacked its chief executive and suspended US advertising.Juul Labs, in which Altria took a 35 per cent stake in December 2018 for $12.8bn, announced on Tuesday an abrupt change of leadership and alterations to its marketing and lobbying policies. A person familiar with the situation said PMI decided to walk away after it became apparent the US government crackdown on vaping could have a negative impact given Altria’s stake in Juul.André Calantzopoulos, PMI’s chief executive, said the two companies had decided to focus on the US launch of Iqos, PMI’s heated tobacco product, which, the companies noted, had been authorised by the US Food and Drug Administration following a “rigorous science-based review” and was not an e-vapour product.Speaking to the Financial Times on the sidelines of a tobacco conference in Washington soon after the collapse of the deal was announced, Howard Willard, Altria’s chief executive, said his company was “always evaluating opportunities. These discussions with PMI just reflected that. Ultimately we’ve ceased negotiations and we’ll move on.”Juul said Kevin Burns had decided to step down as chief executive. KC Crosthwaite, Altria’s chief growth officer, will replace him. The company added it would suspend all its broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the US and refrain from lobbying the Trump administration on its moves to tighten regulation in the wake of an outbreak of vaping-related lung illnesses tied to several deaths. The changes at Juul were intended to reassure PMI that Altria was in control of Juul and would have guided the start-up through the regulatory backlash, said a person informed about the negotiations.PMI had been informed in advance of the moves, and the selection of an executive with greater tobacco industry experience coming from Altria was appreciated, the person added. Up until late last week the two sides were determined to go ahead with a deal. Over the weekend, however, the board of PMI determined that the risks outweighed the benefits of a merger, said people close to the companies. Both people said that PMI is likely to pursue a deal with Altria at a later stage once the regulatory environment settles.Mr Willard told the FT that Juul had “taken a number of leadership actions — they’ve done more than any of the other vapour companies — but it’s still not enough”.A PMI-Altria combination was pitched as a way for the companies to spread their bets on the future of nicotine consumption, uniting the largest brand in the declining US cigarette market with Juul, which has seized a 70 per cent share of US e-cigarette sales, and the nascent Iqos.But the deal ran into immediate hostility from both companies’ investors. PMI shareholders expressed concern about taking on exposure to the declining, litigation-wracked US cigarette market. Altria shareholders questioned the logic of a deal that would have offered no control premium.In early trade on Wednesday in New York, shares in PMI jumped 6 per cent, but Altria’s were down more than 1 per cent.“Obviously the timing of the merger wasn’t right given escalating [negative] regulatory headlines, but we still see the merits of this combination and wouldn’t be surprised if talks resume at some point in the future when the environment is better,” said Wells Fargo strategist Bonnie Herzog.The collapse of the talks will also negatively impact the independent investment banks advising them, who will be missing out on significant fees. Lazard was the lead adviser to PMI, while Perella Weinberg Partners and Goldman Sachs were the financial advisers of Altria. 
15;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T03:31:47+0000;Trump considers ban on flavoured e-cigarettes;Health officials have increased scrutiny of vaping after lung illnesses and deaths;The Trump administration is examining whether to ban flavoured e-cigarettes, after more than 400 patients have been diagnosed with a mysterious illness linked to vaping and six have died.Alex Azar, the US health secretary, said the US Food and Drug Administration is looking at whether to require e-cigarette makers to remove all flavours other than tobacco from the market. Speaking after a White House meeting with Donald Trump and Ned Sharpless, the acting FDA commissioner, he said it will take action if companies are marketing flavoured e-cigarettes to children.Mr Trump said the US has a problem with vaping and must do something about it. He said companies that sell e-cigarettes had become “very rich” very fast.His comments come after Melania Trump tweeted earlier this week that she is “deeply concerned” about the “growing epidemic” of e-cigarette use among children. Mr Trump said: “She’s got a son . . . she feels very strongly about it.”Wall Street reacted with some concern to the latest sign of a vaping crackdown. It comes less than a week after health officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned consumers to avoid using e-cigarettes.Shares in Altria, which owns a 35 per cent stake in ecigarette maker Juul and sells Marlboro cigarettes in the US, had been trading as much as 1.7 per cent higher earlier in the day but after the announcement they lost all the gains to trade little changed.Altria shares have dropped 11 per cent so far this year. With consumers rejecting traditional cigarettes at an accelerating rate, the emerging health concerns over vaping have dented investor confidence that such companies can transition into new businesses.The White House’s move threatens to further complicate Altria’s planned tie-up with Philip Morris International in a $200bn mega-deal. Analysts have already expressed scepticism about the merits of the combination, noting it would bring PMI into the US market at a time of heightened uncertainty over regulation of, and consumer demand for, alternative products.The FDA did not respond to a request for comment. The regulator has been warning vapers to avoid e-cigarettes that contain THC, the main psychoactive component in marijuana.Such e-cigarettes have been linked to the mysterious illness. Some officials think the THC could be diluted with vitamin E oil, which is safe to absorb orally, but could damage the lungs when inhaled.Scientists are still investigating the cause of the lung problems, and the American Medical Association and the American Lung Association have advised the public to not use e-cigarettes at all.US regulators have already introduced a series of restrictions on the devices. While health officials see merit in converting existing cigarette smokers to lower-risk alternatives, they have been alarmed by a surge in popularity among young people and are concerned a new generation is at risk of getting hooked on nicotine. Earlier initiatives included restricting the availability of flavoured e-cigarettes to people under 21.
16;MO;Altria Group;2019-08-30T17:08:49Z;Altria/PMI: the resilience of Big Tobacco;The lasting value of the two Marlboro makers has surprised and dismayed public health advocates;"An industry with a lethally addictive product offers billions of dollars to cap the liabilities that threaten its biggest companies: news this week that Purdue Pharma had offered up to $12bn to resolve claims relating to its role in America’s opioid crisis had analysts, investors and lawyers flashing back to the landmark settlement Big Tobacco struck with US states a generation earlier.Yet at the same time came news that two of the world’s largest tobacco companies are in talks about one of the largest mergers in history, which could dictate the future of a product which kills an estimated 8m of its 1.1bn global users each year, according to the World Health Organisation.The $200bn deal under discussion would reunite Altria with Philip Morris International, the overseas operation it spun off in 2008, in part to shelter shareholders from the legal storm clouds that hung over the US tobacco industry even after its $206bn-plus settlement of 1998.The fact that the two makers of Marlboro cigarettes remain so highly valued, and have proposed reuniting, speaks to a resilience that has surprised and dismayed public health advocates. “Like anyone who worked on the litigation 20 years ago I find it heartbreaking that the industry has continued to thrive,” says Doug Blanke, executive director of the Public Health Law Center, who worked on Minnesota’s cases against tobacco companies in the 1990s. But the deal also reflects the profound disruption tobacco companies are facing, as the decline in cigarette consumption accelerates and a format war rages between technologies vying to give smokers ostensibly less harmful means of delivering nicotine. What has brought PMI and Altria together again, analysts say, is the prospect of using the financial muscle and market power their legacy business has given them to gain a decisive advantage in that battle — even if it means killing the product the “Marlboro man” made famous in the process. Financially, Big Tobacco has been more stable than investors dared to hope in 2008, when the two companies split apart. PMI’s exposure to emerging markets has allowed its revenues to grow by 15 per cent since then, while Altria’s US revenues have increased by 1 per cent. Even in the US, the market investors once wanted shelter from, cigarettes have never been more profitable, says Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog — the result of their ability to get addicted customers to pay more. Although some funds refuse to touch the industry, the fact that PMI and Altria both convert 80 per cent or more of that profit into dividends has lured other investors who are desperate for yield: last year UK fund managers at Allianz swapped the oil stocks in their portfolio for tobacco companies. These robust financial headlines mask more troubling trends for the industry, however. In 2000, the WHO estimates, almost 27 per cent of the world’s adult population smoked: that figure has dropped below 20 per cent, with notable falls in major markets including Brazil, Russia and the UK.The US has seen one of the biggest declines, from 23.3 per cent in 2000 to just 14 per cent in 2017. For a decade, this shrinking pool of smokers has left the industry dependent on price increases to keep revenues growing. But with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimating that each 10 per cent increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes reduces consumption by 3-5 per cent, analysts now believe the escalating cost of smoking is accelerating its decline. In July Altria said it expected cigarette volumes to fall by 5-6 per cent this year, rather than the 3.5-5 per cent decline it foresaw six months earlier. As tobacco analyst Erik Bloomquist puts it: “This wonderful cash-generating business looks to be more in danger than it ever has been.” In the past two years another force has added to the pressure on cigarette demand: the number of smokers switching to alternatives. Cigarette manufacturers have experimented with what they call reduced risk products for decades: RJ Reynolds spent $350m to develop a heated tobacco device in the 1980s, only to withdraw it when consumers recoiled at the smell of what even its chief executive reputedly dubbed “a turd with a tip”. None were successful until 2003, when the electronic cigarette was developed by Chinese pharmacist Hon Lik, who sold the patent to Imperial Tobacco for $75m in 2013.Despite the billions of dollars cigarette companies invested in new technologies, it took a start-up to popularise e-cigarettes. Founded in 2015, Juul Labs has seized more than 70 per cent of the US vaping market, a market that is growing fast: the US now has 14m adult vapers alongside its 39m adult smokers, Wells Fargo estimates. The speed of these changes has forced cigarette makers to respond. Last year, Altria invested $13bn in Juul for a 35 per cent stake, pledging to use its sway with retailers to promote Juul’s products.The tobacco group’s efforts to diversify have also seen it spend $1.8bn on a 45 per cent stake in Cronos, a Canadian cannabis company, and $372m for a majority stake in Burger Söhne, the Swiss manufacturer of On, an oral nicotine brand. PMI has set out a more aggressive vision of a “smoke-free” future, investing more than $6bn in a heated tobacco device called Iqos, which it hopes will one day replace cigarettes. Impressed with the early response to Iqos, particularly in Japan, Altria struck a deal to license the product in the US, where it plans to start testing the market with a trial in Atlanta next month. That agreement may now be overtaken by the merger plan. Analysts who support the deal say it would let PMI capture the full value of Iqos in the US, while giving Juul the same promotional push overseas that Altria has promised for the US market.Recombining the two Marlboro makers would not only give them united control of the world’s biggest cigarette brand; they would also own the industry’s leading heated tobacco product and a stake in its largest e-cigarette company, potentially allowing them to win regardless of which technology consumers favour. Yet those arguments have not convinced investors who saw the case for Altria and PMI being apart. Shares in both companies have fallen at the prospect of a deal that would give Altria’s shareholders no takeover premium and expose PMI’s investors to the US market, which many of them wished to avoid. “There is a strong possibility the deal will fail,” Adam Spielman, an analyst at Citi, told clients: “By having two companies listed, investors can choose the balance of pros and cons they want. By merging the two, management would be forcing investors to take the weighted average.” But while tobacco investors once worried most about America’s lawyers, their biggest concern now is its regulators. “While US litigation risk was sufficient to break these companies apart back in 2008, US regulatory risk is on the same plane, in our view,” Stifel analyst Christopher Growe said this week. The US tobacco industry is facing both the biggest regulatory threat to cigarettes since the 1990s, and deep uncertainty about how regulators will treat the new products it is counting on for growth. In the past year the US Food and Drug Administration has proposed banning menthol cigarettes, which account for about a third of US sales, and said it could place more graphic health warnings on cigarette packets. After a National Youth Tobacco Survey last year shocked regulators with the finding that more than one in five high school students admitted to vaping — up 78 per cent on the previous year — the industry is also bracing for a clampdown on e-cigarettes. The FDA has announced restrictions on many of the flavoured products that it suspects have tempted a generation of children. By May 2020, it intends to require lengthy applications before any vaping product can come to market. Juul has taken several steps to convince regulators it is serious about keeping its products out of young hands, but the FDA’s demands could be “a tremendous issue” for the company, Mr Bloomquist says. “If I’m an investor, why do I want to buy into a business where the theoretical upside is coming from another business which has an existential threat to it?”There have been few long-term studies on vaping, but there is escalating concern in the scientific community about its impact on health.Last week, the CDC said it was investigating the first death linked to an “outbreak of severe lung disease” among e-cigarette users. On Friday it issued a health advisory after receiving reports of 215 possible cases in 25 states.A separate report that the Federal Trade Commission was investigating Juul’s marketing practices contributed to the slide in Altria’s shares this week. Mr Blanke hesitates to speculate about whether these new risks could come close to the legal liability cigarettes once faced.But he sees the products on which PMI and Altria are staking their future becoming the next battleground for public health advocates.“We can count millions of lives saved,” he says about the decades of campaigning against cigarettes, but on his more pessimistic days he wonders: “Will it be another 70 years to get rid of e-cigarettes and then another 70 years to get rid of heated tobacco?”"
17;MO;Altria Group;2019-08-28T20:48:02Z;Investor doubts put $200bn Philip Morris-Altria merger at risk;Ambitions to combine the companies behind the Marlboro brand raise concerns on Wall Street;Talks about a $200bn merger between Altria and Philip Morris International have run into scepticism among investors, threatening to undermine the plan to reunite the US and international tobacco giants behind the Marlboro brand.“So far we haven’t spoken to one [PMI] shareholder who supports it,” analysts at Citigroup noted on Wednesday. “We are unconvinced of the benefits of combining,” they added.Bonnie Herzog, a Wells Fargo strategist who supports the deal, said she had fielded “a mountain of calls” from investors in both companies who were “frustrated with the potential deal mechanics”.A “merger of equals” structured as a nil-premium offer from PMI could amount to a “takeunder” of Altria, she noted.Investors wiped $13bn off the combined market value of Altria and PMI on Tuesday after the talks were disclosed. On Wednesday both companies recovered some of their losses but remained below the level at which they started the week, with Altria closing up 1.3 per cent at $45.85 and PMI ending New York trading 3.6 per cent higher at $74.32.“PMI has a premium rating because of their investments, technology and strategy to lead the industry transition away from combustible tobacco,” said a portfolio manager at one large asset manager which owns shares in PMI. “A merger with Altria would dilute this strategy significantly and comes with few synergies.”More than a decade after US litigation and regulation prompted the former Philip Morris to split in two, these risks were PMI investors’ biggest worries about the plan to recombine, according to analysts and people familiar with investor feedback to the companies.A deal would require approval from both sets of shareholders. Although both companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, PMI sells Marlboro and other brands outside the country while Altria operates in the US market.“I’m surprised Philip Morris would want to do this deal,” said an analyst at another large asset manager with a stake in PMI. “Not having a US presence sets them apart from other tobacco players and there was no sense that they wanted US exposure. This runs counter to what we thought they wanted to do.”Ms Herzog agreed that PMI investors feared higher exposure to the US, where cigarette consumption is falling faster and regulators pose unpredictable risks both to Altria’s core, cash-generative cigarette business and to the new products on which the industry’s growth depends.Pamela Kaufman, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said she saw “limited strategic rationale” for the mooted merger because of the challenges of the US cigarette market and risks of tighter regulation.“With Philip Morris boasting that its goal is to have a ‘smoke-free world,’ increasing its combustibles exposure seems contrary to its strategy,” she added.The nicotine industry has changed dramatically in recent years, as cigarette sales shrink and consumers shift to e-cigarettes and new heated-tobacco products.One sticking point is Altria’s 35 per cent stake in Juul, the popular ecigarette company. As part of the US group’s agreement with Juul last year, which valued the young company at about $38bn, Altria agreed not to distribute any other e-vapour products.PMI owns Iqos, a cigarette-like device that heats, rather than burns, tobacco and had signed a licensing agreement for Altria to launch it in the US next month. Iqos is marketed as an alternative to cigarettes but it is unclear whether Juul would consider use a deal to seek to renegotiate the terms of its agreement with Altria.On Tuesday PMI revealed it was discussing an all-stock merger with Altria but “no assurance” could be made that an agreement would ultimately be clinched. According to one person briefed on the potential deal structure, PMI shareholders are likely to own between 57 per cent and 59 per cent of the combined group. Altria stockholders would hold the remainder.PMI shares suffered their largest one-day drop in 16 months on Tuesday, declining 7.8 per cent to $71.70. The slide was so intense at one point during the trading day that a US securities rule restricting short sales of PMI stock went into effect.The two companies are investing in e-cigarettes despite intense opposition from regulators in Washington, which have warned that teenage vaping has become an “epidemic”. According to one federally funded study last year, one in five high school seniors said they had vaped nicotine in the previous month.“While US litigation risk was sufficient to break these companies apart back in 2008, US regulatory risk is on the same plane, in our view,” analysts at Stifel said.
18;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Philip Morris in talks with Altria to create $200bn tobacco group;Move to recombine comes a decade after companies split into US and international arms;Philip Morris International is in talks to merge with Altria in a deal that would reunite the global and domestic US makers of Marlboro and create the world’s largest tobacco group with a market value of nearly $200bn.PMI said on Tuesday it was considering an all-share combination that would put it back together with Altria, 11 years after they were separated to shield PMI from a slowing US cigarette market as well as the threat of regulation and litigation.However, investors gave the prospect of a deal a frosty reception, sending shares in both companies lower.A successful deal would create a vast business which last year reported combined sales of nearly $50bn and net income of $15.3bn.“There can be no assurance that any agreement or transaction will result from these discussions,” PMI said.A person close to the discussions said that the nil-premium deal under consideration would see PMI shareholders own between 57 and 59 per cent of the combined group, while Altria would hold the remainder.The acquisition of Altria by PMI would rank as the sixth largest takeover ever, according to data provider Refinitiv.Shares in Altria initially climbed as much as 11.3 per cent before turning negative and closing down 4.0 per cent on the day at $45.25. That set its market value at $85bn and the company has $27bn of net debt.PMI fell 7.8 per cent to $71.70, taking its market value to $112bn. It has $26.5bn of net debt.Two years ago, their main rival British American Tobacco completed a deal to buy Reynolds American for $49.4bn. At the time, analysts expected PMI to recombine with Altria, given that fears over US litigation of cigarette groups had dissipated.Tobacco groups are racing to increase their presence in electronic cigarettes and heated-tobacco technology as sales of traditional tobacco products decline. Altria agreed last year to take a 35 per cent stake in ecigarette group Juul Labs for $13bn.Uniting the two companies would also allow PMI to capture the full value of its Iqos heated-tobacco technology, which Altria is preparing to launch under licence in the US, according to Bonnie Herzog at Wells Fargo. Altria’s strong US free cash flow would also allow PMI to “catapult the growth” of Iqos around the world, she said.The two companies are investing in e-cigarettes despite intense opposition from regulators in Washington, which have warned that teenage vaping has become an “epidemic”. According to one federally funded study last year, one in five high school seniors said they had vaped nicotine in the previous month.“While US litigation risk was sufficient to break these companies apart back in 2008, US regulatory risk is on the same plane, in our view,” analysts at Stifel said.The two companies have taken different approaches to the fast-growing cannabis market. PMI believes that marijuana remains too risky to invest in despite the number of countries that have legalised its medical and recreational consumption, while Altria has taken a 45 per cent stake in the Canadian cannabis group Cronos for C$2.4bn.Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson in New York
19;MO;Altria Group;2019-08-27T18:52:38Z;Philip Morris and Altria gamble on post-cigarette future;Tobacco companies face challenge in convincing investors of merits of $200bn deal;When the world’s largest tobacco company announced in 2007 that it planned to break in two, the rationale was that its US and international operations faced fundamentally different dynamics. The split of Altria and Philip Morris International, which took effect in 2008, would free a faster-growing international division to pursue the emerging markets consumers who were trading up to premium brands such as Marlboro from the US operation whose growth had been hobbled by years of litigation and was staring at an inexorable decline in the number of smokers. That the two companies are exploring a merger little more than a decade later speaks to profound changes in their marketplaces, technologies and attitudes towards their core product. The biggest of these is what Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog described as a “global arms race for reduced risk products”. After decades of fruitless and sometimes halfhearted investments by tobacco companies, two alternative technologies are showing signs of persuading cigarette smokers to switch to something less harmful. Altria and PMI have a substantial interest in both of them. I expect the existing incumbents of Imperial, BAT and Japan Tobacco will need to revisit their playbooks for M&A and value creationIn the past decade, PMI has invested $6bn — more than any other tobacco company — to develop a product that heats tobacco for a cigarette-like experience that exposes smokers to fewer harmful chemicals than burning the leaf does. Iqos, its third attempt at creating such a product in 20 years, has performed well in Japan and other Asian markets, converting more than 7m smokers. But its biggest test awaits: Altria had planned to begin testing Iqos in Atlanta next month, with a view to rolling out sales across the US. That arrangement would have seen Altria license the technology from PMI. But under the common ownership the merger talks are aiming for, PMI would have access to the full economic benefits if Iqos took off among the 40m adult smokers in the US, Ms Herzog noted.Altria has made its own $13bn bet on an alternative to cigarettes. The US company took a 35 per cent stake late last year in Juul, putting a $38bn valuation on the fast-growing company that has seized more than 70 per cent of the US ecigarette market and has an explicit mission of ending cigarette smoking. The deal gave Altria exposure to the most successful of the “vaping” start-ups, having failed with its own ecigarette investments. The appeal for Juul was the prospect of Altria using its vast marketing and distribution power to promote the Juul brand from Marlboro packets to retailers’ shelves. This promise was “transformational” to Juul’s mission, according to Dan Thomson, managing director of Juul’s UK arm: “We’ve got the biggest manufacturer of cigarettes in America to hasten their own decline, or hasten the decline of their existing cigarette business,” he said.A combination of Altria with PMI could give Juul a similar boost in international markets and provide the new tobacco company with an unrivalled slate of alternative products, effectively spreading its bets about the future of smoking. Bernstein Research analysts cautioned that non-compete clauses could restrain any plan for PMI to promote Juul internationally, but Robert Waldschmidt, a strategist at Liberum, said that bringing together the leading ecigarette business with the leading heat-not-burn brand would make the combined company a dangerous competitor for tobacco rivals.“I expect the existing incumbents of Imperial, BAT and Japan Tobacco will need to revisit their playbooks for M&A and value creation,” he said. Tobacco executives now say such alternatives can be as profitable as cigarettes after a period of high marketing investment to establish the new brands. That realisation has encouraged companies including PMI and Altria to see their strategy as trying to take market share away from cigarette rivals without such products. The litigation concerns that hung over the Altria/PMI split more than a decade ago have also ebbed. It is 21 years since the then Philip Morris and its rivals agreed to the largest civil litigation settlement in US history, guaranteeing $206bn in payments to 46 states over the next quarter-century. But the industry has continued to produce prodigious returns to shareholders.However, the fact that shares in Altria and PMI were under pressure after the companies disclosed the talks on Tuesday underlines the task they face in convincing shareholders that a deal is the best way to address the disruption the industry faces.One of the biggest hurdles in the path of a successful PMI-Altria recombination is the uncertainty about how regulators will treat the new products on which the industry’s growth depends. In April, the US Food and Drug Administration authorised Altria to start selling PMI’s Iqos heated tobacco system in the US, but analysts are concerned that the regulator could clamp down on the ecigarette market, after warning of an “epidemic” of youth vaping. Ryan Tomkins, an analyst at Jefferies, said that the biggest threat to the deal was the FDA, which has focused its efforts to curtail vaping on Juul in particular due to its popularity among teenagers and is investigating reports tying seizures to vaping use. Mr Tomkins added that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey of youth tobacco use in the US was due out any day, “the results for which could be dangerous for Juul”.Since their split, PMI and Altria have also diverged in other ways. Altria, led by Howard Willard, last year took agreed to take a C$2.4bn stake in the Canadian cannabis company Cronos, but PMI chief executive André Calantzopoulos has said he still sees too many risks in a market where international regulators have found no consensus.More profoundly, the two companies have differed in their commitment to killing off their main product. PMI talks about “building a future on smoke-free products”. Altria has framed its stance more cautiously, emphasising smokers’ “consumer choice” alongside its commitment to innovation and harm reduction.Stifel analyst Christopher Growe said a merger would boost PMI’s earnings and extract $400m in savings, but Altria’s higher regulatory burden and slowing growth would reduce the multiple at which PMI’s shares trade.That concern drove PMI’s shares down almost 11 per cent from Friday’s close by Tuesday lunchtime in New York, pointing to the potential that investors’ concern could yet prove the biggest obstacle to the deal.If it does happen, however, it could be just be a prelude to another split, Mr Growe speculated: “Perhaps this merger would allow the combined company to create two separate businesses — one focused on cigarettes and generating strong free cash flow and one focused on growth with new, innovative products such as Iqos and Altria’s stake in Juul.”Additional reporting by James Fontanella-Khan in New York
20;MO;Altria Group;2019-08-27T17:06:37Z;Philip Morris/Altria: smokin’;The case for re-unification lies in the push for tobacco alternatives;Smokers bond by huddling together against the cold and discussing how to quit. It is the same with tobacco companies such as Philip Morris International and Altria, corporate pariahs in a health-conscious world. On Tuesday, the groups said they were in talks to create a tobacco giant with a market value of more than $210bn. The merger proposal has merits for both sides.The case for re-unification — little more than ten years after the two companies separated — lies in the push for tobacco alternatives. Pooling resources to develop and market new products make sense.Philip Morris is known for its heat-not-burn product Iqos. These cigarette-like devices produce fewer harmful chemicals than cigarette smoke. They have have sold well in some markets, such as Japan. Meanwhile, Marlboro cigarette maker Altria owns a 35 per cent stake in vaping start-up Juul, bought for $12.8bn in December. In June it also acquired a majority stake in a Swiss maker of nicotine pouches. By joining forces, the combined company could benefit from marketing the full range of products globally.Altria spun off its international wing, bearing the name Philip Morris, more than a decade ago, partly as a response to shares trading at a discount to the sum of the company’s parts. That gambit was a damp squib. The two companies have a market value of nearly $220bn, more than a third higher than at the announcement of the split back in 2007. But that is less than the combined growth in operating earnings over the same period.Even so, re-combining carries risks to Philip Morris’s valuation, which might explain why its share price fell on Tuesday. Since the 2008 split, PMI has outperformed, benefiting from its international growth potential. The valuation gap may also have been widened by Altria's purchase of Juul, whose popularity with young people heightens regulatory risks.At the end of 2016 the two traded at a similar price to forward earnings multiple of around 14 times. By the middle of this month, before rumours of a merger, Philip Morris traded at a multiple half again as high. While regulatory risk and lower growth potential have depressed Altria's valuation, they have also created a buying opportunity. For Philip Morris, rewards and risks are stacked more evenly than they are for smokers.
21;MO;Altria Group;2019-04-30T18:57:59Z;FDA approves sale of Philip Morris IQOS heated tobacco devices;Decision will boost company’s push into ‘reduced risk’ products as cigarettes fall out of favour;Regulators have given Philip Morris International the go-ahead to sell its heated tobacco devices in the US, paving the way for the cigarette giant to compete with vaping start-up Juul for a slice of the fast-growing market for tobacco alternatives.In a long-awaited ruling, the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said it had given the IQOS product the green light after the company convinced officials it produced lower levels of toxins than traditional cigarettes.The approval will help build investor confidence that big tobacco can build profitable new businesses as health-conscious consumers reject traditional cigarettes at an accelerating rate. The industry is investing heavily in vaping and other devices to replace cigarettes.IQOS (pronounced eye-koss) are cigarette-like devices that heat, rather than burn, tobacco. Launched in Japan three years ago to initial success, they make up the main pillar of PMI’s push into so-called “reduced risk” products.André Calantzopoulos, PMI’s chief executive, said the decision was “an important step forward for the approximately 40 million American men and women who smoke”.The authorisation of new tobacco products doesn’t mean they are safeHe said: “Some will quit. Most won’t, and for them IQOS offers a smoke-free alternative to continued smoking.”The FDA has yet to allow IQOS to be marketed as safer than traditional cigarettes, however, tempering optimism for the ruling on Wall Street. For now, the product must adhere to the same strict regulatory standards as cigarettes.“The authorisation of new tobacco products doesn’t mean they are safe,” said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. He added the agency would be “keeping a close watch” on IQOS, including levels of usage among young people.IQOS will be marketed and distributed in the US by Altria, the US cigarette maker from which PMI was spun out more than a decade ago.The product will be rolled out initially in Atlanta, Georgia, as the companies seek to “learn as much as possible, as quickly as possible”, said Howard Willard, Altria’s chief executive. It would be sold at about 500 retailers in the city, including a dedicated store in the Lenox Square mall.The authorisation had come sooner than expected, said Chris Growe, analyst at Stifel. He expected the device to be sold for almost $70, a price that should prove prohibitive for teenagers.Under former head Scott Gottlieb, the FDA introduced restrictions on e-cigarettes to combat a surge in popularity among youngsters. Earlier this month, the agency said it was investigating whether the use of e-cigarettes increases the risk of seizures.Even so, Mr Zeller said on Tuesday the FDA recognised the potential for the new technology to “completely move adult smokers away from use of combustible cigarettes”.US-listed shares in Switzerland-based PMI rose 2 per cent on Tuesday and Altria was up 1.5 per cent.
22;MO;Altria Group;2019-04-22T11:54:07Z;Juul believes deal with Altria will hasten tobacco’s demise;Vaping company’s UK chief says he had reservations about tie-up with Marlboro maker;Few companies look to help another that would put them out of business.But that is what vaping start-up Juul claims Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, did when it took a 35 per cent stake in the company at the end of last year.“We’ve got the biggest manufacturer of cigarettes in America to hasten their own decline,” said Dan Thomson, managing director of Juul UK. “No one has ever done that.”As smoking declines in the west, multinational tobacco groups are seeking ways to counter their demise. Some have diversified into marijuana and drinks. Others have turned to e-cigarettes, which have eaten increasingly into Big Tobacco’s business.Juul’s vaping products dominate the US market for cigarette alternatives. The company, which now accounts for about 75 per cent of US e-cigarette sales, saw a 154 per cent increase in sales between 2017 and 2018, according to Nielsen data.The Altria deal, which valued Juul at $38bn, more than doubled the two-year-old company’s valuation at its previous funding round last summer. But Mr Thomson insists that “money was not the motivation” and that, given Juul’s mission to “end cigarette smoking”, he had serious reservations about tying up with a tobacco group.As part of the deal, Altria agreed to have Juul adverts in Marlboro packets, allow access to its customer database and give the vaping product a presence on Marlboro shelf space in US retailers.In December, Altria scrapped its own vaping products at a pre-tax cost of $200m, citing their “current and expected financial performance”.Howard Willard, Altria’s chairman and chief executive, said concerns around his company’s future profitability based on its investment in Juul were “overstated”.However, there are question marks over Juul’s own growth after it came under fire from the US Food and Drug Administration in January for targeting young people. The FDA has restricted sales of flavoured vaping products and threatened to ban all e-cigarettes if use among the young continues to rise.Analysts at Jefferies said they saw “increased risk” to Juul from FDA guidelines and noted that Juul volumes and share had seen two months of decline.Juul is now sold in nine markets outside the US. It launched in the UK last July, where Mr Thomson wants to position it as a health product. It retails in 270 Boots pharmacies and will launch in another 300 by the end of the month.The UK could be a lucrative market given the receptive public health atmosphere: Public Health England has backed vaping as a safer alternative to smoking.However, Mr Thomson said Juul would be more successful if EU restrictions on nicotine were loosened. In Europe, Juul pods contain 1.7 per cent nicotine as opposed to 5 per cent in the US, making them less addictive. But Mr Thomson argued that the US level was more effective for switching smokers.“It strikes me as a strange regulatory regime when you can have pretty much unlimited strength nicotine cigarettes and quite limited strength vaping products,” he said.However, Caroline Renzulli, of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said Juul’s move away from the youth market was “too little, too late”. She said the start-up had “zero credibility in claiming that it cares about public health” and that it did not change “until it had no choice”.
23;MO;Altria Group;2019-04-03T16:21:48Z;US cigarette sales drop as smokers shift to vaping;Sharp decline in volumes signals Big Tobacco’s challenge in adapting to new habits;The number of cigarette packs sold in the US dropped sharply in March, intensifying Wall Street concerns that smokers are stubbing out Big Tobacco’s core product at an accelerating pace as they shift to vaping.Sales volumes fell 8.8 per cent from a year ago in the four weeks to March 23, according to Nielsen data cited by Morgan Stanley. While price increases partly offset the impact on revenues, the decline exceeded an 8 per cent rate fall reported in February and a 5.3 per cent decrease in 2018.The figures are the latest sign of the pressures facing companies such as British American Tobacco and the Marlboro-maker Altria. The industry is investing heavily in ecigarettes and heated products, but still relies on revenues from regular cigarettes to support cash flow and dividend payouts.That strategy could be challenged by the escalating scrutiny on ecigarettes. US health officials have made clear the devices could help wean smokers off tobacco, but are worried the products could be hooking a new generation on nicotine. Ecigarette companies have already been told to stop marketing flavoured vaping products in stores in the US.On Wednesday the US Food and Drug Administration said it was also investigating whether there was a link between vaping and seizures, after 35 reported cases of seizures following ecigarette use between 2010 and early 2019.The regulatory crackdown has done little to curb the popularity of ecigarettes. The Nielsen figures showed continued strong growth in sales of products from Juul Labs, the ecigarette company that was valued at $38bn in December when Altria took a 35 per cent stake.Juul, which has argued that its ecigarettes are more effective than nicotine patches and other products in persuading smokers to switch from cigarettes, cited the data as evidence it was succeeding in its mission.“These changes in the US tobacco market are a testament to the success of Juul products in switching adult smokers off combustible cigarettes,” said Kevin Burns, Juul chief executive.Juul’s sales lept 154 per cent year-on-year, while its market share advanced from 6.2 per cent to 6.6 per cent over the course of the month.The Nielsen figures follow a forecast from Altria this year that the long-term decline in cigarette volumes was gathering pace.Billy Gifford, Altria’s chief financial officer, said at a conference that the volume decline had accelerated last year “outside of the 3-to-4 per cent historical range”. The company now expected volumes to fall at an average annual rate of 4-5 per cent over the next five years “as adult smokers continue to explore alternative tobacco categories”.Nielsen’s data track sales in only a minority of the US stores that sell cigarettes and have in the past shown larger declines than were subsequently reported by tobacco companies. Even so, analysts said they were a meaningful signal of a step-change in cigarette sales.Research this year by Pamela Kaufman, a Morgan Stanley tobacco analyst, showed that the correlation between rising sales of Juul’s products and falling cigarette sales had become far clearer in recent months.In a note to clients this week, Ms Kaufman said the Nielsen data showed Altria’s volumes in the most recent period had fallen 9.7 per cent against the same four weeks a year earlier.
24;MO;Altria Group;2019-04-03T14:17:23Z;FDA investigates possible seizure risk from vaping;;The US Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it is investigating whether the use of ecigarettes increases the risk of seizures, expanding the agency’s scrutiny of “vaping” among teens.FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb and principal deputy commissioner Amy Abernethy said in a statement they have reports indicating that some ecigarette users, “especially youth and young adults,” have experienced seizures. The FDA is aware of 35 reported cases of seizures following ecigarette use between 2010 and early 2019.“We believe these 35 cases warrant scientific investigation into whether there is in fact a connection,” Mr Gottlieb and Ms Abernethy said.Regulators have yet to determine if there’s a direct correlation between vaping and seizures. The FDA said it would conduct research into the risk of seizures and continue to investigate other potential health issues related to ecigarettes.“The FDA is committed to monitoring this issue closely and taking additional steps as necessary to protect the public, especially our nation’s youth, from the dangers of ecigarettes and other tobacco products,” they said.Shares in Altria, the Marlboro maker that owns a $12.8bn stake in ecigarette company Juul, were down 1.3 per cent following the announcement. British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International were also trading lower.News of the investigation into seizure risks comes at a time of heightened regulatory scrutiny of the growing ecigarette market. The FDA in September ordered five providers of ecigarettes to submit plans to reduce teen vaping. Meanwhile, city officials in San Francisco have proposed a ban on ecigarette sales until the FDA completes a health review.“We noted today’s FDA statement that since 2010 they have recorded 35 reports of seizures that mention e-cigarette use,” Juul said in a statement. “We have robust safety monitoring systems in place and will vigilantly monitor for any evidence of safety issues and work cooperatively with FDA as we continue to combat youth usage and eliminate cigarettes, the number one cause of preventable death in the world.”

Carlos Alberto da Veiga Sicupira, the Brazilian billionaire and one of the founders of 3G Capital, is also set to step down, to be replaced by his daughter Cecilia Sicupira.According to people familiar with the matter, the changes are intended to telegraph to shareholders that the brewer’s board is determined to reverse a period of steep share price declines. The maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois is struggling to pay down more than $100bn in debt racked up from acquisitions, and faces slowing demand for beer in its biggest market, the US. Mr Behring’s departure also shows the board wants to signal its distance from 3G Capital, whose founders were instrumental in turning AB InBev into the world’s largest brewer. 3G is renowned for its debt-fuelled dealmaking and ferocious cost-cutting, but the Brazilian-backed private equity group’s methods have fallen out of favour with investors lately with the implosion of packaged foodmaker Kraft Heinz. Mr Behring said: “I’ve decided to step down so I can devote more time to my roles as chairman of two publicly listed companies and managing partner at 3G Capital.”In a statement, AB InBev said the changes would be subject to approval at its annual shareholders’ meeting to be held on April 24.Mr Barrington has served on the AB InBev board since 2016 as a representative of Marlboro producer Altria, which has owned a 10.2 per cent stake since AB InBev took over SABMiller in 2016. At the time of the deal, AB InBev’s shares sat at roughly €114, but they have slumped to €74.30. AB InBev will have to change its bylaws to allow Mr Barrington to become chairman since under current rules only an independent director can serve in the role. He will replace Olivier Goudet, a managing partner at investment company JAB Holdings, who the Financial Times earlier reported was stepping down over concerns that JAB’s activities in beverages overlapped with AB InBev’s forays into non-alcoholic drinks.AB InBev’s 15-member board only has three independent directors, which is few for a company of its size. The board is under the sway of the powerful Brazilian and Belgian families — the former associated with 3G — who orchestrated a series of deals since the 1990s to create the current company. Together they own roughly 43 per cent of the company’s shares, through a vehicle known as Stichting Anheuser-Busch InBev and other entities acting in concert.Stéfan Descheemaeker, who is the chief executive of Nomad Foods and represents the Belgian families, will also leave the board. He will be replaced by Sabine Chalmers, who was chief legal officer at AB InBev for over a decade and is now general counsel at the UK telecoms group BT.Mr Goudet’s seat as an independent director will be filled by Xiaozhi Liu, an automobile industry executive from China. 
26;MO;Altria Group;2019-02-12T19:47:42Z;Altria’s $11.5bn bond sale meets strong investor demand;Tobacco giant will use proceeds to finance purchase of 35% stake in Juul Labs;Tobacco giant Altria Group locked in financing for its purchase of a 35 per cent stake in ecigarette maker Juul Labs on Tuesday, borrowing $11.5bn in a debt sale that highlighted the strong demand among investors for corporate bonds.The bond offering attracted around $50bn of investor orders, which helped Altria secure lower-than expected interest rates on its new debt, according to people with knowledge of the deal.The investment in Juul has been seen as one way for Marlboro cigarette-maker Altria to gain a foothold in a faster growing business as traditional tobacco sales decline.The strong demand for the new issuance is the latest sign of investor appetite in the bond market this year after prices tumbled in the fourth quarter.The age-old adage of not fighting the Fed is in full effect at this pointIt also underscored interest in lower quality triple-B rated debt, which sits just above the high-yield category and has been the focus of concern as companies have binged on cheap debt in recent years.The bond sale marks the second largest this year and the second large triple-B debt raising after Anheuser-Busch InBev raised $15.5bn last month.“A lot of investors were concerned about a deal like this,” said Hans Mikkelson, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “To see that it performed so well will provide a tailwind to the market.”Bond markets have abeen aided by a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve and expectations that interest rates are unlikely to rise this year.“The age-old adage of not fighting the Fed is in full effect at this point,” said John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill. “It’s been a strong start to the year.”The $11.5bn bond issue was spread across seven tranches, with maturities ranging from three to 40 years. The company said it would use the proceeds to pay off a short-term loan it initially used to finance the stake purchase, which had a 3.5 per cent interest rate and matured in December.Prices across all seven tranches tightened by five basis points from initial guidance — indicative of demand — but the company’s borrowing costs still rose compared with its other recent debt sales, according to people familiar with the bond sale. The 10-year tranche was issued with a spread above Treasuries of 215 basis points, higher than the 155 basis points paid in 2013.The investment in Juul valued the maker of vape pens at about $38bn, marking it one of Altria’s largest bets in decades. At the same time as it was negotiating with Juul, Altria was also at work on a deal with Canadian marijuana company Cronos. It ultimately agreed to purchase a 45 per cent stake in Cronos, worth about C$2.4bn, in a bid to further diversify its business away from tobacco.Brennan Clark, an analyst with rating agency S&P Global, said the deals with Juul and Cronos “could help offset the secular decline in Altria’s legacy tobacco business”. But he added that the investments would not “contribute meaningfully to Altria’s profits over the next few years”.
27;MO;Altria Group;2018-12-20T22:53:06Z;Marlboro maker raises eyebrows with Juul price tag;Altria pays $12.8bn for 35% of ecigarette group in ‘biggest investment in our history’;Altria raised eyebrows on Wall Street on Thursday after the New York-listed tobacco group that sells the Marlboro brand shelled out about $13bn for a stake in the ecigarette company Juul at an “unusually high” valuation.Juul’s 1,500 employees will share a $2bn bonus pool as a result of the deal, but Altria will cut an unspecified number of jobs in its own workforce to save $600m of expenses and offset some of the debt it is taking on to fund the deal.While broadly welcoming the strategic rationale — traditional cigarette sales are in terminal decline in the west and more consumers are adopting new technologies to help them quit — several analysts questioned the price and terms.Howard Willard, Altria’s chief executive, pitched the tie-up as a way to safeguard the company’s long-term future.“We have long said that providing adult smokers with superior, satisfying products with the potential to reduce harm is the best way to achieve tobacco harm reduction,” Mr Willard said. “Through Juul, we are making the biggest investment in our history toward that goal.”Altria will give Juul products shelf space alongside its combustible cigarettes, though flavoured products will only be available on Juul.com. It will also provide Juul with its logistics and distribution experience.The deal, which values Juul at $38bn, making it one of the world’s most valuable private companies, was completed on the same day it was announced, although it has yet to receive antitrust approval. Shares in Altria were down 2.7 per cent by early afternoon in New York, more than twice the decline in the wider market.The valuation was “unusually high”, said Christopher Growe, analyst at Stifel. “The price paid offsets most of the future potential benefit — if at all — from the addition of Juul,” he said.Mr Growe had expected a valuation lower even than the $16bn price tag put on Juul in a fundraising this summer.Altria is making the investment in spite of a regulatory crackdown on flavoured ecigarettes, which are blamed for getting a new generation addicted to nicotine.The US Food and Drug Administration’s head Scott Gottlieb is taking action to deal with what he has called “epidemic” levels of vaping by high school pupils. Juul, whose rapid expansion has made it a focus for the regulator, has pulled flavoured versions of its products from more than 90,000 retailers to comply.Nik Oliver, analyst at UBS, said he was “surprised by the valuation in light of the increased level of regulatory scrutiny on Juul”.Altria will be subject to a standstill agreement preventing the company from increasing its stake beyond 35 per cent or from selling Juul shares for six years from closing.“Given the strong performance of the business and its expected upside, we felt even without a pathway to control this was an attractive deal for us,” Mr Willard said.The tie-up was criticised by anti-nicotine campaigners. Kevin Burns, Juul’s chief executive, said he understood the “scepticism that comes with an affiliation and partnership with the largest tobacco company in the US. We were sceptical as well.”However, he added: “Over the course of the last several months we were convinced by actions, not words, that in fact this partnership could help accelerate our success switching adult smokers” from combustible products to ecigarettes.Altria would not say how many jobs were on the line under its internal cost-reduction plan, aimed at delivering annualised savings of about $500m-$600m by the end of 2019. It said it was “working through the process”.Meanwhile, Standard & Poor’s downgraded Altria’s credit rating from A minus to triple B in response to the Juul deal. The debt Altria was assuming to fund the purchase meant an “increase in leverage and a shift away from the company’s historically conservative financial policy”, the agency said, while Juul would not provide “significant near-term investment returns”.Altria’s latest investment outside traditional tobacco products comes just two weeks after it took a $1.8bn stake in Cronos, the Canadian marijuana company.The tobacco group financed the Juul deal through a $14.6bn term loan facility arranged by JPMorgan, of which $1.8bn may be used to finance investment in Cronos.Perella Weinberg Partners and JPMorgan Securities were financial advisers to Altria. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal counsel.Goldman Sachs served as financial adviser to Juul, while Pillsbury, Winthrop, Shaw, Pittman and Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton provided legal counsel.
28;MO;Altria Group;2018-12-20T16:56:22Z;Altria/Juul: vaped crusader;Tobacco group must reinvent itself so this deal has powerful logic;Juul likes to boast about its independence from the big tobacco groups. That claim now rings hollow. The ecigarette company is selling a 35 per cent stake for $12.8bn to Marlboro cigarette maker Altria. The deal involves big risks on both sides. These are worth taking.For Juul, the tie-up could worsen its standing with regulators. Stanford design graduates Adam Bowen and James Monsees founded the business with a grandiose mission to improve public health. That aspiration could be tarnished by teaming up with a company that gets 86 per cent of its revenues from tobacco. Juul has already had to take sweetly flavoured products off the shelves in response to regulators’ concerns about ecigarettes’ impact on adolescents. This week, the US surgeon general stepped-up warnings. Juul’s use of nicotine salts allows particularly high levels of the drug to be inhaled, he said.At least the deal’s high price tag will cushion Juul’s descent from the moral high ground. The risks are greater for Altria. If Juul’s spectacular growth — sales jumped 600 per cent last year — is halted by regulators, it will have paid too much for a business with an estimated $2bn of annual sales. The deal takes Altria’s debt to about 2.4 times ebitda, although a cost-cutting exercise will help offset the interest expense. Conversely, if Juul’s success continues, Altria is helping to undermine its own business. As well as providing funds, Altria will support Juul in marketing its products and taking up prized shelf-space in convenience stores.There remains a powerful logic to the deal even so. Altria is struggling to build its own smokeless products business. Its ecigarettes brands, MarkTen and GreenSmoke, are being discontinued after failing to compete against Juul’s intense hit and cool design. A further high may follow if cannabis becomes legal under federal law. Altria this month spent $1.8bn on buying a 45 per cent stake in Cronos Group, a Canadian cannabis business. While most marijuana users smoke it, vaping is on the rise.Altria deserves credit for its boldness. Fears about cannibalising an existing business often stop companies embracing new technology. But it is already clear that Altria has to reinvent itself. Shares are down almost 30 per cent over the past year. In the US, smoking has dropped to the lowest levels on record. For Altria, that trend is as deadly as its product. Doing nothing could be fatal.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

29;MO;Altria Group;2018-12-19T23:54:18Z;Juul valued at $38bn in deal with Altria;Tobacco group’s 35% stake in ecigarette maker will more than double its worth;Marlboro cigarette maker Altria is set to take a 35 per cent stake in Juul Labs in a deal that would value the ecigarette group at about $38bn and catapult it into the ranks of the world’s most valuable private companies, four people briefed on the terms said.Altria’s investment of about $13bn, which could be announced as early as Thursday morning, will more than double the $16bn valuation put on Juul in a fundraising this summer, a sign of how much big tobacco covets the fast-growing San Francisco company at a time when cigarette consumption is falling in developed markets.British American Tobacco, listed in London, was also interested in acquiring a stake in Juul but lost out to Altria, two people informed about the negotiations said.Altria has been keen to have the option of gaining a controlling stake in time, people briefed about the matter said, but with Juul’s leadership hoping to retain control, Altria agreed to a standstill agreement capping its stake at 35 per cent for a sustained period. When that standstill expires, any increase will be subject to agreement.Altria is assuming the risk of regulatory intervention in the deal, agreeing to no board representation or voting rights until it secures antitrust approval, after which it could have up to one-third of the seats on the Juul board.Juul, which was founded only three years ago, will now be worth more than S&P 500 stalwarts such as Prudential Financial, Ford and Delta Air Lines.Under a more traditional analysis the valuation seems nutsThe price tag is likely to surprise analysts who had broadly welcomed the prospect of a tie-up between the two companies but estimated that Altria would pay significantly less for a stake. Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo wrote in November that Altria could spend $4bn-$7bn for 30-40 per cent of Juul.Altria’s shares rose 1 per cent to $51.40 after the Wall Street Journal first reported details of the deal. They have fallen from above $65 since the start of November.The largest investors in Altria, which include Capital Group and Fidelity, were backing the transaction, said a banker close to one of Altria’s major shareholders.“Under a more traditional analysis the valuation seems nuts,” the person said. “But if you consider that regular tobacco sales are declining and Juul is the future it makes a ton of sense to buy a stake at these levels.”The deal was expected to include support from Altria in terms of securing shelf space at retail and advertising Juul’s products as alternatives for existing smokers looking to switch, one person briefed on the terms said. Altria this month announced it would discontinue its own e-vapour products, MarkTen and GreenSmoke, which have sold poorly.Juul has pitched itself as the most effective tool yet discovered for people looking to stop smoking combustible cigarettes, which are blamed for 8m deaths around the world each year.Altria is paying up for its Juul investment even though the ecigarette market has been threatened by Scott Gottlieb, head of the Food and Drug Administration. He is preparing to crack down on what he has called “epidemic” levels of underage vaping.A federally funded study by the University of Maryland reported this week that the number of high school students using ecigarettes doubled this year. One in five high school seniors told the researchers they had vaped nicotine in the previous month.The regulator’s plans would severely restrict the availability of flavoured ecigarettes to locations off limits to anyone under 21, upending Juul’s business model.Juul has pulled sweet flavours of its nicotine liquids from more than 90,000 retailers to comply, among a series of actions that analysts estimate could affect about half of its sales.In spite of the restrictions, new technologies such as ecigarettes are seen as the main way to safeguard big tobacco’s long-term future, as consumers avoid traditional cigarettes at an accelerating rate. Juul has seized three-quarters of the US ecigarette market since its 2015 launch.It is the latest investment by Altria, which this month took a $1.8bn stake in Cronos, the Canadian marijuana company, signalling the growing interest from consumer brands in the market for cannabis in North America, where decriminalisation is quickly spreading.Altria declined to comment. Juul did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Cronos will in turn become Altria’s “exclusive partner for pursuing cannabis opportunities throughout the world”.“Altria is the ideal partner for Cronos Group, providing the resources and expertise we need to meaningfully accelerate our strategic growth,” said Mike Gorenstein, Cronos’ chairman, president and chief executive. “The proceeds from Altria’s investment will enable us to more quickly expand our global infrastructure and distribution footprint, while also increasing investments in R&D and brands that resonate with our consumers.”Altria’s deal with Cronos comes as investors have piled into the sector amid a push to legalise cannabis. Canada became the largest country to completely legalise recreational pot use in October, and several US states, including California, have made similar legal changes.Earlier this year, Coca-Cola said it was examining the market for cannabis-related products. Corona beer maker Constellation Brands recently invested just under $4bn into Canadian cannabis group Canopy Growth, lifting its stake to 38 per cent.Like other big tobacco companies, Altria is under pressure to find new sources of growth as cigarette sales slow. While the industry has poured billions in recent years to develop alternative “reduced risk” tobacco products, take-up for these heated products has been slower than expected, with consumers preferring “vaping” instead.Altria has recently initiated talks to take a stake in Juul Labs, the $16bn ecigarette start-up that has seized three-quarters of the US vaping market since its launch in 2015.In a further sign that it plans to grow its presence in vaping through deals, Altria said in a separate announcement on Friday that it planned to discontinue the production and distribution of all MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vapor products and Verve oral nicotine products. The move will result in a one-time charge of $200m to the company’s fourth-quarter results.

Shares in Cronos, which grows and distributes cannabis, climbed 14 per cent in New York on Monday to $10.39, giving the Canadian company a market capitalisation of $1.9bn.Cronos said in a statement after the market closed that it was “engaged in discussions concerning a potential investment” by Altria.The statement added: “No agreement has been reached with respect to any such transaction and there can be no assurance such discussions will lead to an investment or other transaction involving the companies.”The talks, first reported by Reuters, come as investors have piled into the sector; Canada became the largest country to completely legalise recreational pot use in October, and several US states, including California, have made similar legal changes.The beer and spirits maker Constellation Brands earlier this year pumped almost $4bn into Canopy Growth, another large Canadian pot group, while rival Aurora Cannabis in May struck a $2bn deal to buy the medical marijuana group MedReleaf. Deals worth more than $10bn have been agreed so far this year, up more than sevenfold from 2017, according to data from Dealogic.Other large consumer companies have also been eyeing the cannabis sector as decriminalisation of the drug spreads across North America and western Europe.Coca-Cola, the world largest beverage maker, has held talks with Canada’s Aurora to develop beverages, while Altria has also held talks with Tilray and Aphria. Diageo, the drinks group behind Johnny Walker whisky, has also been exploring investment opportunities in the sector, according to people close to the company.Cannabis has been legalised in Canada and in more than half of America’s 50 states, although it remains an illegal substance under US federal law. Spending on cannabis is expected to climb to $32bn by 2022* from $9.5bn last year, according to analysts with ArcView and BDS Analytics.The series of talks come as Washington undertakes a wide-ranging crackdown on tobacco and ecigarettes as concerns mount that a new generation is getting addicted to nicotine.Altria is also seeking to acquire a stake in Juul Labs, the ecigarette start-up valued at $16bn that has seized three-quarters of the US vaping market since its launch in 2015. It is looking to take a 40 per cent stake in Juul, with an option to take full control at a later stage, according to several people close to Altria.The US Food and Drug Administration is planning to ban menthol cigarettes and flavoured cigars, and also severely restrict the availability of flavoured ecigarettes to locations that are off limits to anyone under 21.The industry’s main product, meanwhile, is declining in the west at an accelerating rate. Cigarette volumes are expected to decline by about 4.2 per cent in the US this year, according to Wells Fargo forecasts, a slightly faster rate than the average for recent years.Shares in Altria, listed in New York with a market capitalisation of $105bn, have fallen 14 per cent in the past month.Altria did not respond to a request for comment.*This story has been amended since initial publication to note that cannabis spending is expected to reach $32bn by 2022."

33;MO;Altria Group;2018-11-29T20:18:16Z;Altria/Juul: vape fear;Tobacco is suddenly a growth industry;The future of smoking may soon involve crème brûlée and cucumber. These are two of the non-traditional flavours offered by Juul Labs, the red-hot ecigarette start-up most recently valued at $16bn. Altria, the tobacco juggernaut behind Marlboro, has seen its shares fall by nearly a fifth in recent weeks. One reason: vaping is quickly catching on particularly with young Americans, replacing cigarettes.Now Altria is looking to buy a big chunk of Juul to stay ahead of changing consumer tastes. But for a company whose financial success has been built on discipline amid persistent regulatory pressure, investing in a both pricey and risky start-up is a radical departure.Retail sales data from Nielsen showed that October cigarette volumes fell by a sharp 8 per cent from a year earlier. At the same time, the Food and Drug Administration, the primary US regulator, wants to ban menthol cigarettes. It also seeks to restrict sweet flavours of e-cigs at physical retail outlets to discourage underage vaping. Juul itself has voluntarily agreed to abide by regulations that would steer e-cig purchases to its website, where age verification is stricter.Wells Fargo estimates that Juul’s annual revenue is roughly $2bn. But analysts worry about the valuation Altria will pay given the intensifying regulatory response to vaping. Altria’s leverage of just over one times net debt to ebitda is modest. It can afford to spend a few billion on Juul. Yet Altria’s business model consists of wringing out earnings per share growth of 10 per cent annually, even as revenue declines. Its high profit margins and good cash flow conversion translate into relatively high dividends (its yield has risen to six per cent) and share buybacks.Altria shareholders were not, however, spooked by the reports of a potential Juul investment. The company’s share price rose four per cent. Altria rightly wants to avoid the fate of other consumer companies which have not quickly caught on to changing trends, regardless of taste.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

The latest negotiations occurred after the FDA made an unannounced on-site visit to Juul Labs last month.The cigarette maker has the backing of several key investors to carry out a deal that would eventually give it control of Juul, two of the people said.A deal will only happen if Altria has a path to control, said a person who had spoken to several large investors in the tobacco company.A spokesperson for Juul declined to comment. A spokesperson for Altria said the company did not comment on “rumours and speculation”.Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate that US ecigarette sales have grown from $2.5bn in 2012 to $4.4bn in 2017, and will reach $5.5bn this year. Traditional tobacco companies have poured billions of dollars into developing alternatives to combustible cigarettes but have watched their share of this new market dwindle as Juul has grown.Analysts are looking closely at data suggesting a recent lurch down in tobacco sales to understand whether it is a sign of a lasting shift. Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo, wrote in a note on Tuesday that she was “disappointed and somewhat mystified” by the magnitude of the 8.7 per cent decline in cigarette volumes reported in the latest weekly data from Nielsen. Marlboro’s trends showed signs of stabilising, she added.The same data showed a 197 per cent surge in ecigarette volumes, led by Juul, which now claims a 76 per cent share of the market.After news of the talks emerged, Ms Herzog welcomed the prospect of a deal. Altria could afford to spend $4bn to $7bn for a 30-40 per cent stake at this stage, she estimated.Juul could “round out Altria’s reduced-risk strategy” and give it exposure to markets outside the US, she said, while Altria could help Juul navigate regulatory challenges and “catapult” its international growth.Juul, with about 1,000 people, was valued at $16bn in a funding round this summer which featured investors including Tiger Global, the New York hedge fund and venture investor. Its pitch to investors, regulators and consumers has been that its products are a far more effective means for the world’s 1bn smokers to switch from combustible cigarettes which are blamed for 8m deaths a year.Juul moved to get ahead of the FDA crackdown on ecigarettes by pulling sales of flavours of its nicotine liquids from more than 90,000 convenience stores, shutting down its social media accounts and bringing in Bluetooth-based technology to help track where its devices are sold.Analysts estimated that limiting flavours such as mango to online sales and shops that can verify that customers are at least 21 years old could affect half of Juul’s sales. But it is not yet clear whether consumers will switch to the menthol, tobacco and mint-flavoured ecigarettes which remain widely available, or turn to buying Juul’s flavoured products online.The talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
35;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
36;MO;Altria Group;2018-10-25T14:49:58Z;Marlboro maker to pull ecigarette pods from market;Move comes as US drugs watchdog scrutinises spread of underage vaping;Altria, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, is to stop selling most flavoured vaping products in the US, warning it needed to take “rapid action” in the face of a regulatory crackdown on devices seen as the future for big tobacco.The New York-listed company disclosed the plans on Thursday after the US Food and Drug Administration threatened an outright ban on flavoured nicotine products to combat what it describes as “epidemic” levels of teenage vaping.While Altria’s products represent a small proportion of the ecigarette market, which is dominated by the start-up Juul Labs, the move underlines the new regulatory threat to an industry whose traditional offering is in terminal decline in the west.Tobacco companies have been investing heavily in new technology to safeguard the industry’s longer-term future, saying the emerging products are safer than traditional cigarettes. But health campaigners warn they could get a new generation hooked.The FDA said last month it was investigating whether ecigarettes were being deliberately targeted at underage smokers. It said on Thursday: “The agency has taken a number of steps to address the growing epidemic of youth ecigarette use and will be taking additional action very soon.”Having met Scott Gottlieb, FDA commissioner, officials at Altria decided to take “immediate action to address this complex situation”, said Howard Willard, chief executive.He said that Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris US, still believed e-vapour had a “lot of opportunity” to convert cigarette smokers. “But clearly the significant increase in youth usage of the products puts that at risk, and we think a rapid and significant action is necessary.”Altria said it would pull from the market the pod-based products MarkTen Elite, which is available in almost 25,000 stores across the US, and Apex by MarkTen, which is sold online. The company would not begin selling them again until it had received guidance from the FDA on how to market them, or “the youth issue is otherwise addressed”.Even so, Altria said 80 per cent of its third-quarter ecigarette volume would remain on the US market. These will only be available in tobacco, menthol and mint flavours. All other flavours will be discontinued.Pod-based ecigarettes have been criticised for being stronger and more comparable to traditional combustible cigarettes in the speed they deliver nicotine hits. Critics have also alleged the wide range of flavours they are available in, such as strawberry and bubblegum, makes them attractive to children.Ecigarettes are of growing financial importance to big tobacco. In the first nine months of 2018 Altria’s sales fell 1 per cent to $19.3bn, as lower revenues from “smokable products” were partially offset by a better performance from “smokeless” alternatives.Juul, which controls around 70 per cent of the US ecigarette market, was asked by the FDA earlier this year to hand over documents about its marketing practices. In October, the FDA collected more than 1,000 pages of documents in a surprise inspection of the company’s office.Philip Morris USA is ready to roll out its heated tobacco device, IQOS, upon FDA approval, which is pending, the company added.
37;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Tobacco stocks fall after Jefferies revises outlook;;Tobacco giants, Philip Morris and Altria Group were trading lower after Jefferies downgraded the stocks and predicted slower adoption of “reduced risk” tobacco products than previously forecasted. The move also weighed on their rivals.Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett, revised down projections for so-called reduced risk tobacco products, to 41 per cent of market share globally, compared with previous predictions of 61 per cent in the US and 51 per cent overseas.Mr Bennet also downgraded Philip Morris and Altria to “hold”, while reaffirming British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands as a “buy”, as the tobacco industry contends with a shift in consumer preferences away from traditional cigarettes in favour of “vaping”.Philip Morris shares were down 3 per cent, just after noon in New York on Friday, while Altria was down 1.5 per cent. UK-listed Imperial Brands was down 1.5 per cent and British American Tobacco was down 3.4 per cent after the close of markets in London.Mr Bennett said he previously believed that “heated” products would appeal to the majority of smokers, but now sees a slower adoption of heated products, pointing to consumer preference for vapour.BAT has the first-mover advantage in the US vapour market, Mr Bennet wrote in the report, and noted that Imperial Brands is also well positioned for vapour share.Philip Morris, on the other hand, faces longer term pressure on total tobacco volume due to consumer preferences for vapour, Mr Bennett said, adding the company has seen significant share loss in the Japanese market.Altria Group also faces share pressures, and is at a disadvantage in the vapour market, due to available formats and concerns around a delay on approval of IQOS, a tobacco heating system, Mr Bennet wrote.Jefferies predicts vapour making up 54 per cent of initial launch markets in the US by 2026, and 62 per cent outside of the US by that date. That’s up from Jefferies previous predictions of 40 per cent and 36 per cent. That prediction is supportive of British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands, but bad news for Philip Morris, Mr Bennet wrote.All of these companies compete with Juul, the San Francisco-based vaping start-up, which has grown in popularity, but is currently under scrutiny by regulators.
38;MO;Altria Group;2018-07-10T18:33:13Z;Vape start-up Juul raises $650m at $15bn valuation;Ecigarette maker spun out only last year worth half market cap of big tobacco group Imperial;Juul Labs, the San Francisco-based ecigarette company, has closed on the first $650m of a $1.25bn funding round, new regulatory filings show. The equity fundraising, led by New York-based hedge fund and venture investor Tiger Global, values Juul at $15bn, according to people familiar with the deal. The valuation for Juul, which spun out of its former parent Pax Labs to become an independent company just last year, is half the market capitalisation of 117-year-old tobacco group Imperial Brands, which owns Gauloises, Golden Virginia and Rizla. Juul’s plans to raise a total of $1.25bn in new funding, first reported by Bloomberg and The Information, were confirmed in a Form D regulatory filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Juul declined to comment beyond the filing. Directors named on the filing include San Francisco real estate billionaire Nicholas Pritzker, Riaz Valani of private equity firm Global Asset Capital and Kevin Burns, the former chief operating officer of yoghurt company Chobani who joined Juul as chief executive in December. After launching its compact $35 vaporisers in 2015, Juul has quickly established itself as the dominant brand in the US market, particularly among younger vapers, and is experiencing breakneck growth, analysts say. Recent research from Wells Fargo, based on Nielsen data, found that Juul’s sales grew by almost 800 per cent over the past year. Juul holds more than two-thirds of the US ecigarette market by sales, leaving traditional tobacco companies such as Imperial, Altria and British American Tobacco trailing far behind.The surge in popularity has attracted regulatory scrutiny. This year the US Food and Drug Administration launched a crackdown on ecigarette sales to minors, which focused on Juul’s products. The regulator also wrote to Juul demanding details about its marketing strategy and the health effects of its products to “better understand . . . the particular youth appeal of these products”. Some parents have complained that the company is targeting children with its flavoured nicotine capsules. In April, Juul said it would invest $30m over the next three years in research and education, as well as campaigning to raise the minimum age for purchasing tobacco products to 21. “Our company’s mission is to eliminate cigarettes and help the more than 1bn smokers worldwide switch to a better alternative,” Mr Burns said in a statement at the time. “At the same time, we are committed to deterring young people, as well as adults who do not currently smoke, from using our products.” Juul’s financing comes as ecigarettes and vaporisers, the vast majority of which are made in Shenzhen, China, face a new threat of higher import duties. The devices are among a second tranche of Chinese imports that the Trump administration has proposed could be hit with a 25 per cent tariff, alongside electric bikes and e-scooters.This article as been amended to correct Kevin Burns’ title at Chobani.
39;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Altria creates new ‘core’, ‘innovative’ tobacco units;;Altria is hoping to light a fire under its efforts to diversify away from traditional tobacco products, announcing on Tuesday that it was creating two new divisions — one for “core” tobacco like cigarettes, and a separate unit for “innovative” products like vaping devices, as smokers increasingly seek out less harmful options.Altria said that its new “core” division will comprise cigarette maker Philip Morris USA, pipe tobacco and cigar company John Middleton, snuff maker US Smokeless Tobacco Co and Nat Sherman, and its line of premium cigarettes and cigars. The new unit will be headed by Jody Begley, who has held various roles at the company, most recently as president and general manager of Altria’s innovation company Nu Mark.The new “innovative” division will focus on non-combustible products seen as healthier alternatives like nicotine-containing oral products, e-vapour and other inhalable products. The new division will be led by Brian Quigley, currently president and chief executive of US Smokeless Tobacco Company.Additionally, Altria said it was creating a new position — chief growth officer — to help identify and act on strategically important priorities. It has appointed K.C. Crosthwaite — president and chief executive of Philip Morris USA — to the role.Altria chairman and chief executive Howard Willard said in a statement:“This is a dynamic time in the tobacco industry, and just as we lead in traditional tobacco products, we intend to lead in offering adult smokers more choices in innovative, non-combustible, reduced-risk products. We expect this new structure to accelerate our innovation pipeline, maximise our core tobacco businesses and allow us to continue to reward shareholders.”Even as they come under heavy fire from health authorities around the world, tobacco giants like Altria have been well-loved for years by Wall Street for paying fat dividends. As cigarette smoking starts to taper off, these companies are looking for new revenue streams, including alternative “smokeless” devices like the IQOS, which its maker Philip Morris claims is healthier because it heats tobacco rather than burn it.Altria and Philip Morris International have teamed up to bring the IQOS device to market and have sought the US Food and Drug Administration’s permission to market it as a reduced-risk product.Altria shares, which were up just 5 per cent last year, are down 22.5 per cent so far in 2018.
40;MO;Altria Group;2018-04-19T20:58:40Z;Philip Morris warning damps tobacco shares;Stock down 16% as results raise alarm over ecigarette and vaping strategy;Investors stubbed out shares in the world’s largest tobacco companies on Thursday after Philip Morris International warned that alternative devices may take more time to be embraced by consumers turning away from cigarettes. Philip Morris, the biggest listed tobacco company, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, fell 15.6 per cent, the worst day for its shares since becoming a public company in 2008, wiping $24.5bn from its market valuation. British American Tobacco slipped 5.4 per cent and Altria shares dropped 6.0 per cent. As more health-conscious consumers abandon traditional cigarettes, Big Tobacco has turned to ecigarettes, vaping and substitute devices in search of growth. However, Thursday’s results raised alarm bells over the strategy after a weak showing in markets such as Japan — which had been among Philip Morris’s most promising prospects.Japan has emerged as a battleground between tobacco companies that have used technology to develop alternatives to conventional cigarettes which the companies say are less harmful.The new generation come in two main varieties — ecigarettes which turn a nicotine-laced fluid into a vapour, and “heat not burn” devices that turn tobacco into a vapour, but do not burn it. Ecigarettes are banned in Japan but not the latter.Investors soured on tobacco stocks despite Philip Morris saying shipments of heated tobacco units more than doubled from a year ago but were down from the December quarter. In East Asia and Australia, which makes up three-fourths of Philip Morris’s heated tobacco volumes, the company shipped 7.3bn units, which was nearly 4bn shy of forecasts by analysts at Cowen & Company. Cowen said the result “seems to reflect a maturation in consumption in Japan”.André Calantzopoulos, chief executive of Philip Morris, admitted sales of its heated devices in Japan grew “less-rapidly than initially projected”. “We are now reaching more conservative adult smoker segments that may require, at least at first, slightly more time for adoption,” he said. Morgan Stanley said the comment “marks a noteworthy shift in tone” while Citi analysts said that as recently as [February] management was sounding extremely bullish. “Now we hear demand growth is slowing in Japan . . . this is much more important than the cut in the tax rate guidance.”However, Bonnie Herzog at Wells Fargo said it is just “entering a more mature phase” and this “doesn’t detract from its strong growth prospects globally”.Philip Morris has touted a “smoke-free future” with its so-called IQOS devices. However, the company is still awaiting a decision from the US Food and Drug Administration after the regulator in January rejected its claim that IQOS tobacco heating devices were less risky than cigarettes.Philip Morris’s cigarette shipments fell 5.3 per cent in the quarter. Revenues rose 13.7 per cent from a year ago to $6.9bn, shy of analyst expectations for $7.03bn, while net earnings fell to $1 a share, topping estimates for 90 cents.
41;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Philip Morris, Altria hit by FDA advisory panel ruling on IQOS devices;Shares stabilise after an initial 5% stumble;Shares of Philip Morris International and Altria Group took a hit after a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel rejected Philip Morris’s proposed claim that its IQOS tobacco heating devices present less of a health risk than the traditional version.The findings of the independent panel could feed into a two-day FDA meeting due to conclude on Thursday, which could have wide-reaching implications for tobacco companies and public health writ large.Philip Morris contends its IQOS device, which heats tobacco rather than burning it, reduces most of the health concerns surrounding traditional cigarettes. Accordingly, the company has been seeking FDA approval in an attempt to market them as a safer alternative to cigarettes.The panel said on Thursday that Philip Morris had not shown that reductions in exposure to harmful chemicals are reasonably likely to translate into a measurable and substantial reduction in morbidity or mortality, Reuters reported. But the panel did support the company’s proposed claim its IQOS devices reduce exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals for those smokers who completely switch over from traditional products.The FDA may or may not follow the advisory panel’s finding.That mixed bag of rulings initially saw Philip Morris shares tumble as much as 6.9 per cent before stabilising 2.5 per cent lower at $107.86. Altria – which operates in the US through its Philip Morris USA subsidiary, the maker of Marlboro – was down 1.7 per cent at $70.38 after earlier falling as much as 5.5 per cent.FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb last year flagged the government agency would reconsider its tobacco policies, noting the role that “less harmful” tobacco products could play in reducing the death toll from cigarettes, and attempt to push smokers toward such alternatives.
42;MO;Altria Group;2017-09-19T04:01:54Z;Big tobacco sends out smoke-free signal;US crackdown adds urgency to improving meagre sales of alternatives to cigarettes;Can big tobacco quit smoking? After years of cigarette makers trumpeting their progress in building “reduced risk” alternatives, the US Food and Drug Administration’s July announcement that it aims to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes has injected urgency to the quest.So much so that Debra Crew, chief executive of Reynolds American, the second-largest American tobacco company, compares the challenge to the US space mission of the 1960s. “If we can put a man on the moon, we can deliver tobacco to people with less risk than smoking,” Ms Crew told her peers at an industry conference last week. Hours earlier, Philip Morris, maker of Marlboros, promised to spend $1bn to wean people off cigarettes. To the big tobacco executives gathered at the annual conference in New York, the message was clear.The FDA’s initiative could be the largest effort to curb smoking since 1965, when president Lyndon Johnson signed legislation requiring cigarettes to be labelled with health warnings. The news was perhaps deepest felt at London-listed British American Tobacco, the world’s largest tobacco group, which had just acquired Reynolds American for $49bn, buying its way back into the $130bn US market after a decade absence. The deal closed just three days before the FDA announcement, making the US its largest market. If they try to reduce nicotine levels to a very low amount . . . I think they’ll encounter a stiff wind in the face through the courtsKingsley Wheaton, BAT’s director of “next generation” products, says he was “not surprised” by the FDA’s announcement, which swiftly wiped about $10bn from BAT’s market value. “Was I surprised that it came at 3pm on a Friday afternoon?Maybe. But I wasn’t particularly surprised with the content,” he said in an interview, calling the market moves an “overreaction”. BAT, along with rivals such as Philip Morris, is in a race to offset shrinking cigarette sales with a new generation of products. These alternatives come in two main categories: ecigarettes, which turn a nicotine-laced fluid into a vapour, and “heat not burn” devices that turn tobacco into a vapour, but do not burn it. Tobacco companies have poured billions into development and marketing of these new products, with some success. Philip Morris in its most recent quarter reported that its IQOS “smokeless cigarette”, which heats tobacco in a handheld device, had sold enough to offset a 25 per cent drop in conventional cigarette sales in Japan. The company says it has invested $3bn since 2008 on smoke-free products, which it hopes will account for more than 30 per cent of production by 2025. “They have been trying to hedge their bets and cultivate new markets to save their business,” says Marc Scheineson, who worked on tobacco regulation as an associate commissioner for the FDA, and is now a partner at law firm Alston & Bird.But tobacco companies still derive the majority of sales from traditional cigarettes. Only 9 per cent of Philip Morris’s $6.9bn of revenues in the second quarter came from “reduced risk products”, and much of that came just from Japan. BAT has in the past six years spent $1.5bn on next gen products, yet it still declines to give revenue figures for them. Mr Wheaton says new products such as ecigarettes have a “public perception” problem, particularly in the US. A third of Americans last year said ecigarettes were just as bad as tobacco cigarettes, and 60 per cent said ecigarettes should be regulated as much as tobacco cigarettes. “We’ve seen perception [of vapour and heating products] in the US dwindle,” he says, blaming “sensational headlines” and bad marketing. “There are a lot of commercial questions still. Next gen products need to be profitable. This is not just an altruistic journey.”The FDA has not specified how much it aims to trim the nicotine levels from cigarettes, and is currently soliciting comments on what to do. The industry is expected to put up a lobbying fight, and perhaps launch litigation. “If they try to reduce nicotine levels to a very low amount . . . I think they’ll encounter a stiff wind in the face through the courts,” says Mr Scheineson. Mr Wheaton says it’s “quite possible” to trim US nicotine levels “a little bit”, noting that about half of cigarettes sold to Americans have 12mg of tar and 1.2mg of nicotine, while European cigarettes are capped at 10mg of tar and 1mg of nicotine.Still, “it’s not the nicotine that’s bad for you,” he argues, warning of a “large rise in illicit trade” as an unintended consequence of cutting nicotine.The public health debate over whether less nicotine will yield a reduction in smoking has been at a “complete and total stalemate” for decades, said Mitch Zeller, an FDA director, this week.There is also a question of whether investors can be convinced that American smokers will finally make the switch. In the past 20 years tobacco stocks have “significantly and consistently outperformed the broader market” despite a string of class action lawsuits and regulatory threats, said analysts at RBC. “But this time could be different.” This latest regulatory shock may not provide the same kind of lucrative buying opportunity as in the past, they said. Investors appear to agree. Eight weeks after the FDA unveiled its plans, the stock prices of the largest tobacco companies have not recovered. BAT had dropped about 11 per cent to 4,741p a share at the end of last week, while Philip Morris is down 2 per cent and Altria has lost 16 per cent.
43;MO;Altria Group;2017-07-31T10:33:55Z;Tobacco: smoke signals;Nicotine regulation may never happen, while ecigarette news is positive;"The Trump administration is making little legislative headway. But it can at least slash regulations with gusto. Surprising, then, that a government that has rolled back rules on power plant emissions should propose new ones on personal lung pollution.Shares in Altria have fallen 9 per cent and British American Tobacco by 7 per cent since the Food and Drug Administration said it aimed to reduce nicotine in cigarettes to lessen their addictive properties, while supporting new safer alternatives.The sell-off was not universal, however. Philip Morris International shares, after a brief dip in sympathy with the sector, ended up in positive territory on Friday. PMI, which sells Marlboro internationally after its spin-off from Altria in 2008, has an advantage; the Switzerland-based company can dodge the rules thanks to its focus outside the US. BAT, however, paid $49bn in January for the remaining stake in Reynolds American, maker of Newports and Camel.Yet the US is not such a hostile place for Big Tobacco. Altria’s sell-off, which went as far as 19 per cent at one stage on Friday, looks exaggerated. Even as the number of smokers in the US has continued to fall, industry revenues have risen thanks to higher prices. Last year volume sales fell 2 per cent to 263.4bn cigarettes, while the value rose 1 per cent to $94.4bn, according to Euromonitor International. BAT’s bet is still good. Of course the industry remains vulnerable to government intervention. But there is a long way to go before any new restrictions are implemented. The permissive attitude to ecigarettes, the other side of the proposal, is more likely to stick. All should benefit — but none more so than PMI, which possesses one of the most promising ecigarettes. Even before Friday, Wells Fargo estimated it would be enough to reverse declining revenues and more than double earnings growth. Rather than bask in its remoteness from the US, it can seize the moment."

The move would affect approximately 3,300 jobs, it said.The announcement came as Starbucks came in shy of analysts’ targets for comparable-store sales growth, a key industry metric, for the quarter ending July 2.Global comparable sales increased just 4 per cent versus the 4.8 per cent expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Comparable sales growth in the Americas, Starbucks’ biggest market, rose 5 per cent.It underscored concerns about Starbucks’ sales growth, even as it looks to inject some momentum by expanding its global footprint beyond its home country.On Thursday, Starbucks announced that it had paid $1.3bn to buy out the remaining 50 per cent that it did not own of its East China venture — its largest single acquisition — which will give it full ownership of 1,300 stores in its fastest-growing market outside of the US.“Starbucks leveraged food and beverage innovation, an elevated in-store experience and personalised digital connections to our customers to deliver another quarter of record financial and operating performance, despite the softness impacting our principal sectors overall,” said Kevin Johnson, who replaced Starbucks co-founder Howard Schultz as chief executive in December.Philip Morris International, which sells the brands outside the US, fell 7.5 per cent before bouncing back to end the day 0.3 per cent up at $118.51 in New York.The FDA announced a regulatory plan to stub out tobacco related disease, including lowering the amount of nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels.“Although the announcement’s timing was unexpected this morning, we’ve long believed the FDA taking a more comprehensive approach toward nicotine was a natural next step,” said Bonnie Herzog at Wells Fargo Securities.“Overall, while viewed as a ‘negative’ for cigarette manufacturers, we believe this could prove to be an opportunity over the long term for reduced-risk products.”The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.1 per cent at 2,472, the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged up 0.2 per cent to 21,830 while the Nasdaq Composite moved 0.1 per cent lower to 6,374.

The gains also pushed the index back into positive territory for the week, putting it up 1.16 per cent on the back of strong earnings from corporate stalwarts like aerospace company Boeing and a return to profitability for oil giant Chevron.Substantial drops in shares of tobacco company Altria, e-retailer Amazon and coffee chain Starbucks pushed the S&P 500 to an 0.13 per cent decline on Friday to 2,472.1. The healthcare sector led the benchmark index with an 0.5 per cent increase, while consumer staples were the biggest loser thanks to Altria’s 9 per cent fall after the FDA said it was considering limits on the level of addictive nicotine in cigarettes.Despite setting a fresh closing high on Wednesday, the S&P 500 has fallen over the latter half of the week to push it just barely into the red for the past five days, at an 0.02 per cent decline, to snap its three-week winning streak.The Nasdaq went from setting a fresh closing high on Wednesday to falling over the latter half of the week thanks to a sharp sell-off for tech stocks on Thursday. The tech-heavy index extended the slump on Friday, closing down 0.12 per cent at 6,374.67.

Revenue also increased 2.2 per cent to $6.7bn.Both metrics were ahead of analyst expectations of 87 cents per share and sales of $5.02bn.Altria said its MarkTen e-vapor product was now the number two brand nationally, representing 13 per cent of the retail market share. It also reiterated plans to sell Philip Morris International’s modified-risk tobacco product IQOS, pending FDA approval.The results came one day after rival Reynolds American was formally folded into British American Tobacco to create the world’s largest listed tobacco company by sales. While shares in Altria have gained 6.5 per cent in the year, BAT, in contrast, has gained 15 per cent.Analysts have warned Altria has not embraced e-cigarettes and other alternative smoking products to the same extent as some of its peers. However efforts to expand operating margins, including the consolidations some of its manufacturing facilities, has kept the company afloat, even after a voluntary product recall last quarter of certain smokeless tobacco products.The company also reaffirmed its 2017 full-year guidance. It continues to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.32.

AB InBev plans to slash 3 per cent of the combined workforce, or 5,500 people, a person with knowledge of its strategy said.“The business model will be supported by strict financial discipline regarding the generation and use of cash underpinned by AB InBev’s powerful ‘Dream, People Culture’ platform,” the shareholder documents said. They added: “The dream is to be ‘the Best Beer Company Bringing Together People for a Better World’.”The deal for SABMiller is intended to let AB InBev strengthen its grip on the Latin American market and expand its business in Africa. Those markets have not been disrupted by a shift in consumer taste towards craft beers and continue to see strong growth in consumption volumes.The bulk of the deal-related payments — $1.74bn — will be incurred by AB InBev, including roughly $475m in stamp duty to HM Revenue & Customs. But the remainder of fees from both sides is set to go to banks and professional service companies.The business model will be supported by strict financial discipline regarding the generation and use of cash underpinned by AB InBev’s powerful ‘Dream, People Culture’ platformLazard, lead adviser to AB InBev, will be chief among the banks splitting $135m for providing financial and broking advice to the Belgian-Brazilian brewer, alongside Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Bank of America and Standard Bank.AB InBev will pay a further $725m in fees to its financing banks, which helped the company raise $46bn in debt in January — the second-biggest bond deal ever — to pay for the deal. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer will receive the largest slice of the $185m in fees that AB InBev is set to pay to several law firms. The deal faced competition reviews in multiple countries and included a number of divestments.Public relations company Brunswick is set to net $20m in fees for its work, while accountants will make $15m from AB InBev. Lastly, $180m in payments has been earmarked for management consultants and other service providers.On the SABMiller side, financial advisers led by London-based boutique Robey Warshaw will receive $113m for their work with the target company, alongside JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners. Law firms led by Linklaters will share $76m in payments for their work, while public relations adviser Finsbury will be paid $9m. Accountants and other fees will cost $4m.Last month SABMiller’s board backed a revised offer from AB InBev, which largely quelled shareholder unrest over the takeover. Investors must choose to either accept a cash payment of £45 a share or a small cash payment along with AB InBev stock that will not be listed for five years.$475mAB InBev stamp duty payment to HM Revenue & CustomsThe move came after some investors complained that the partial share offer had become superior to the cash offer and was designed to favour SABMiller’s two largest shareholders, US tobacco company Altria and the holding company of Colombia’s Santo Domingo family, BevCo.A plunge in sterling following June’s Brexit vote, and gains in AB InBev’s share price, led to the cash portion of the deal becoming worth about 15 per cent less than the partial share alternative.

48;MO;Altria Group;2016-07-29T19:09:05Z;SABMiller board backs AB InBev’s revised £79bn offer;World’s biggest brewer is set to extend its global reach with third-biggest deal in history;SABMiller’s board has backed a revised £79bn takeover bid by Anheuser-Busch InBev, paving the way for the world’s biggest brewer to extend its global reach and seal the third-biggest corporate takeover in history.Its decision largely puts to rest fears among some investors that the deal might collapse because of a divergence between two alternative offers to SABMiller investors.After a six-hour meeting on Friday, the SAB board said it intended to recommend AB InBev’s revised cash offer of £45 a share, up from £44, which it tabled on Tuesday.But it also said it intended to recommend to a UK court that its two largest shareholders — Altria, the US tobacco company and BevCo, the family investment vehicle of Colombia’s Santo Domingo family — be treated as a separate class of shareholder.Such a move would help defuse tension among investors about the weight of the two, which own 41 per cent of the shares and support the takeover, in the final vote. This follows growing criticism that AB InBev’s partial share offer, aimed at the two largest shareholders, has ended up being more favourable than the cash offer.If the court agrees, then instead of a single vote garnering 75 per cent support, 75 per cent of each shareholder group would need to vote in favour. In effect, this would mean the support of 85 per cent support of all the shareholders to succeed.Fund group Aberdeen Asset Management welcomed the decision to hold two votes, saying it would “help to ensure that the views of the rest of the investor base have due weight”.Aberdeen, which holds about 1 per cent of SAB shares, said it intended to vote against the deal, believing that SAB had “superior value” as a standalone company.A plunge in sterling following last month’s Brexit vote, and gains in AB InBev’s share price, led to the cash portion of the deal becoming worth around 15 per cent less than the partial share alternative.We are cognisant that the partial share alternative initially stood at a discount to the cash consideration, but recent events have resulted in it now standing at a headline premiumJan du Plessis, SAB chairman, said: “We are cognisant that the partial share alternative initially stood at a discount to the cash consideration, but recent events have resulted in it now standing at a headline premium . . . Amongst other reasons, that is why we intend to ask the UK Court to treat Altria and BevCo as a separate class of shareholders.”AB InBev welcomed the SABMiller board’s decision and said it expected the deal to complete later this year.AB InBev’s partial share offer was designed to help the two large shareholders minimise taxes from selling out of SAB. But while that offer is theoretically open to all shareholders, a five-year lock-up preventing the sale of unlisted AB InBev shares would have been unappealing to most other shareholders.AB InBev decided this week to increase its offer to stem a growing rebellion by some SABMiller shareholders over the widening divergence in the value of the two offers.Mr du Plessis said the impact of the Brexit vote on the value of sterling had complicated the decision before board.Sterling’s weakness not only reduced the relative attractiveness of AB InBev’s cash offer but also boosted the valuation of consumer staples, such as SAB, that make most of their earnings outside the UK.For these reasons, Mr du Plessis said: “We believe the final cash consideration of £45 per share to be at the lower end of the range of values considered recommendable.”Earlier on Friday, AB InBev cleared the final regulatory hurdle for the proposed takeover, after it received approval from China’s Ministry of Commerce.Mr du Plessis said that the SABMiller board would now “work constructively with AB InBev to bring about successful completion of the transaction as soon as practicable”.
49;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;SABMiller backs AB Inbev’s improved offer;;Disaster averted.SABMiller has backed a revised £79bn takeover offer by Anheuser-Busch Inbev, paving the way for the world’s biggest brewer to acquire its nearest rival in the third-biggest corporate takeover ever.The decision ends a mini-drama over AB InBev’s offer to SABMiller’s investors, which bubbled to the surface over the past week after a plunge in the value of sterling widened the gap between the two options presented to shareholders, reports Arash Massoudi in London.The board of SABMiller recommended the new £45 a share offer and did not express a view on a mostly stock alternative worth around £51 a share. The latter consists of AB InBev stock that will be unlisted for five years and was designed to please SABMiller’s two biggest shareholders, US tobacco company Altria and Colombia’s wealthy Santo Domingo family, who own around 40 per cent of the world’s second biggest brewer.However, SABMiller is calling for two votes on the deal, allowing for those taking the cash offer to have a say on whether the offer is prejudiced towards Altria and the Santo Domingos.SABMiller Chairman, Jan du Plessis, said:The Board’s decision was difficult given changes in circumstances since the Board originally recommended £44 per share in cash last November. At that time we were satisfied that the 50% premium to the undisturbed share price appropriately reflected the quality of the business and its long term prospects.Since then, various factors have affected the value of the offer, most importantly the impact of the Brexit vote on the value of Sterling and the re-rating of comparable companies. This has made the Board’s decision more challenging, and we believe the final cash consideration of £45 per share to be at the lower end of the range of values considered recommendable.
50;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;AB InBev welcomes Chinese clearance for £79bn SABMiller deal;;"Anheuser-Busch InBev has received regulatory approval from China’s Ministry of Commerce for its proposed £79bn takeover of rival brewer SABMiller, although the latter has yet to approve its suitor’s latest offer, which was upped earlier this week following shareholder disquiet.AB InBev, the brewer of Budweiser and Stella Artois, welcomed the approval from Chinese regulators, which is conditional on it selling SABMiller’s 49 per cent stake in China Resources Snow Breweries (CR Snow) to China Resources Beer, which already holds the other 51 per cent of the joint venture.The joint venture brews Snow, which may not be so well known in the western world but is the biggest single beer brand by volume.The sale of the 49 per cent stake in CR Snow is dependent on AB InBev’s takeover of SABMiller still going ahead.The FT’s Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Neil Hume revealed earlier this week that SABMiller has told its employees to temporarily pause work on integrating the two companies, after AB InBev raised its offer for its smaller rival by £1 a share, valuing the deal at £79bn. SABMiller’s board has yet to deliver its verdict on the sweetened offer.AB InBev revised the offer price following the sharp depreciation of sterling in the wake of Britain’s vote to leave the EU, which opened up a disparity between the cash takeover price and a partial share alternative, which some shareholders had argued disproportionately benefits SABMiller’s two biggest investors, the US tobacco company Altria and BevCo, the investment vehicle of the Santo Domingo brewing family.In its statement covering the Chinese regulatory approval, AB InBev said it “continues to focus on taking the necessary steps in preparation for completing the combination [with SABMiller] as quickly as practicable. Another announcement will follow in due course with further details”.AB InBev has now secured regulatory approval for the deal in:North America (US and Canada); Asia-Pacific (Australia, India, South Korea and China); in Africa (Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa); in Europe (the EU, Albania, Moldova, Turkey and Ukraine); and in Latin America (Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay and Mexico)."
51;MO;Altria Group;2016-07-26T19:57:49Z;SABMiller/AB InBev: arb luck;Currency movements will benefit some investors. Get over it;It is hardly an edifying spectacle. A deal structured to limit tax obligations for certain shareholders and whose financial logic stretched credulity is now threatened by speculators trying to wring extra money out of the bidder using flimsy arguments.To borrow a recently resurrected phrase, the takeover of SABMiller by AB InBev could plausibly be described as the “unacceptable face of M&A”.When the two companies agreed the terms of the takeover last November, the £44 a share cash offer was worth more than a partial share alternative that most thought would appeal only to the Santo Domingo family and the US tobacco group Altria.Between them, they own 41 per cent of SABMiller and would face a big tax hit from a cash bid. Since sterling fell after the Brexit vote, the partial share offer, however, is now worth 14 per cent more than the cash bid. Hedge funds and others have demanded a compensatory increase. On Tuesday, ABI added £1 a share and declared that bid “final”.The obvious retort to the arbs’ complaint is that currency volatility is a fact of life. Those who moan that some shareholders are getting more than others do not rush to object when a strong greenback boosts the sterling value of their dollar-denominated dividends.And they could always opt for the share alternative themselves (though doing so would entail accepting unquoted shares that convert into ordinary ABI shares only after five years). That combination may be unattractive for many, but it was announced eight months ago. It is a bit late in the day to be crying foul about the deal structure.Two factors embolden those demanding more. One is a sense that ABI has invested too much time and capital to walk away now. The other is that even if it did walk, SABMiller shares would probably not slump back to the £30 or so they traded at last November, because companies with overseas earnings are increasingly sought after.Still, the cost savings from this transaction did not cover the premium even at the original price — AllianceBernstein estimates it would take a decade for returns to cover the cost of capital — so it is no surprise that AB InBev is digging in its heels.SAB shares trade just under the new price, suggesting investors believe that “final” means just that. Those worried that the deal might yet collapse should resign themselves to remaining SABMiller investors — or sell the shares now.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
52;MO;Altria Group;2016-07-26T15:01:48Z;AB InBev rocks SABMiller’s post-Brexit deal revisionists;Could this be the first megadeal stymied by the EU referendum?;Hells bells! Carlos Brito, AC/DC fan and chief executive of Anheuser-Busch InBev, has delivered an ultimatum to investors critical of his takeover offer for SABMiller. He has accompanied a small top-up to the cash part of the £79bn deal with the dread words “final offer”. That means the Belgian-US brewer will walk away rather than sweeten the price further.The hard-nosed Brazilian is putting a cannon shot across the bows of Martin Gilbert of Aberdeen Asset Management and other dissident SABMiller shareholders. They believe a fall in the pound against the euro means the deal terms now disadvantage them. This could be the first — and possibly only — megadeal stymied by post-referendum currency gyrations.Mr Brito has raised the cash offer targeted at long funds and hedgies from £44 to £45 per SABMiller share. But an alternative offer in restricted shares and cash — designed for industrial investors Altria and BevCo, who hold 41 per cent of the South Africa-rooted beer group — has risen from £39 to about £51 per share.This reflects a jump in the sterling value of AB InBev’s euro-denominated shares, as well as an 88p increase to the cash kicker included in the alternative offer to £4.70 per share.Mr Gilbert is over-egging it when he says this is unfair. Fund managers as big and tough as him should be able to bear forex fluctuations. And any investor can take the cash and shares option created for Altria and BevCo, if they can stomach a five-year lock-up on the stock.The view of the Scot is coloured by his belief that SABMiller would flourish as an independent. Hedgies, such as Elliott Advisors, an activist that agitated for a “bump”, are likely to take the money rather than see the deal fail.You might then expect long funds to fall in line, and vote for the takeover. But many will first discuss the angles with Jan du Plessis, shrewd chairman of SABMiller. He broached a potential revision of terms with AB InBev. His board has not recommended the revised offer, however.Mr Brito’s unilateral decision to “go final” has freed Mr Du Plessis to recommend a No vote if that represents the mood among fellow directors and independent investors.Altria and BevCo would probably still vote in favour. But a judge may yet bifurcate the poll, with industrial investors and independents voting separately. If less than 75 of the latter by value and 50 per cent in number support the takeover, it would fail.Mr Brito, who has headbanged to Mr Du Plessis’ tune during much of the offer period, is trying to turn the tables. If the South African calls his bluff, it could leave the deal, not on AC/DC’s infamous “Highway to Hell”, but a road to nowhere.The City once hosted guilds that fixed prices at the expense of the public. That historic ambivalence towards free markets was reflected in a 3 per cent rally in the shares of BT on Tuesday. Ofcom has let the UK telecoms group off the hook. BT will not have to spin off Openreach, which dominates Blighty’s telecoms infrastructure.Instead BT will only have to grant its offshoot the kind of autonomy a liberal parent gives to an older teenager. Openreach can make some of its own decisions via a board with a majority of independent directors. The company will remain a subsidiary whose budget is set by its progenitor.That would allow BT to keep down Openreach’s capex, ensuring UK broadband standards continue to shock and amuse foreign visitors. BT can indirectly set the dividend rate payable by Openreach.Ofcom says it could still recommend full separation. One suspects the moment for that has passed. The regulator says a potential weakening of BT’s covenant to pensioners stood in the way of a full spin-off. BT cares so much about this army of oldies that in 2014 it extended its deadline to pay off a £7bn scheme deficit by six years, to 2030.The Investment Association was accused of radicalism that rattled members under erstwhile boss Daniel Godfrey. No danger of that with the IA’s report on executive pay. Damp flannel rather than a chastising whip is levelled at fat cats. For example, the body says boards should “explain why they have chosen their company’s pay level with consideration of relativities”.It’s surprising a working group that includes such reformist City folk as Nigel Wilson, Helena Morrissey and Edi Truell have written such a bland document. Members squashed a proposal for bonuses to be paid partly in restricted stock. Did wider wet blanketing of the firebrands occur?New prime minister Theresa May has outpaced the IA on executive pay simply by pasting chunks of the Labour party manifesto into her policy proposals. Let’s hope the IA’s own incoming leader, the level-headed Chris Cummings, will nudge the body into taking a bolder position.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
53;MO;Altria Group;2016-07-26T09:44:11Z;Aberdeen: revised deal for SABMiller ‘remains unacceptable’;;One of SABMiller’s top ten shareholders has said a sweetened takeover offer for the brewer from its bigger rival Anheuser-Busch InBev remains “unacceptable” as it “undervalues” the company behind brands such as Miller Genuine Draft.AB InBev this morning upped its offer for SABMiller by £1 a share to £45-a-share – valuing SABMiller at £79bn – following a sharp slide in the value of the pound in the wake of Britain’s vote to leave the EU.The cash element of a partial share alternative – available for 41 per cent of SABMiller shares – was also upped from £3.7788 to £4.6588, plus 0.483969 of unlisted shares.The revised offer came after SABMiller’s board faced pressure from investors to press for better terms after sterling dropped sharply after Britain’s Brexit vote on June 23.Investors had raised concerns that the previous structure favoured SABMiller’s two biggest shareholders, US tobacco company Altria and BevCo, the investment vehicle of the Santo Domingo brewing family, which had already indicated they would elect for the partial share alternative.But Aberdeen Asset Management said that even under the sweetened terms, SABMiller’s two biggest shareholders were still being favoured. The fund manager said:In the absence of an improved offer we would be more than happy to remain committed long-term shareholders in SABMiller.We have engaged with SABMiller’s Board on the differential treatment of shareholders since the deal was first constructed. The way that the value of the partial share offer has diverged from the cash offer has compounded our discomfort.Altria and Bevco should not be able to vote on the cash offer as they are inherently conflicted by their future stakes in AB InBev if the deal completes. We believe the Board’s only choice is to treat Altria and Bevco as a separate class of shareholders and would urge them to make a public statement to this effect.Between them Altria and Bevco’s stakes represent 40.38 per cent of SABMiller’s shares.The revised terms of the partial share alternative represent an equivalent value of £51.14 SABMiller share, AB InBev said in its statement this morning.

The revised terms value SABMiller at £79bn.SABMiller has come under pressure from activist investors to seek improved terms for the deal following the depreciation of sterling after the Brexit vote. It recently emerged that the Children’s Investment Fund Management (TCI), run by the British investor Sir Chris Hohn, and US activist investor Elliott Management had built up stakes in SABMiller, the brewer of brands including Miller Genuine Draft and Peroni.Elliott recently wrote to SABMiller’s board raising concerns over the structure of the takeover deal.There had been increasing concern among investors over the choice between being paid either in cash or mostly stock after the fall in sterling, which widened a gap in the respective values of the options. There were concerns that the mostly stock alternative would disproportionately benefit SABMiller’s two biggest shareholders, US tobacco company Altria and BevCo, the investment vehicle of the Santo Domingo brewing family.AB InBev said the revised terms unveiled on Tuesday were final and it will “not further increase the cash consideration or the cash element or the exchange ratio of the partial share alternative”.Regulatory approvals for the takeover deal – dubbed “mega brew” by analysts – have already been secured in Europe, the US and South Africa.

And shares in Philip Morris declined 1.7 per cent to $99.95.Concerns about so-called deeming regulations weighed on the shares. This regulation, which could come into effect by mid-2016, could see e-cigarettes, hookah tobacco, cigars and nicotine gels classified as tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration subjecting them to tighter regulatory scrutiny and making it more expensive for companies to market them.Traditional tobacco companies made an aggressive push into products like e-cigarettes in an attempt to diversify, as consumers have opted for healthier lifestyles, choosing to give up smoking cigarettes.A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last year showed that 10 per cent of US adults now ‘vape’, compared with 2.6 per cent according to a US government estimate in 2013.Chris Growe, an analyst at Stifel, said earlier this week:We have been anxiously awaiting the announcement of the Deeming Regulations for the better part of the past three years and the FDA seems prepared, finally, to release those regulations further regulating the E-vapor market. We believe this will have an adverse effect on the growth of the category in 2017 and going forward although the exact regulations are unknown at this time and we will assess their impact once they are formally announced.“We believe this is partially due to weakness across consumer staples, though a Bloomberg article on pending deeming regulations, does seem to be weighing on sentiment,” said Vivien Azer, an analyst at Cowen & Co. She added that the concerns are “overblown”. The S&P 500 consumer staples sector was down 1 per cent for the day.The S&P 500 tobacco industry index, which includes just Reynolds America, Phillip Morris and Altria Group, has posted seven consecutive years of annual gains.The index has been up more than 27 per cent since the start of 2015, compared with a less than 1 per cent gain for the benchmark S&P 500.

57;MO;Altria Group;2015-10-13T06:36:12Z;SABMiller agrees in principle to £68bn takeover by AB InBev;London-listed brewer accepts £44-a-share proposal from Belgian-Brazilian rival;The world’s two largest beermakers have struck a £68bn deal to combine, in what would rank as the third-biggest takeover in history.UK-listed brewer SABMiller said it had agreed “in principle” to an acquisition by its larger rival Anheuser-Busch InBev, accelerating the pace of frenzied corporate dealmaking.The breakthrough after a month-long pursuit will further boost the bulging volume of deals in 2015 which is already on pace to surpass the record set just before the financial crisis. The enthusiasm for mergers and acquisitions has been fuelled by cheap debt and a hunt for growth among the world’s biggest companies.The combination would create a brewer responsible for one in every three beers sold globally and would require several knock-on deals as the two shed assets, from the US to China, to win regulatory approval.The agreement followed a frantic day of negotiations in London on Monday between Jan du Plessis, the South African chairman of SAB, and Carlos Brito, the Brazilian chief executive of AB InBev.With Mr du Plessis holding out for more money and Mr Brito refusing, a deal was clinched only after Olivier Goudet, chairman of AB InBev, intervened and said his company would raise its cash offer for a fifth time to £44 a share.The figure — a 50 per cent premium to SAB’s undisturbed share price a month ago — was enough to sway Mr du Plessis and Alejandro Santo Domingo, who was also involved in the final discussions and whose family is SAB’s second-largest shareholder.Mr du Plessis said the support of the Santo Domingos was “critical” to a deal. “I have the utmost admiration for the way they have behaved. They are real gentlemen,” he said.The final AB InBev proposal values SAB’s equity at £68bn and amounts to £75bn including net debt. The bid includes a partial share offer for 41 per cent of SAB’s stock, which is worth £39.03 a share.Top-up at the two brewers shows that a little more money makes a big differenceRead moreUS cigarette maker Altria, which owns 27 per cent of SAB, has openly backed the approach, and said previously it would elect to take the equity option. It is likely that Mr Santo Domingo’s family holding company BevCo will also take up the share alternative. Both Altria and BevCo are expected to receive board seats in the merged entity, people close to the matter said.SAB shares rose more than 8 per cent to £39.26 in London, while AB InBev increased 1.6 per cent in Brussels.SAB’s senior managers stand to share in a potential $2.1bn in vesting shares and options if the deal is completed, according to analysts at Bernstein. Alan Clark, chief executive of SAB, alone stands to receive more than $65m.Should the deal fall apart due to either regulatory hurdles or opposition from AB InBev shareholders, the company will have to pay a break fee to SAB of $3bn.If completed, the deal — including debt — would be the third-largest M&A transaction in history, according to Dealogic, overtaking AOL’s purchase of Time Warner in 2000.It will also mark the most ambitious step yet for AB InBev, whose long record of acquisitions has helped the company grow from a relatively small unit in Brazil to the world’s largest brewer.Will Hayllar, partner at consultancy OC&C, said: “Mergers are so attractive [in the sector] because they allow companies to build scale, reduce costs and grow brands internationally at premium price points. It’s no wonder the top three brewers have grown their share of the global market from 29 per cent in 2010 to 40 per cent in 2014.”Although AB InBev and SAB are the two largest beermakers, some analysts have played down the regulatory risks due to the distinct geographic split of their businesses. Nonetheless, a deal would probably take more than a year to complete because it would require approvals in dozens of jurisdictions.To satisfy antitrust rules in the US, analysts said, the combined company would most probably have to sell MillerCoors, a joint venture controlled by SAB. The likely buyer is SAB’s partner Molson Coors, which has a right to make the first and final bid for MillerCoors.AB InBev has sought SAB for its strength in faster-growing emerging markets, such as Africa, as sales in many developed markets are slowing due to changing consumer tastes.SAB’s largest South African investor, Public Investment Corp, said it was “critical” that the merged group be listed in Johannesburg.Devan Kaloo, of Aberdeen Asset Management which has a 2 per cent holding in SAB, praised the SAB board for negotiating “a fair, if not full price”.Lazard was the sole financial adviser to AB InBev, while Freshfields and Cravath, Swaine & Moore acted as its legal counsel. SAB was advised by Robey Warshaw, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs on the financial transaction and by Linklaters and Hogan Lovells.Additional reporting by Andrew England in Johannesburg and David Oakley in London
58;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;SABMiller investor calls for AB InBev to raise offer;Pension fund manager PIC asks for clarification of proposed listing in Johannesburg;The fourth-largest shareholder in SABMiller is pushing for Anheuser-Busch InBev to improve its £65bn offer, less than 72 hours ahead of a bid deadline imposed by UK regulators.A senior official at South Africa’s state-owned Public Investment Corporation, which manages more than $130bn in pension funds and is the country’s most powerful investor, said that key among its concerns was clarification of a proposed listing of a combined brewer on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.The comments from PIC highlight a split among investors just days before the 5pm expiry on Wednesday by which, under Takeover Panel rules, AB InBev must make a formal offer or walk away for six months.Carlos Brito, AB InBev chief executive, has not ruled out making a hostile bid, but said last week that he hoped SABMiller’s board would back an offer.With the exception of US tobacco maker Altria, which is SABMiller’s biggest shareholder, the board last week rejected AB InBev’s cash offer of £42.15 per share in cash and a partial share alternative as “very substantially undervaluing” the brewer.Altria has said it is willing to accept an offer of £42.15, or higher, and has called on SABMiller chairman, Jan du Plessis, to negotiate with AB InBev. But Colombia’s Santo Domingo brewing dynasty, which holds 14 per cent of the company and has two board seats, voted to reject the offer.The two largest shareholders control 41 per cent of the brewer.Alejandro Santo Domingo, scion of the Colombian brewing dynasty, and one of the two members of the family investment vehicle, BevCo, on the SABMiller board has emerged as the kingmaker in what would be the biggest takeover of a London-listed company.Without BevCo’s support, AB InBev cannot finance its offer, which is dependent on the two largest shareholders opting for the partial share offer, though it is theoretically open to all shareholders.PIC, which holds about 3 per cent in SABMiller, said it also wanted a share transaction rather than a cash deal. The PIC official said he was concerned that AB InBev was “looking to satisfy the two major (SAB) shareholders first”.It’s very important for them to come back with a better offer that takes care of all shareholders’ concernsMr Brito has repeatedly said the partial share offer was designed “for and with” the major shareholders.The PIC official said: “It’s very important for them to come back with a better offer that takes care of all shareholders’ concerns. Most importantly, if there’s a listing it must be immediate, it must be through a swap of shares. There’s no way we are going to accept cash because we don’t know what to do with that cash in the current market.”He added that the PIC would be guided by SAB’s board.A listing on the JSE for any new entity is seen as a critical condition for SABMiller’s South African investors, which collectively hold 10 per cent in the brewer. The country’s pension funds are required to invest 75 per cent of the funds in domestic assets.The proposed AB InBev/SABMiller deal shows where size matters — and where it does notContinue ReadingAB InBev has said any new entity would have a secondary listing on the JSE, but South African shareholders say it is unclear if it would be deemed a domestic stock.Cape Town-based Investec Asset Management, which holds about 0.2 per cent in SAB, has also written to the brewer’s board outlining its issues around a proposed deal.“We want SAB’s board to engage with InBev . . . we are supportive of the SAB board rejecting the £42.15 offer by InBev,” Rob Forsyth, a portfolio manager at Investec said.“We think as shareholders of both companies, there can be a higher price that satisfies both sets of shareholders and is fair and we would like the board to work towards that.”

Some say the bid is still too low and others are concerned about the competition issues likely to arise from combining the world’s top two brewers.Brazilian billionaire closes in on dream with AB InBev and SABMiller mergerRead more“You would expect the most eligible partner at the dance to play hard to get,” said Alex Smith, analyst at Investec in a note. Nevertheless, the rejection of the proposal “suggests the two parties are further apart on price than most had anticipated”.However, James Edwardes Jones, RBC Capital Markets analyst, said he believed a deal would ultimately be struck at around £44 per share.“The reality, we think, is that the two sides are much closer to an agreement than it might appear,” he wrote in a note.If completed at £42.15 per share, the deal would already be the third-largest takeover in history, according to Dealogic data.Additional reporting by Scheherazade Daneshkhu
60;MO;Altria Group;2015-10-07T21:34:35Z;SABMiller rejects AB InBev’s £65bn takeover offer;Investors split over Belgian-Brazilian brewer’s third bid;"A smouldering takeover battle to create a dominant global brewer ignited on Wednesday when a frustrated Anheuser-Busch InBev unveiled a £65bn bid to buy rival SABMiller only to be swiftly rejected by its UK-listed rival.SAB said the proposal, which followed two lower private offers, “very substantially” undervalued the brewer, jeopardising the prospects of what would be the third-biggest deal by value in history.AB InBev decided to go public with its campaign after failing to win over SAB’s second-biggest shareholder, Colombia’s Santo Domingo family.However, US tobacco group Altria, SAB’s biggest shareholder, backed the latest offer with its 27 per cent stake, setting the stage for a frantic final week of talks before a UK deadline for AB InBev to make a firm offer.“The Santo Domingos hold the power to veto this entire transaction,” said one person directly involved in the boardroom negotiations.A deal now hinges on the ability of Carlos Brito, AB InBev’s Brazilian chief executive, to sway Jan du Plessis, SAB’s South African chairman.Mr du Plessis is holding out for at least another 10 per cent on top of AB InBev’s latest offer, which consists of £42.15 in cash as well as a partial stock component meant to attract Altria and Bevco, which manages the Santo Domingos’ 14 per cent holding, people familiar with the talks said.The SAB board believes that AB InBev will make big cost savings and other benefits from a combination and want the offer to reflect that.They said yesterday that AB InBev’s bid was unattractive to some of its shareholders due to the structure of its part cash, part share offer. The SAB board also said the price undervalued the group’s footprint in fast-growing emerging markets.But three board members, nominated by Altria, have split with the rest of the 15-member group. Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said it “supports a proposal of £42.15, or higher, with a partial share alternative and, subject to finalisation of terms, would be prepared to elect the partial share alternative”.Everyone involved in the brewers’ negotiations has reason to be nervousRead moreMr Brito on Wednesday expressed disappointment with Mr du Plessis and the SAB board for failing to negotiate seriously during three weeks of private talks. He urged the smaller group’s shareholders to persuade the company to accept its latest bid.“We didn’t get any meaningful engagement from the board going the private route,” he said.“With the put up or shut up deadline approaching, we thought it important for SABMiller shareholders to understand . . . it’s an amazing price,” he added.The Belgian-Brazilian brewer said SAB had already rejected two offers, one at £38 a share and one at £40. The new offer would value SAB, including debt, at £72bn, representing a 44 per cent premium to its share price before AB InBev made its interest known.If AB InBev succeeds, it would be the third-largest M&A transaction in history, according to Dealogic, and the latest conquest in a two decade long effort by its largest shareholders to consolidate the global brewing industry.Shares in SAB were flat £36.33 in London on Wednesday, while AB InBev shares gained 1.7 per cent to €99.7.The bid by the world’s top beer maker to buy its biggest rival is the most ambitious step yet for AB InBev, which has a long history of acquisitions. AB InBev is seeking to combine its stable of global brands, including Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, with SAB’s long list of popular emerging market beers.A top 30 shareholder in SAB said: “There are worries about the cultural fit between these groups and whether this might raise antitrust issues in some domiciles. But the cash offer is on the generous side and I think that will be a big consideration for some shareholders.”1) Vodafone AirTouch/ Mannesmann — $172bn (Nov 1999)2) Verizon Communications/ Verizon Wireless — $130bn (Sep 2013)3) AB InBev/SABMiller — $117bn (e) (Oct 2015)4) AOL/Time Warner — $112bn (Jan 2000)5) Pfizer/Warner-Lambert — $111bn (Nov 1999)Source: DealogicMainstream brands have been increasingly under pressure in developed markets from the rising popularity of craft beers, often brewed by small independent producers.AB InBev hopes a deal will help it gain exposure to fast-growing African markets, where SAB has long been the dominant supplier. The combined group would generate annual revenue of £64bn, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £24bn.AB InBev has retained as advisers Lazard and law firm Freshfields. SABMiller is being advised by Robey Warshaw, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Its lead legal adviser is Linklaters.Additional reporting by David OakleyAnheuser-Busch InBev’s third proposal for SABMiller comes in two forms: one is all-cash and the other is a mix of AB InBev shares and cash, writes Lucy Colback.The all-cash offer is £42.15 per SAB share, a premium of 16 per cent to the close on Tuesday, the night before the latest bid was announced. Speculation of a renewed bid emerged on September 14, however; based on the undisturbed share price, AB InBev says it is offering a premium of 44 per cent.The partial share offer is 0.48 AB InBev shares and £2.37 in cash for every SAB share. Based on an AB InBev share price of €100, that equates to £37.94 a share, a discount of 10 per cent to the all-cash offer.The cash and share proposal is available for about 41 per cent of outstanding SAB shares — corresponding to the combined shareholdings of the London-listed brewer’s largest shareholders, Altria and BevCo, the holding company of Colombia’s Santo Domingo family. Given that 41 per cent of shareholders must take up the partial offer in order for a deal to go ahead, a firm offer is unlikely to emerge unless these two shareholders indicate they will accept the share and cash alternative.Other shareholders who wish to opt for the mixed consideration would be given an allocation pro-rata according to demand. The partial offer is not only less attractive financially but also other terms may deter SAB investors from taking it up.Although the new shares will carry voting rights, the stock will be unlisted and untradeable on any exchange. After an unusually long lock-up period of five years, former SAB investors will receive ordinary AB InBev shares on a one-for-one basis. Only then will they be able to sell their holdings.AB InBev has said it could still vary the proposed terms."
61;MO;Altria Group;2015-10-07T10:14:23Z;SABMiller/AB InBev: a potent brew;Everyone involved in the brewers’ negotiations has reason to be nervous;It is, as former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson liked to say, squeaky bum time. The deadline for Anheuser-Busch InBev to make an offer for SABMiller is approaching, and the bidder has tried to crank up the pressure. Having received no joy from the SABMiller board with private offers at £38 and £40 a share, AB InBev went public with a cash offer of £42.15 and a (vastly inferior) partial share alternative. The SAB board is still unimpressed. It rejected that bid, too.Three groups of people should be nervous. First, AB InBev shareholders. Their company is offering $99.5bn for SAB’s equity. That is nearly 28 times forecast 2016 earnings (or an enterprise value of 15 times historic earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation). It is not clear that the deal will create value at that level, even with AB InBev’s legendary cost-cutting skills. The company has said nothing about savings, yet they are the only reason to buy SAB. Analysts at RBC think the financial case for a deal erodes rapidly at over £40 a share. Assuming the inferior share offer is only taken up by SAB’s largest shareholders (who may be keen to avoid the tax liability associated with taking cash) AB InBev is offering an average £40.20 a share.SABMiller shareholders should also be sitting uncomfortably. Their board is playing hard to get, and has managed to push AB InBev’s cash offer up 11 per cent. Full marks to them. The latest rejection may well result in a further increase — the 15 times EV/ebitda multiple is not at the very top of recent sector deals, and there are no other acquisitions of this size open to AB InBev.The world’s largest brewer AB InBev’s £65bn offer for SABMiller, the second largest, has been rebuffed. Lex’s Robert Armstrong and Oliver Ralph discuss what price will win SAB, whether it will be too much and what regulatory hurdles there may be.Plus, it wants a recommendation from the SAB board. But if the deal collapses SAB’s shares could fall to the £30 at which they were trading before the approach was made public last month. Could they get to £42.15 alone? Eventually, perhaps — the company has good businesses in growth markets. But first-half revenue growth was just 4 per cent, and the shares have been moving sideways since mid-2013.Finally, shareholders in tobacco group Altria should be annoyed. The company owns 27 per cent of SABMiller. There is no need for it to own this. If Altria’s shareholders want to own SAB, they can buy its shares directly. Worse, Altria says it will take the partial share alternative, worth £37.49 a share. And there is a five year lock up on the shares. Way to go Altria!Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
62;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Altria clouds SABMiller deal prospects;Marlboro owner’s 27% stake gives group a voice in AB InBev talks;Beer and cigarettes are not the healthiest combination, but for Altria, the maker of Marlboro, owning 27 per cent of brewer SABMiller has proven lucrative.The stake has contributed 10-19 per cent of Altria’s annual pre-tax profits over recent years, so the prospect of a bid for SAB by Anheuser-Busch InBev, its larger rival, has left investors watching keenly to see what Altria opts to do with its holding.The size of the stake also means that the tobacco group could be an important influence over SAB’s discussions on whether to accept an offer, and how the deal should be structured.Most analysts say that the best outcome for Altria, the biggest tobacco company in the US, is to push for terms that allow it to keep a stake in an AB InBev-SABMiller combination.Vivien Azer, an analyst at Cowen & Company, expects Altria to use its three board members to lobby for a 50-50 stock and cash deal that would allow it to maintain a “meaningful” position in the merged company. One reason being that selling Altria’s stake for cash would incur significant tax costs, analysts noted.“They would have a tremendous tax bill if they were to sell,” says Michael Zbinovec, an analyst at Fitch, the rating agency. “They have repeatedly said they are happy with earnings from the business.”Morningstar’s Adam Fleck estimates that its stake in SAB could be worth roughly $24bn in a takeover, with the research company estimating a fair value for the brewer of £36 per share. Others suggest the price could be higher.This is close to where SAB trades now, standing at £37.22 in morning trade on Wednesday. It is difficult to determine the company’s undisturbed share price, however. It has rallied nearly 20 per cent since an approach was confirmed on September 16, but speculation about an offer was rife even before this, bolstering the stock.Regardless, any final price would be far higher than the $6.2bn book value of the asset as recorded on Altria’s balance sheet at the moment.And the tax rate on its gains would be 35 per cent, analysts say.● 2002 SAB acquires Miller Brewing from Philip Morris for $3.6bn in stock and $2bn in debt. The tobacco group holds a 36% stake in the combined company SABMiller, with three board members● 2003 — 2009 Altria’s stake in SAB is diluted to 27.3% from 36%● 2003 Philip Morris changes its name to Altria● 2007 Altria sells its stake in Kraft and related brands● 2008 Altria spins off Philip Morris’s international operations into a separately listed companyAltria, then Philip Morris, gained a 36 per cent share in SAB worth $3.4bn, after it sold Miller Brewing to SAB in 2002. This was gradually diluted to 27.3 per cent by 2009, according to its annual reports.But tax is not the only reason that holding on to a stake would be in Altria’s interest, according to analysts. SAB’s substantial contribution to Altria’s earnings provides steady cash flow for the company as it seeks to bolster shareholder returns amid a secular decline in its core tobacco business.It has also been a form of diversification for Altria, given that most of the group’s profit still comes from cigarettes, despite expanding its “smokeless” offerings and wine business. The group’s geographic spread has also narrowed since it spun off Philip Morris International to focus on the US market.By securing a stake in a combined AB InBev-SABMiller, Altria could share in the gains that analysts expect from a deal backed by 3G Capital, the cost-cutting Brazilian private equity group that owns 22.7 per cent of AB InBev.Fitch’s Mr Zbinovec also notes that AB InBev’s dividend yield exceeds SAB’s at 3.17 per cent and 2.07 per cent respectively, suggesting a continued stake could increase its dividend income.Altria’s long-term goal of earnings per share growth of 7-9 per cent “seems to imply growing equity contributions from SABMiller”, Morningstar’s Mr Fleck points out.“If management wants to continue to hit those targets without increasing equity contributions, it would need to boost pricing and likely accelerate volume declines in its tobacco products,” he says.Altria’s Marlboro brand, which accounts for almost all of its “smokable” cigarette sales, has nearly 44 per cent of the US market — more than the next 10 brands combined. The segment, which also includes cigars, enjoys generous margins of 44 per cent. Its smokeless offerings, while a much smaller contributor to profit, are growing and have margins of 63 per cent.But with limited ability to advertise and regulation only likely to get stiffer, tobacco is a difficult industry.Domestic competition is intensifying at a time of significant consolidation. Reynolds American recently completed its acquisition of Lorillard, with some brands from those two companies sold to Imperial Tobacco’s US subsidiary, while Japan Tobacco this week announced it is to buy $5bn of assets from Reynolds.More consolidation could come though. There has been market speculation that Imperial itself could be a target either for BAT or Japan Tobacco.Potential deal would involve Brazilian, Belgian, Colombian and US investorsRead moreOne key focus for investors and analysts if Altria maintains an investment in brewing through an AB InBev-SAB deal, is how big its holding will be.At the moment, its 27.3 per cent stake and three board members gives it “significant influence” in accounting terms, allowing it to use so-called equity method accounting and consolidate its share of SAB’s profit on its income statement.While letting its stake fall below 20 per cent could force it to change the way it accounts for its holding and only count dividends, there is no hard and fast rule, analysts say, adding that it could prove in other ways that it continues to exert “significant influence”.As the Marlboro Man said of his smokes back in 1954 “You get a lot to like”. For Altria, when it comes to maintaining a stake in a newly formed AB InBev-SAB, the same probably applies.

They also co-founded 3G Capital in 2004. Their most spectacular transaction to date was this year’s merger of Kraft Foods with Heinz to create a company with an enterprise value of $100bn — a deal orchestrated with the veteran US investor Warren Buffett.AB InBev targets SABMiller in a deal to create a group that is responsible for one out of every three beers globallyLombard says SABMiller chief Alan Clark would do well to tap into AC/DC lyrics while considering his next moveThe FT’s management editor examines how the Budweiser brewer has sharpened its takeover and integration tacticsThat deal followed last year’s $11.4bn purchase of Tim Hortons, the Canadian coffee and doughnut chain, by Burger King, which 3G had acquired in 2010 for $3.3bn.However, 3G has faced criticism over its aggressive cost-cutting tactics, including the axing of 7,000 jobs within 18 months of taking over Heinz in 2013. MPThe Belgian familiesThree Belgian families have a 28.6 per cent holding in AB InBev as a result of their historic brewing ties — and, together with the brewer’s three largest Brazilian shareholders — control a majority stake in the overall group.The de Spoelbergh family’s Artois brewery was founded in the 14th century, although the family took control of the business much later. In 1987, the family merged Artois with the Van Damme family’s Piedbouf brewery to create the Interbrew group, which later stepped up its international expansion with a series of acquisitions, notably Anheuser-Busch. The de Mevius family completes AB InBev’s Belgian ownership base.But all three families are notably publicity shy and have been content to take a relatively backstage role in the running of AB InBev. DDAltriaAlthough it may not be a household name, tobacco company Altria owns a 26.6 per cent stake in SABMiller and some of the best-selling cigarette brands — including Marlboro, L&M and Benson & Hedges in the US.Formed following a split of the Philip Morris International brands in 2008, some 97 per cent of the company’s $24.5bn net revenue last year came from tobacco and ‘smokeless products’, with the remainder made from wine sales.In any deal with AB InBev, Altria is likely to prefer equity in exchange for its SABMiller stake, in order to avoid a large capital gains tax bill. MPThe Santo Domingo familyColombia’s brewing dynasty was founded by Julio Mario Santo Domingo, who died in 2011 with an $8.4bn fortune and having controlled his country’s beer industry from the 1960s onwards.His Santo Domingo group gained a 13.9 per cent stake in SABMiller in 2005 when it sold the jewel in its crown, the Bavaria brewery, to the London-listed group. Today, this SABMiller stake represents Santo Domingo’s main asset.Julio Mario’s principal heirs — all billionaires in their own right and no strangers to jetset society — are his sons Alejandro and Andres, his grandchildren Tatiana and Julio III.

They are also the founders of 3G Capital, the Brazilian private equity group, which has been buying up US food companies including Heinz, Kraft and Burger King, sometimes with the support of serial investor Warren Buffett.A series of deals over the past decade have transformed AB InBev and SAB into the world’s two biggest brewers and the two — along with Heineken and Carlsberg — make half the world’s beer.Ironically, the industry has consolidated just as consumer tastes in beer are fragmenting. The big brewers face a growing challenge from craft beer, popular with millennial and younger drinkers who reject what they perceive as the bland offerings of the big multinationals.SABMiller said on Wednesday it had been informed that AB InBev intended to make a bid proposal for the company but it had not received any such proposal or details about its terms.“The board of SABMiller will review and respond as appropriate to any proposal which might be made,” it said in a statement after the Financial Times told the company it intended to report the approach.AB InBev’s bold dreams of expansion originated with Jorge Paulo Lemann, the group’s single biggest shareholderLombard says SABMiller chief Alan Clark would do well to tap into AC/DC lyrics while considering his next moveThe FT’s management editor examines how the Budweiser brewer has sharpened its takeover and integration tacticsUnder rules guiding takeovers in the UK, AB InBev has until 5pm on October 14 to make a firm offer to SABMiller.AB InBev later confirmed that it had made an approach, saying its intention was “to work with SABMiller’s board toward a recommended transaction”.Shares in SABMiller closed up 20 per cent to £36.14 in London, giving it a market capitalisation of £58.5bn ($90.7bn). SABMiller has net debt of about £7.5bn. AB InBev shares closed up 6 per cent at €100.5, giving a market capitalisation of €161.6bn ($182.6bn).AB InBev is hoping to engage the management of SAB in a friendly transaction, said people familiar with the matter.It is being advised by Lazard, the independent investment bank, and law firm Freshfields. SAB is working with advisers at Robey Warshaw, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, as well as lawyers at Linklaters.It is unclear whether SAB, which counts the tobacco company Altria and Colombia’s Santo Domingo family as its largest shareholders, is interested in pursuing a deal. On Tuesday it emerged that Altria, which has a 27 per cent stake in SAB, had cancelled two appearances this week at consumer goods conferences hosted by BofA Merrill Lynch and Stifel, fuelling speculation that SAB might be in play.Working for the world’s largest brewer is not to everybody’s taste — and that is fine with Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev’s chief executive.Read moreGiven the size of the two companies, AB InBev would have to agree to divestitures in order to obtain regulatory approval for a deal in multiple countries, including the US and China.SABMiller has a near-30 per cent share of the US beer market through MillerCoors, its joint venture with Molson Coors. It also has 23 per cent of China’s beer market through a joint venture with China Resources Enterprise, known as CR Snow, while AB InBev has a 15 per cent share of the Chinese market.Trevor Stirling, analyst at Bernstein said: “The US Department of Justice would almost certainly insist on the disposal of SAB’s stake in MillerCoors in the USA. And ABI might also have to dispose of SAB’s 49 per cent stake in CR Snow in China. But it is also likely that Molson Coors and CRE would be willing purchasers respectively.”People who have studied a potential tie-up between AB InBev and SAB in the past said AB InBev would be ready to sell SAB’s stake in the joint venture with Molson Coors.Mr Lemann’s first foray into beer came in 1989, when he and his partners acquired control of Brahma, a Brazilian brewer. Ten years later Brahma took over Antarctica, Brazil’s biggest brewery, to create Ambev, which supplied Mr Lemann with the firepower to acquire Belgium’s Interbrew in 2004, creating InBev. The last blockbuster acquisition was the $52bn deal with Anheuser-Busch of the US that led to today’s AB InBev.Fitch, the rating agency, has noted, an AB InBev-SABMiller merger “would create a global player, thus further widening the gap with rivals Heineken and Carlsberg. It would be exposed to high growth and profitable markets and would require only limited divestments in relation to market overlaps”.The sense of catharsis that settled early on Wednesday among investors and analysts did not last long, even as Anheuser-Busch InBev confirmed its intention to bid for its main brewing rival SABMiller.Though speculated for months by followers of both stocks, there seemed to be little agreement about how much the world’s largest brewer would need to pay to secure a deal or how such an offer would be structured.Analysts’ forecasts for what a knockout bid from AB InBev would have to be ranged from £39 to £45 a share. That would value SABMiller’s equity at between £63bn and £73bn, quite a wide gap for a takeover that has been endlessly scrutinised and modelled by traders.Shares in SABMiller closed almost 20 per cent higher at £36.14 in London trading.“It would seem to us that the offer would have to be set at least a 30 per cent premium to the undisturbed share price, [or] north of £39,” analysts at Bernstein said.According to analysts at Olivetree Securities: “If there is a debate in the investor community over the clearing price, we think you should go to the high-end of the range because of SABMiller’s scarcity value.”At £45 per share, the offer would value SABMiller’s enterprise value at a multiple of 22 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. That multiple is well above the average price paid for deals in the sector, which has hovered around 14 times EV/ebitda.There was more of an agreement around structure, with most analysts concluding that any offer from AB InBev would consist of both cash and shares.That is because SABMiller’s two biggest shareholders Altria, the US tobacco group, which has a 27 per cent stake, and Colombia’s billionaire Santo Domingo family, with 15 per cent, could receive a stake in the combined company and avoid a large capital gains tax bill.Analysts at Morningstar said: “The deal is likely to be at least 40 per cent financed by stock, in order to allow major shareholders Altria and the Santo Domingo family to retain an economic interest in the brewing industry.”AB InBev could then offset some of the affect of issuing new equity with a stock buyback after a deal is completed.

Regulators have moved smoking from bars into streets; advertising has moved from screens to, at best, still pictures. Two years ago, Australia introduced “plain” packaging – adorned with such gruesome warnings that the adjective hardly fits.Yet the stocks have done well. Since late 2008, the top five names in the sector have returned between 144 per cent (Imperial) and 347 per cent (Altria). Most tobacco companies have beaten the 130 per cent return of the MSCI World index. Such resilience may be ending.This week China, home to 300m smokers and accounting for a third of the world’s tobacco use, according to Euromonitor, announced a ban in Beijing’s indoor public spaces, to commence in June. The Chinese market is dominated by state-owned enterprises and counterfeit goods, so the direct impact on multinationals will be small. But the message is clear. Growth will become harder to find, even in the emerging world.Last year, tougher regulations hit developed-market volumes and even pricing – often hidden behind tax rises – is softening a bit. So far this year, both Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris International have seen sales declines accelerate in previously reliable markets such as eastern Europe.Forecasts are faltering: expected earnings per share have fallen about one-tenth as the year has progressed. Typical is Philip Morris, with 70 per cent of sales in emerging markets. Since its 2008 spin-off from US-focused parent Altria, the company has achieved annual earnings per share growth of one-tenth. This year, growth will fall 6 per cent. Japan Tobacco and British American have a similar tale of woe. And yet the stocks are not cheap, on mid-teens multiples of 2015 EPS.These companies generate lots of cash. Their dividends look safe. But weaker profits could cut into share buybacks. These have long been a key reason to invest in Philip Morris shares. British American had been ramping up buybacks, until its recent investment in Reynolds American.

66;MO;Altria Group;2014-07-18T15:49:22Z;Cooper draws plaudits for Imperial Tobacco with £4.2bn buyout;;"Alison Cooper has, in the words of her press handler, a “demented schedule”. The 48-year-old chief executive of Imperial Tobacco spent the first half of the week finalising a £4.2bn buyout that will see the Bristol-based company become the third-largest cigarette seller in the US – and the second half hurtling round shareholders convincing them of the deal’s merits.“We were negotiating up to the last minute,” says Ms Cooper. “It’s been incredibly busy – I like it that way.”Analysts applauded the deal, which involved Imperial paying less than many had expected for US cigarette brands such as Winston, Kool and Salem from Lorillard, which was itself bought out by US-rival Reynolds American, in a complex three-way transaction.The praise marked a U-turn for many Imperial-watchers. As recently as last summer Imperial shares were at a two-year low, having been buffeted by falling sales, rising illicit trade and fears of increased regulation. There were rumblings at the time that Ms Cooper could pay the price for the structural problems faced by the company.“People talked about her not being in a job by Christmas. They were saying: ‘This company is sick; it’s gone’,” says Chris Wickham, an analyst at Oriel. But not all were so dismissive. “I walked away never happier with my buy recommendation,” adds Mr Wickham.He was proved right. Imperial has put its miserable 2013 behind it, while shares have rallied by 25 per cent since August, hitting an all-time earlier this month.The US deal is the boldest move yet by Imperial under the cigar-smoking Ms Cooper, who has headed the group since 2010 – becoming only the fifth woman to head a FTSE 100 company in the process.“Clearly, we like doing deals,” says Ms Cooper, who has been with the group since 1999. “Anyone does – we’re not an exception.”But the US adventure is not the start of another bout of the dealmaking that transformed Imperial from a division of sleepy UK conglomerate Hanson into the world’s fourth-largest tobacco company by market share during the 1990s and 2000s, insists Ms Cooper.“It is not a question of returning the business to its record [of M&A],” says Ms Cooper, who was Imperial’s chief operating officer under former chief executive Gareth Davis. “My tenure is about maximising returns.”The Blu deal has turned Imperial from a late entrant into the fast-growing e-cigarette market into – arguably – the leading big tobacco company in the categoryCigarettes are still relatively cheap in the US, especially compared to Europe, which gives plenty of scope for Imperial to raise prices and improve margins. This makes the US, perversely, a growth market from a profit perspective – even as the number of American smokers continues to plunge.Imperial will have a fight on its hands. With only 10 per cent of the market, it will be far smaller than Marlboro maker Altria, which has half the $90bn market, and the enlarged Reynolds American, which will control more than a third.“We love challenges. We thrive on it,” says Ms Cooper. “We have to seize the opportunities of being smaller, but more agile.”This tactic was borne out by the M&A ju-jitsu performed by Imperial on its larger rivals during the deal, which saw Imperial walk away with Lorillard’s Blu – the US’s largest ecigarette brand with 45 per cent of the market.Competition concerns dogged the deal, meaning that Imperial had to be given a viable US business, which strengthened the British company’s hand.“Alison understood that they held negotiating power and used it well,” says one analyst. The Blu deal has turned Imperial from a late entrant into the fast-growing e-cigarette market into – arguably – the leading big tobacco company in the category.Ecigarettes will play a key-role in Imperial’s future, but not in Ms Cooper’s personal smoking habits: “Cigars are still my favourite,” she says."
67;MO;Altria Group;2014-07-15T17:54:53Z;Reynolds American agrees $27bn deal for Lorillard;;"Reynolds American is buying Lorillard for $27.4bn in a complex four-way deal that will reshape the $90bn US tobacco market.The deal, which values Lorillard at $68.88 a share, combines America’s second- and third-largest tobacco companies – creating a formidable rival to Marlboro-maker Altria in the world’s most profitable cigarette market.To assuage potential regulatory concerns, the companies are selling the Kool, Salem, Winston, and Maverick cigarette brands, and the Blu ecigarette brand, to the UK’s Imperial Tobacco for $7.1bn, tripling its US market share.In addition, British American Tobacco, which owns 42 per cent of Reynolds, will inject $4.7bn into the combined company to maintain the size of its stake.News of the deal, first reported by the Financial Times in March, sent Lorillard shares tumbling 10 per cent to $60.17 by close of trading in New York. Reynolds fell 7 per cent to $58.84.Murray Kessler, chief executive of Lorillard, told the Financial Times the deal was “one of the most complex ever attempted in the history of corporate America,” adding: “They have bought the crown jewel in the tobacco industry”.Susan Cameron, who became Reynolds chief executive in May, said the deal was “pro-competitive” and that the sale of brands to Imperial would create a strong number three competitor in the market.The combined Reynolds-Lorillard will hold on to the leading US menthol cigarette brand, Newport, as well as Camel and Vuse, Reynolds’ entrant in the fast-growing ecigarette market.The expanded company is projected to have more than $11bn in revenues and $5bn in operating income. It will have about a 40 per cent share of the US market, compared with Altria’s share of about half of total sales. Imperial’s US market share will rise to about 10 per cent.Analysts at JPMorgan said they did not expect significant competition concerns, adding that “perhaps the greatest antitrust issue is that the brands chosen by almost all new smokers – Marlboro, Newport and Camel – would only be owned by two firms,” rather than three.Reynolds said it expected the merger would achieve cost savings of $800m, mainly through cutting corporate costs and the divestitures to Imperial.Under the terms disclosed on Tuesday, Imperial will also acquire Lorillard’s headquarters in North Carolina, including its manufacturing and research and development facilities, and about 2,900 employees.The complications of pulling together the deal created a windfall for investment banks, with Centerview and Barclays advising Lorillard; Lazard and JPMorgan advising Reynolds; Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs advising Imperial, and Deutsche Bank and UBS advising BAT."
68;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Big tobacco lights up e-cigarette rivalry;;Big tobacco is pushing further into the fast-growing electronic cigarette market with Reynolds American’s plan to expand its Vuse brand across the US next week.Competition for dominance in the $2.5bn US market is heating up, even as regulators and public health groups grapple over the benefits and risks of the battery-powered devices.Reynolds, the second-largest US tobacco company by sales, began testing Vuse in Colorado last year amid industry-wide moves to step up investment in alternatives to conventional cigarettes. With traditional cigarette sales in the US shrinking an average 3 per cent a year, tobacco companies have come to view e-cigarettes as an opportunity to retain customers.“The brand’s nationwide expansion is an important step as we position Vuse as the vapour authority, and continue our efforts to lead the transformation of the tobacco industry,” said Stephanie Cordisco, president of Reynolds subsidiary RJ Reynolds Vapor Company. Vuse will be available in stores across the US from June 23.The fragmented e-cigarette market is just a fraction of the $700bn global tobacco industry, but has drawn attention from big companies facing declining smoking rates. Last week, Japan Tobacco bought the UK’s E-Lites for an undisclosed amount.Lorillard, the smallest of the big three US tobacco groups, dominates US sales with its Blu Ecigs brand, which it acquired in 2012 for $135m. Last year Reynolds and Marlboro-maker Altria began developing their own electronic products and testing them in various states. Altria, which has about 40 per cent of the US cigarette market, plans to take its MarkTen brand national in the coming months.“We expect the national expansion of the Big Three into the vapour category . . . should catapult growth of the entire category,” said Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog, who predicts e-cigarette consumption could surpass traditional smoking in the next decade.Reynolds and Lorillard are in talks over a potential merger, the Financial Times reported in March. Ms Herzog said the tie-up could accelerate growth in the electronic category.“We think a combined Reynolds-Lorillard could become a global vapour powerhouse assuming a potential strategic partnership is formed with British American Tobacco (similar to Philip Morris International’s and Altria’s partnership) to expand outside the US,” she said. PMI, which sells the Marlboro brand internationally, and Altria struck a deal in December to license and distribute products including e-cigarettes.Big tobacco’s moves will probably boost advertising for the devices, including on television, where tobacco ads have been banned since 1971. Marketing spending on e-cigarettes more than tripled to $79m in 2013, according to Kantar Media.Vuse has been running TV ads in Colorado and Utah, while Blu appears on national cable networks. Njoy, a privately owned e-cigarette maker, ran ads in some markets during the past two Super Bowls.The US Food and Drug Administration left the door open to more spending when its proposed e-cigarette regulations, unveiled in April, did not include curbs on marketing or advertising.Reynolds’ expanded bet on the category comes amid a debate over the safety of the products. Advocates argue that the devices, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into a vapour that users inhale, are a less dangerous alternative to smoking because they lack some of the toxins found in cigarette smoke.But others say there is not enough evidence on the potential health risks and that the products risk “renormalising” smoking after decades of success in stigmatising the habit.In a letter to the World Health Organisation on Monday, a group of scientists, doctors and academics called on the agency to regulate e-cigarettes in the same way as tobacco, including advertising bans, limits on public smoking and heavy taxes. That followed an earlier appeal from other public health scientists to avoid burdening the emerging category with strict regulations.“By moving into the e-cigarette market, the tobacco industry is only maintaining its predatory practices and increasing profits,” Monday’s letter said. “Both scientific evidence and best practices are available to support a regulatory framework that will best prevent initiation of use among youth and other non-tobacco users, protect bystanders in public areas from involuntary exposure, regulate marketing, and prohibit unsubstantiated claims.”shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
69;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Traditional ecigarettes lose steam to vaporisers;;Electronic cigarette sales at US convenience stores have fallen for the first time, underlining a shift towards larger devices that are cheaper and allow more customisation.The data highlight the challenges facing companies looking to gain share in the fragmented ecigarette market, where technology is evolving rapidly even as some brands are only beginning to roll out their products on a large scale.The dollar value of sales at shops measured by Nielsen fell 10.4 per cent during the four weeks to May 10, when a 13.9 per cent drop in net pricing outweighed 4.1 per cent volume growth.The release of the data coincided with a plea by more than 50 public health scientists to the World Health Organisation to avoid burdening ecigarettes with stringent regulations.Electronic devices work by heating nicotine-laced liquid into a vapour. The ecigarettes that have taken off in the past decade – called “cig-alikes” for their resemblance to traditional cigarettes – consist of a long battery unit tipped with a cartridge of liquid. They come in disposable and rechargeable versions that can be fitted with new cartridges, similar to razors and blades.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo, said the sales decline reflected not just a lower price per cartridge, but a turn among consumers to vaporisers that can be filled with a variety of “e-liquids”, which tend to be sold online or at tobacco or vapour shops and are not captured in Nielsen’s data.These refillable devices, known as vapours, tanks or mods, are growing twice as fast as the overall electronic category and make up about 44 per cent of a $2.5bn market for electronic vapour products, according to Wells Fargo. Ms Herzog has forecast that ecigarettes and vapour consumption could surpass traditional cigarettes in the next decade.The shift is also evident in companies’ own data. Lorillard, whose Blu Ecigs brand accounts for nearly half of the US market, said ecigarette sales fell 10.5 per cent in the first quarter. Lorillard shares are up more than 16 per cent so far in 2014 after the Financial Times reported the company is in merger talks with rival Reynolds American.Murray Kessler, Lorillard’s chief executive, told analysts during the company’s April earnings call that the slowdown “is directly related to the rapid rise of vaporiser sales in vape shops”.Nik Modi, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, cited Google data showing US searches for “vape shop” have reached successive record highs every month this year, while queries for “electronic cigarette” have fallen back to 2009 levels. The pattern is similar in the UK, where ecigarette sales are estimated at about £200m.Mr Kessler said vaporisers are growing faster than traditional ecigarettes “because they deliver a superior consumer experience at a better value . . . bigger batteries, more vapour, more satisfaction, lower cost to refill”.While new consumers may be comfortable starting with a traditional ecigarette, those who stick with vaping may find the products are “somewhat lacking”, said Andries Verleur, chief executive of VMR Products, which sells e-liquids, disposables and cartridge-based ecigarettes.The World Health Organisation has slapped down British American Tobacco’s attempts to involve itself in the public health debate on ecigarettes, writes Duncan Robinson.The world’s second-largest tobacco company by market share had called on the WHO to allow the FTSE 100 group to have a say on the future regulation of ecigarettes and other non-tobacco products.Continue reading“The large-scale devices solve this problem to an extent with the amount of liquid they can carry. You only need to charge and fill it once a week,” Mr Verleur said.The ability to try a wide range of flavours and nicotine levels is also appealing, and liquids tend to be cheaper than ecigarettes, widening the price gap with traditional cigarettes.Other market leaders have also taken notice. Njoy, backed by Sean Parker and Peter Thiel, has slipped from second to third place by US market share and said earlier this month it would add a refillable tank system to its product line-up in July and August. Mistic, another big brand, started selling a vaporiser in February.Analysts say such moves could push big tobacco to move more quickly into refillable systems. The two largest US cigarette makers, Altria and Reynolds, are expanding their own cigarette-like products nationally this year.Last month, Lorillard’s Mr Kessler said the challenge is to “close the performance gap relative to vaporisers and do that in months, not years”. The company is working on technical improvements, including battery strength, that he said “will minimise the defection from traditional ecigs”.Whether those changes will be enough to woo consumers is unclear. After a recent visit to a new vapour shop in New York, Ms Herzog wrote: “The cig-alike ecigs as they are today are already becoming ‘your father’s ecig’.”shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
70;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Report slams US tobacco child labour;;Children who cannot legally buy cigarettes harvest tobacco, use heavy machinery and climb into barn rafters to dry leaves. During shifts as long as 12 hours, these workers – some as young as seven – are exposed to nicotine, pesticides and extreme heat.These are not dispatches from Malawi or Kazakhstan, but a Human Rights Watch report on the US, where the world’s biggest tobacco companies, including British American Tobacco, Philip Morris International, Japan Tobacco and Altria, buy some of their leaves.The report highlights an area of reputational risk for an industry that is already spending billions of dollars a year complying with a patchwork of national and international regulations.Specific numbers are not tracked, but hundreds of thousands of children are believed to work on US farms growing all kinds of crops, from tomatoes and berries to cotton and tobacco. HRW interviewed 141 children between the ages of seven and 17 working on tobacco farms in four US states.Young agricultural workers face higher rates of death and injury than their peers, and tobacco carries added risk from nicotine. But there is little consensus on industry-wide child labour policies.India, Brazil and Russia have banned anyone under 18 from working with tobacco, but in the US, children as young as 12, and sometimes younger, can work on farms.While the report did not directly connect any companies to the farms involved, it describes “common practice” in tobacco cultivation, said co-author Jane Buchanan. “The burden falls on [the companies] to say that this isn’t happening on their farms.”Child labour is not a new concern for the industry, but approaches vary widely. Some companies, including BAT and Imperial, follow International Labour Organization conventions, which set the minimum age to work at 15 and prohibit children from hazardous work. Others, including Lorillard and Reynolds American, require suppliers to follow national laws.The burden falls on [the companies] to say that this isn’t happening on their farmsUS law allows children as young as 12 to do unlimited farm work outside of school with parental permission. There are no age limits for children working on their families’ farms. Outside of agriculture, children cannot work until they are 14 and those under 16 can only do certain jobs with limited hours.In 2011 the Obama administration proposed updates to the 1970s-era labour law, including limiting the kinds of work kids can do on farms. But those changes were scrapped after opposition from the agriculture industry.“The laws in the US are substandard,” said Dan Viederman, chief executive of Verité, a non-profit watchdog that works with Philip Morris International. “The age is lower and there are really no meaningful limits on what children can do.”The gap between US and international standards mean that companies’ policies in the US can be more lax than the rules they follow in other countries.Altria, which owns Marlboro in the US, “defers” to government regulators to define hazardous work because “we’re not experts in farm labour”, said spokesman Jeff Caldwell.Altria requires growers to assign hazardous tasks only to workers over age 18. Mr Caldwell said the company recently assessed all its contracted farms and found a “very very high” level of compliance.Human Rights Watch cited Philip Morris International, which sells Marlboro, L & M and Parliament outside the US, with creating “the most detailed and protective set of policies and procedures” on child labour.Following a 2010 HRW investigation into child labour at PMI’s suppliers in Kazakhstan, the company created a labour policy for all its growers. It sets the minimum age to work at 15 and spells out hazardous work that children under 18 cannot perform, including handling pesticides and fertilisers, harvesting plants, using sharp tools and working long hours.The laws in the US are substandard. The age is lower and there are really no meaningful limits on what children can do“In the US we are maintaining standards that are stricter than US laws both in terms of age and of hazardous activities,” said Miguel Coleta, PMI’s director of external labour policies. The company spent $30m last year to improve labour conditions at its suppliers. Since 2012, PMI has ended contracts with about 20 US growers who did not want to abide by its policies.PMI, Altria, Reynolds and Japan Tobacco are part of a group working with government, growers and labour representatives on work practices. Following a presentation by Human Rights Watch in April, the group has formed a committee on child labour.HRW said it would like to see the industry go further. The watchdog is calling on the US government to apply labour laws to agriculture and prohibit children under 18 from working with tobacco, and for companies to apply the same restrictions.“As a practical matter there is no way for children under 18 to work safely on US tobacco farms when they have direct contact with tobacco plants of any size or dried tobacco leaves, even if wearing protective equipment,” the report concluded.Mr Coleta said PMI would support some efforts to strengthen US law, but would stop short of a full ban.“We would welcome any regulatory change in the US that would meet international standards and the standards that we’re pushing,” he said. But, he added, “we don’t think this is something that we can do alone.”shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
71;MO;Altria Group;2014-02-05T22:11:14Z;Casino operators drop as Macau revenues slide;Figures underscore concerns that Chinese growth is slowing;Casino and resort operators declined sharply on Wednesday as gaming revenues in Macau, the world’s gambling capital, grew at their slowest pace in 15 months.Total casino revenues rose 7 per cent from a year earlier to 28.7bn patacas, or $3.6bn, according to Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.The results underscored heightened concerns that Chinese growth is slowing, although demand is typically depressed ahead of the Chinese new year, which began on January 31.Wall Street analysts said the figures were a disappointment, with Jake Fuller of FBR Capital Markets noting weekly data had pointed to “mid-teen” growth in January.“The Street was racing to bump estimates, targets and rating on the Macau-centric gaming stocks around year end, pushing market growth expectations to fairly aggressive levels,” Mr Fuller said. “The shortfall in January will be a concern and lead to questions over the market’s ability to reach the +18 per cent consensus for the year.”Shares in Las Vegas Sands fell as much as 8 per cent at one point but pulled back to close down 1.40 per cent to $73.98, while Wynn Resorts declined 1.87 per cent to $209.55.The two companies, which operate the Sands Macau and Wynn Macau resorts, respectively, have increasingly shifted their focus to Asia, with Wynn at work to open a new hotel and casino on the Cotai strip in 2016.Cognizant Technology Solutions shares weakened after the company said sales in 2014 would be below Wall Street estimates.The IT provider and consulting service said it expected net revenues to be at least $10.3bn and adjusted earnings to top $5.02 per share, 6 cents below expectations. Cognizant shares fell 4.29 per cent to $92.85.News that one of America’s largest pharmacy and convenience chains will stop selling cigarettes pressured shares of Lorillard and Altria.Shares in cigarette manufacturer Lorillard slid 2.33 per cent to $47.76 as Altria dropped 1.25 per cent to $34. CVS Caremark announced on Wednesday it would drop tobacco products from its shelves as it tries to recast its relationship with health-conscious consumers.The decision, which is expected to cut some $2bn in annual sales from the drugstore chain, won applause from President Barack Obama. CVS said it would try to recoup some of its lost revenues in other ways. CVS shares fell 1 per cent to $65.44.Estée Lauder shares were among the worst performing on the benchmark S&P 500 after the company said profits slid 3 per cent in the fourth quarter to $432.5m, or $1.09 per share.Management said they anticipated fiscal third-quarter profits to range between 52 and 55 cents a share, below Wall Street forecasts, as it sees “a slowing of the near-term growth trend in China and Hong Kong”. Sales in Asia-Pacific dipped 6 per cent in the three months to December.The company logged better results in Europe and the US. Sales in the UK rose at an almost double-digit rate, while those in the Americas, where the US accounts for the bulk of revenue, rose 5 per cent to $1.19bn.Estée Lauder shares fell 5.5 per cent to $65.36 in New York trading.Overall, US equity markets broadly declined before paring their losses, following weaker-than-anticipated job growth in January. ADP, the payroll processor, said the workforce expanded by 175,000 people in the month, led by small and medium-sized business growth.A separate survey of the US service sector showed some improvement in January later in the day, with rising new orders and employment levels.The S&P 500 declined 0.2 per cent to 1,751.64 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged down to 15,440.23. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite slid as much as 1.6 per cent, touching its lowest level since last November, before recovering to 4,011.55.
72;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Tobacco industry looks to ecigarettes for growth;;Demand for electronic cigarettes is booming – and big tobacco companies are hoping to get a piece of the fast growing $1bn market.In the US, the three largest manufacturers, which control 85 per cent of the domestic cigarette market, will all be selling ecigarettes by the end of the year.“They don’t want [ecigarettes] to be their Kodak moment,” says Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking & Health, a health group. Corporate history is piled with the corpses of giant companies, such as the US camera film company, brought down by consumers’ sudden adoption of new technology – and the companies behind Marlboro and Camel do not want to be added to the heap.Altria and Reynolds, the biggest and second-biggest tobacco groups in the US by sales, this month announced their plans to launch ecigarettes – rechargeable tubes that let users inhale vapour, rather than smoke, for a nicotine hit. In the UK, British American Tobacco bought an ecigarette start up at the end of 2012, while Imperial Tobacco, which owns the Golden Virginia brand, announced its own foray into the market earlier this year.Tobacco executives say they have been studying demand and have decided to test the waters. “The category is in its early stages and time will tell how it will evolve,” Marty Barrington, Altria chief executive, told investors in New York last week.“It’s like Betamax and VHS,” says David Hayes, a tobacco analyst at Nomura. “We don’t know what the preferred standard will be.”Previous attempts to get nicotine addicts to shift from traditional tobacco have been mixed. Snus – a small bag of nicotine, ingested by stuffing it under your top lip – is popular with Scandinavians but few others.In the 1990s Reynolds introduced Eclipse, a cigarette that produced heat, but did not burn. “The knock on effect was that it tasted horrible – one of these details that’s hard to get over,” points out Erik Bloomquist, an analyst at Berenberg bank. Eclipse was eventually scrapped.Ecigarettes have, so far, been an exception. US retail sales of ecigarettes could pass $1bn this year from $600m in 2012, according to Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo. In the UK, there are already 1.3m users, according to ASH.The devices are “revolutionising the tobacco industry”, says Ms Herzog, who estimates that “consumption of ecigs could surpass consumption of conventional cigs within the next decade”.Not all in the industry agree. “[Ecigarettes] will be smaller than our combustible business,” says David O’Reilly, who heads BAT’s research arm and sits on its management board. “It will be a big category, as long as we’re able to innovate,” he added.Whether or not ecigarettes will overtake traditional tobacco is a secondary concern. For tobacco executives, the fact that they provide growth in an industry where volumes have fallen steadily since 2009 is enough to pique their interest.Reynolds’ chief executive Dan Delen says ecigarettes are a category where the company expected “expanding growth to mitigate some of the volumetric decline” in traditional smoking.Altria and Reynolds both say ecigarettes will eventually command better profit margins than their tobacco counterparts, although they would not give specific estimates. Wells Fargo estimates that margins could reach the mid-40 per cent range in another five years, compared with conventional cigarette margins of about 40 per cent.Not all tobacco companies are as gung-ho about ecigarettes.Philip Morris International, the world’s largest tobacco group by sales, is the most high-profile ecigarette refusenik, and is instead focusing on developing a cigarette that heats rather than burns tobacco, producing less tar and smoke.While BAT invested about £40m in its ecigarette subsidiary CN Creative, it spent £2bn on a share buyback a few months later. Imperial Tobacco, the £22bn tobacco company based in Bristol in the southwest of the UK, will not have an electronic product out until at least 2014.The lack of enthusiasm has left some analysts perplexed, especially given Imperial’s reliance on developed markets in western Europe – an area where cigarette volumes have slumped more sharply than in the rest of the world.Time, however, is not necessarily a pressing issue. The embryonic ecigarette manufacturing sector is ripe for consolidation, with 250 operators in the UK alone. Global tobacco companies have the financial firepower to buy in to the sector once the market has settled, rather than running the risk of heading down a research cul-de-sac.Craig Weiss, chief executive of NJOY, the US leader in ecigarettes by market share, compares the devices to the introduction of filtered cigarettes in the 1950s. “They were perceived initially to be fake and artificial,” says the 39-year-old. “There was foam between you and your tobacco.”But from an initial 2 per cent of sales, filtered cigarettes came to dominate the market within a decade. He’s betting ecigarettes will follow the same path, and has won over celebrity investors including Sean Parker, the Napster founder, and Bruno Mars, the pop star.Mr Weiss argues that the big companies’ entrance into the market is positive for NJOY since it drives customers into stores in search of electronic devices and raises awareness through advertising. Ecigarettes, unlike regular cigarettes, can be advertised on television in the US. “I’m not in this business to steal market share from [rival ecigarette company] Blu,” he says. “I’m in this business to steal market share from Marlboro.”
73;MO;Altria Group;2013-06-06T18:48:02Z;Big Tobacco bets a packet on e-cigarettes;;Big Tobacco in the US is raising its bet on the growth of electronic cigarettes to offset the decline of traditional smoking with Reynolds American, the maker of Camel and Pall Mall launching its first smokeless, battery-powered device.Reynolds, the second-biggest US tobacco company by market share, has hailed e-smoking as a “game-changer” for the industry, with chief executive Dan Delen on Thursday calling the launch a “fantastic business opportunity”.Reynolds’ move comes as the industry steps up its investment in alternatives to traditional cigarettes. Marlboro-maker Altria, the biggest US manufacturer with about half of the US’s market share, plans to launch its own e-cigarette this year. Lorillard was the first big manufacturer to enter the US electronic market last year with the acquisition of Blu Ecigs for $135m.Goldman Sachs estimated that the electronic cigarette sector generated sales of about $300m in 2012 while analysts predict that revenues will reach $1bn in the next few years – a fraction of the $90bn US cigarette market but one of the few areas where sales are growing.Smoking rates in the US have been falling for years due to higher taxes, smoking bans in public places and health concerns. With traditional cigarette sales dropping an average 3 per cent a year, according to executives and analysts, the industry has come to view e-cigarettes as an opportunity to hold on to customers.E-cigarette users inhale a nicotine-laced vapour, replicating the experience of smoking without the smoke and carcinogens that are released through combustion. This means that they can be consumed indoors.Mr Delen said e-cigarettes were a category where Reynolds hoped “expanding growth [would] mitigate some of the volumetric decline” in traditional smoking.The US market is highly fragmented with about 300 companies selling Chinese-made e-cigarettes to American consumers, mainly over the internet, said Ray Story, chief executive of the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association, an industry group.He added that it was a simple process for the large manufacturers to enter the market, as “they have distribution points already set up”. Reynolds said that it would market its device, called Vuse, to existing smokers.Mr Delen said about 30 per cent of US smokers had tried e-cigarettes in the past six months, but few had made the permanent switch. Vuse will be sold in a similar way to razors and blades, with disposable cartridges that click on to a long, silver battery-powered unit.Mr Delen acknowledged that the electronic market faced an uncertain regulatory environment. The US Food and Drug Administration has said it plans to regulate e-cigarettes, but has yet to propose formal rules.“We look forward to interacting with the FDA as they begin to promulgate regulations,” Mr Delen said. “We as a company are in a great position relative to any regulation.”
74;MO;Altria Group;2013-01-21T15:37:48Z;Sales of e-cigarettes continue to soar;;Electronic cigarette makers have become increasingly aggressive in their advertising in the US, with one company even proclaiming that “Big Tobacco” has met its match. But the burgeoning industry is worried that an onslaught of taxes and regulations could snuff out its recent success.The new assertiveness comes as tobacco analysts have started to acknowledge that growing demand for “e-cigs” in the US is peeling away customers from tobacco giants such as Altria, Lorillard and RJ Reynolds.Upstarts such as NJOY, Vapor and Logic are spending more on marketing and advertising, to make the case for their products as a viable smoking alternative.E-cigarette makers have even ventured into television in both the US and UK – taboo for tobacco groups – with advertising for their products“Our mission is to ‘obsolete’ cigarettes,” said Craig Weiss, chief executive of NJOY, the leading US e-cigarette maker by market share. “We think of ourselves as the digital to their analogue.”Sales of traditional cigarettes have been declining steadily in the past decade. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, consumption of smoked tobacco products fell 27 per cent from 2000 to 2011, as taxes increased and smoking bans at bars and restaurants took hold.Meanwhile, sales of e-cigarettes have soared, doubling during the past two years to $300m in 2012 and on pace to reach $1bn in annual sales in the next few years, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs. The category is being compared with energy drinks and Greek yoghurt– bright spots in declining consumer markets.“We continue to expect consumption of e-cigarettes could surpass consumption of traditional cigarettes within the next decade,” said Bonnie Herzog, tobacco analyst at Wells Fargo.E-cigarettes work by vaporising nicotine-laced liquid that can be inhaled, replicating the effect of smoking without all of the carcinogens.The success of e-cigarettes could soon hit some obstacles, however, with health regulators preparing new restrictions on the products and state legislatures considering taxing them.E-cigarettes currently fall into a regulatory grey area. The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to offer guidance in April about how the products should be regulated. The agency lost a legal battle with e-cigarette companies in 2010 after trying to block imports of e-cigarettes and has been sceptical about claims they are not harmful.“Further research is needed to assess the potential public health benefits and risks of electronic cigarettes and other novel tobacco products,” said Jennifer Haliski, an FDA spokeswoman.Manufacturers say they are looking forward to greater oversight to make it more difficult for anyone to start importing and distributing low quality e-cigarettes to the US, but they are fearful of more states planning to tax their products.Minnesota recently moved to tax e-cigarettes and Hawaii also considered a tax last year.“The government is going to tax this industry and try to recoup the revenues they’ve lost from cigarettes,” said Eli Alelov, chief executive of Logic, a New Jersey-based e-cigarette company.Ray Story, chief executive of the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association, warned that tax rises on e-cigarettes would only benefit tobacco companies, to the detriment of public health. One reason consumers have been trying e-cigarettes is because they can be as little as half the price of traditional cigarettes sold by big tobacco companies.The increasing acceptance of e-cigarettes caught big tobacco companies off guard initially but they are slowly recognising that they cannot ignore the changing tastes of their consumers.Last year, Lorillard bought Blu Ecigs for $135m and RJ Reynolds has started to develop its own electronic cigarette technology. Altria, the US maker of Marlboro, has stayed on the sidelines thus far, but analysts expect the tobacco giant to either acquire an e-cigarette manufacturer or launch its own brand soon.Declining to divulge its plans, an Altria spokesman said: “Obviously we’re monitoring what’s going on in that category.”
75;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;US equities lower on eurozone concerns;;US equities ended the day significantly lower and the bearish sentiment was compounded after Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the S&P 500 missed analysts’ estimates.Apple shares fell more than 4.5 per cent to $572.08 in after-hours trading after reporting earnings of $9.32 per share against consensus forecast of $10.32.The drastic fall dragged down the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures, pointing to a sharply lower open on Wednesday.US stocks on Tuesday declined for the third day in a row, with the S&P 500 index down 1 per cent to 1,338.32, the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 1 per cent to 12,617.32, and the Nasdaq Composite index 1 per cent lower at 2,862.99DeVry fell the hardest of all US stocks on Tuesday after the for-profit education company revealed higher-than-expected operating costs and weakening student enrolment.The company also reported that it would cut more than 500 jobs, more than 5 per cent of its workforce.The stock, which has already lost nearly 70 per cent of its market capitalisation in the past 12 months, plummeted 24.5 per cent to $20.80 on Tuesday.“DeVry’s negative June quarter earnings pre-announcement serves as further confirmation, as if it were needed, of the ongoing fundamental pressures in the education space,” said Peter Appert, analyst at Piper Jaffray.“Particularly noteworthy was the company’s acknowledgment of increased tuition discounting and significant further margin compression,” he added. “We expect to hear more of the same as industry results are reported over the next several weeks.”Other for-profit education providers also traded lower. Direct rival Apollo Group declined 3.8 per cent to $27.81, while the Washington Post Company, which owns Kaplan, the online degree provider, slid 3.3 per cent to $343.84.Commenting after the latest set of US earnings, Stuart Freeman, chief equities strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said: “While international growth remains soft, we believe a slow recovery in Europe and continuing early signs of a domestic housing recovery have the potential to boost the domestic economy into a late-cycle stage of growth that supports another leg of the current cyclical bull market.”But nervousness on Wall Street was reflected by the CBOE Vix index, a measure of implied volatility, which jumped more than 25 per cent in the past two sessions.All sectors closed in negative territory with losses led by telecommunications, materials and energy stocks.Peabody Energy slumped 11.2 per cent to $20.55 after the company failed to meet expectations and cut back its third-quarter outlook. The coal producer has shed 66 per cent of its market capitalisation over the past 12 months.AT&T, the largest US telecoms company by revenues, reported an 8.7 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings, beating analyst estimates, but the stock fell 2.12 per cent to $34.63.In contrast, wireless provider MetroPCS was among the leaders on Wall Street, rising 5.6 per cent to $6.59.In technology news, investors responded warily to the announcement that VMware, one of the fastest growing software companies, will make a $1.3bn cash and stock purchase of Nicira Networks, a Silicon Valley start-up. The deal has been likened to Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram.“While this is a high price tag for a company with minimal revenues today, we believe this is a very smart strategic move that positions VMware well to gain a major foothold into the fertile software-defined networking area,” said Daniel Ives of FRB Capital Markets who views the purchase favourably.“They paid a lot. It does add some acquisition risk that investors will have to digest,” he added.VMware closed fractionally down at $88.89.Direct rival Cisco Systems dropped 6 per cent to $15.12 after it announced a plan to lay off 1,300 staff – about 2 per cent of its global workforce. Another VMware rival, Juniper Networks, slipped 2.7 per cent to $14.81.Lexmark, the printer manufacturer, fell 12.8 per cent to $16.77 after failing to meet earnings estimates. In the year to date the company is down just shy of 50 per centIn other earnings news, DuPont, one of the world’s largest chemical manufacturers, slipped 2 per cent to $47.74 after it reported decreased profits in the second quarter.Investors responded to the news that the company, which has been hit by global economic woes, might not meet analyst expectations for its full-year earnings.“We think second-quarter 2012 earnings were better than investor expectations, although a more cautious outlook may leave investors less satisfied,” said PJ Juvekar of Citi Research.The response to Altria’s earnings report was muted. Shares in the maker of Marlboro cigarettes traded down 0.2 per cent at $35.57, although the stock price has risen more than 30 per cent over the past 12 months.UPS, an international bellwether, dropped 4.6 per cent to $74.34 after the package delivery company’s second-quarter results missed Wall Street estimates.Netflix shares dropped sharply in after-hours trade, falling more than 14 per cent to $80.39, after the internet video streaming company released its second-quarter results and gave cautious guidance about the third quarter.
76;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Altria triples second-quarter profits;;Altria said on Tuesday that its second-quarter profits tripled, as the maker of Marlboro cigarettes in the US successfully increased prices and sold more smokeless products.Altria’s net earnings jumped from $444m, or 21 cents a share, in the second quarter of last year to $1.2bn, or 60 cents a share, in the latest quarter. Revenues rose 9.6 per cent year-on-year to $6.5bn.The results beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations, and Altria’s shares rose 0.1 per cent to $35.53 in midday trading.Bonnie Herzog, tobacco analyst at Wells Fargo, said the results were “solid”, but warned that promotions planned to bolster Marlboro sales volume during the second half of the year could cut into profit margins.Cigarette companies have been under pressure due to smoking bans, tax increases and dwindling disposable income as a result of the lingering economic downturn. Altria and other tobacco companies have been selling more alternative smokeless products to adapt to changing consumption habits.During the second quarter, Altria’s cigarette and cigar sales volumes increased by just 0.1 per cent year-on-year. Sales of smokeless products were up 7.6 per cent.“We stay close to the adult tobacco consumer,” Marty Barrington, Altria’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts. “We watch what their needs are, either articulated or unarticulated, do a lot of consumer research there and we try to make sure that we’re offering products that they want.”
77;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Plain cigarette packaging labelled unlawful;;Big tobacco companies are claiming Australia’s plain packaging law breaches the nation’s constitution because the government is effectively acquiring brands and intellectual property without compensation by suppressing branding.Philip Morris International is also challenging the law under the 1993 Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) between Australia and Hong Kong that relates to investment promotion and protection.But Australia’s Labor government is in no mood to back down. Attorney-General Nicola Roxon has accused Philip Morris of using legal tricks to try and derail the law. The former health minister alleges the company deliberately transferred ownership of its Australian business from a Swiss parent company to Hong Kong so it could launch proceedings under the Australia/Hong Kong BIT.Philip Morris says there was a legitimate business purpose for the transfer and that the deal was approved by the Australian government and the Federal Investment Review Board.Ms Roxon has also accused British American Tobacco (BAT) of using iconic Australian images to promote cigarettes in Europe – a kangaroo appears on packs of Winfield in France – and threatened to spearhead legal action against the industry. The government claims 15,000 Australians die each year from tobacco-related diseases.Professor Gillian Triggs, from the University of Sydney, says big tobacco may find it difficult to prove the plain packaging law breaches the constitution.“The question is whether the Australian government is acquiring intellectual property or destroying it,” says Prof Triggs. “And there’s a strong argument that it’s not an acquisition.”However, a challenge from BAT, to be conducted under the arbitration rules of the UN Commission on International Trade Law, has a greater chance of success, she said.“At the international level, the argument will be whether a government can adopt a policy that is not demonstrably based on scientific fact. There does not appear to be any scientific evidence that plain packaging has a demonstrable positive effect on public health.”
78;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Imperial’s Spanish losses continues;;A combination of anti-smoking regulation, higher taxes and a price war precipitated a double-digit fall in cigarette volumes in the key Spanish market during the first quarter for Imperial Tobacco.The FTSE 100 company, which owns Davidoff and Gauloises brands, declined to specify the extent of the fall for the three months to 31 December but said it expected the rate of decline to slow during the remainder of the year.It caps a miserable year for Imperial in Spain, its biggest single market by revenue after Germany and the UK, coming in the wake of a profit warning last June due to a price war with rivals BAT and Philip Morris.In November Imperial reported its full year operating profit in Spain had fallen by more than a quarter to £200m.Jonathan Fell at Deutsche Bank said he expected the losses to moderate.“The extent of the volume loss in Spain is very unusual in the context of developed cigarette markets – but it’s the result of higher taxes, more regulation and worse economic circumstances…the economic situation might not improve rapidly but the impact of other factors should reduce so we shouldn’t be seeing the market decline at a double-digit rate this year.”The tough market in Spain, as well as trade sanctions in Syria and price increases in the US, saw Imperial’s overall cigarette volumes drop 7 per cent contributing to a 1 per cent decline in net tobacco revenue. However, cigar chompers in Russia and China boosted Imperial’s luxury cigar volumes in emerging markets by 14 per cent.Alison Cooper, Imperial’s chief executive, said the company was focusing on its four strategic brands - Davidoff, Gauloises, West and JPS - in Asia-Pacific, Africa and the Middle East.“Combined stick equivalent volumes of our key strategic brands were up 3 per cent and net revenues up 10 per cent with our focus on driving growth in these brands in emerging markets and fine cut tobacco in the EU,” she said.Shares in Imperial Tobacco closed up 1.45 per cent at £23.03.FT COMMENTThe received wisdom that tobacco stocks like Imperial provide a haven during times of economic uncertainty has been shaken by the company’s pain in Spain. Imperial shares, after a 27 per cent price increase during 2011 boosted by a £320m buy-back, have declined by 5 per cent since the beginning of the year. While volatile Spanish consumption should smooth out, stronger pricing has led to what the company said is an “underlying” increase in net revenue of 3 per cent. That’s bolstered by a strategy of persuading smokers in emerging markets to trade up to Imperial’s premium brands. Priced at 11 times 2012 earnings Imperial shares are cheap compared with its peers such as BAT on over 15 times. If the company’s Iberian troubles moderate that could be good value.
79;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Altria reports tobacco customer’s shift;;Altria, the biggest US tobacco company and maker of Marlboro cigarettes, says customers are moving increasingly to its discount brands and smokeless tobacco products in the face of price increases and smoking bans.On Friday, Altria made two announcements that could mark a shift in long-term strategy. Michael Szymanczyk, the company’s 63-year-old chief executive, said he was retiring and will be replaced by Martin Barrington, the group’s vice-chairman.Separately, Altria said it had entered into an agreement with Okono, an affiliate of Fertin Pharma, the Danish maker of nicotine chewing gum, to develop “non-combustible” tobacco products.“Altria continues to focus on developing lower-risk products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers,” Mr Szymanczyk said.The moves came as Altria announced a 9 per cent year-on-year decline in its fourth quarter net earnings to $837m, or 41 cents a share, as restructuring charges weighed on the results. Last October, the company announced a cost reduction programme intended to save $400m a year to help cope with declining cigarette sales volumes.Sales volume of Marlboro cigarettes declined by 0.6 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter, while Altria’s other premium brands were down by 7.2 per cent. Meanwhile, volume for its discount brands jumped nearly 20 per cent and smokeless products were up 9.7 per cent.Overall, revenues were up 3.4 per cent from a year ago to $6.1bn in the fourth quarter.“Despite heightened promos, Marlboro’s retail share continues to decline,” said Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo.Ms Herzog noted that second-tier tobacco brands were battling for supremacy and taking market share from more expensive premium cigarettes. The shift, she said, is, “fuelled in part by a challenged consumer that is prone to downgrading”.Altria’s results come as the tobacco industry continues to face pressure from bans, taxation and threats of greater regulation on packaging and menthol products.Although Mr Szymanczyk acknowledged the changes occurring in the cigarette market he said that it was important for Marlboro to maintain “modest momentum” so that the company maintains profit growth. Altria, which recently made packaging changes to some of its Marlboro brands, said it would announce more brand-building plans next month.Altria shares fell 1.57 per cent to $28.21 in midday trading on Friday.
80;MO;Altria Group;2011-11-21T10:33:22Z;Australia stubs out tobacco packaging;;Big tobacco companies have started the legal fightback against a new law in Australia requiring cigarettes be sold in plain, unbranded packages – the world’s first of its kind.Philip Morris, the world’s largest cigarette maker by sales, issued a legal challenge to the new law shortly after the Australian parliament approved it Monday, fearing it could set a precedent for other countries to take similar action in a bid to reduce smoking.The company, which has just under 40 per cent of Australia’s tobacco market, is seeking the suspension of the law and compensation for damages, which it says could amount to “billions of dollars”.Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, which is also planning a legal challenge to the bill, argue that the law unconstitutionally limits their ability to use their intellectual property without compensation.Australia, the first country to require plain packaging, will be an important test case for other nations, including the UK, that are considering similar restrictions.“Plain packaging means that the glamour is gone from smoking,” Australia’s health minister, Nicola Roxon, said.Some countries, including many from Latin America, have criticised the plain packaging law for its impact on small tobacco producers and raised the issue in meetings of the World Trade Organisation. Tobacco companies argue plain packaging will make it easier for counterfeiters to fake their products.The law is expected to be formally approved by the country’s governor-general in the next fortnight, after which it will take formal force, although the actual new packaging will not be used until December 2012. BAT, Australia’s market leader with a 46 per cent share, said it will officially file its separate legal action with the Australian High Court after the law receives the governor-general’s royal approval.Philip Morris says the plain packaging legislation violates both Australian law and the bilateral investment treaty between Australia and Hong Kong where the company’s Asian operations are based.A Philip Morris spokeswoman said in a statement: “The government has passed this legislation despite being unable to demonstrate that it will be effective at reducing smoking and has ignored the widespread concerns raised in Australia and internationally regarding the serious legal issues associated with plain packaging.”Arbitration between multinational companies and countries in Asia remains rare, said lawyers in the field, and the resolution in Philip Morris’s case could set precedent for future cases by companies considering using arbitration in challenging a state decision or new law.Robert Pé, a lawyer with Orrick who specialises in dispute resolution in Asia, said: “If Australia were eventually to lose this arbitration [case] that might dissuade governments of other countries from adopting such radical legislation as Australia has adopted.”
81;MO;Altria Group;2011-10-26T22:25:08Z;BAT points to rising illicit sales;;The illicit cigarette trade has become the tobacco industry’s fourth-biggest business by volume worldwide according to British American Tobacco, as government tax increases push hard-up smokers towards the black market.“The illicit trade, taken as a whole, is number four [worldwide] by volume behind BAT, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco,” said Michael Prideaux, BAT’s director of corporate affairs. “[It represents] anything between 6-12 per cent of global volume, so between 330-660bn cigarettes a year.”In a trading statement, the owner of the Lucky Strike and Dunhill brands warned the expansion of illicit trade remained a threat to legal trade “driven by shock excise increases and pressure on consumers’ disposable income”.Despite a fragile spending environment BAT revealed 7 per cent revenue growth in the nine months to 30 September compared with the same period last year, buoyed by an increase in prices and a focus on smokers in emerging markets.Nicandro Durante, BAT’s chief executive, said the results showed the company is “on track for another year of good earnings growth.” The company cited good performances by BAT’s four so-called ‘global brands’ – Kent, Dunhill, Pall Mall and Lucky Strike – particularly in emerging markets such as Russia, Pakistan and Romania. Mr Prideaux said the company also benefited from solid growth in Japan, Australia, France and Germany.Overall volumes declined 0.4 per cent this year, although this narrowed from a 1.8 per cent decline in the first quarter.Robbie Aitken, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, said the results showed the company was on a positive trend. “We’re seeing an improving trend in terms of price mix and volumes,” he said. “The volume declines look to be moderating and I think the consumers have proved they can soak up the price increases.” In May BAT pushed further into emerging markets by acquiring Columbia’s second largest cigarette company, the privately owned Protabaco, for $452m.The company, which has an undrawn credit facility of £2bn ($3.2bn), said it spent £622m buying back 23m shares, or about 1.2 per cent of the existing share capital, so far this year.BAT shares rose 43.5p, or 2 per cent, to £28.96.● FT CommentThe latest quarterly salvo by BAT bolsters conventional wisdom about tobacco being a defensive stock during a recession: smokers don’t quit just because there’s a downturn. Moreover, the company’s impressive revenue growth shows higher prices and a focus on emerging markets can compensate for declining volumes. Such a strategy, coupled with its global footprint, means BAT is on track to meet analysts’ consensus of slightly more than £6bn in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation matching last years year-on-year earnings increase of nearly £600m. Investors have to pay for steady growth in uncertain times but, at 13.5 times 2012 earnings BAT’s shares look fully priced compared to smaller peer Imperial on 10.8 times.
82;MO;Altria Group;2011-10-20T17:34:13Z;Philip Morris fumes at ‘plain’ Australian plan;;Philip Morris International, the world’s largest cigarette maker by sales, hit out at the Australian government on Thursday for its plan to introduce plain, brandless, cigarette packaging, arguing that the move would undermine public health objectives and violate intellectual property protections.“The Australian government seems intent on ignoring these adverse consequences on introducing such a regulation,” Hermann Waldeme, chief financial officer of Philip Morris, said on a call with analysts. “We are therefore vigorously pursuing several legal avenues to challenge this unreasonable proposal and protect our valuable brands.”Last April, the Australian government proposed making all cigarette packets logo-free in a dull green colour displaying graphic images of smoking-related diseases. Brand names would be marked with a standard colour, size and font on the package.In June, Philip Morris threatened to sue the Australian government and on Thursday the company said it was “ramping up” its efforts to prepare for a legal battle if the proposal is passed.“Of course, we are in full swing to be ready for this situation,” Mr Waldeme said.Meanwhile, Mr Waldeme argued that there is no evidence that plain packaging would reduce cigarette consumption or youth smoking and said that, in fact, it would lower prices and increase illicit trade.Philip Morris also said it is bracing for an onslaught of new excise taxes, as governments facing budget crises look for more revenue. Mr Waldeme called such efforts “disruptive,” but said that most governments have realised that cigarette taxes have little impact on long-term revenues.In spite of the challenges facing the tobacco industry, Philip Morris reported robust third-quarter earnings. Net income rose 30.1 per cent to $2.46bn, or $1.35 a share, from a year ago as net revenues jumped 22.3 per cent year-on-year to $20.7bn.Cigarette shipment volumes were weak in Europe, declining by 3.5 per cent from a year ago. But this was offset by a 12.6 per cent increase in Asia, which Philip Morris calls its “growth engine”. The company, which is best known for its Marlboro brand, raised prices in Japan, Australia and Indonesia, but customers there proved willing absorb the increases.Bonnie Herzog, tobacco analyst at Wells Fargo, called the results “impressive” and said that Philip Morris was “firing on all cylinders”.Shares of Philip Morris closed 3.3 per cent higher at $68.19 on Thursday.
83;MO;Altria Group;2011-08-12T15:25:24Z;SABMiller still circles Foster’s;Rout in equity markets is a factor;SABMiller is preparing the ground for a renewed assault on Foster’s, the Australian brewer which in June rejected its A$9.5bn takeover offer.The world’s second-largest brewer by sales has been rounding up lenders, to ensure it has bank funding in place, and is plotting its next steps. While the company – and its investors – would be reluctant to put more cash on the table, SABMiller could ratchet up pressure by tabling a formal offer.Last week’s market turmoil has rendered Foster’s more affordable in two ways. The Aussie dollar, which peaked this month at a nearly three-decade high of $1.1081, on Friday fell back to $1.0291.The rout in equity markets has also weakened Foster’s hand, as has the absence, to date, of rival bidders.SABMiller is unlikely to act before the Australian brewer reports its full-year results, due on Tuesday week. Analysts – reading across from numbers at rival Lion Nathan – expect beer profits to be weak.Foster’s share price last week dipped below SABMiller’s non-binding proposal of A$4.90 per share, which represented an 8.2 per cent premium to Foster’s closing share price on June 20, when the offer was launched.The shares closed the week a whisper above SABMiller’s offer, suggesting the market is still counting on the UK-listed brewer to snap up its quarry.However, for Foster’s to accept the current offer would entail chief executive John Pollaers “having to eat a lot of humble pie … they would have to get round management ego and a lot of posturing first,” according to Trevor Stirling, an analyst at Bernstein Research.At the time of the offer Mr Pollaers said: “The value put on the table was so far away from reality that it wasn’t worth engaging [with SABMiller].”Some SABMiller investors have expressed disquiet at a deal which takes the brewer, which currently obtains more than four-fifths of its sales from emerging markets, deeper into lower-growth mature parts. Emerging market exposure would drop to about 70 per cent, still high relative to the peer group.Those investors would rather SABMiller paid back cash to shareholders.However, that is no deterrent for the two biggest shareholders, who have signed off on the deal. Philip Morris-owner Altria, with 27 per cent, is already cash rich, holding $2.3bn of cash on its balance sheet at end-2010.Similarly, Mr Stirling said, the Santo Domingo family with 15 per cent, a legacy of the Bavaria takeover in 2005, may feel they already have plenty of emerging market exposure and be keen for some diversification.SABMiller declined to comment.
84;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T03:31:47+0000;Break-ups are part of make-up;;Kraft is no stranger to break-ups. The US food group itself was created in a separation from parent Phillip Morris, which after a 2001 initial public offering sold the remainder of its stake six years later.The company also benefited from splits elsewhere, launching its $19bn hostile bid for Cadbury three years after Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, successfully lobbied for the confectioner to shed its soft drinks arm.That deal, Kraft said, pre-empted the latest move to divide into a cash-generative, US-focused grocery group and a snacks business focused growth in developing markets.In doing so, the group has joined a growing list of US companies opting for focus, in a bid to increase the valuations given to their constituent parts and improve operational performance.Companies in the oil sector, notably Conoco-Phillips, have decided to divide downstream refining from exploration and production operations. Sara Lee, Fortune Brands and ITT have also announced separations in the past year.“It all starts with a judgement by the board that there is a persistent undervaluation of the pre-split or pre-spin business,” said Roger Altman, founder of Evercore Partners, which has advised companies including Tyco, Cendant and Kraft on their separations.“If we are in some kind of correction phase from a market point of view, we will probably see more of these,” added Mr Altman, as markets tumbled on Thursday. “The frequency of undervaluations as seen by boards will increase.”Divestments already account for close to a record share of global mergers and acquisitions activity so far this year, according to Dealogic. In the US, spin-offs are close to 6 per cent of total deals, up from less than 2 per cent in 2010.People familiar with Kraft’s thinking said that it had become clear that the market was not giving the company credit for the higher-growth snacks business, bolstered by purchases including LU biscuits and Cadbury.While valuations vary over time, food companies with greater emerging markets exposure, such as Danone and Nestlé, should trade on earnings multiples in the high teens, they added. US-centric businesses, or those focused on maximising cash flow from prominent brands, tend instead to command a low to mid teens multiple.But beyond a financial arbitrage, companies are reassessing the operational benefits of keeping distinct business lines together, say bankers. In reality, concede advisers privately, investment fashions come and go. Kraft, after all, had until Thursday spent a decade diversifying from its roots in US food, after the 2000 merger with Nabisco.For Kraft, the theory goes, managers in its grocery arm will be able to focus on cutting costs and marketing well-known brands, while those in the racier snack business concentrate on investment in new products and new distribution channels globally.Activist investors have also played a role in kick-starting or accelerating companies’ efforts to refocus their operations.Pershing Square, which owns a 1.3 per cent stake in Kraft, was active in encouraging Fortune Brands to divide its hotch potch of businesses. Meanwhile, activist investor Jana Partners this week joined forces with a Canadian pension plan to press for a break-up at McGraw-Hill, whose businesses span text books to credit ratings.
85;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
86;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;BAT snaps up Colombian group for $452m;;British American Tobacco has cashed in on Philip Morris’s antitrust problems with the purchase of Colombia’s second-biggest cigarette maker, a deal agreed by BAT’s US rival in 2009 but scuppered by competition authorities last year.Productora Tabacalera de Colombia makes Mustang cigarettes, the second most popular brand in the country, with an 18 per cent market share. The $452m (£277m) deal will make BAT the second-largest tobacco group in Colombia after Philip Morris.The privately owned company sold 5.5bn cigarettes last year, and its addition will boost BAT’s volumes in the Americas by 3.7 per cent to almost 200bn. It should add 2 per cent to sales in the region.BAT is paying the same price agreed by Philip Morris in July 2009, which represents a multiple of 11.3 times the Colombian company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $40m last year. It will be funded by balance sheet cash.Philip Morris dropped its bid this January, saying regulatory approval had proved “too burdensome”. The company is already number one in the country and would have had to dispose of some brands to win approval for the Productora Tabacalera deal.Jonathan Fell, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said BAT was the obvious buyer following the collapse of the Philip Morris deal, since Japan Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco – the number three and four global groups in the sector – have only a minimal presence in South America. “It’s not like you could even use Colombia as a bridgehead, because the other countries are all sewn up,” he said.Nicandro Durante, BAT’s new chief executive, has said his focus in the first few years at the helm will be on organic growth, but he did not rule out bolt-on acquisitions to extend the company’s exposure to the developing world where cigarette volumes are growing.Analysts said that after paying down debt following the last round of industry consolidation – which ended with the purchase by Imperial in 2008 of Altadis, the world’s fifth-biggest tobacco group – the global leaders have cash to spend.Fulvio Cazzol, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, said the forward net debt to ebitda ratio for the sector had fallen from 3.2 times in 2007-08 to 1.5 times now.However, this deal falls far short of the “significant consolidation opportunities” highlighted by Goldman analysts, including a possible acquisition of Imperial Tobacco by BAT.BAT’s shares rose 1.2 per cent on Thursday, to £27.12. It shares are rated more highly than those of its peers Imperial and Japan Tobacco, in part because of its exposure to the developing world.
87;MO;Altria Group;2011-05-20T19:20:28Z;Imperial reflects downdrift at price war fears with Philip Morris;;Fears of a price war sent Imperial Tobacco sliding on Friday as the London market drifted lower.Imperial lost 1.3 per cent to £21.86 as pressure from the Marlboro-maker Philip Morris forced it to cut prices in Spain, which contributes about 8 per cent of group profit.The decision follows six months of jostling between Spain’s main cigarette companies after British American Tobacco moved to take market share from its rivals by not passing on a tax increase to customers.BAT capitulated and raised prices at the start of May, action Imperial followed immediately. But Philip Morris revealed on Thursday that it was not to follow suit, leading Imperial to reverse its price rise.Citigroup reckoned these skirmishes were symptomatic of a wider deterioration in worldwide tobacco pricing. “In an industry that has been marked by excellent price discipline in recent years, there is evidence that that discipline has weakened,” it said.But Royal Bank of Scotland, Imperial’s house broker, said the impact on group profits would be negligible. It would advise clients to treat the weakness as a buying opportunity.BAT, for which Spain contributes less than 1 per cent of earnings, rose by 0.8 per cent to £27.45.Financial stocks dragged on the wider market as concerns intensified about Greece and the eurozone. Having been up as much as 1 per cent in advance of a mid-morning expiry of options contracts, the FTSE 100 erased gains to close down 0.1 per cent or 7.5 points at 5,948.49. That left the index up 0.4 per cent for the week.Lloyds Banking Group was Friday’s top blue-chip faller, dropping 2.9 per cent to a one-year low of 51.6p. Late on Thursday, Goldman Sachs cut long-term earnings forecasts for the bank by as much as 88 per cent.Amec, the industrial services group, lost 1.1 per cent to £11.74 after a capital markets day that analysts described as “solid rather than spectacular”. Collins Stewart downgraded Amec to “hold”, arguing that there were no catalysts for outperformance on the horizon beyond the conversion of its acquisition pipeline.Among the gainers, BP jumped by 2.7 per cent to 460p after Mitsui, 10 per cent partner on its Macondo field in the Gulf of Mexico, agreed to settle all claims between the companies in regard to last year’s rig disaster.“Put bluntly, we believe the implications for BP are monumental,” said JPMorgan. “A rational partner has concluded, based on a complete set of evidence and investigatory reports, that Macondo was both multi-party and multi-causal in nature.“We believe this must make it more likely that the US Department of Justice will share its conclusions. This reduces the chances of a worst-case fine under the Clean Water Act of up to $18bn versus BP’s provision of $3.5bn.”Primark owner AB Foods rose 3.1 per cent to £10.90 after Exane BNP Paribas advised a switch out of Tate & Lyle, which weakened by 2.2 per cent to 614p.Micro Focus jumped 7.8 per cent to 398½p on confirmation that private equity groups Advent International and Bain Capital were interested in bidding. The IT company said last month that it had received takeover approaches, rumoured to be between 425p and 450p per share.Banking software maker Misys took on 0.9 per cent to 360p on continued speculation that Sungard, the US IT group, was a potential bidder. Aveva, the maker of design software for shipbuilders, added 4.2 per cent to £16.18 on a revival of gossip that it may be a target for Oracle or SAP.Howden Joinery, formerly MFI’s kitchens wholesaler, gained 0.5 per cent to 115½p amid speculation it may be a takeover target for Travis Perkins. Evolution Securities argued this week that Travis, off 1.5 per cent to £10.32, was ready to make acquisitions and was seeking to add kitchens to its portfolio. The building supplies group could afford to bid up to 164p per share for Howden on existing resources, it said.TalkTalk, the broadband provider, gained 4 per cent to 145¾p after Goldman Sachs reheated bid theories.“TalkTalk could be an attractive M&A candidate for a UK fixed-line player seeking scale . . . or a mobile operator that believes in the cross-selling opportunities of fixed-mobile convergence,” it said in a note raising the stock to “buy”.An upgrade by Goldman also lifted ITE Group, the eastern Europe-focused conference organiser, by 3.9 per cent to 243½p.Mitchells & Butlers dropped 3.9 per cent to 243½p after the pubs group provided no news on reinstating its dividend or appointing a new chief. A JPMorgan Cazenove downgrade to “neutral” on valuation grounds also weighed on the shares.
88;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Japan ‘panics’ over lack of cigarettes;;Foreign cigarette makers have taken the unusual step of air freighting cigarettes to Japan to make up for a plunge in supplies, after last month’s natural disaster knocked out a third of the country’s cigarette production.British American Tobacco and Philip Morris are racing to import cigarettes from the US and Europe to meet strong demand for their products, following earthquake damage to two cigarette factories of Japan Tobacco, the country’s dominant producer.“We have received what might be described as panicked orders from retailers after the March 11 disaster,” said a representative of BAT Japan.“Certainly demand for our products has increased, since some people who buy JT products are buying our products (instead),” a Philip Morris representative said.JT, which controls 65 per cent of the market, suffered damage at two cigarette production facilities in northeastern Japan and has stopped all cigarette shipments in the past 10 days in order to reorganise production to focus on its best-selling brands and build inventory.It will try to resume production at two factories next week and will only be shipping 25 per cent of its normal volumes this month, it said.To meet potentially pent-up demand, BAT has doubled inventories from one to two months while Philip Morris also said inventory levels had risen.JT is also suffering a shortage of cigarette filters, after one of four filter producing factories owned by a subsidiary was damaged in the disaster.The group aims to bring cigarette production back to 90 per cent of normal volumes by the end of May, when it will ship 25 of its leading brands that represent about 65 per cent of its revenues.JT’s plight comes as an unexpected windfall for BAT and Philip Morris, whose market share in Japan is about 11 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.Japan is the fifth largest cigarette market in the world by volume but the high price of cigarettes – a pack of the leading brand costs Y440 – makes it a lucrative market.Consequently, Japan “is a very important market for companies that sell premium products”, said BAT.The boost to profits in Japan comes as global cigarette groups face tighter regulations in Australia, which is imposing plain packaging for all makers.Cigarettes are among a diverse range of daily goods that are in still in short supply as a result of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which led to the death or disappearance of more than 27,000 people.The disaster has highlighted the role of the earthquake and tsunami-devastated Tohoku region as a production base for many products that are low-tech but nonetheless constitute a crucial link in the supply chain of everyday goods.Production of bottled drinks, for example, has had to be cut, in part due to a lack of bottle caps.Two of Japan’s top three bottle cap makers, Japan Crown Cork and Yamamura Glass, which supply about two-thirds of the Japanese market, have not been able to resume operations at their Tohoku factories since last month’s disaster.
89;MO;Altria Group;2011-03-18T22:53:05Z;US panel backs menthol cigarette ban;;An advisory panel for the US Food and Drug Administration said on Friday that removing menthol cigarettes from the market would be beneficial to public health, potentially dealing a blow to the tobacco industry if a ban is implemented.The draft report came after a year of research into menthol cigarettes after other forms of flavoured tobacco were banned. The FDA will review the report by the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee and could ban them if it determines that menthol cigarettes are more dangerous than non-menthols.The group concluded that menthol cigarettes, which provide a cooling sensation, entice young smokers and make quitting more difficult. It did not present clear evidence that menthol cigarettes create more exposure to toxins but its findings make a ban more likely.The US tobacco industry has maintained that there is no “meaningful” difference between the effects of menthol and non-menthol cigarettes in terms of chronic smoking-related diseases.Lorillard, which makes Newport cigarettes, and RJ Reynolds Tobacco, which makes Camel, Salem and Kool menthol brands, would see the most damage to its business from a menthol ban in the US.“Menthol brands account for about 30 per cent of cigarette sales volumes and $25bn of retail sales, so a ban would hit hard on industry revenues,” Moody’s, the credit rating agency, said in a report on Friday.Lorillard, which generates 90 per cent of its revenue from menthol cigarettes would be hit the hardest, according to Moody’s. However, other companies such as Altria Group, which makes Marlboro, could benefit as menthol smokers switch brands.Moody’s projects that overall cigarette sales volumes in the US would fall by 8 to 10 per cent if a menthol ban was imposed and then decline at a rate of 3 to 4 per cent thereafter.Jeffery Gentry, chief scientific officer of RJ Reynolds, said: “Several key issues, such as a potential increase in cigarette smuggling and contraband if menthol cigarettes were eliminated from the market, need additional study.“We continue to believe that any final decision by the agency should be based on sound science.”Lorillard did not comment on the report.Last month, the companies filed a joint lawsuit against the advisory committee in an effort to block the group’s findings. The lawsuit alleged that three members of the advisory panel had conflicts of interest because they had earned thousands of dollars as expert witnesses in litigation against tobacco companies.The American Wholesalers Marketing Association warned on Thursday that a ban on menthol cigarettes would be ineffective and would likely create a “significant contraband market”.The possibility of a ban has also generated resistance from the African-American community. The FDA estimates that 80 per cent of black smokers smoke menthol cigarettes.“Menthol flavour is the favourite of African-Americans who smoke cigarettes,” said Harry Alford, president of the National Black Chamber of Commerce. “They want to strike a big blow directed at us black folks.”
90;MO;Altria Group;2011-02-19T00:54:10Z;McKessy to run SEC whistleblower office;;The Securities and Exchange Commission has named Sean McKessy to lead its new whistleblower office.Mr McKessy is a former SEC enforcement attorney who since 2000 has worked at Altria Group, AOL and Caterpillar in compliance-related positions. He is the first person to run the whistleblower office, which was created by the Dodd-Frank law in response to the agency’s failure to follow up on several tips that Bernard Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme.The SEC still needs to fill several other positions created by the financial regulation law, including heads for a credit rating agency unit, an office of an investor advocate and an office of women and minority inclusion.The whistleblower office is a high-profile slot within the agency. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said the agency receives over 1m tips a year.The SEC faces an April deadline to approve rules governing its handling of whistleblower complaints and craft procedures for granting rewards for tips that lead to successful enforcement actions. Several companies have said they are concerned the rule will undermine corporate compliance programs.Separately, Diego Ruiz resigned as executive director, where he oversaw the SEC’s finances, human resources and leasing. The SEC said he is returning to the private sector.
91;MO;Altria Group;2010-10-20T23:12:13Z;Smokeless tobacco boosts Altria earnings;;Altria, the US tobacco group, said its third-quarter profits increased 28 per cent to $1.1bn as its flagship cigarette, Marlboro, gained market share and sales of smokeless tobacco rose.Revenue climbed 1.6 per cent to $6.4bn, with cigarettes accounting for $5.7bn of sales, smokeless tobacco $389m, cigars $147m, wine $107m and financial services $30m, the company said on Wednesday.In spite of the contraction of overall demand for cigarettes, Marlboro’s share of the US retail market rose to 42.6 per cent during the third quarter from 41.9 per cent in the same period of the previous year.Through internal cost management, Altria increased its operating income for cigarettes by 15 per cent over the prior year. Sales of smokeless tobacco products, including Skol and Copenhagen, rose 10 per cent. Operating income in the category was up 65 per cent.“We are seeing increased interest among adult tobacco consumers” in smokeless tobacco, said Michael Szymanczyk, Altria chief executive. “We are optimistic about long-term prospects for these kinds of products.”Mr Szymanczyk said the company’s new merchandising programme for smokeless tobacco products, involving the installation of in-store product displays, could help boost sales.“The smokeless tobacco category historically has not received the necessary merchandising space in retail stores,” he said.“By offering fixtures, retailers can improve merchandising, reduce out of stock and help achieve objectives.”David Beran, chief financial officer, attributed the company’s increased profitability to higher prices for its cigarettes, cost savings and reduced promotional spending.Overall, the company estimates the cigarette market is declining at a rate of 4 per cent annually, while the smokeless tobacco category is on a 7 per cent growth track.Altria, which markets Marlboro and other Philip Morris branded cigarettes, raised prices on its US brands by 8 cents per pack in May. The company said the average price per pack of Marlboros in the US was $5.63, while the average pack of cigarettes cost $4.19. The average state excise tax levied on each pack of cigarettes was $1.36.
92;MO;Altria Group;2010-10-20T19:49:04Z;Altria;Smokeless tobacco fuels sales and profits rise;The king of snuff died this month, but the company Louise Burtle chaired for two decades lives on as part of Altria, which acquired US Smokeless Tobacco in January 2009. Mr Burtle’s tactic of aiming fruity flavours at youths has shared the fate of most forms of nicotine marketing, but snuff is one of the few areas of growth left for the US’s largest cigarette maker.In Altria’s third quarter, reported on Wednesday, smokeless tobacco sales were a 10th higher than last year. To UST’s well established Skoal and Copenhagen lines, Altria has added Marlboro-branded snuff. With integration savings, operating profits in the division were a third higher.Yet if this is the growth opportunity, investors might still cough nervously. Smokeless profits were flattered by last year’s expense of rolling out Marlboro Snus. The growth is also helped by discounting, pushing down average prices and suggesting a market with relatively dim prospects for ongoing expansion.Furthermore, in stock market terms at least, tobacco has already been rehabilitated. From a valuation low of just two times prospective earnings in 2003, Altria has steadily risen to the lofty 13 times rating it currently holds. And since the spin-out of Philip Morris International was completed in 2008, the company operates purely in the mature US market it dominates via Marlboro’s 43 per cent share.Marlboro smokers are ageing and conservative, though, meaning point-of-sale innovation is the last marketing tool aside from price left to Altria. And Marlboro’s market share has only ever been matched in the past by Camel in 1925, notes Credit Suisse. Marketing obstructions make challenging the brand by rivals difficult. Still, history would suggest Marlboro’s share has peaked in the US and the dwindling sales of past favourites (Lucky Strikes, Pall Mall and Winston, for instance), point to tougher times ahead.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
93;MO;Altria Group;2010-10-20T18:17:20Z;Mexico raises deficit in 2011 budget;;Mexico’s 2011 budget will contain a higher deficit than the one originally proposed by centre-right President Felipe Calderón after legislators on Wednesday agreed on the composition of next year’s government income.The new deficit, equivalent to 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product against 0.3 per cent originally proposed by Mr Calderón, comes barely a year after two of the world’s top-three credit-rating agencies downgraded Mexico one notch on the back of a deteriorating fiscal outlook.But on Wednesday, the country’s finance ministry downplayed the larger projected deficit. Miguel Messmacher, head of economic planning, said: “In spite of the changes, the deficit’s downward trend remains intact.” This year, the deficit was set at 0.7 per cent of GDP.The government managed to kill off a plan by opposition legislators of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to reduce value added tax from 16 per cent to 15 per cent.Mr Calderón’s administration had argued that such a reduction would have been irresponsible given the country’s already-low tax take as well as Mexico’s dependence on oil revenue.Overall, next year’s budget predicts economic growth at 3.9 per cent – slightly higher than the government’s original projection of 3.8 per cent – and an average oil price of $65.40 a barrel, $2 more than the government’s proposal.In addition, legislators agreed to slap a 25 per cent tax on energy drinks as well as raise the price of the packet of cigarettes seven pesos. In response, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, the two largest companies in Mexico’s cigarette market, threatened to withdraw their investments, according to the El Universal newspaper.The paper quoted the company as saying the proposed tax “put seriously at risk our investment and expansion plans, and threatens hundreds of direct and indirect jobs”.Together, the changes to the government’s original proposal are designed to generate an additional 60bn pesos, which lawmakers have earmarked for spending in areas of the country that have been hit by tropical storms and torrential rain in recent months.The approved revenue package will now go to the Senate, which must give a green light to the budget by the end of this month. The spending package, which is always potentially more divisive than the revenue portion, must be approved by November 15.
94;MO;Altria Group;2010-10-05T17:16:39Z;Cheap bonds help fuel share buy-back rebound;Groups exploit attractive relative cost of debt to equity;"Are companies starting to turn the dial away from bondholders and towards shareholders?It is a question investors and analysts are increasingly asking as the cheapness of debt and relative costliness of equity gives companies big opportunities. Some groups such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are already exploiting what UBS is calling the most attractive relative cost of debt-to-equity in 30 years by issuing bonds in order to buy back shares.“We think we are at a tipping point in terms of corporate behaviour. Companies have been deleveraging and have got ample cash on their balance sheets: we believe we are at the start of the process where the focus will shift back to shareholders,” says Sunil Kapadia, global asset allocation strategist at UBS.With equities still an unfashionable asset class for most investors and companies hoarding record amounts of cash, investors are urging companies to take the matter into their own hands and take action to prop up their own valuations. “I can’t see investors changing their minds any time soon so in a way it has been left up to companies to step in and act as asset allocators,” says Robert Buckland, equity strategist at Citi.One side of the coin is the well-known cheapness of issuing bonds. Microsoft set a new record last month when it issued three-year debt with a coupon of just 0.875 per cent. On the flip side is the relatively high cost of equity. Comparing the free cash flow yield of stocks and shares against the yield for US Treasuries, Citi analysts found that the difference between the two has become positive in the past few years in both the US and Europe.That gives companies an enticing arbitrage opportunity between the cost of debt and equity. The question is: how many of them will take it on? Mr Buckland says: “If you can borrow money in the corporate bond market at 3 or 4 per cent and buy cash flow in equity markets at 7 per cent, then you have got a 3 or 4 per cent carry. Some companies are going to take this on.”Evidence is already building that many companies are prepared to do this as share buy-back activity starts to rebound after plummeting last year.Data from Birinyi Associates, a research group, shows that in the second quarter of this year executed buy-backs – those that actually happened compared with those that were merely announced – rose to $85bn in the US. That is back where buy-backs were in the middle of 2005, although this is still a long way off the peak of $228bn reached in the third quarter of 2007.Mark Bamford, head of global fixed-income syndicate at Barclays Capital, says: “We are seeing a number of companies exploring the idea of accessing the debt capital markets to retire more expensive equity capital.” Few are willing to make the connection explicitly but companies such as McDonald’s and HP have issued debt and made buy-back announcements close to each other recently.UBS calls this phenomenon “releveraging”. Mr Kapadia says: “Companies and investors should use the currency of cheap credit to unlock equity valuations. There is a huge incentive for companies to leverage again given this valuation gap.”Analysts at Citi see it as part of a broader trend, to which they give the particularly ugly name of “de-equitisation”. In essence, this looks at the total number of shares in issue and whether this number is rising or not. Rights issues or flotations cause shares in issue to rise whereas buy-backs and acquisitions cause this number to fall. Citi even argues that increased dividends should be seen as part of its “de-equitisation” trend as it is the preferred form of returning capital for many investors.BHP Billiton’s $39bn hostile bid for Potash is a good example of potential de-equitisation. If this deal were to proceed, BHP would issue no equity but would finance itself entirely through bank loans and bonds. Heath Jansen at Citi estimates that these current funding costs are less than 2 per cent and would rise only to 3-4 per cent as a bridge loan is replaced by long-term corporate bonds.Citi recommends looking at strong companies that face persistent takeover speculation such as Anadarko, or Capital One in the US, or ITV and Prudential in the UK; or groups that have consistent policies on buy-backs such as Akzo Nobel, BASF, Lockheed Martin or Texas Instruments; or businesses with a high dividend yield and a history of increasing it such as Deutsche Börse, Vivendi, Altria and Qwest.But while many see a clear trend towards deleveraging as – post the crisis – companies finally start to favour shareholders over bondholders, some bankers are sceptical. “It is very cynical to view providing balanced returns to shareholders as bad for bondholders,” says Larry Wieseneck, head of global finance at Barclays Capital. “Hoarding cash is not so good either: shareholders get very nervous, and bondholders should get even more nervous.”Perhaps the most intriguing part about de-equitisation is the suggestion from some that it could have helped J apanese companies as deflation took hold in the 1990s, with some arguing that it could have helped prop up share prices. With a persistent fear of deflation still in western countries, it gives companies more food for thought. “If there is one country in the world where the de-equitisation trade has made sense for 13-14 years it is Japan,” Mr Buckland says. “De-equitisation would have done a world of good to Japanese stock markets.”"
95;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Philip Morris faces tougher rules in Indonesia;;For generations, Indonesia’s huge cigarette market was dominated by domestic players, while foreign companies struggled to gain even a foothold. Then, five years ago, Philip Morris International entered the country with the largest acquisition it had ever made.Philip Morris paid $4.8bn for Sampoerna, a manufacturer of kretek, clove-flavoured cigarettes, which are consumed by 90 per cent of Indonesia’s roughly 70m smokers. After snapping up several leading brands, it commands about 30 per cent of the market and is the leading tobacco company.Since 2005, Sampoerna’s production volume has almost doubled to 76bn cigarettes per year, driven mainly by stellar sales of its top kretek brand, A Mild, a slim cigarette flavoured with tropical Indonesian spice. Philip Morris’s flagship Marlboro and low priced kretek brands have also grown strongly.“The acquisition was a little bit of a coup and it was the only way you could get into this market correctly,” claims John Gledhill, president director of Philip Morris’s Indonesian operations, in an interview with the Financial Times. It “has been a stunning success. It was part of the driver for growth for the last five years”.Sampoerna made $555m in net profit last year, a 30 per cent increase from 2008. It employs 28,300 people at 10 factories across the island of Java, the heartland of Indonesia’s centuries-old kretek industry.Another 38 suppliers of its hand-rolled kreteks employ 60,000 more workers.In addition to its rich heritage, tobacco excise tax is a large source of Indonesian government revenue – Philip Morris pays roughly $2.5bn of tax a year – and 6m people work in tobacco farming and production.Philip Morris has invested $250m to expand production of machine-made Marlboro and A Mild since the acquisition, while aggressive advertising and product development have helped it stay ahead of leading competitors including British American Tobacco. BAT bought rival Bentoel last year for $494m.The Indonesian tobacco market, which is growing at 2-4 per cent per year, is the third largest after China and India. Population growth and rising purchasing power will continue to make it an attractive region in which to sell cigarettes as traditional western markets shrink.It is also the world’s largest, unregulated tobacco market with virtually no control of advertising.A Mild, the leading Philip Morris brand, recently ran an advert on a billboard in downtown Jakarta with skateboarders on a half-pipe ramp and a banner headline that read: “Go Ahead!” This sort of ad appears to run counter to internal Philip Morris guidelines of not marketing tobacco products in a way that appeals to minors.The World Health Organisation estimates that roughly 400,000 deaths in Indonesia each year are due to smoking-related illnesses. The health minister has vowed to sign the United Nations convention on tobacco control this year.One of the big challenges facing tobacco companies will thus be preparing for a tightening of health and marketing regulations.Mr Gledhill, who has held key management positions across Philip Morris since 1983, said that, rather than fearing control, Philip Morris supports tougher health guidelines because loose rules “just open the doors to everyone to criticise Indonesia”.Like regulated markets across the globe, the key will be finding a correct balance, he said. “Tobacco is inherent in the culture and fabric of society here, whether we like it or not. It is a very, very large employer. It is a very large contributor to the state coffers and it [the industry] needs to be more responsible.”
96;MO;Altria Group;2010-07-14T18:39:10Z;Wildlife charity to benefit from well capture;;"An unexpected bonanza is in store for the conservation charity that will receive the revenue from the oil being siphoned from BP’s leaking well.The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation can expect to collect at least $40m from the nearly 550,000 barrels of oil captured from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill so far, if oil prices hold steady at about $75 a barrel. There could be a similar amount to come
if a further 500,000 barrels are captured, which could be possible depending on whether the relief well operation is successful, experts say. BP’s efforts to put a cap on the well were delayed on Wednesday when the US government asked for further analysis of the procedures the company intended to use.Last year, the NFWF received $37.4m in federal funds. It was able to match this with donations, loans and other forms of leverage from businesses and other organisations, resulting in 508 separate grants for conservation projects worth more than $110m.Matching BP’s funds could be more difficult, but the influx of money could still be overwhelming to the charity.Experts from other environmental charities said it could be difficult to set up the infrastructure necessary to disburse the funds quickly to the areas where money is needed. However, some of the environmental groups already at work in the area are likely to be recipients of some of the grants from the fund, which may make it easier. “Lots of people have already been working in the area since the spill so we have boots on the ground,” said one charity worker.The NFWF, founded by the US Congress in 1984, works to preserve and restore the native wildlife species and habitats of the US. The money that comes to the charity from BP – the net revenues from selling the captured oil – will be directed towards projects to rescue the wildlife and habitats of the gulf coast states that have been affected.“We will invest in projects that will have the greatest benefit to the species most at risk from the oil,” said Jeff Trandahl, executive director of the NFWF. “We are working very closely with US Fish and Wildlife Service, other federal and state agencies, and myriad conservation organisations to identify the immediate wildlife needs throughout the gulf.”Past corporate donors to the charity, chaired by Mark Rockefeller, have included many big names from the oil industry: BP, as well as rival oil companies Shell, ConocoPhilips, Chevron and ExxonMobil. Donors from outside the oil industry have included FedEx, Altria, Syngenta and PacifiCorp. The organisation works with a variety of federal agencies, including the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. BP provided $5m to the charity immediately on announcing its choice, so projects could get moving before the oil had been sold.Tony Hayward, BP chief executive, said the charity was “a strong and responsible steward” for the money."

As the next earnings season nears, Mr Creatura said forward-looking commentary from companies will “be more important than ever”.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent at 1,074.57, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 10,138.52 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,220.65.Altria, the largest US tobacco company, added 3.3 per cent to $20.34 after the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal filed by the Obama administration against the tobacco industry.The move makes it significantly less likely that a racketeering suit first filed by former President Bill Clinton’s administration will lead to financial penalties against Philip Morris USA, now owned by Altria, and Reynolds American, whose stock was up 4.1 per cent to $53.45.Apple was up 0.6 per cent to $268.30 as it announced it had sold 1.7m units of the latest iPhone model in the first three days after the launch.It is the most successful product launch in the company’s history, it said.Financials were mostly down after the G20 meeting in Toronto.Leaders of the world’s largest economies insisted on Sunday on implementing tough capital rules to force banks to hold sufficient buffers to guard against a future crisis, but they signalled a delay before the rules would take effect.Financials were buoyed in early trading but fell back as investors took some profits from the banks’ recent good run.Bank of America fell 1.2 per cent to $15.24, JPMorgan Chase lost 2.3 per cent to $38.54 and Goldman Sachs dropped 2.2 per cent to $136.66.But Citigroup maintained a positive course and was 1.5 per cent higher at $4.Boeing dropped 2.1 per cent to $67.30 after Dubai Aerospace Enterprise said it was seeking to renegotiate orders with the aircraft maker and privately-held Airbus SAS as it attempts to reduce its debt levels, Les Echos reported, citing unidentified sources.Universal Health Services, an operator of more than 100 medical facilities in the US, was down 1.5 per cent to $39.48 after the company had its corporate credit rating cut from triple B to double B at Standard & Poor’s.Alcoa, the largest US aluminium producer, fell 1.8 per cent to $11.03 as the company agreed to buy privately-held Traco, a Pittsburgh-based maker of custom-designed windows and doors, in order to expand its market in these products for commercial buildings.US-listed shares in BP were 0.1 per cent higher to $27.05 after the oil company said that Tony Hayward, who has faced criticism for his handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, did not plan to resign as chief executive.Igor Sechin, Russia’s deputy prime minister, was reported to have said that Mr Hayward might step down and announce his successor during a trip to Moscow.Pfizer, the largest US drugmaker by market value, inched down 0.7 per cent to $14.54 as the stock being removed from the “conviction buy” list at Goldman Sachs.

98;MO;Altria Group;2010-06-17T17:56:59Z;Tobacco;Prices keep on rising with limited effect on demand;Barely breathing at full capacity themselves, governments can at least rely on smokers. In the US, for instance, 60 cents of every dollar spent on the habit goes into state and federal pockets, including 13 cents to fund the $206bn agreement struck with state attorneys-general in 1998 to exempt the tobacco companies from future lawsuits. Investors, contemplating a future of consumer price deflation or economic stagnation, may come to love the sector as well.The attraction is twofold: valuation, and the ability for cigarette prices to keep rising with limited effect on demand. British American Tobacco, say, is a tad more expensive than the broader market, but yields 4.5 per cent. US companies Altria – which in 2008 spun out its international business – and Reynolds both yield nearly 7 per cent and trade on about 12 times forward earnings. For them, cheapness relative to the market and fellow consumer stocks in part reflects fears for volumes following the impact of tax rises last year.However, the elasticity of demand for cigarettes in 2009 was bang in line with the long-term relationship between prices and volumes. Last year’s 25 per cent price increase per pack caused consumption to fall 8 per cent, an elasticity of -0.34, calculates UBS. By comparison, since 1969 prices have risen 87 per cent (adjusted for inflation), while consumption fell a third, giving a similar elasticity of -0.37. Based on this fairly steady relationship, UBS argues that tobacco manufacturers can sustain price increases of 4 to 5 per cent annually (8 to 9 per cent for retail prices) for the next decade, while absorbing consumption declines of 3 to 4 per cent.What is more, smoking rates in the US seem to be levelling off (ditto for the UK) and there is plenty of room to push prices higher. A UK pack costs almost twice that of an American smoke. Higher taxes, likely given budget problems, provide cover to raise prices. Not one for socially responsible investors but, for the rest, it may be time to light up.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
99;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Funding costs fall for US companies;;Borrowing costs for industrial companies in the US have plunged, allowing some groups to pay the lowest interest rates ever on long-term debt.The decline in funding costs reflects the sharp fall in US Treasury yields amid the surge in demand for low-risk investments as jitters about the eurozone debt crisis have escalated.For investment-grade companies including Altria, the tobacco maker, Duke Energy, the utility, Abbott Laboratories, the pharmaceuticals group and General Mills, the food manufacturer, it has provided an opportunity to sell bonds with record low interest payments, according to Dealogic.The interest paid by companies is usually calculated relative to government bond yields.“All the problems in Europe again caused Treasury yields to fall,” said Allen Carrick, general manager of corporate finance at Duke Energy.“This created an opportunity for us. We are part of the flight to quality.”Duke Energy last week sold $450m of 10-year bonds that paid investors a coupon, or interest payment, of 4.3 per cent, the lowest the company has paid for debt of that maturity.This week, Altria sold bonds due in 2015 paying 4.125 per cent.The average yields on the bonds of investment-grade industrial companies recently approached 4 per cent, according to the Barclays Capital US Industrial Bond Index, the lowest level since the index was started in the early 1990s.The 10-year US Treasury bond has fallen to 3.27 per cent from more than 4 per cent in April.Even though the yield differential, or risk premium, between government bonds and corporate bonds has risen amid the flight to quality, the decline in bond yields has offset that spread increase for some groups.The all-in funding cost for companies with high credit ratings and stable prospects has therefore remained low or even fallen.“There is no question that borrowing costs are extremely low,” said Justin D’Ercole, head of Americas investment grade syndicate at Barclays Capital.For riskier investments, such as junk-rated US companies or European banks, this has not been the case.Despite the low funding costs, corporate issuance remains light. Many companies have boosted their cash levels since the crisis, and rushed to sell bonds early in the year when economists were predicting that interest rates would rise.Also, turmoil has resulted in lower levels of mergers and acquisitions.“There is relatively little new supply of investment-grade corporate debt, so demand for non-financial companies that do come to market is very strong,” said Jim Probert at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Some investors are, however, cautious about buying bonds at current levels. Any rise in yields would push down the price of bonds.“With very low yields, you don’t have a lot of room for error,” Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said.
100;MO;Altria Group;2010-04-27T19:58:59Z;Prudential poll heaps pressure on leader;;"Lofty ambition, a high-sounding manifesto for change, floating voters, media gossip. The campaign to persuade investors to back Prudential’s $35.5bn bid for AIA, the Asian arm of AIG, has all the elements of a hard-fought election.The latest rumour is that some Pru investors, headed by Capital Group, are trying to incite bids for bits of the UK assurer. Break-up looks attractive – on paper. Panmure Gordon reckons the parts of the Pru could fetch a total of 955p a share, with its Asian operations alone worth more than the group’s current price of 540p. But the sales would have to happen simultaneously. Spinning off, say, the UK first would endanger the group’s credit rating. That is one reason the Pru has not offered to sell the British arm to reduce the $21bn rights issue backing the AIA acquisition. As for buyers, Clive Cowdery’s Resolution would certainly be interested in the UK operation. But it’s doubtful rival Aviva would have the urge, resources, or investor support to purchase the US arm. Most potential bidders for the Asian operations either have work to do on their own regional networks or have ruled out large acquisitions.In fact, this story is more interesting as a symptom of possible dissent among the electorate. Since the Pru was rushed into announcing its plan, Tidjane Thiam, its chief executive, has battled to convince shareholders to back the deal, despite regulatory and execution risk. Capital, which has declined comment on the reports, would have to find $2.5bn to avoid its 12 per cent stake being diluted if all its funds subscribed to the rights issue. It would be easier if the Pru could reveal more detail about AIA and the rationale for buying it. This week’s rumours heap further pressure on Mr Thiam to fill the information gap when the rights issue prospectus is published, on the eve of the general election. The pundits say Mr Thiam will eventually get the votes he needs. But if he fails, then, like an ambitious party leader thwarted at the polls, his only course will be to step aside.Imperial’s wealth warningCigarettes are notoriously good for your wealth. Imperial Tobacco reported a year-on-year 4 per cent rise in operating profit to £1.2bn for the six months to end-March. Both Imperial and British American Tobacco have outperformed the broader market since the UK economy hit the skids in early 2008. But it was ever thus that in bad times vice pays. When Japan’s bubble burst, shredding real estate and share prices, pachinko parlours were still packed-out with laid-off salarymen slotting coins into the pinball machines.Imperial has played its hand well. Acquisitions, such as Altadis, provide top-line growth and synergies. Health concerns in the developed world are offset by marketing vigour in parts of the world where such cares are still mere niceties. Roll-ups offer cash-strapped Brits a cheaper smoke, but still put money in Imperial’s pockets. The combination of defensiveness and astute management is as gratifying as the first cigarette of the day: Imperial, in similar vein to peers such as Japan Tobacco and Altria Group of the US, has generated total returns of 32 per cent in the past year. It is lifting the interim dividend 16 per cent to 24.3p; on a compounded basis, Imperial’s dividend has risen 14 per cent a year since listing in 1996.But a wealth warning is firmly attached. Recession can kill sales: Imperial sold nearly one-fifth fewer sticks in Spain last year as straitened Brits nixed holidays on the Costa del Sol and Spaniards cut back. Emerging markets aren’t immune, either, as testified by Russia, say, or Morocco. The regulatory and fiscal backdrop is as temperamental as a chain-smoker gone cold turkey and when the taxes go up, sales plunge – look at America. Maintaining growth without making acquisitions is a challenge for incoming chief executive Alison Cooper. But that’s cigarettes for you: often pleasurable but ultimately reduced to ashes.Candover and almost outIt limped into the twilight zone, but Candover’s days as a stand-alone entity always looked numbered. Now private equity’s erstwhile poster child – which escaped the ignominy of being sold for a song or launching a highly dilutive rights issue – is in talks with a Canadian pension fund. That looks pretty racy of the Alberta Investment Management Company but if yesterday’s plunge in Candover’s share price is anything to go by, it is building in a decent margin for error. Besides, one has to hand it to the Canadians. Having avoided the financial meltdown themselves, it’s exceptionally civil of them to mop up our debris.andrew.hill@ft.com"
101;MO;Altria Group;2010-04-26T22:45:40Z;Tobacco giants set for legal clash with Labour;;A showdown is looming between the government and the tobacco industry after the world’s four biggest cigarette makers said they would launch legal actions against Westminster’s latest attempt to restrict cigarette sales in the UK.Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco yesterday each separately said they were seeking a judicial review of the relevant sections of the Health Act 2009, under which the government is looking to impose a ban on the display of cigarettes and tobacco products in shops and supermarkets by October 2011.The so-called “display ban” – which would force shops to stock cigarettes under the counter, where they cannot be seen by consumers – has already been introduced in countries such as Canada, Iceland and Ireland. While the UK government believes the measure could be an effective way to combat the problem of teenage smoking, the scheme has outraged the tobacco industry and many small retailers, who argued that the move would only encourage the illicit trade and endanger the livelihood of tens of thousands of small businesses.Imperial, which controls 45 per cent of the UK cigarette market with brands such as Lambert & Butler, said there was no evidence to show that such a ban would cut smoking rates in the UK.“If this misguided legislation is implemented it will simply fuel the growth in the illicit trade of tobacco and create a huge cost burden for retailers who are already under considerable pressure as a result of the difficult economic climate,” said Gareth Davis, Imperial’s outgoing chief executive.JT, which following its acquisition of Gallaher in 2007, now controls 39 per cent of the UK cigarette market, called the regulations “unreasonable and disproportionate” and said it had no option but to start the legal process to challenge the ban.Elsewhere, PMI, maker of Malboro and Chesterfield cigarettes, said experience from Iceland and Canada showed that display bans “have caused significant damage to small retailers, stifled competition between manufacturers and have had no impact on smoking rates.”The display ban is part of a Europe-wide offensive on cigarettes, which in recent years has seen the introduction of smoking bans in bars and restaurants in countries.Alan Johnson, health secretary, said 200,000 children under 16 years of age started smoking each year in Britain and the risk of premature death for them was three times higher than for people who start in their 20s.
102;MO;Altria Group;2010-04-21T20:34:42Z;Strong earnings bolster anxious Wall St;;US stock prices put in a mixed performance on Wednesday as they see-sawed around the flat mark, in spite of results from Apple that smashed analysts’ expectations, with Morgan Stanley and Boeing also posting better-than-expected first-quarter numbers.“This suggests that recent market advances may have fully priced in expectations of this quarter’s results,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent at 1,205.94, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent 11,124.92 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,504.61.Apple led the technology stocks in the Dow higher, rising 6 per cent to $259.22. The company reported a 90 per cent increase in second-quarter profit and a 49 per cent increase in revenue after the session’s close on Tuesday, far surpassing bullish Wall Street estimates.The consumer technology products group had been expected to record earnings per share of $2.46 on sales of about $12bn, instead, it reported earnings of $3.33 per share, or $3.1bn in total, on sales of $13.5bn in the first quarter.AT&T, the largest US phone company by revenue, lost 1.2 per cent to $26.34 as first-quarter sales came in slightly below average analyst expectations. The company’s exclusive contract with Apple to offer the iPhone helped drive earnings but a number of analysts raised concerns over its dependency on the contract.Yahoo was 5.1 per cent lower at $17.45 as the search engine provider forecast lower-than-expected second-quarter sales after the session’s close on Tuesday, citing falling market share.The company also reported first-quarter sales that missed average analyst estimates.Morgan Stanley reported first-quarter results before the session’s open yesterday morning, and its shares rallied 4 per cent to $31.68.The bank’s earnings beat average analyst estimates, helped by a strong performance of its fixed income division.Earnings from continuing operations, including a 21 cent tax benefit, were $1.03 per share, compared with analysts’ average expectations of 57 cent per share.Wells Fargo slid 2 per cent to $33.01 as it reported first-quarter earnings that were lower than the same quarter a year earlier, however, non-collectable loans were lower than the fourth quarter of last year. The bank also originated fewer mortgages compared with a year earlier.Gilead Sciences fell 9.6 per cent to $40.76 after the drugmaker which focuses on Aids treatments lowered its full-year forecasts, and said sales of Truvada and Atripla, its flagship drugs, missed expectations in the first quarter.Boeing was up 3.9 per cent to $74.16 as the aircraft manufacturer reported higher-than-expected first-quarter results. But it cut full-year guidance due to the higher costs of providing health benefits to employees as a result of recent US healthcare legislation. It maintained its full-year delivery guidance of 460 to 465 aircraft, saying those were all sold. Revenues would be $31bn to $32bn.Altria, the world’s largest tobacco company, added 1.4 per cent to $21.46 on its first-quarter earnings that beat expectations, helped by a strong performance by its smokeless tobacco business.The company left its full-year guidance unchanged, adding that high unemployment and economic pressures continue to weigh on its customers.Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company, was 1.5 per cent higher at $86.25 even after reporting lower first-quarter profits and reducing its full-year outlook, also partly due to the impact of the healthcare bill. Net earnings in the quarter fell 18 per cent to $547m, or $1.45 per share, compared with $666m, or $1.68 per share, in the same period a year earlier.For the full year Lockheed said that earnings per share would be $7-$7.20 per share, down from its prior estimates of $7.15 -$7.35 per share.AMR, parent company of American Airlines, slumped 9.2 per cent to $7.77 after reporting a widening loss amid higher fuel prices and meagre growth in passenger traffic.
103;MO;Altria Group;2010-02-25T19:06:02Z;Tan changes his style for cigarette deal;;It is not difficult to see the business sense behind Thursday’s agreement between Philip Morris International and Filipino businessman Lucio Tan to combine their cigarette businesses in the Philippines.Between them the two companies will hold 90 per cent of the local tobacco market – a business that was last year worth about 78.9bn pesos ($1.7bn). Philip Morris is strong in the premium end of the market with brands such as Marlboro, while Mr Tan’s Fortune Tobacco dominates the low and mid-priced segments.For Philip Morris, the deal with Fortune Tobacco eliminates the pressures of rivalry with a big local operator at a time when the number of smokers in western markets is declining.Analysts say the deal will give Philip Morris leverage to fend off hostile legislation that could hamper the growth of the cigarette market in the Philippines – one of the least-regulated and least-taxed cigarette markets in Asia.In spite of several increases in excise taxes on cigarettes since the mid-1990s, the proportion of tobacco taxes to retail selling price has been steadily falling.Limits on tobacco marketing and advertising in the Philippines are also not as tough or as strictly enforced as compared with some other countries. Cigarette packs in the Philippines do not carry graphic health warnings.The market logic may be compelling for both groups, but the deal has come as a surprise for Mr Tan’s associates.They say that to enter into equity joint ventures with a strategic partner does not seem to fit the style of the 75-year tycoon who during the last five decades has built many of his businesses from the ground up.“He has had licensing agreements with foreign companies – but has never got into equity partnerships, especially where he does not own a controlling stake,” said an executive of Basic Holdings, one of Mr Tan’s holding companies. Mr Tan – who according to Forbes is now the second richest man in the Philippines with a net worth of $1.7bn – has built an empire that includes more than 100 businesses. As well as running the Philippines’ biggest cigarette company, Mr Tan owns its largest airline, some of the biggest banks, and one of south-east Asia’s biggest pig farms.The deal with Philip Morris, however, represents an important change in operating style for a man who usually likes to stay in total control.Philip Morris and Fortune Tobacco will have equal equity stakes in a new company. The deal gives Philip Morris responsibility to run combined operations of the two companies. Mr Tan will be chairman of the board but the president will come from Philip Morris.The deal could allow Mr Tan to leave his flagship company in able hands, defusing a potentially divisive succession issue. Last year, a rift prompted a younger brother, Mariano, to turn against Mr Tan, offering to give evidence in a government case against the businessman.“It reflects a possible strategic move to ensure long-term stability of his [business] empire because he knows his kids and siblings may not be as good as he is in running businesses,” says Wilson Lee Flores, a business commentator.
104;MO;Altria Group;2010-02-25T09:20:02Z;Philip Morris in tie-up with Filipino tycoon;;Philip Morris International yesterday unveiled a joint venture in the Philippines that will see it team up with Fortune Tobacco, a local cigarette maker owned by tycoon Lucio Tan, to create a company that will control 90 per cent of the domestic cigarette market.The newly formed PMFTC is expected to build on the two companies’ dominant positions in various segments of the Philippine cigarette market, which had an estimated volume of 85bn sticks last year, making it the world’s 12th biggest. Tobacco consumption in the Philippines was estimated to be worth 78.9bn pesos ($1.7bn) in 2009, according to the government’s statistics agency.The tie-up comes as other western tobacco groups seek to boost their presence in emerging markets, to counter a fall in smoker numbers in more developed markets as a result of tighter regulation, smoking bans and health concerns.Last year British American Tobacco bought a majority stake in Bentoel Internasional Investama, Indonesia’s fourth-largest cigarette maker, for $494m. Morris already has a big presence in Indonesia, mainly through its Sampoerna unit, which it bought for $5bn in 2005.The joint venture between Morris and Fortune operations will not only give the two almost total control of the local market but could also boost their ability to lobby against moves to increase taxes on cigarettes and adopt tougher rules on tobacco marketing and advertising.The Philippines imposes one of the lowest taxes on cigarettes in Asia and has yet to adopt tough tobacco control laws.Morris’s Philippines unit, which has a market share of 30 per cent, dominates the high-end segment of the market with brands such as Marlboro and Morris.Fortune, with a 60 per cent market share, leads in the medium and low-priced segments of the market.Mr Tan, majority owner of Fortune, is the second-richest man in the Philippines and has a vast business network.“By combining [Fortune’s] sales and distribution expertise with [Morris’] manufacturing and marketing capabilities, we are ensuring our continued success in this important cigarette market,” said Matteo Pellegrini, president of Morris in the region.The companies will contribute selected assets and liabilities into the venture, which is expected to eventually integrate production, marketing and distribution of their leading brands.Chris Nelson, Morris’s country manager, said the two companies would have equal equity stakes in the venture but refused to disclose its value.
105;MO;Altria Group;2010-02-24T21:31:26Z;Wall St comforted by rate outlook;;US equities moved higher on Wednesday as the markets were comforted by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s comments to Congress that the US economy is in a “nascent” recovery that requires interest rates to be kept low to encourage demand by consumers and companies.“The markets are breathing a sigh of relief that the recent rise in the discount rate will not lead to significant tightening in the near future,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research.He said Mr Bernanke is keen to give the jittery markets plenty of visibility on policy decisions. “He wants any move the Fed makes to be a non-event.”The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent up to 1,105.24, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to 10,374.16 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent higher at 2,235.90.Shares in homebuilders fell as figures showed that sales of new homes in the US fell unexpectedly in January to the lowest levels on record.Only 309,000 new homes were sold in January, while inventories remain high.DR Horton fell 1.8 per cent to $12.34, Pulte Homes declined 1.5 per cent to $10.81 and Lennar Corp lost 0.1 per cent to $16.27.Shares in Citigroup were up 3 per cent to $3.45. The bank was reported to be in advanced talks to sell its fund-of-funds business to SkyBridge Capital, a New York-based alternative asset manager with about $4bn in assets.No agreement has yet been signed and the proposed sale price was not known.Shares in STEC dived 23.5 per cent to $10.27 as the flash memory drive maker said it expected to make a first-quarter adjusted loss of 11 cents to 13 cents per share. Analysts had expected on average a profit of 23 cents per share.Millipore Corp, a life sciences specialist, gained 5.5 per cent to $93.79 after the company said it was in the process of evaluating its strategic options, including a potential sale or merger.It was reported on Monday that rival Thermo Fisher Scientific had made an unsolicited bid for Millipore worth about $6bn.Arena Pharmaceuticals jumped 1.2 per cent to $3.19 on news that the Food and Drug Administration had accepted its application for lorcaserin, its experimental obesity drug.The company said it expected to find out in the following weeks when the FDA would make a final drug approval decision.Pfizer strengthened 0.8 per cent to $17.81 following the approval by the FDA of a new version of its Prevnar vaccine against pneumococcal bacteria in children.Also, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that that any children who have not yet been vaccinated with Prevnar should be vaccinated with the new version.H&R Block, a leading tax return preparer, was one of the biggest fallers in the S&P 500 index.The shares lost 12.2 per cent to $17.32 after the company said it would fail to achieve its previous earnings forecasts.Rising unemployment had curtailed tax returns and more people were choosing to complete their own to save money, the company said. The stock’s target price was cut by S&P Equity from $23 to $19 and rated “hold”.Rival Jackson Hewitt Tax Service was also down 3.7 per cent to $2.36.Shares in BGC Partners, a broker focused on over-the-counter trading, gained 17.8 per cent to $5.03 after forecasting higher first-quarter earnings than analysts had expected.Tobacco group Altria gained 1.5 per cent to $20.26 on news that it had raised its regular quarterly dividend by 2.9 per cent.In the food and restaurant sector, Papa John‘s, a leading pizza maker, rose 7.2 per cent to $24.88, the most in two months, as the company posted fourth-quarter earnings that comfortably beat average analyst estimates.Rival Domino’s Pizza was also up by 2.4 per cent to $12.43, continuing its steady rise since the start of the year.Restaurant chain operator Darden Restaurants gained 0.9 per cent to $40.99 as the stock’s target price was raised by analysts at Credit Suisse from $37 to $44..
106;MO;Altria Group;2010-02-12T01:53:43Z;Philip Morris to buy back $12bn shares;;Philip Morris International, the world’s largest listed tobacco company, will return more than $12bn (£7.7bn, €8.8bn) to shareholders over the next three years through a new share buy-back programme in the clearest sign yet of its confidence that the downtrading seen in some of its key markets and the effects of adverse currency movements are abating.The planned buy-back, which will begin in May, comes after the maker of Marlboro, Parliament and Virginia Slim cigarettes spent $11bn buying back shares over the past two years and follows a spate of share repurchases announced by companies such as Munich Re, the Royal Bank of Canada and IBM late last year.“The fragility of the economic recovery, particularly with regard to employment levels and currency volatility, naturally warrants a cautious outlook for 2010,” said Louis Camilleri, chief executive and chairman.“However, we enjoy solid momentum and remain confident that we will again post strong financial results this year. Our new $12bn, three-year share repurchase program underscores our optimism going forward.”Having spun off from Altria in 2008, PMI, which is based in Lausanne but is listed in New York, now generates all of its sales outside the the US. During the first three quarters of 2009, the group has seen earnings come under pressure as recession-hit smokers traded down to cheaper brands while the sharp rise of the US dollar eroded profits made in other currencies.But these pressures appeared to be easing, with PMI on Thursday reporting better-than-expected fourth quarter, helped by better pricing.For the three months to December 31, net earnings was $1.5bn, or 80 cents a share, compared with $1.4bn, or 71 cents a share a year earlier and the 79 cents a share expected by analysts.Still, net revenues for the full-year fell 2.6 per cent to $25bn as a result of currency headwinds. Net earnings was $6.3bn, or $3.25 a share, compared to $6.9bn, or $3.32 a share, the year before.The economic crisis in Spain and the weaknesses for premium-brand cigarettes in Russia, the world’s third largest cigarette market after China and the US, dented sales of PMI’s flagship Marlboro brand, which fall 2.8 per cent to 302bn units during the year – although Mr Camilleri believes the worst is over.Since its demerger, PMI has wasted little time hitting the acquisition trail, which include the $452m purchase of Colombian cigarette maker Protabaco and the C$2bn purchase of Canada’s Rothmans. On Thursday Mr Camilleri said the share buy-back programme will not affect the group’s ability to continue making acquisitions.“We have a list of projects we pursue…If a significant acquisition was to come about, we believe we can pursue it.”Shares in PMI gained 4 per cent to $48.72, giving it a market capitalisation of $92.8bn.
107;MO;Altria Group;2010-01-19T19:44:18Z;Norway fund shuns tobacco companies;;Norway has dropped 17 tobacco companies, including Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, from its sovereign wealth fund, adding to a growing list of stocks blacklisted by Europe’s biggest equity investor.Imperial Tobacco, Altria, Reynolds American and Japan Tobacco were among others barred from the $455bn fund – which owns more than 1 per cent of all global stocks – after the Norwegian finance ministry ruled that the companies were in breach of the fund’s ethical guidelines.The tobacco companies join a list of about 50 stocks excluded from the Norwegian fund on ethical grounds, ranging from arms manufacturers, such as Boeing and BAE Systems, to companies accused of environmental and labour rights violations, including Rio Tinto and Wal-Mart.Norway has sought to make its sovereign wealth fund a role model for socially responsible investment since introducing ethical guidelines in 2003. Tobacco companies initially escaped exclusion but Sigbjørn Johnsen, finance minister, on Tuesday said it was time for them to be removed.“It is important that the ethical guidelines reflect at all times what can be considered to be commonly held values of the owners of the fund,” he said.The fund, in which Norway invests its oil wealth for future generations, is the world’s second-largest sovereign wealth fund after that of the United Arab Emirates.According to Reuters calculations, the fund’s holdings in the 17 excluded tobacco companies were worth NKr14.6bn ($2.6bn) at the end of 2008. Its stakes included 1.3 per cent of British American Tobacco, 0.5 per cent of Philip Morris International and 1.3 per cent of Imperial Tobacco.The finance ministry said all stocks had been sold in advance of Tuesday’s announcement. It added that other companies connected with the industry could be excluded in future.The fund has a Council of Ethics that recommends stocks for removal, with the final decision made by the finance ministry.Norway stirred controversy last September by excluding Elbit Systems, an Israeli company that supplies the surveillance system for the “separation barrier” under construction by Israel in the West Bank.Other blacklisted companies include Honeywell and Northrop Grumman for their role in making nuclear weapons and EADS, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon for production of cluster munitions.
108;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Weak Marlboro sales hit Philip Morris earnings;;Falling Marlboro sales and the continued strength of the US dollar have resulted in a 14 per cent decline in third-quarter earnings at Philip Morris International.The group, which was spun off from Altria last year and generates all of its sales outside the the US, said net earnings for the three months to end of September was $1.8bn, or 93 cents a share, down from $2.1bn, or $1.01, the year before.The weak economy and ever increasing excise taxes in many European markets have continued to put pressure on sales of its flagship premium Marlboro brand, which fell 4.3 per cent to 76.9bn units during the quarter.The is the third consecutive quarterly decline suffered by Marlboro and underscores how cash-strapped smokers are turning their back on higher priced cigarettes as the recession bites.Overall cigarette volumes – which include gains from acquisitions – were down 2.9 per cent to 219.3bn units, with other brands such as Chesterfield and L&M down 15.1 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively.While PMI has been able to mitigate the volume decline with price increases, revenue for the quarter still suffered a 5.3 per cent decline to $6.6bn as a stronger dollar shrunk profit earned in other currencies.Excluding the effects of unfavourable exchange rates, revenue grew 6.9 per cent while earnings per share rose 18.3 per cent.“The third quarter underscored our proven ability to deliver excellent results and improve our operating margins,” said Louis Camilleri, chief executive.“While we experienced lower organic volume in the quarter, this was largely anticipated given our pricing actions and the on-going impact of the economic crisis on total consumption levels, notably in Spain and Ukraine. Our year-to-date volume decline of 2.1 per cent better reflects our estimated full-year organic volume performance.”The earnings decline was less than analysts were expecting. The group, which in February sharply lower its profit guidance for 2009 on the back of currency headwinds, also raised its forecast for full-year earnings on signs that the foreign-currency impact might be lessening.The group is now expecting earnings per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.25. While this compares favourably to the $3.10 to $3.20 it guided the market towards earlier this year, it is still below the $3.32 acheived in 2008.Shares in the PMI, the world’s largest listed tobacco group, fell $1.36, or 2.7 per cent, to $49.46, giving it a market capitalisation of $95.7bn.
109;MO;Altria Group;2009-09-07T20:33:54Z;Kraft looks beyond the US cupboard;;From Ritz crackers to Jell-O deserts, and Oreo cookies to Maxwell House coffee, Kraft’s top packaged food brands may be more American than apple pie. They are found in more than 99 per cent of US households.With annual sales of more than $40bn (£25bn), Kraft has grown to be the largest US food company – globally, second only to Switzerland’s Nestlé – since Joseph Kraft first opened his wholesale cheese business in Chicago in 1903.But its £10.2bn ($16.7bn) proposal to Cadbury, already rejected by the UK group, reflects the company’s need to find growth it cannot easily deliver in a saturated North American market that accounts for about 60 per cent of its sales.Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive of Kraft, signalled her intention of looking internationally for growth – particularly in emerging markets – with the $7.2bn acquisition of the global biscuit business of France’s Danone, carried out shortly after Kraft was fully spun off in 2007 by its former owners, Philip Morris (now Altria).Since then, Kraft has completed both a restructuring of its business and a drive to revitalise its core brands with new product innovation and marketing efforts. Ms Rosenfeld said the company believed the time was now right for the Cadbury approach.The Cadbury chocolate business would fit with Kraft’s existing Milka and Toblerone businesses, acquired in 1990, as Danone’s LU biscuits was seen as a fit with Kraft’s Nabisco and Oreo brands.The combined brands would also benefit from improved global distribution, with Kraft’s strengths in Brazil, Russia and China complementing Cadbury’s distribution in India and Mexico. About a third of Cadbury’s sales come from developing markets.The deal would give the combined business the scale to compete more effectively with Mars of the US, strengthened by last year’s $23bn acquisition of Wrigley, the gum maker, giving each about 15 per cent of the global sweet market. Kraft would also acquire Cadbury’s gum business, which should benefit from stronger global distribution.Ms Rosenfeld suggested that uniting the two companies’ brands could create new opportunities by, for instance, combining Cadbury’s chocolate brands with the LU biscuit business it bought from Danone in 2007.While the strategic logic is evident, it is much less clear how Kraft might be able to inject more cash into what it would be prepared to offer for Cadbury.The Danone deal has left the US group with a comparatively high level of gross debt, about $20bn compared with its market capitalisation of about $42bn.A person close to the potential deal stressed that Kraft had been contemplating the bid proposal for some time, and had chosen to wait until global financial markets had become more stable.The person also argued that the current stock and cash deal could be financed without the need for any divestitures by Kraft, insisting that the move was aimed at overall growth, rather than a “grow and prune” strategy.Analysts in the US have suggested Kraft could consider selling its meats or cheese businesses, which include the Oscar Meyer and Philadelphia brands.The source also said Kraft had already been approached by several banks about potential financing, which he argued could be carried out without any threat to its existing credit rating.
110;MO;Altria Group;2009-07-23T21:08:51Z;Marlboro cigarette sales fall again;;Philip Morris International has offered the strongest sign yet that global demand for premium cigarettes is on the wane after Marlboro sales fell for a second quarter in a row.The world’s largest listed tobacco company said on Thursday that total shipments of its flagship brand fell 1.1 per cent to 78.3bn units for the three months to the end of June, as recession-hit smokers traded down to cheaper brands.In Russia, a key PMI market, the decline was particularly acute. Sales of premium brands there fell 12.3 per cent, with Marlboro and Parliament down 19.1 per cent and 4.3 per cent respectively.In spite of the softening in the premium segment of the market, Hermann Waldemer, chief financial officer, said the group had no plans for a replay of its “Marlboro Friday” price slash in 1993, when it cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes by almost 20 per cent.“That would be the wrong thing to do,” he told the Financial Times.Any volume weakness was being offset by price increases, he said, a view many analysts share.In recent years, tobacco companies have sought to offset declining sales in mature western markets by shifting customers, notably in emerging economies such as Russia, to more expensive brands.But this trend appears to be ending with the recession and analysts are expecting more smokers to trade down to non-premium cigarettes this year as unemployment increases.The sector’s number two, British American Tobacco, in May reported a slowdown in sales growth for some of its top brands in the first quarter of the year.By contrast, Imperial Tobacco, whose business is more geared towards the less expensive segment of the market, is seeing a sharp rise in the sale of loose tobacco for rolling cigarettes.In spite the weakness reported in the premium market, PMI raised its 2009 earnings forecast to a range of $3.10 to $3.20 a share from $2.85-$3.00, citing reduced concerns over currency exchange rates.For the quarter, profit fell to $1.55bn, or 79 cents a share, from $1.69bn, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier, hurt by the stronger dollar, although earnings beat expectations.A stronger dollar reduces the value of sales outside the US, and all of PMI’s sales come from outside the country.Adam Spielman, analyst at Citigroup, said the results showed that PMI could use price increases to generate “smoother” earnings growth that than most other large caps.
111;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
112;MO;Altria Group;2009-07-02T21:16:05Z;Philip Morris in South African deal;;Philip Morris International, the world’s largest listed tobacco company, extended its push into smokeless tobacco products on Thursday with a deal to buy Swedish Match’s South African business for R1.75bn ($222m).The deal, which PMI said would still need to be approved by South African regulatory authorities, would give it a dominant position in nasal snuff products, as well as pipe tobacco, in the country.At the moment, pipe tobacco and nasal snuff account for 31 per cent of total tobacco sales in South Africa, according to PMI.“This financially attractive acquisition represents an excellent strategic fit for our business in South Africa,” said Jean-Claude Kunz, head of PMI’s Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa region.This is the fourth acquisition that PMI has made since its spin-off from Altria last March according to data from Bloomberg. The biggest was the purchase of Canada’s Rothmans for about $2bn last July.While the cigarette industry remains large and profitable, industry volumes have fallen at an annual rate of 1-2 per cent a year for the past 20 years – a trend that is expected to continue.As a result, PMI, which saw first-quarter shipments of of its flagship Marlboro brand decline 2.4 per cent, has, along with other large tobacco groups been looking at ways to expand their businesses beyond cigarettes.Smokeless products such as snus – a teabag-like pouch that users stick between their cheek and gum – and snuff have attracted the most interest thus far.In February, PMI announced a 50:50 global joint venture with Swedish Match to make and sell smokeless products such as snus.Last year, rival British American Tobacco boosted its presence in the snus market through the acquisition of Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni and Altria acquired UST, the largest chewing tobacco maker in the US, for $11.7bn.At the time, analysts said the Altria deal could set off more consolidation in the global tobacco industry. Swedish Match, one of the world’s biggest makers of snus, has long been seen as a potential acquisition target.While snus may be the latest buzz in the tobacco industry, smokeless tobacco products have attracted the wrath of anti-smoking advocates.Sweden is the only country in the European Union in where it is legal to sell snus, but BAT is testing the product in Canada and South Africa. The company says health authorities believe snus is healthier than smoked tobacco.Anti-tobacco groups said allowing snus to be sold in the EU would encourage people to consume tobacco.
113;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Tobacco’s road;;"The authorities’ longstanding love-hate relationship with smoking has had decidedly more of the latter. King James I called it a “custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs, and in the black, stinking fume thereof, nearest resembling the horrible Stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless”.Around the same time, harsh proscriptions were put on it by the Ottoman empire, Ming dynasty and Russian Orthodox church. Yet a stroll down the streets of Istanbul, Beijing or Moscow today is still clouded by plenty of smoke.Even in America, where tobacco users in its largest city must pay $10 a pack, huddle in doorways and accept a social pariah-like status, tobacco’s hold is surprisingly resilient.So it is fair to be sceptical that a vote by the US Senate to allow the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco is the industry’s death knell. It survived a 160 per cent federal excise tax increase earlier this year, as well as $206bn in fines agreed a decade ago.To be sure, cigarette sales have slipped – from 4,300 per capita annually in 1965 to 1,700 now in the US – but leaders such as Altria, Reynolds American and Lorillard continue to be highly profitable. FDA regulation might even help them at the expense of upstart brands as more onerous marketing restrictions appear.Tobacco was a bane well before there was an FDA but it has been a boon to governments, too. Regulating a product that generates such tax revenues out of existence is not easy. Nor is cajoling a population to quit through health warnings and advertising bans. If beatings and the threat of eternal damnation did not do the trick, then nothing will.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

114;MO;Altria Group;2009-06-11T22:53:21Z;Senate backs tighter curbs on tobacco;;The US Senate approved regulation on tobacco on Thursday that would usher in European-style restrictions on advertising and put prominent health warnings on cigarette packets.Barack Obama, who has himself struggled with a nicotine habit, said he would sign the legislation into law. “My administration is committed to protecting our children and reforming our healthcare system – and moving forward with commonsense tobacco control measures is an integral part of that process,” the president said.The Senate bill would put tobacco under the control of the Food and Drug Administration and follows the passage of a similar bill through the House of Representatives. The Senate bill is likely to go to Mr Obama for approval, said Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker.Edward Kennedy, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts and a leading supporter of the legislation, said the Senate vote in favour, by 79 to 17, was “a life-saving act for the millions of children who will be spared a lifetime of addiction and premature death”.Chris Dodd, a Democratic senator and a co-sponsor of the legislation, said: “This bill makes it harder for tobacco companies to addict our children, gives parents peace of mind, and will ultimately save lives.”Restrictions on advertising have divided the tob­acco industry with Philip Morris, the US arm of Altria Group and manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes, supporting the legislation, while smaller competitors such as Reynolds American, the maker of Camel, criticise it. Analysts note that the marketing curbs will make it harder for companies such as Reynolds to win market share from Philip Morris.But all companies are likely to be forced to change their packaging, moving a modest health warning on the side of the packet to a starker series of messages that take up the top half of the front and back of the packet.The FDA, which will levy fees on the industry starting at $85m a year and rising to $712m a year by 2019, could decide to ban the word “lights” from lower-tar cigarettes if consumers are misled into thinking they are less harmful.Flavoured cigarettes, apart from menthols, would be banned as part of the legislation in a measure designed to reduce the attraction of cigarettes to children.Smokeless tobacco, which manufacturers have focused on as a growth area because of perceived lower health risks, does not escape the legislation, which orders specific advertising warning of the risk of mouth cancer.Altria said it broadly welcome the legislation but said it “is not perfect”.“For example, we have expressed first amendment reservations about certain provisions, including those that could restrict a manufacturer’s ability to communicate truthful information to adult consumers about tobacco products.”Some lawmakers argue that the FDA is the wrong regulator for the industry, because it is supposed to ensure the safety of food and medicine, and that is impossible with tobacco.To prevent tobacco from being banned all together, the Senate bill explicitly says the FDA cannot forbid the sale of cigarettes or force nicotine levels down to zero. But smokers are likely to be able to see the ingredients of cigarettes printed on packets, along with the quantities of tar and nicotine, in line with existing standards in force in the European Union.
115;MO;Altria Group;2009-04-12T18:45:06Z;Private-label power play;;"“Trading down” is one of this recession’s big trends. And it’s global. AC Nielsen has found frugal consumers across 11 big economies are cutting spending by shifting to lower-cost brands – often retailers’ private-label goods. There has been no repeat – yet – of “Marlboro Friday”, when Philip Morris in 1993 slashed cigarette prices to dent competition from bargain brands. But, once again, plates are shifting.British retailers pioneered turning private labels into genuine rivals to leading brands. That boosts profits, since store brands, though lower priced, typically earn fatter margins. Now the recession is giving own-label another fillip. J. Sainsbury, the UK grocer, is beating rivals’ sales growth with a “Switch and Save” campaign encouraging customers to dump brands for Sainsbury’s equivalents.But the US may be seeing the biggest shift. Though penetration has historically been lower there, supermarkets such as Kroger and Safeway have improved store brands’ quality and sophistication. Now they are reaping benefits. The Private Label Manufacturers’ Association says private-label grocery sales rose 10 per cent last year to $83bn. Branded product sales grew just 2.8 per cent.Now retailing’s 10-ton gorilla, Wal-Mart, is revamping and expanding its Great Value private-label range – already North America’s biggest food brand. Citigroup forecasts the label could go from 16 to 40 per cent of Wal-Mart’s sales within three years. Ominously, it suggests Wal-Mart could use resulting margin gains to cut prices across its grocery range, unleashing a price war.That could hammer other retailers – and branded manufacturers. US grocers are already using their growing private-label clout to press brand-makers to reverse price increases they pushed through last year. Manufacturers are resisting, saying commodity prices have eased but remain high. Some name-brand manufacturers are frantically marketing their products’ advantages over cheaper store brands. They should beware. Having sampled the alternatives, many consumers may decide, post-recession, not to return to their old, expensive brands.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

116;MO;Altria Group;2009-04-12T10:38:29Z;Norway’s fund plans move out of tobacco;;Norway has proposed new ethical guidelines that will see its Government Pension Fund, Europe’s largest pension fund, exit tobacco investments and screen companies for climate and tax haven violations.In addition, the NKr2,300bn (£233bn, €259bn, $344bn) fund plans to earmark NKr20bn for investments in “environmentally friendly” companies over a five-year period and possibly target “sustainable” growth in emerging markets.The new rules are part of a series of reforms presented by the finance ministry in a white paper to parliament on April 3, concluding the most exhaustive review of the fund’s ethical guidelines since they were first introduced five years ago.But critics say the fund should focus on making money instead of taking on more risk in emerging markets and imposing further restrictions on its portfolio holdings after suffering an unprecedented loss of NKr633bn on its investments last year.“The main goal is to place the money so as to get the best possible return at moderate risk,” said Christian Tybring-Gjedde, a member of Norway’s opposition Progress party, the country’s second largest. “Now we see the government going away from that with more politically correct investments.”Even Norway’s central bank, the manager of the fund, has expressed reservations over earmarking parts of the fund for special purposes, also known as “positive” screening. In a hearing note to the finance ministry, the central bank warned positive screening would mark a breach with the fund’s investment strategy, reduce its risk spread and expose it to more company-specific risks.The bank drew specific mention to an analysis by Thore Johnsen and Ole Gjølberg, two Norwegian academics, which revealed positive screening led to poorer performance for socially responsible investment funds.Norway’s finance ministry has defended the move as a long-term strategy. Although the NKr20bn fund would entail risk, it would also diversify the fund into new territories. Moreover, the ministry would place the same return requirements on the separate fund as the rest of the portfolio.“The sum of the risk profile is responsible and will give a good return over time,” says Kristin Halvorsen, Norway’s finance minister. “We have a hundred years’ perspective.”Pending parliamentary approval this June, the fund would start selling its shares in tobacco producers over a two-month period. The fund owned shares in tobacco companies such as Altria, Phillip Morris and British American Tobacco at the end of 2008, according to the fund’s last public report.The fund also plans to introduce a new watch list for companies in the “grey zone” of exclusion and expand its active ownership policy to include environmental issues, such as climate change, and corporate governance problems relating to transparency and the reporting of payment flows involving tax havens. Companies not found to be in compliance with its ethical guidelines risk being put on the fund’s watch list and potentially excluded from its investment portfolio.The fund has put companies under observation twice before, once with Monsanto with regards to allegations of child labour at supplier farms in India, and most recently Siemens, which last year paid more than $2bn to settle corruption charges in Germany and the US.The fund has so far excluded 29 companies for production of anti-personnel land mines, cluster munitions, and nuclear weapons, as well as human rights violations and environmental damage.The ministry separately announced it was working on new guidelines to limit risk in its active management, as well as an external review of the central bank’s risk management and active management.This will provide the basis for a white paper in the spring of 2010.
117;MO;Altria Group;2009-04-02T21:37:50Z;US tobacco;;"It has been a lousy week for US tobacco companies. Tuesday saw Altria lose an appeal against a $155m civil judgment at the Supreme Court; a 160 per cent increase in federal excise taxes began on Wednesday and the House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday that would allow the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco.Still, tobacco groups have remained profitable in the face of heavy regulatory blows, particularly the $206bn settlement with state governments in 1998, so the latest developments are far from ruinous. The excise tax is likely the worst but will take time to affect sales. Since cigarettes are addictive, demand has been fairly inelastic in the short run, but high prices are thought to have played a role in the steady decline of per capita consumption from almost 4,300 annually in 1965 to below 1,700 now. This is hard to separate though from myriad anti-smoking measures such as health warnings, advertising restrictions and bans on public puffing.In addition to the federal move, many cash-strapped states are in the process of raising their own duties. The real retail price per pack in the US has gone from about 80 cents in 1980 to $4.35 recently, but some places have seen prices rise much more. With the combined city, state and recently raised federal tax, smokers in New York City pay about $10 per pack. South-eastern states had the lowest prices with the differential between South Carolina and New York City at more than $4, making it a mecca for smugglers.Regulation and higher taxes have a silver lining – they make big tobacco too valuable for the government to eliminate altogether. And the big three US tobacco companies, Altria, Reynolds American and Lorillard, generate prodigious free cash flow. With dividend yields between 6 per cent and 10 per cent, no wonder investors find the shares hard to give up.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

118;MO;Altria Group;2009-03-15T09:25:21Z;Pension fund treads a thorny path;;"Norway likes to think of itself as an ethical model for others. It spends 1 per cent of its gross national income on international development assistance and $1bn (£723m, €783m) to save the rainforest in Brazil.But the paradoxes within one of its most visible efforts, the ethical investment strategy of its government pension fund, show how difficult it is to bridge the irreconcilable differences between the two main purposes of the world’s second largest sovereign wealth fund: to make money while investing ethically. The most recent contradiction, and probably most ironic, is the finance ministry’s current consideration of whether to exclude companies for carbon emission violations.Norway’s NKr2,275bn (£239bn, €258bn, $329bn) Government Pension Fund - Global, originally known as the Petroleum Fund, is funded by revenues from fossil fuels and even invests in oil companies. The government was obliged to take up the matter after Norwegian environmentalist group Bellona last year made a formal recommendation to the ministry as part of a white paper on the fund’s management to be submitted to parliament on March 27.The paper is the culmination of the most exhaustive review of the fund’s ethical guidelines since their introduction five years ago. It will provide the eventual basis for any potential changes to the guidelines this summer.“Climate change was central [to the public consultation process],” says Martin Skancke, finance ministry director general for asset management. “But the advice was broad, including positive screening, active ownership and separate allocations towards green technology companies.”Several companies have also made recommendations in the current consultation for the fund to abstain from tobacco company investments. The fund can presently exclude tobacco companies on an ad hoc basis if their marketing poses a serious violation of ethical norms. So far, none have been excluded and in fact the fund has ownership in some of the major tobacco companies, such as Altria and Philip Morris, according to its year-end report.The list of contradictions does not end there. The fund has excluded Lockheed Martin from its investment portfolio, yet the country buys its planes. The fund also temporarily blacklisted US oil company Kerr McGee for pollution violations at a Western Sahara project, despite a Norwegian company being involved in the project.Moreover, Norway has a formal ethics council for the Government Pension Fund - Global, but cannot present conclusive evidence that ethical investing pays off financially.“It’s not difficult to find the paradoxes in this,” says Gro Nystuen, chair of the ethics council. “But if you try and do everything 100 per cent, it is paralysing.”Ms Nystuen is one of five council members, part of whose job it is to recommend which companies to exclude. She says the ethical part of the government pension fund’s investment strategy dates back to the late 1990s when journalists unearthed an embarrassing revelation about the fund’s investment in a Singapore company involved in anti-personnel land mines shortly after Norway hosted the international Land Mine Ban conference in Oslo. The situation prompted the eventual formation of the independent advisory council on ethics in 2004.The blacklist of excluded companies comprises polluting miners, weapons producers and companies with labour violations. The council gets its leads from the Ethical Investment Research Service, a UK screening company that looks at the 7,000 companies in the fund’s portfolio and mines for keywords. Eiris sends the council the names of 40 to 60 possible offenders every month. The council also gets tips from non-government organisations and journalists.The fund recently excluded investments in Canadian mining company Barrack Gold for environmental damages and US company Textron for cluster weapons production. There are currently 29 companies excluded from the fund’s investment portfolio.The council’s work has been conducive to changing the way some companies behave.Monsanto is a key example. The council initially recommended in 2006 that the finance ministry exclude the US agricultural company because of its use of child labour in its cotton seed production in India. But after working together with the company, and even going so far as to physically go into the fields and count children, the ministry decided last year to keep Monsanto because it had made significant improvements.The fund’s ethical investment strategy has also been influential in changing the way other pension funds invest. The Swedish AP Fund was persuaded to disinvest in Wal-Mart following Norway’s lead; Norwegian pension fund KLP has followed the government pension fund’s recommendations, and the fund has influenced the New Zealand Superannuation Fund."
119;MO;Altria Group;2009-02-04T22:41:58Z;Philip Morris shares tumble 4%;;The rapid and relentless rise of the US dollar has prompted Philip Morris International to sharply lower its profit guidance for 2009 on Wednesday, driving shares in the world’s largest cigarette maker down 4 per cent.The group, which was spun off from Altria last year and generates all of its sales outside the the US, said it expected 2009 profit per share to be in the range of $2.85 to $3.00, compared with analyst expectations of about $3.41 and the $3.32 achieved in 2008.While overall sales volume has remained robust, the maker of Malboro cigarettes said the stronger dollar meant the group could take a hit of $0.80 per share in 2009.Louis Camilleri, chief executive said the fall seen in the Russian rouble, Turkish lira, Mexican peso and the Ukrainian Hryvnia alone account for 60 of the 80 cent hit.“The global economic crisis obviously results in uncertainty, particularly on the currency front and at current exchange rates we face a steep hurdle,” he said.PMI’s estimate of currency impact was much more than what the market was expecting. Most analysts had projected it would decrease earnings by 40 cents a share.“The underlying business is performing exactly as we had expected, which in this economy is probably a mild positive,” said Adam Spielman, an analyst at Citigroup. “But in our view the much greater-than-expected currency sensitivity is a clear negative.”Excluding the adverse currency impact, the group said profit is expected to increase between 10-14 per cent.The unfavourable currency comparisons have already cut into to the group’s profit during the last quarter of 2008.Net earnings for the three months to end of December fell 7.8 per cent to $1.4bn, or 71 cents a share, despite a 2.2 per cent rise in revenue during this period.For the year, net earnings rose 14 per cent to $6.9bn, or $3.32 a share. Net revenue rose from $55.2bn to $63.6bn as cigarette shipment volume increased 2.5 per cent to 869.8bn units.Although the group said it has seen no sign yet that the global recession is having a material impact on sales, Mr Camilleri cautioned that “there is no certainty that these trends will be sustained.”“We recognise that the year has barely started and the global economic crisis is still unfolding,” he said.“Regretfully, currency will cast a dark shadow on our financial results should exchange rates remain at current levels,” he added.PMI’s comments on currency headwind also drove shares in other global tobacco groups lower on Wednesday.British American Tobacco closed down 3.1 per cent at £18.54 while Imperial Tobacco fell 2.5 per cent to £18.29.Shares in Japan Tobacco is likely to open lower on Thursday when the market opens in Toyko.
120;MO;Altria Group;2009-02-04T20:32:11Z;Hard Kraft;;"Just because it involves churning out the same processed and packaged food every day, nobody should think that making and marketing the grub is easy. Take Kraft Foods, the largest American producer of edible items, including the famous Kool-Aid, Oreo and Velveeta brands.Fully spun out from the tobacco-stained fingers of Altria in 2007, the group is halfway through a grand turnround plan under chairman and chief executive Irene Rosenfeld. Last year, the company gained plaudits for its ability to raise prices as the cost of agricultural commodities soared, and optimism led to ambitious aims for growth and profits in 2009. However, the outside world has since intervened. Currency moves and higher pension costs prompted a retreat from previous earnings guidance on Wednesday, and falling dairy prices mean less sales growth in prospect. Kraft shares fell by about 10 per cent in response.Falling input prices should give cheese maker Kraft a helping hand on margins. Yet larger issues lurk in the food aisle as consumer desperation replaces aspiration. Private labels’ market share in the US grocery market is around 16 per cent and growing rapidly as the recession bites. It may never reach levels in western Europe, where a concentration of retailer power means private label penetration is 22 per cent, but the downturn is accelerating the structural shift. Retailers like private label because the lack of required marketing support means better margins despite lower price points. It also reinforces the store brand at a time of intense price competition.Kraft is particularly at risk because it operates in several of the more commoditised food categories. Research from Goldman Sachs suggests that share gains for private label are more pronounced in areas such as cheese where penetration is already high. But with Sara Lee also reporting similar troubles, the food manufacturing business is not a place for investors to seek comfort.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

121;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;US smokers win right to sue tobacco group;;"Smokers have been granted the right by the US Supreme Court to sue Altria Group and other tobacco companies over claims their marketing tactics for “light” cigarettes are deceptive.The five-four ruling, which opens Altria’s Philip Morris and its peers to a spate of litigation, affirms an appellate court decision that federal cigarette labelling laws preventing states from enacting additional smoking regulations was not a reason to prevent a lawsuit from proceeding in a Maine district court.Citing the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, a group of long-term smokers claimed they were misled by Philip Morris’s efforts to suggest that Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights were less harmful than regular cigarettes because they had “lowered tar and nicotine”.While the plaintiffs acknowledged that the “light” brands did indeed have less tar and nicotine, they argued that the company knew that smokers compensated for the decreased potency of the cigarettes by holding smoke in their lungs longer or covering filter ventilation holes with their lips or fingers.The labelling act, enacted by Congress in 1965 after the nation’s surgeon general determined that smoking was harmful, requires that every pack of cigarettes sold in the US contains a “conspicuous warning”.The law, which was amended later that decade to strengthen the warning’s language and ban cigarette advertisements on television, pre-empted state laws.Philip Morris also maintained that the suits would undermine the Federal Trade Commission’s efforts to encourage tobacco companies to market low-tar brands.However, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in the Supreme Court’s opinion on the case that “respondents still must prove that petitioners’ use of ‘light’ and ‘lowered tar’ descriptors in fact violated the state deceptive practices statute, but neither the labelling act nor the FTC’s actions in the field prevent a jury from considering that claim”.The court did not rule on the merits of the plaintiffs’ case, which will now proceed in the district court.A federal trial court in Maine had granted Philip Morris’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case in May 2006.“While we had hoped for a dismissal based upon federal pre-emption, it is important to note that the Supreme Court made no finding of liability,” Murray
Garnick, associate general counsel and client services senior vice-president for Altria, said in a statement."
122;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Obama effect fails to reach US markets;;Barack Obama’s victory in the US presidential election has not yet proved helpful for the country’s markets. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones index have slipped more than 6 per cent since the result was announced late on Tuesday.But more optimistic fund managers predict a rally in the next few months and are already looking to reposition their portfolios.Felix Wintle, manager of Neptune’s US opportunities fund, is keen to invest in infrastructure companies, for example, as Obama has suggested that tens of billions of dollars will be spent on rebuilding roads and bridges.Sectors to be avoided include medical insurance and pharmaceutical groups as the new administration is likely to push for lower drug prices and wider access to health insurance.In spite of a possible fallout in the pharmaceuticals sector, Pfizer, which now trades at $16.73, is still a strong bet, Wintle says, as it offers a 7.82 per cent dividend yield and now trades at a forward price/earnings ratio of 6.89 per cent. Bard and Baxter, the two medical device groups, the consumer group P&G and cigarette company Altria are other suggestions.“We’re still looking for cash-rich companies with strong balance sheets which offer dividends,” says Wintle.The consensus appears to be that the US will recover from recession ahead of the UK and the eurozone. But the rebound may take some time. The level of US personal consumption dropped 3.1 per cent in the third quarter – the largest fall since 1980. Unemployment is now 6.1 per cent and is expected to rise as the economy worsens. And this week, the manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) – a telling indicator of the strength of the US economy – fell to its lowest level in 26 years, while the ISM service sector index plummeted to an all-time low, according to Collins Stewart, the broker.Some also worry that Obama – who voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement and once dubbed the North American Free Trade Agreement “a big mistake”– will push for protectionism in trade policies. Such a move could increase inflation and slow the country’s economic growth, critics argue.Even optimists predict it will be difficult for Obama’s administration to introduce all the programmes raised on the campaign trail. “Despite all the financial analyses that are a part of the process, we believe the market impact of the election will be less than most observers think,” says Bob Doll, vice-chairman at BlackRock, the investment house. “Like all elected officials, president Obama will focus on only a fraction of the initiatives he discussed on the campaign trail. And events and surprises inevitably come up. The economy is deeply troubled, markets have been thrown into turmoil and government action has been unprecedented.”Even though investment managers have much to be pessimistic about, many are bullish on the prospects of the US economy in the longer term. Although sterling rebounded to $1.58 this week, analysts predict the dollar will continue to strengthen against the pound as more US hedge funds repatriate assets and investors retreat to US markets after losing money elsewhere. The rise of the greenback will benefit UK investors with money already invested in the US.“We’re reasonably positive about US equities, within reason, and on a relative basis and long term,” says Tim Cockerill, an advisor with Rowan & Co.“The US economy is more balanced than the UK economy, which is so dependent on financial services. It is more dynamic and flexible and the Fed acts aggressively andis determined to pull the US out of recession as quickly as possible. We are certainly more positive on the US than the UK.”
123;MO;Altria Group;2008-10-28T04:06:48Z;Time to begin the bargain hunt;;I have some good news and some bad news for investors. First the bad news: I think the economic and psychological damage inflicted by the global financial crisis has been so severe that both the US and world economies are likely to be weak for a number of years, making it hard to imagine either corporate earnings or the multiples investors are willing to place on those earnings going up for quite some time.Thus, in spite of the devastation visited on equity markets over the past year, I would be shocked to see a sustained comeback in overall share prices over the next two to three years.Now for the good news. Based on the number of cheap stocks I am seeing – they are everywhere – I have never been more bullish in my investment career.With fear running rampant, some of the best businesses are priced today as if their earnings will never rise again, and many lesser businesses are priced as if they might go out of business entirely. While I profess no great insight into calling the bottom of the market, I have never felt greater certainty that with patience and perseverance I will be well rewarded by the stocks I own at current prices.Far more esteemed investors share my bullish views on stocks. Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett recently wrote: “Equities will almost certainly out­perform cash over the next decade, probably by a substantial degree. Today, my money and my mouth both say equities.”In a recent interview with the newsletter I co-edit, Value Investor Insight, pre-eminent value investor Seth Klarman of the Baupost Group made a compelling case for the increased value added from fundamental stock-picking in today’s market environment.“You could argue that for the past 10 or even 20 years, equities haven’t been allowed to get cheap,” he said. “When it appeared the market was really going down – in 1987, 1998, 2000 – the government tended to intervene to prop it up. One of the pernicious problems of doing that when things are about to get cheap is that it creates the illusion that there isn’t much downside risk, and also prevents the necessary creative destruction that happens when an asset gets incredibly cheap.“In the past 15 months we’re starting to see stocks trade at whatever price. There’s a much higher probability that fundamental value investors in this type of period will be able to add value with specific stock selection.”I think Mr Klarman is right and that there are a great number of exciting ideas to choose from. The most interesting opportunities fall into three broad categories, appropriate for investors with risk profiles from the most conservative to the most aggressive.For conservative investors, the stocks of some of the greatest businesses, with strong balance sheets and dominant competitive positions, are trading at their cheapest levels in years – due primarily to the overall market decline and weak economic conditions rather than any company-specific issues. In this category, funds I co-manage own Berkshire Hathaway, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, but the list of the best beaten-up blue chips today would also include Altria, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft.On average, these eight stocks have held up relatively well, falling just more than 25 per cent from their 52-week highs versus a more than 40 per cent drop for the S&P 500. But given the high quality of their businesses, these stocks should trade at closer to 18-20 times next year’s earnings estimates rather than the 12 times at which they trade as a group. And they pay an average dividend yield of 2.8 per cent.Berkshire Hathaway is our favourite blue-chip stock, in large part because we believe it benefits from the credit crunch. Its operating businesses will be negatively affected by the recession, but this should be more than offset over time by the investment opportunities Mr Buffett is taking advantage of to put Berkshire’s enormous cash hoard to work.So far this year, he has invested more than $50bn and he still has tens of billions of dollars of buying power remaining. It is likely his future deals will be struck on even more favourable terms, as those who need capital get more desperate. We estimate that Berkshire Hathaway is trading at least 30 per cent below its intrinsic value – and the few times in the past when we have seen the discount this large, the stock has risen quickly.Berkshire is a great example of letting someone else find bargains for you in this tumultuous time. We have also recently added a position in Leucadia National, a diversified company similar to Berkshire Hathaway that we have long admired but never owned because the stock was never cheap enough – until now.Leucadia is run by two of the savviest investors on the planet, Ian Cumming and Joe Steinberg, and its stock has outperformed Berkshire’s over the past 20 years. Leucadia shares have historically traded at about two times book value but, after a recent 60 per cent decline, can now be bought at less than book.For more adventurous investors looking to buy great companies in the most out-of-favour sectors such as financials and retailers, I recommend American Express and Target. Both stocks are down 50-60 per cent over the past year and trade near 11-year and five-year lows, respectively.Amex, which recently reported better-than-expected earnings, will no doubt suffer significant losses in its credit card business and will be hurt by weak consumer spending for some time, but one does not often have the chance to buy one of the world’s great businesses with excellent long-term growth opportunities at less than 10 times earnings.Target is a similarly superior business facing significant macro headwinds, which have crushed the stock to below 10 times this year’s earnings estimates (which the company recently reaffirmed). In September, Target’s same-store sales were down 3 per cent, yet total sales were up 2.5 per cent, a respectable showing given the environment.Target remains healthily profitable and is taking advantage of its weak share price to buy back stock –4 per cent of its outstanding shares per quarter over the past three quarters – which is exactly what we as investors would hope to see.More aggressive investors would be well served to search for bargains in the energy sector. Speculative excess had crept into prices of energy stocks as oil prices reached as high as $147 a barrel this summer, but now that excess of optimism appears to have been replaced by an excess of fear, as concerns over weak demand have caused energy prices to fall sharply.At the same time, leveraged, momentum-driven investors who were big holders of energy shares have panicked (or are being forced to sell due to margin calls), leading to a more dramatic decline in stock prices.Particularly attractive today, we believe, are natural gas processing and pipeline companies, which have limited commodity-price risk and pay out nearly all of their earnings in hefty dividends. Investors can buy them via publicly traded master limited partnerships such as Crosstex Energy and Atlas Pipeline Partners.Atlas, for example, at a recent $20.30, is priced to yield 16.5 per cent and we consider the dividend payout to be safe. We also see considerable upside in exploration and production company Contango Oil & Gas, which is more of a direct bet on natural gas prices. Recently trading at about $40, we believe the stock price already discounts much lower natural gas prices than today’s level.Last but not least, we consider two companies recently involved in corporate transactions, Wendy’s/Arby’s Group and EchoStar Corporation, to be trading at well below half their respective intrinsic values. Following its recent merger with Triarc Companies, Wendy’s is now being run by Nelson Peltz and his team, top operators and capital allocators who engineered a remarkable turnround at Arby’s and are a good bet to do the same with Wendy’s.EchoStar was spun out of satellite TV company Echo­Star Communications at the beginning of this year and is a collection of satellite technology and set-top box businesses run by legendary founder Charles Ergen. Today’s stock price is so depressed that it nearly equals the company’s cash and investments, meaning an investor is paying almost nothing for the company’s ample assets and cash flows.Successfully navigating today’s market takes a strong stomach, a realistically long investment horizon and a very discerning eye. Regardless of your tolerance for risk, however, the opportunities are out there.• Funds managed by Mr Tilson own Berkshire Hathaway, McDonald’s, Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola, Amex, Target, Crosstex Energy, Atlas Pipeline Partners, Leucadia National, Wendy’s and EchoStar Corporation.The writer is a money manager who co-edits Value Investor Insight and co-founded the Value Investing Congress.

124;MO;Altria Group;2008-10-26T22:16:01Z;J Tobacco aims to blow smoke in rivals’ faces;;On the wall of the chief executive of Japan Tobacco International’s office in Geneva is a picture of a Marlboro man with a difference.In place of the traditional cowboy that has been the face of rival Philip Morris International’s signature brand, is Joe Camel, the advertising mascot for JTI’s Camel cigarettes, decked out in pinch front cowboy hat and rugged leather boots, cigarette dangling from its lips.An avid art collector, Pierre de Labouchere also owns other camel paintings by Chinese contemporary artist Zhou Tiehai, including Joe Camel as Mona Lisa which hangs in his private dining room.But it is the sly subversion of the iconic Marlboro image in his office that best hints at the scale of Mr de Labouchere’s ambitions for Japan Tobacco, the world’s third-biggest publicly listed cigarette maker.“Our goal is to overtake PMI as the industry’s number one,” says Mr de Labouchere with a laugh. “So yes, I guess you can say there’s a subliminal message there [in the painting].”As the head of a division that has been the main driver of profit growth for JT over the past four years, the 54-year old Frenchman has reasons to be ebullient.JT, which also owns food and pharmaceuticals businesses, still has some way to go before it topples PMI from the top spot. But the gap between it and British American Tobacco, the industry’s number two, became a lot narrower last year after JT swooped up Gallaher, the UK maker of Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut cigarettes, for £7.5bn ($12bn). The deal, the largest foreign acquisition ever made by a Japanese company, doubled the size of JT’s international operations overnight and gave it a 10.6 per cent share of the global tobacco market, against BAT’s 12 per cent and PMI’s 15.6 per cent. (The Chinese state tobacco industry remains the biggest player, with 35 per cent of the market).The acquisition has also enabled JTI to secure its dominance in Russia, the world’s third-biggest tobacco market behind China and the US as well as in the former Soviet bloc, where the booming economies are creating a middle class that can afford to trade up to JTI’s higher price brand.As in the US and western Europe, cigarette sales in Japan have fallen steadily over the past decade amid rising health fears and more stringent tobacco advertising regulations and increasingly punitive taxation.With fewer smokers lighting up in its home market, JT has had to look abroad to compensate for the decline. It made its first big move in 1999, when it splashed out $7.9bn to buy Reynolds International, the non-US tobacco operations of RJR Nabisco, the US conglomerate.At the time, many analysts were sceptical whether JT, a former state-owned monopoly that is still 50 per cent-owned by the Japanese government, had the managerial acumen to make the acquisition work.Among those who had reservations was Mr de Labouchere, who was then president of Reynolds International. “I did some research at the time on Japanese acquisitions abroad, and the track record of successful integration was not a good one,” he says. “I was ready to go.” But in an unusual move, Mr de Labouchere – then the president of Reynolds International – was asked to stay on to head the business, which was renamed JTI.“I think [Katsuhiko Honda, JT’s then chief executive] came to the conclusion that to run an international business, you cannot impose a Japanese management culture,” says Mr de Labouchere.Even today, JTI’s structure stands out from most Japanese companies operating abroad in that it has one company for all global operations outside Japan and has its headquarters in Geneva. Of JTI’s 16 executive officers, only two are Japanese, with the remainder hailing from 11 different countries.“We are not Japanese, nor American, nor Swiss, but a truly multicultural, multinational organisation,” says Mr de Labouchere. “The emphasis on this has been very helpful in attracting top talents and in the integration of Gallaher.”But if JTI is today in a position to give PMI and BAT a run for their money, Mr de Labouchere says that is only because of JT’s consistent support.“The company was sick before JT came along,” he says. “RJR was crippled by debt after KKK [Kohlberg Kravis Roberts] bought it in a leveraged buyout. There was no money to develop the international unit. Brands were neglected.”Backed by JT’s deep cashpile and its focus on long-term growth rather than short-term profits, Mr de Labouchere has been able to markedly strengthen the business over the past couple of years.Sales of Winston, its discount cigarette brand, have tripled between 2000 to 2007 to overtake PMI’s L&M as the world’s second-largest cigarette brand. Meanwhile Camel and Mild Seven, its two higher-priced brands, also rank in the top five.With the purchase of Gallaher, JTI now accounts for 48 per cent of JT’s operating income and 70 per cent of its sales volume. The combination of the two companies is expected to generate $400m in cost savings and other synergies by 2010.But the challenge for Mr de Labouchere will be whether he can internationalise any of Gallaher’s brands – most of which are relatively local in nature - in the same way he has with Winston.No less important is how trading in Russia - now its largest market by volume and second-largest by profit - will be affected by the fallout from the market turmoil.In the longer term, JTI still faces gaps in its portfolio, notably in Asia and Africa, and particularly in Latin America - a situation Mr de Labouchere says he would like to remedy.“At the moment our priority is to combine Gallaher into JTI’s existing operations,” he sayswhen asked about the possibility of making further acquisitions. “But we are always looking. Asia is a region we would like to increase our presence in.”
125;MO;Altria Group;2008-10-23T23:30:10Z;Wall St volatile on mixed earnings and jobs news;;"US stocks were mixed after another highly erratic session on Thursday as investors considered whether relatively upbeat corporate earnings showed the global economic slowdown may not be as grim as the market’s brutal sell-off has implied.The session began in upbeat fashion. Dow Chemical, Altria and Eli Lilly were up 10.5 per cent to $24.43, 1.5 per cent to $19.58 and 4.3 per cent to $33.48, respectively, after overshooting analyst estimates.However, the S&P 500 closed up 1.3 per cent to 908.11 points having swung between losses of 4.3 per cent and gains of 2.9 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2 per cent higher at 8,691.25 points but the Nasdaq Composite Index ended 0.7 per cent down at 1,603.91 points.Financials were one of three sectors to drag on the market, down 0.9 per cent. Goldman Sachs tumbled 5.3 per cent to $108.58 after it emerged that the bank was planning to cut 10 per cent of its workforce in response to the deteriorating environment.The sector was also hit by further stress in money markets after signs of improvement this week. The rate at which banks lend to each other over the long-term rose for the first time since the fresh round of government intervention in the banking system this month.General Motors lost 1.5 per cent to $6.10 after it emerged that the group was to begin involuntary lay-offs.The news from Goldman and GM came after first-time unemployment benefit data jumped more than forecast. “There is every reason to expect hiring to drop in the wake of the disaster in the stock markets and the continued tightening of credit,” said Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics.The rise came after the benchmark S&P 500 index fell to a fresh five-year low in the previous session after poor figures from companies such as AT&T and Boeing.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose as much as 14 per cent, to 79.43, which continued to signal a heightened level of distress. It had fallen as much as 7.5 per cent in the session.Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress that the global financial crisis was a “once-in-a-century credit tsunami” and he foresaw more

126;MO;Altria Group;2008-10-15T17:36:11Z;Dealing with the crunch;;The financial crisis has been like a wildly speeded-up version of natural selection. The weak have disappeared at an astonishingly fast rate and the strong are getting bigger and fatter. But not everyone can be a bulky predator like Philip Green or Santander.In the real world, the accelerating markets meltdown has led to a slowdown of corporate activity. Mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, asset sales and rights issues are being shelved, delayed or “reconsidered”. Volatility in the global capital markets provides the perfect excuse to scrap deals that have lost their economic rationale.But what about the good deals? They are being forced on to the slow lane too, starting with the mega ones. BHP Billiton’s $82bn proposed takeover of rival Rio Tinto, set to create a mining behemoth, is proceeding at a snail’s pace, as is Rio’s defence. Rio on Wednesday warned it may delay its plans to sell at least $10bn worth of assets to pay back debt, blaming the financial crisis. The same reason was given by Xstrata for throwing in the towel on its proposed £5bn ($8.7bn) acquisition of Lonmin.Belgian brewing giant InBev has postponed a $9.8bn rights issue meant to finance its $52bn takeover of Anheuser Busch. InBev says the acquisition, the biggest ever in the beer industry, is on track. Investors fear it may still be delayed. In the American telecoms market, there are doubts whether Verizon Wireless will be able to obtain funding for its $28bn acquisition of Alltel. A slide to 2009 is the best-case scenario.Altria, of Marlboro fame, is postponing its $10bn purchase of UST, the leading chewing tobacco manufacturer. The slowdown is affecting all sectors. Waste Management, the biggest rubbish collector in the US, has just binned its $6.7bn offer for rival Republic Services, saying “it would not be prudent”. Indeed. Caught between financial institutions in turmoil and slowing consumer demand, companies have very little room for manoeuvre.

127;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Altria/UST;;While the markets cheered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s de facto nationalisation on Monday morning, Altria nonchalantly announced the $11.7bn takeover of the smokeless tobacco maker UST. It is hard to see outstanding benefits for Altria’s shareholders.The move is the last opportunity for consolidation of any real size left for US-focused Altria. So it is expensive, but not eye-bleedingly so. Finding annual cost savings of $250m should be a simple matter of cutting out UST’s standalone administrative, sales and lobbying functions. Adjusted for the taxed and capitalised value of those savings, Altria is paying just more than 10 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. For a stable, and highly profitable business, that would be a reasonable reinvestment of cash.Yet tobacco remains an industry in decline. The smokeless market is growing moderately, but with a 10th of the revenues of Altria’s main business – Philip Morris USA – UST does not change that fundamental reality. This should not matter, provided that the company focuses on boosting profits and returns, rather than chasing market share for its own sake.It is not clear that Altria will chose the right route. UST currently controls about 60 per cent of the smokeless tobacco market in the US. Its premium brands, however, cost typically three times as much as the budget products which are growing more rapidly. Cutting prices would defend market share, but at the cost of slashing profitability.Comments from management that synergy benefits will be used to deliver both shareholder and “consumer value” suggests that this remains a risk. If so, it would mean that Altria has perhaps not yet learnt the lesson of Marlboro Friday – when the 1993 announcement of price cuts sent share prices tumbling.Since then Marlboro’s US market share has risen by almost half. But operating profits last year for Philip Morris USA of $4.5bn were still below the $5.2bn made in 1992. Financial discipline should not go up in smoke.To email the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
128;MO;Altria Group;2008-09-08T20:59:19Z;Wall St rises after government takover;;Lehman Brothers was a notable outlier from a strong rally in financials on Monday, as investors focused on the embattled investment bank’s internal woes.Although at one stage up as much as 9.4 per cent, the shares closed down 12.7 per cent at $14.15 after analysts – ahead of its much-anticipated third quarter figures – predicted larger writedowns.The sell-off came even as Lehman, which has been in talks with Korea Development Bank over a possible capital injection, said “key strategic initiatives’’ would accompany its results next week.Financial stocks led Wall Street higher on hopes the effective nationalisation of Freddie Mac and Fannie would provide a long-term fillip to the sector.Banks with exposure to the mortgage market fared particularly well. Wachovia jumped 13.4 per cent to $18.99, Bank of America climbed 7.8 per cent to $34.73 and Citigroup gained 6.6 per cent $20.32 respectively.However, institutions with large stakes in Fannie and Freddie suffered as the market capitalisation of the pair collapsed. Gateway Financial lost 24.7 per cent at $5.35, Sovereign Bancorp slid 6.6 per cent to $9.02 and Midwest Banc slipped 24.6 per cent to $4.48.Still, the sector – and the wider market – pared some of its early gains, as more bearish investors noted the government intervention was no panacea to underlying ills.As if to underscore the point, Oppenheimer issued a bearish outlook on investment banks before their third-quarter earnings.As well as Lehman, it lowered its third-quarter earnings estimates for Goldman and Merrill Lynch, which said on Monday it expected a pre-tax loss of between $300m and $350m from a plan to buy back auction-rate securities. Still, their shares edged up 4 per cent to $169.73 and gained 3.2 per cent to $27.59 respectively.Meanwhile, Regions Financial climbed 10.4 per cent to $12.24 after Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co upgraded the Alabama bank from “``underperform” to “market perform’’.It said: “We anticipate that recent credit performance will take a back seat with investors until the euphoria passes.”Meanwhile, Washington Mutual fell 3.5 per cent to $4.12 after the bank was put under special regulatory supervision and named Alan Fishman as its new chief executive. He will succeed Kerry Killinger, who will retire after 18 years.In the broader market, the S&P 500 was up 2.1 per cent at 1,267.79 points by the close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 2.6 per cent higher at 11,510.74 points.David Buik, analyst at BGC Partners, said: “Had Freddie and Fannie defaulted without the assistance of the Treasury and the Fed, the US economy would have fallen into the vortex of recession for at least five years…This action is a confidence booster.”Last week, the S&P 500 suffered its worst weekly loss since February as mounting concerns about the health of the global economy battered sentiment.Homebuilding stocks took particular comfort from the intervention on Monday and were one of the few sectors to hold on to their gains consistently throughout the session. KB Homes, Pulte Homes and Lennar climbed 14.2 per cent to $23.54, 11.3 per cent to $16.22 and 10.3 per cent to $14.95.Earlier in the day, all 10 sector groups boasted gains although by the close energy and materials had edged into negative territory.Technology also struggled to enjoy large gains. Semiconductors suffered amid concerns they were among the most vulnerable stocks to a global slowdown.UBS downgraded its recommendation on NVidia from “neutral” to “sell” and cut its price target from $12 to $11. The shares fell 4.1 per cent to $11.19.UBS also cut its earnings estimate on SanDisk, pushing the shares down 5.9 per cent to $16.60. It said an oversupply of flash memory made it unlikely that prices would recover until the second half of next year.Elsewhere, UAL, parent of United Airlines, tumbled 11.2 per cent to $10.92 after denying a report in the Chicago Tribune newspaper about a possible bankruptcy filing.Altria edged up 0.1 per cent to $20.97 after agreeing to buy UST, a move that will create the largest US producer of smokeless tobacco.
129;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Altria buys UST for $11.7bn;;Altria on Monday announced that it would buy US chewing tobacco maker UST for $11.7bn, in a deal which would help offset Altria's declining US cigarette volumes and boost its position in the tobacco market by expanding its range of alternative tobacco products.Altria, the owner of Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris USA, has tried to build strength in the expanding smokeless tobacco category but has met with little success. UST, which makes Copenhagen and Skoal tobacco and also owns a wine distribution business, is the largest US maker of chewing tobacco.Altria said in a statement that it was offering to buy in cash all outstanding UST shares at $69.50 each, valuing the deal at approximately $11.7bn, including the assumption of approximately $1.3bn of debt.Shares of Altria were up 3.3 per cent at $21.65 in early trading. UST shares were 0.9 per cent higher at $68.16.An agreement between Altria and its smaller rival has long been expected by investors and Wall Street analysts.The two rivals have been unable to strike a deal in the past, largely because of disagreements over pricing, industry sources have said.Shares of UST were hit hard in the summer after it said tougher competition and higher gas prices were affecting its premium smokeless tobacco volumes. The stock had been trading just above $50 in the months before news arrived on Friday of a possible transaction, which sent the stock up to $67.55.According to Altria, the offer represents a premium of 28.9 per cent to UST’s three-month average share price of $53.90.Altria said it expected the acquisition to be accretive to adjusted diluted earnings per share within 12 months and to generate “an attractive double-digit economic return”.Combination of the two companies would lead to around $250m of annual cost saving by 2011, the company added.To finance the acquisition, Altria has changed a two-year, $7.5bn share repurchase programme to a three-year, $4bn programme. It has received $7bn in bridge financing Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan and it plans to access the public-debt market to refinance a portion of its credit facilities.A combination of the US rivals could set off more consolidation in the global tobacco industry, such as the oft-rumoured takeover of Lorillard by Reynolds, industry analysts have said. Lorillard was spun off from Loews last year.US tobacco stocks underperformed the broader market by 4 per cent in the second quarter, according to Goldman, as investors expressed concerns over pricing, volumes and potential increases in regulation and taxes.Altria split its US Philip Morris division from Philip Morris International in March, and investors speculated that it would subsequently consider making an acquisition. Altria bought John Middleton, a cigar maker, late last year.For the first half of 2008, Altria’s operating income was $2.6bn, compared with UST’s $451m. If Altria had owned UST since the beginning of 2008, Altria’s first half revenue would have increased 10.3 per cent to $10.4bn, it said.
130;MO;Altria Group;2008-09-05T20:19:59Z;Altria closes in on $10bn UST deal;;Altria is in late-stage talks over the takeover of US chewing tobacco maker UST for about $10bn.A deal could be announced within days, according to an insider.An agreement between Altria and its smaller rival UST, which has long been expected by investors and Wall Street analysts, would help offset Altria’s declining US cigarette volumes and boost its position in the tobacco market by expanding its range of alternative tobacco products.Altria, the owner of Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris USA, has tried to build strength in the expanding smokeless tobacco category but has had little success. UST, which makes Copenhagen and Skoal tobacco and also owns a wine distribution business, is the largest US maker of chewing tobacco.The two rivals have been unable to strike a deal in the past, largely because of disagreements over pricing, industry sources have said. But UST’s shares rallied more than 25 per cent by the close on Friday, after the New York Times initially reported that the companies were close to a deal.Speculation over the transaction was triggered on Thursday after UST’s top executives cancelled a presentation at a key analyst conference at the last minute. Investors quickly inferred that the move could be related to an imminent deal but the company would not comment on why its executives backed out of the presentation.Shares of UST were hit hard in July and August after it said tougher competition and higher gas prices were affecting its premium smokeless tobacco volumes. The stock closed at $67.55 on Friday, a few dollars below the value that would be implied in a $10bn deal.A takeover of UST at $70 a share would give Altria more flexibility with its balance sheet and boost its earnings per share by 4 per cent in its second year and 7 per cent in its third year, Goldman Sachs estimated.A combination of the US rivals could also set off more consolidation in the global tobacco industry, such as the oft-rumoured takeover of Lorillard by Reynolds, industry analysts have said. Lorillard was spun off from Loews last year.Altria did not return calls for comment.US tobacco stocks underperformed the broader market by 4 per cent in the second quarter, according to Goldman, as investors expressed concerns over pricing, volumes and potential increases in regulation and taxes.Altria split its US Philip Morris division from Philip Morris International in March, and investors speculated that it would subsequently consider making an acquisition.

131;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Altria and Philip Morris;;In any break-up, comparisons with the ex are inevitable. In the case of Altria and Philip Morris International, the differing fates of the US tobacco company and the international operations it recently spun off reflect a larger split in the tobacco market.PMI, freed to seek out overseas growth, shows signs of fulfilling its promise. Smokers in emerging markets find its pricier brands alluring, to the extent that PMI recently increased full-year earnings guidance to reflect growth of 19 to 21 per cent. Life is also good for its nearest competitor, British American Tobacco, which again beat expectations last week with strong growth in Russia, Romania and Asia. A wave of consolidation has left few takeover targets available. So both companies are building market share through innovation: BAT emphasises unusual packaging while PMI has added low-tar ‘Filter Plus’.Altria, however, is having a tougher time. Its shares fell after second quarter numbers last week showed sales slowing more than expected. The results stung because Altria’s chief domestic rival, Reynolds American, which has also struggled with declining volumes, posted a 13 per cent increase year-on-year in earnings per share for the quarter. Both companies also face a changing regulatory framework: the US House of Representatives last week passed a bill that would give the Food and Drug Administration the power to regulate tobacco, although any final action would likely be delayed until after the November presidential election. Altria now sees US cigarette consumption contracting by 3 to 3.5 per cent annually over the long term, worse than its previous 2.5 to 3 per cent outlook.All four companies have outperformed their local indices over the past 12 months, as has the UK’s Imperial Tobacco, reflecting a sense that tobacco stocks are defensive in a recession. After so much consolidation, though, success will now depend on them building up market shares and selling fancier smokes. Aspiring emerging market consumers look like the better bet.
132;MO;Altria Group;2008-07-31T20:01:11Z;PMI sets sights on Canadian rival;;Consolidation in the global tobacco industry continued apace on Thursday after Philip Morris International, the world’s biggest listed tobacco company, agreed to buy Canada’s Rothmans for C$2bn ($1.95bn) in cash.The C$30-a-share offer, which is being recommended by Rothmans’ board, represents a 17 per cent premium to the company’s 20-day average trading price to July 30.The deal, if successful, would give PMI control of a third of Canada’s cigarette market, including the leading share of the country’s fast-growing discount cigarette category.The acquisition would be a first for PMI, which was formed after Altria spun out its overseas operations in March. The move was designed to give the international business more freedom to pursue sales growth in emerging markets as well as shield it from the litigation risks facing the US business.Jonathan Fell, tobacco analyst at Deutsche Bank, said the deal was a sensible one given that PMI already owns 40 per cent of Rothmans Benson & Hedges. Rothman, the listed vehicle that PMI is acquiring, owns the other 60 per cent.Louis C. Camilleri, chairman and chief executive of PMI, said the transaction would not affect 2008 results and would add “modestly” to per-share earnings in 2009.“This proposed acquisition is a win-win for both Rothmans and PMI shareholders,” he said. “Rothmans shareholders will receive a significant cash premium and PMI consolidates its presence in a market that we deem financially attractive and of strategic importance going forward.”The company has generally performed well in a declining market, but has complained that contraband sales were chipping away at its market share.Earnings grew 18 per cent to C$117.6m in its latest fiscal year ended March 31. Sales were 8.4 per cent higher at C$670.6m.
133;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
134;MO;Altria Group;2008-06-06T18:35:33Z;Battleground for smokers lies in new markets;;The era of big tobacco deals more or less came to a close last summer with Imperial Tobacco’s €16.2bn (£12.95bn) acquisition of Spanish rival Altadis.The deal, which came hard on the heels of Japan Tobacco’s £7.5bn approach for Gallaher, consolidated the Bristol-based company’s position as the world’s fourth largest cigarette maker and gave it control of Altadis’s cigar business.In the process, it also meant the global top four – Philip Morris International (which spun off from Altria this year), British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Imperial – now control about 69 per cent of world cigarette sales, excluding China.For Gareth Davis, Imperial’s chief executive, the acquisition of Altadis caps an extraordinary 12-year run at the company. Under his stewardship, Imperial shares, which were worth less than £4 10 years ago, have risen more than sixfold to as much as £27 earlier this year. Pre-tax profits have jumped from £325m in 1997 to £1.2bn last year.In an industry that relies on scale to maintain profit margins amid falling sales in mature western markets, Imperial has proven a master of increasing its share of falling markets while keeping costs down. (The company said it was expecting to generate savings of €300m a year by 2010 from the Altadis takeover, rising to €400m by 2012.)But with most of the big deals done, some are beginning to wonder if Imperial’s rough-and-ready approach and appetite for sweating assets would be enough to keep the company on its winning streak.With cigarette sales falling in the US, parts of Europe and other mature markets amid health concerns, smoking bans, higher taxes and advertising restrictions, analysts say emerging markets will be the big battleground.It is not hard to see why. Setting aside China – which is a closed market dominated by the CNTC, a state-run company – emerging markets accounted for more than two-thirds of world demand for cigarettes in 2007. Although they represent only a third of the industry’s operating profit, sales there are booming. Last year, emerging markets generated 55 per cent of the industry’s profit growth.“Trading up in emerging markets has often resulted in replacing local brands with international brands and, there, the development of these franchises is critical to the long-term success of the international players,” says Jonathan Leinster of UBS.If a company’s success rests on its ability to target growth markets, then PMI, maker of Marlboro cigarettes and BAT, which counts Lucky Strike and Dunhill among its brands, appear well placed. The latter is expected to generate half of this year’s net profits from emerging markets and the former about 40 per cent.Imperial, by contrast, has the lowest exposure among the big four, with only about 17 per cent of its 2008 net profits expected to come from emerging countries, according to UBS.In the world of post-blockbuster deals, analysts say companies will now look to internal growth, state privatisations and smaller deals in emerging markets to increase volumes while lifting earnings through cost-cutting and share buy-backs.In this respect, BAT also appears to be a step ahead of the competition. Having sat out on the wave of consolidation that swept the industry over the past five years because it thought prices for big listed companies were too high, the company came off the sidelines to do two deals in six days this year. It spent a total of about £3bn on Tekel, the Turkish state tobacco company, and Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni, the cigarette arm of Denmark-based ST Group.While modest in size, analysts say these were sensible acquisitions done at a reasonable price. BAT paid 11.4 times historic annual earnings for Tekel and 11.2 times for its Scandinavian deal, well below the 14.2 multiple Imperial paid for Altadis and the 13 multiple Japan Tobacco paid for Gallaher.“Acquisitions are an important source of growth for the tobacco industry, but buying in growth only makes sense when the price is right,” says one analyst. The analyst reckons Imperial would probably have ended up paying 20 per cent less for Altadis had it waited a few months longer. “By then, the credit crunch would have made it much harder for CVC [the rival suitor] to challenge Imperial.”It is the Altadis deal that has helped cement Imperial’s global status, but the high price that Imperial has paid is not without its consequences. The strength of the euro against the pound and Imperial’s decision to buy in Altadis’s minority stake in Logista rather than sell the logistics business forced the company to announce a rights issue last month. The news prompted Imperial shares to suffer their biggest one-day fall in about six years.But not all analysts see Imperial’s exposure to mature western markets as a negative. Eileen Khoo, analyst at Morgan Stanley, the company’s joint broker, says that, given the strength of the euro, having strong exposure to European countries can be an asset.“We believe the earnings outlook has improved for Imperial, given strong currency tailwinds, improving profitability in central and eastern Europe,” she says.Looking ahead, analysts say state monopolies in Egypt and Algeria, if they come up for sale, will generate interest from the big four. But the big question is whether the Chinese market, by far the world’s largest, will open up.“It’s the Holy Grail that everyone is trying to crack,” says one industry veteran. But he warns that, given the size and ambition of the Chinese tobacco industry, western firms could become acquisition targets.
135;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Philip Morris eyes purchases;;Philip Morris International said it would seek acquisitions, cost-cutting and annual earnings growth of 10-12 per cent after the cigarette maker’s spin-off from Altria’s US tobacco business this month.The forecast came as Altria, the world’s largest cigarette maker and owner of the Marlboro brand, gave investors the first financial outlook for the separated companies.In January, Altria said it would spin off PMI to shareholders on March 28 to unlock the faster-growing international cigarette business from the US, where consumption is declining.The move completes the break-up of Altria, the consumer goods conglomerate, which will effectively become Philip Morris USA and will retain its 28.6 per cent stake in brewer SABMiller.Spinning off PMI creates a strong international tobacco group that can use its stock as currency in the consolidation of the global tobacco industry. Altria will also have more flexibility to make moves to grow its US business.Louis Camilleri, Altria’s chief executive, who will become chief executive of the separate PMI, said the break-up of the conglomerate leaves “independent, focused and thriving entities”.In a presentation to Wall Street, PMI executives said they saw a number of attractive acquisition targets around the world. “I can’t tell you the time or scale other than [to say] we are vigorously pursuing those opportunities,” Mr Camilleri said.Potential acquisitions combined with cost-cutting and strengthening Marlboro and other brands worldwide would also help it hit “appropriately ambitious” long-term financial targets, he said.PMI’s forecast over the next several years included annual volume growth of 1-2 per cent.
136;MO;Altria Group;2008-02-11T21:42:03Z;Energy and tech lead gains on Wall St;;US stocks chalked up modest gains on Monday, led by energy and technology companies, helping offset worries about the threat of new turmoil in credit markets.Oil companies attracted buyers as the price of crude reached its highest level in a month and tech stocks were buoyant after Yahoo rejected Microsoft’s takeover bid, raising the prospect of a higher revised offer. Retailers moved higher as traders looked to buy into sector weakness.Insurance companies came under pressure after American International Group dramatically increased its estimate of credit derivative losses, adding to concerns about further writedowns in the financial sector.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,339.12 having fallen 0.8 per cent early on. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,320.06 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 0.5 per cent to 12,240.01.Yahoo’s board formally rejected Microsoft’s $31-a-share offer as inadequate, threatening to trigger a heated takeover battle.Some analysts said the debate might now be one about price and that Yahoo might find it difficult to reject a higher offer. Microsoft is preparing to target Yahoo’s shareholders directly, the FT reported. Yahoo’s shares rose 2.3 per cent to $29.87. Microsoft fell 1.2 per cent to $28.21 after RBC Capital Markets cut its price target from $40 to $31.In a sign of further consolidation in the tech sector The Wall Street Journal said Motorola and Nortel Networks were in discussions about a possible merger of their wireless infrastructure units. Motorola rose 2.8 per cent to $11.57. Nortel fell 1.6 per cent to $10.89.Apple rose 3.2 per cent to $129.45 after Citi Investment Research added it to a preferred list on valuation grounds. It has fallen more than 34 per cent this year.After a stellar run last year, energy stocks have failed to ignite in 2008, falling an average of 11 per cent, as worries about margin pressures and waning US demand have grown. Peabody Energy enjoyed the best of Monday’s gains, climbing 4.9 per cent to $56.52.Chevron, up 1.5 per cent at $80.43, joined ExxonMobil as a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Bank of America was also elevated to the blue-chip average in place of Altria and Honeywell.The changes were the first since April 2004 and are set to apply from February 19. Honeywell, an industrial conglomerate, fell 0.3 per cent to $57.64 and Altria, which is in the process of spinning off its international tobacco business, fell 0.9 per cent to $72.42.Dow Jones’ substitutions reflected the growing importance of oil and gas to the global economy.A broad range of financial stocks remained under pressure as risk indicators pointed to elevated tension in credit markets.AIG’s shares slumped 11.7 per cent to $44.74, their lowest point in almost five years, after the insurer’s auditors found “material weakness” in the reporting of fair valuation of its credit insurance portfolio.“AIG came out and reminded everyone of the continuing problems in credit markets and the financials,” Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, saidHaving updated its valuation model AIG said the gross cumulative value decline in October and November of credit default swaps linked to collateralised debt obligations was almost $5bn, compared with a previous estimate of just over $1bn.Standard & Poor’s cut its equity recommendation on AIG from “buy” to “sell” and Fitch Ratings put the insurer on watch for a possible credit downgrade.The S&P financial index extended last week’s fall of 8.6 per cent, its biggest decline since the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001, as fears grew that corporate and commercial property defaults were set to rise. Investors were also gripped by worries that the market for leveraged loans – used to finance Wall Street deal-making – is also showing signs of stress.Bank of America Securities cut its first-quarter earnings estimates on US brokers prompting Lehman Brothers to fall 3 per cent to $58.25. Credit card issuers were also battered after Fox-Pitt Kelton cut its rating on the sector. Capital One Financial fell 4.4 per cent to $46.82.
137;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;BofA and Chevron selected in Dow shake-up;;Bank of America and Chevron became the latest companies to be selected for the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index on Monday in the first change to the share market barometer since 2004.The new members to the benchmark, which dates back to 1896, replace shares of Altria and Honeywell from next week.The Dow has been one of the most recognisable equity benchmarks for investors since its inception as a 12-stock average.The Dow set a record close of 14,164.53 last October and is trading at 12,122.71, down 8.6 per cent so far in 2008.Changes in the average are supervised by The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board and this is the first time that the 30-member average has been changed since Dow Jones was bought by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp last year.“The catalyst for these changes is the restructuring in progress at Altria, which will result in a much smaller and more narrowly focused company,” said Marcus Brauchli, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal.Constituents of the Dow are chosen with the aim of making the benchmark representative of the US economy.The Dow has gradually moved away from reflecting just industrial companies but critics contend that it remains a narrow market benchmark. Broader, rival indices include the S&P 500.The average is calculated on the price of its 30 constituents and not their market capitalisation. This means Dow stocks with high share prices carry more weight in calculating the average.The addition of Bank of America and Chevron will raise the weighting of the financials sector from 11 per cent to 13.9 per cent and energy from 5.5 per cent to 10.8 per cent, said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.Bank of America was trading 0.6 per cent lower at $41.93 while Chevron was down 0.7 per cent at $78.73. Chevron was in the Dow from 1930 to 1999.Honeywell was dropped because it is the smallest of the industrials in terms of revenue and earnings, said Dow Jones.The changes mean that the weighting of the industrial sector in the Dow, its largest group, will fall from 26 per cent to 22 per cent while consumer staples will decline from 16.4 per cent to 11.6 per cent, said Bespoke.The Dow was last changed in April 2004 when American International Group, Pfizer and Verizon Communications replaced AT&T, Eastman Kodak and International PaperSince then, AIG has fallen 44 per cent, Pifzer has lost 38 per cent while Verizon is up less than 1 per cent.AT&T subsequently become part of the Dow again in November 2005, through its merger with SBC Communications, which had joined in 1999.
138;MO;Altria Group;2008-02-06T20:25:06Z;Tobacco brands;;Where does Altria’s plan to spin off Philip Morris International leave the company’s Marlboro cowboy?For decades now, Marlboro has been the only truly global tobacco brand. Other tobacco companies sell their products all over the world, but Marlboro, with an 8.6 per cent share, is the only one that can lay claim to more than 2 per cent of the world cigarette market by volume.That may be about to change. Five other brands now hold at least 1.5 per cent of world market share and sales of all, except Japan Tobacco’s Mild Seven, are growing rapidly. Marlboro, by contrast, appears to be in decline. Its sales peaked in 2000 at 500bn cigarettes and fell to 455bn in 2007.Marlboro is facing multiple challenges. As a premium brand, it prospered between 1970 and 2000 by convincing western Europeans to trade up, but demand there is now sinking, according to AC Nielsen. Growth lies elsewhere. Discount brands Winston (shared by Japan Tobacco and Reynolds) and Philip Morris International’s own L&M are luring two types of customers: economising westerners and smokers in the emerging economies looking to upgrade, but unwilling to pay premium prices. Further down the sales chart, British American Tobacco brands Kent and Dunhill have also stolen a march on Marlboro with innovative packaging. Though their sales are still less than one-tenth of Marlboro’s, they are seen in Russia and elsewhere as trendier and more luxurious, analysts say. Then there is China, which remains essentially closed to outsiders. Five of the top 10 brands are now Chinese.But much of the developing world is still up for grabs. Marlboro’s managers have recently sought to freshen its image with brand extensions, including Indonesian clove cigarettes and Swedish smokeless tobacco. These forays will not be enough. Philip Morris International will need a lot more than its cowboy to stay ahead of the pack.Post and read comments on this Lex
139;MO;Altria Group;2007-12-17T19:11:54Z;Loews moves to spin off Lorillard;;Loews, the insurance-to-hotel group controlled by the Tisch family, is to sever its 40-year ties with its $14bn tobacco business Lorillard, in a move that underlines the US conglomerate’s desire to capitalise on the slowing domestic economy.The spin-off of Lorillard – maker of Newport menthol cigarettes, the second-largest brand in the US – will enable Loews to tap into investors’ renewed appetite for tobacco companies, which are less exposed to an economic downturn.The separation of Lorillard – acquired by Loews in 1968 – is also aimed at lifting the threat of tobacco litigation from the rest of the group, improving its credit rating and reducing the cost of raising funds for acquisitions.The move by Loews suggests conglomerates and other value investors such as Warren Buffett are looking to the liquidity squeeze and deteriorating economic environment as an opportunity to reshape their portfolios and make acquisitions.Analysts said independent Lorillard – which last year had revenues of $3.8bn and profits of $826m, about a third of Loews’ total earnings – could be a target for tobacco groups looking to improve their fortunes in the slow-growing US market.Chas Manso de Zuniga, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, said: ”The part that makes Lorillard attractive is …Newport, which is the leader in the menthol segment of the cigarette industry and a premium brand.”In August, Louis Camilleri, chief executive of Altria, parent of the world’s largest cigarette maker Philip Morris, said a planned split between its fast-growing international unit and its US business would provide “a potential acquisition currency” for both units. Philip Morris USA, which had $18.5bn in revenues last year and control of the dominant Marlboro brand in the US, lacks a dominant menthol cigarette brand.Altria declined to comment.Lorillard, whose stock market value is partly captured by shares in Carolina Group, a tracking stock issued by Loews, was valued at about $14bn on Monday.Jim Tisch, Loews’ chief executive, told the Financial Times the Lorillard spin-off move was driven by the desire to increase shareholder returns and improve Loews’ ability to hit the acquisition trail.“We are here to create value for our shareholders,” he said. “As a result of the transaction, there will be a dramatic improvement in our perceived risk profile”.Mr Tisch added that the Lorillard spin-off should prompt Wall Street analysts to revaluate Loews. He said the company was largely followed by tobacco analysts rather than conglomerates specialists, adding that he wanted Loews to be covered by the same analysts that follow Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.However, Moody’s, the credit rating agency, on Monday said it would retain its Loews’ rating unchanged.Under the terms of the deal, expected to be completed in the middle of next year, investors in Carolina Group will receive new shares in Lorillard.Loews will also exchange the 38 per cent stake it directly owns in Lorillard by distributing it to Loews’ shareholders in exchange for common stock.
140;MO;Altria Group;2007-11-27T20:02:45Z;Tobacco;;Historically large tobacco companies have been great defensive stocks because smokers still light up during a recession. A recent JPMorgan analysis found that tobacco stocks outperformed the broader US market by an average of 17 per cent in all the recessions and bear markets from 1973 to 1999. The margin in Europe was only slightly less impressive at 13 per cent. Only food stocks, the research found, did equally well.On the surface, there is reason to believe the same magic would work again if the US economy gets into trouble and other countries begin to follow suit. In theory, the big cigarette companies – Altria, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco – are even better positioned to ride out a slump now because they are more geographically diversified and sell at a wider range of price points. Tobacco also has an advantage compared with other consumer staples: it does not have to compete with other sectors for its main input.There is a wrinkle. Tobacco stocks have been on an incredible run this decade – Datastream’s world tobacco index tripled, compared to a 30 per cent increase for its total market index. The reasons are myriad: US litigation costs finally appeared to be contained, investors returned to traditional economy stocks, and mergers and acquisitions boomed as the industry consolidated. More recently, recession fears have come into play as investors started piling into consumer staples.These days, tobacco stocks are no longer cheap. BAT, Imperial and Altria are trading at 15 to 16 times next year’s consensus earnings, above the average of about 11 for the FTSE 100 and 14 for the S&P 500. Japan Tobacco is even higher at 26 times earnings, although accounting differences complicate comparisons. With world cigarette sales volume growing very slowly, tobacco companies need to shift customers to higher-priced brands to maintain their earnings growth. It is not clear that strategy will continue to work if smokers start economising. Tobacco still looks to be a safe haven, but it may not be a lucrative one.
141;MO;Altria Group;2007-11-08T00:24:18Z;Kraft moves to appease Peltz;;Kraft Foods has reached an agreement with Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, over the appointment of two board members, in a move that removes the possibililty of a bitter proxy battle with his Trian Partners funds.The world’s second-largest US food company, which completed its spin-off from Altria in April this year, said it was expanding its board with two new independent members, Lois Juliber, the retired vice-chairman of Colgate-Palmolive, and Frank Zarb, managing director of Hellman & Friedman to its board.As a result, Mr Peltz’s Trian funds have pledged to support the election of the full, expanded Kraft board at its next two annual meetings, and to maintain their stake in the company below 9.9 per cent.Trian has built up a 2.4 per cent share of Kraft’s outstanding shares.Kraft sought to downplay suggestions that it had succumbed to pressure from Mr Peltz.Nancy Daigler, Kraft’s spokeswoman, said Kraft had intended to add independent members to its board after it the spin-off from Altria, and that the two directors had been “selected by Kraft, and supported by Trian.”“We saw this as a pragmatic path forward and we took it,” she said.Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive, said the board “is united in its goal of building value for all of our shareholders, and we are delighted to welcome Lois and Frank as directors”.Trian said in a statement it “has developed a positive relationship in recent months” with Ms Rosenfeld and supported her “previously announced initiatives to further enhance performance”.“Given Kraft’s terrific portfolio of brands, Trian believes there are numerous opportunities to continue to enhance shareholder value.”With a market capitalisation of $51.5bn and sales or around $35bn, Kraft is one of the largest US companies to respond to the concerns an activist shareholder. In February, Home Depot accepted a board member nominated by Ralph Whitworth’s Relational Investors to avoid a proxy fight.In 2006, Mr Peltz fought an acrimonious proxy battle with Heinz, publishing a “white paper” criticising the company’s management. He and an associate subsequently won seats on Heinz’s board. Trian was also involved in an activist campaign against the management of Wendy’s in the same year.At Kraft, Mr Peltz reportedly wants an increased focus on its core brands, and divestitures to fund overseas expansion.After Mr Peltz took his stake in Kraft, the company competed its first major acquisition under Ms Rosenfeld in July, with a $8.4bn (€5.3bn) deal to buy Danone’s biscuit unit.Ms Rosenfeld indicated over the summer that Kraft would dispose of under-performing units.

The S&P 500 closed
0.2 per cent higher 1,541.24.The Nasdaq Composite closed 1 per cent higher at 2,792.67 having fallen as much as 1.8 per cent from its peak only to rally later. Technology was by far the best performing of the S&P’s leading 10 sectors.After the market closed Ebay, the online auction site, reported better than expected third-quarter earnings. Excluding a $1.39bn write-down of Skype, its web-based phone service, profit was 53 per cent higher at $563.8m, or 41 cents a share, compared to 33 cents expected by analysts. Revenues increased 30 per cent to $1.89bn. The stock closed up 5.2 per cent at $40.60 and was 0.5 per cent higher in after-hours trade.Intel, IBM and Yahoo reported earnings after the market closed the previous day and though all beat expectations the shares enjoyed mixed fortunes.Yahoo was the best tech performer, up 8 per cent at $28.82 after net income declined less than anticipated and revenues rose
12 per cent. Intel, up 4.9 per cent at $26.72, attracted buyers after third quarter earnings increased 43 per cent to $1.86bn. IBM fell 3.2 per cent to $115.78, in spite of increasing earnings by 6.3 per cent, as investors were spooked by a 10 per cent decline in hardware revenues.Nvidia, a graphics chipmaker, gained 7.7 per cent to $39.54 after an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners raised her profits estimate. Google, which reports today, rose 2.8 per cent to $633.48.Equity indices were volatile. The Beige Book, a survey of anecdotal reports from the Fed’s 12 regional reserve banks, said the economy was still growing but the “pace of growth decelerated since August” in five regions.“Contacts in a number of industries indicated a higher-than-usual degree of uncertainty about the outlook for economic activity,’’ the Fed report said.“Residential real estate markets continued to weaken, and most districts reported additional declines in home sales, prices and construction.”There was more bad news for the real estate sector as housing starts slumped 10.2 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 1.191m annual rate in September, worse than an expected 4.2 per cent slide. That followed a fall of 3.2 per cent in August. For the past year to September, housing starts are down 30.8 per cent.The S&P homebuilder index was down 2.4 per cent at 404.20. The S&P consumer staples index, a bellwether of negative economic sentiment, closed 0.2 per cent higher at 291.15.After the market closed Washington Mutual, the mortgage lender, said third quarter profit fell 72 per cent to $210m.But JPMorgan beat earnings estimates in spite of the credit squeeze in the third quarter. It offset large leverage loan write-downs and credit-loss provisions with a big jump in its asset management and treasury services businesses. The shares gained 2.8 per cent at $46.37.The S&P financial index slipped 0.1 per cent at 457.77. Citigroup was one of the most actively traded stocks, falling 0.3 per cent to $44.66, hitting its lowest level in two years.

143;MO;Altria Group;2007-08-31T21:18:41Z;Wall St up as Bush offers subprime help;;"Wall Street ended the week mixed after a stuttering rebound followed the heavy losses suffered on Tuesday with continuing disquiet about the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis.The leading indices all closed higher for the day, after President George Bush announced that the US government would help some Americans with delinquent mortgages keep their homes.Markets appeared to have taken heart from earlier comments from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who said the central bank would “act as needed” to prevent the credit crunch from damaging the US economy.Although markets were cheered by the president’s plan, William O’Donnell, strategist at UBS, said the Bush proposal – allowing the Federal Housing Administration to act as guarantor of some loans from homeowners who are more than 90 days overdue – was “palliative” rather than a solution to the subprime mortgage crisis.The S&P 500 closed up 1.1 per cent on the day, but was 0.4 per cent lower for the week at 1,473.99, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2 per cent for the day and 0.8 per cent for the week to 2,596.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher on the day and 0.2 per cent down for the week at 13,357.74.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies had gained 1.3 per cent for the day but was 0.8 per cent off for the week at 792.86.Higher equity volatility suggested that nervousness continued to cloud investor sentiment. The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index fell 7.1 per cent for the day to 23.29, but was 12.5 per cent higher over the week after dropping more than 30 per cent last week.The Bush plan gave relief to stocks after reports earlier in the week showed sharp falls in home sales and house prices had fuelled a bearish mood among investors.Countrywide Financial, the biggest US mortgage lender, rose 1.1 per cent for the day to $19.85, although the company’s shares finished the week down 5.5 per cent and have lost half their value since mid-June.Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage company, also recouped some of the losses it suffered on Thursday after reporting a 45 per cent plunge in second-quarter net income on a $320m loss on new mortgages. Its shares gained 2.6 per cent on the day, but were down 3.1 per cent for the week at $61.61.Accredited Home Lenders gave the mortgage sector a lift after Lone Star Funds, which had been seeking to abandon its $400m purchase of the struggling subprime mortgage lender, said it was prepared to complete the deal for a reduced price.Accredited shares soared 50 per cent for the week to $9.05.Investment banks staged a moderate recovery but still finished the week lower after Merrill Lynch said tighter credit markets would hit earnings at Citigroup, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.It cut its profit estimates for the three banks and lowered the recommendations on their shares to “neutral” from “buy”. Financial stocks were dealt another blow on Thursday when Lehman Brothers Holdings cut its third-quarter and second-half earnings forecasts.Lehman Brothers, the biggest underwriter of bonds backed by home loans, was 9.2 per cent lower for the week at $54.83; Citigroup lost 3.3 per cent to $46.88; Bear Stearns was down 7.2 per cent at $108.66; and Merrill Lynch fell 3.2 per cent to $73.70.On the upside, technology stocks performed well, as investors welcomed positive earnings results and appeared ready to bet that companies in the sector would continue to be insulated from woes in the credit markets.Dell, the second-largest maker of personal computers, rose 1.8 per cent over the week to $28.25, as the company posted stronger-than-expected quarterly profits and Lehman Brothers raised its target price for the stock to $30.Apple climbed 2.4 per cent to $138.48 after the company issued invitations to an event next week at which it is widely expected to unveil a new version of the iPod digital music and video player.Oracle rose 1.7 per cent for the week to $20.28 after SAP, the German software maker that it is suing for alleged theft of program codes, offered to settle.In other sectors, Altria Group rose 0.3 per cent to $69.41 after it announced it would spin off Philip Morris International, its tobacco unit, and raised its quarterly dividend by 8.7 per cent to 75 cents a share."
144;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:55:11+0000;Altria to split up Philip Morris;;Altria Group on Wednesday said it would split the international and domestic operations of Philip Morris, the world’s biggest cigarette maker, into separate public companies in a long-anticipated move.The fast-growing international unit, Philip Morris International, will be spun off to shareholders, severing it from Philip Morris USA, which is suffering from falling US cigarette consumption. The spin-off is set for next year after a unanimous board vote. Timing will be given on January 30.Louis Camilleri, Altria chief executive, will become chief executive of PMI, whose operations are based in Lausanne, Switzerland, but with a small headquarters office retained in New York. Altria will in effect become PMUSA, led by Michael Szymanczyk, and it will retain its 28.6 per cent stake in the brewer SABMiller.The move will complete the break-up of the Altria conglomerate, highlighted by the closure of the New York headquarters, cutting about 400 parent company jobs with an estimated $250m in cost savings.Altria has restructured, including a spin-off in March of Kraft, its US food unit, to boost value for shareholders as the US tobacco litigation threat receded.The last step marking a milestone in the global tobacco industry was to restructure Philip Morris, which makes Marlboro, one of the world’s most recognisable brands, and PMUSA’s and PMI’s increasingly different business agendas. Mr Camilleri said: “I am convinced that this transaction will enhance growth at both Altria and Philip Morris International.”A standalone PMI would be a fast-growing global contender. It has a 15.4 per cent share of the international cigarette market, but only 5 per cent of its profits come from emerging markets, which make up 60 per cent of international cigarette consumption. Its balance sheet would be strong and its stock would be robust currency to participate in rapid industry consolidation.PMI, which accounts for almost three-quarters of the cigarette makers’ total revenue, has made recent acquisitions in Indonesia and Pakistan and eyed fast-growing Asian and eastern European cigarette markets.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, said: “It’s at this point that we expect the beast to be unleashed…and shareholders will be rewarded.”Separating PMI and PMUSA is likely to cheer Wall Street as it will free both groups to become more efficient. Altria shares were up by just over 1 per cent at $69.80 at the close.Lehman Brothers and Centerview Partners advised Altria.
145;MO;Altria Group;2007-08-29T22:05:42Z;Altria splits;;First came the snack break. Altria spun off its Kraft food business, releasing it from the cloud of litigation risk. That made complete sense. Now it is following through with a cigarette break. Altria on Wednesday announced plans for the long-anticipated split between its fast-growing international business (Philip Morris International) and its mature US operations.The split no longer looks as compelling as it did. As litigation risk has subsided Altria has narrowed the valuation gap with international rivals. A few overseas consolidation opportunities have slipped away: Japan Tobacco bought Gallagher of the UK and Imperial is buying Altadis of Spain. And splitting up has its disadvantages. Not least, Altria’s Marlboro brand would be owned by two companies with potentially differing views on how to position it. New product development would no longer be shared.That said, Altria can still justify pressing ahead. First, as regards litigation, a split would theoretically give PMI (almost three-quarters of Altria’s tobacco revenue) a clean bill of health. That could lure in timid investors worried about legal woes returning to haunt the US business. Second, from a business perspective, PMI will have a very different profile. Volumes are growing rapidly, especially in Asia. It has space to grow market share and use its strong balance sheet to pursue what international deals are left. The US business, by contrast, already has 50 per cent market share and volumes are declining. It must focus on building a presence in smokeless tobacco while maximising cash returns to shareholders.Altria has a story to tell. But, given the record of recent demergers, it might take longer than hoped for any benefits to be reflected in the share price of the new companies.
146;MO;Altria Group;2007-08-29T20:28:13Z;Wall St rallies led by tech stocks;;Wall Street stocks rebounded strongly on Wednesday after sharp falls in the leading indices on Tuesday.Markets were lifted by the release of a letter from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to Charles Schumer, chairman of Congress’s Joint Economic Committee, saying the Fed is closely watching financial markets and is ”prepared to act as needed” should the economy be threatened.Shares were also bolstered by a resurgent technology sector, Altria’s long-awaited spin-off of Philip Morris International and some better-than-expected earnings results.Rebecca Engmann Darst, equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers, said US shares had in effect “recovered from a sullen, late-session tantrum” on Tuesday, sparked by the release of somewhat dour minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting.She said it showed how at times the markets had strayed from examining fundamentals. “Investors seem more preoccupied with watching a circus freak show than the main attraction of the economy.”The S&P 500 closed up 2.2 per cent at 1,463.76 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.5 per cent to 2,563.16.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.9 per cent higher at 13,289.29 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 2.5 per cent at 787.32.The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was up six basis points at 4.57 per cent.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index fell by 10.2 per cent to 23.63 after two days of sharp rises.The Nasdaq was boosted by healthy rises in several technology shares. Seagate Technology shares rose 3.8 per cent to $25.39 after the leading maker of computer hard-disk drives raised its first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late on Tuesday and several analysts lifted their price targets for the company’s stock.Apple was another strong performer, climbing 5.7 per cent to $134.08 after the company issued invitations to an event next week at which it is widely expected to unveil a new version of the iPod digital music and video player.Google rose 1.3 per cent to $512.88 after the internet search engine said George Reyes, its chief financial officer, would leave by the end of the year.Mr Reyes sparked a sharp drop in Google shares in February 2006 when he made off-the-cuff comments about the company’s need to “find other ways to monetise our business”.Oracle was another technology company in investors’ sights after SAP, the German software maker that it is suing for alleged theft of program codes, offered to settle. Its shares closed 4 per cent higher at $20.13.In other sectors, Altria Group rose 1.1 per cent to $69.80 after its expected announcement that it would spin off Philip Morris International, its tobacco unit. Altria also raised its quarterly dividend by 8.7 per cent to 75 cents a share.In earnings news, Big Lots had its biggest rise since March, gaining 9.9 per cent to $28.91 after the biggest US seller of discontinued goods reported second-quarter earnings above expectations.Borders Group shares rose 1 per cent to $14.94 after it reported a second-quarter net loss of $25.1m compared with a net loss of $18.4m last year. The slimmer-than-expected losses prompted Standard & Poor’s to upgrade the shares from “sell” to “hold”.“While industry conditions remain as challenging as ever, and we expect Borders Group’s turnround to take longer than management projects, the recent 35 per cent slide in share price mitigates further downside risk,” said Michael Souers, the ratings agency’s specialty retail analyst.In a sign that the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis continues to cloud investor sentiment, State Street shares fell 0.3 per cent to $61 on concerns about how credit-market turmoil has hit its managed funds.Mortgage applications fell by 4 per cent in the week to August 24, according to a report released on Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association.Dillard’s shares fell 0.6 per cent to $24.20 after it posted a hefty second-quarter net loss.Amgen was in the spotlight after a US federal court ruled that Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, had been infringing one of the biotechnology company’s patents. Its stock rose 2.4 per cent to $50.19 by the close of trading.Boeing shares were up 1.3 per cent to $96.90 after it said it had secured a $515m Nasa contract to produce the upper stage of the Ares I crew launch vehicle.Shares in PDL BioPharma plunged 20.3 per cent to $18.80 after the developer of technology for cancer medicines announced a restructuring and was downgraded by JPMorgan Chase.
147;MO;Altria Group;2007-08-27T20:40:42Z;Wall St falls on poor homes sales;;Wall Street stocks finished the trading session lower on Monday after a report said sales of existing homes in the US had dropped in July for a fifth consecutive month.Sales were down to their slowest pace in nearly five years while house prices have fallen in every month of the past year.By the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.9 per cent at 1,466.79 points and the Nasdaq Composite had lost 0.6 per cent to 2,561.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,322.13 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was 1.2 per cent lower at 789.45.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index – which last week fell more than 30 per cent – gained 9.9 per cent to 22.76.The National Association of Realtors reported sales of previously owned homes declined 0.2 per cent in July, less than forecast, to an annual rate of 5.75m from 5.76m in June. The median price of a house sold in July fell to $230,200, down by 0.6 per cent from a year ago. This marked a record twelfth consecutive month that home prices had declined from a year before.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said that given that context, “prices would be falling even if all was well in the mortgage market. So in today’s troubled circumstances, we have to expect steep declines for the foreseeable future.”Noting a sharp increase in housing inventory, Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said the report “in combination with credit problems is bound to put significant downward pressure on prices in coming months …We will probably have to await another couple of months to better survey the damage caused by the credit tremors.”Adding to the bearish sentiment, a survey by the National Association of Business Economics showed that economists thought credit worries were more of an immediate threat to the US economy than terrorism. Some 32 per cent of respondents in the National Association of Business Economics study said loan defaults and excessive debt were their chief short-term concerns, while 20 per cent cited terrorism.Countrywide, which has borne the brunt of concerns over subprime mortgagea, lost 4.8 per cent to $20 after Lehman Brothers reduced its 2007 earnings per share estimate for the biggest mortgage lender in the US from $2.80 to $1.00. Lehman cited “extraordinary weakness” in the secondary market for loans held by Countrywide, whose shares have lost more than 50 per cent of their value since mid-May.Continuing pessimism over credit also hit Bear Stearns, which fell 4.2 per cent to $112.20 and Lehman Brothers , whose shares lost 4.3 per cent to $57.75.Shares in Home Depot gained 1.6 per cent to $35.25 after the retailer agreed to sell its wholesale distribution business to a group of private equity firms for $8.5bn, $1.8bn less than originally planned.Wal-Mart was in the spotlight after the Financial Times reported that the world’s biggest retailer was considering making acquisitions in the US for the first time in more than 25 years. The company’s shares closed 0.2 per cent higher at $43.82.Takeover news moved shares in several companies. US Steel fell 0.4 per cent to $93.01 after the company said it would buy Stelco of Canada for about $1.1bn.Chicago Bridge & Iron stock lost 0.2 per cent to $38.12 after it agreed to buy Lummus Global from ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, for $950m.Rio Tinto fell 0.7 per cent to $271.99 after it said it had won US antitrust approval for its $38.1bn purchase of Alcan, the Canadian aluminium producer, whose shares rose 0.6 per cent to $97.96.Shares in First National Bancshares lost 0.1 per cent to $14.73 after it said it had agreed a $59.3m stock-and-cash deal to buy Carolina National, whose shares rose 43.4 per cent to $19.50.Gateway had its biggest rise since its initial public offering in December 1993 after Acer of Taiwan said it would buy the company for $710m, creating the world’s third biggest computer-maker. Its shares leapt 50.4 per cent to $1.82.Altria Group gained 1.3 per cent to $70.08 on the expectation that the cigarette-maker will announce on Wednesdaya spin-off of Philip Morris International.Shares in Neurochem fell 43.2 per cent to $3.16 after the biotechnology company said its Alzheimer’s drug had failed in a clinical trial.
148;MO;Altria Group;2007-08-26T21:01:44Z;JT sets tough targets in Europe;;Japan Tobacco, which completed a takeover of UK-based Gallaher in April, has laid out aggressive targets for its European business.Hiroshi Kimura, chief executive of the world’s third-biggest cigarette maker, said JT could generate pre-tax profits of $1bn or more in top overseas markets such as the UK and Russia, a significant increase even after the addition of Gallaher’s brands.“I think there are some places where we can hope to earn at least $1bn from a single market,” he said. “Right now only Japan is that big for us.”JT, half owned by the Japanese government, paid £7.5bn ($15bn) for Gallaher in an acquisition designed to close the gap with the world’s top two – Altria, parent of Phillip Morris, and British American Tobacco.The addition of Gallaher, whose brands include Silk Cut and Benson & Hedges, gives JT a roughly 10 per cent share of global cigarette sales.Its leading 34 per cent share in Russia is seen as particularly valuable, because smoking rates in the country remain highIts total international tobacco earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation came to $1.09bn last year.JT operates in 120 countries and considers 11 to be “core markets”. In the UK, where JT had little presence before the acquisition, Gallaher made a pre-tax profit of £317m.Earnings in Russia and other former Soviet states totalled £85m. Mr Kimura said profit growth would come from cost cuts and higher sales as a result of better marketing and quality-boosting investments in new blends and machinery.It is the same investment-focused strategy JT applied to its 1999 acquisition of RJR Nabisco’s non-US cigarette operation, Mr Kimura said. He oversaw integration of the two companies as an executive at JT’s Geneva-based international arm.
149;MO;Altria Group;2007-08-26T17:25:42Z;Altria reaches crossroad on Philip Morris;;The future of the world’s largest cigarette maker, Philip Morris, comes into focus this week, as the board for parent group Altria meets with an opportunity to decide to spin off the fast-growing international tobacco business from the declining US unit.Wednesday’s meeting is highly anticipated by Wall Street for gauging the continuing momentum of US-group Altria’s methodical restructuring. In March, Altria spun off Kraft, its food business.Next on the agenda is the expected spin-off of Philip Morris International (PMI) into a separate company, and away from Philip Morris USA (PMUSA) and falling US cigarette consumption. Altria’s other asset is a minority stake in brewer SABMiller.A standalone PMI would be a fast-growing global competitor with a strong balance sheet. It has a 15.4 per cent share of international cigarettes, but only 5 per cent of its profit comes from emerging markets – which make up 60 per cent of the international cigarette consumption. Its shares would be robust currency for it to participate in rapid industry consolidation.Consideration of the spin-off comes after Louis Camillieri, chief executive of Altria, told shareholders in April that the group’s long-term strategic course including PMI’s future would be examined over the summer.Mr Camillieri said then at its annual meeting: “Over the next several months, we will continue to carefully and diligently examine the benefits of a spin-off of PMI and other possible value-enhancing options.”Altria declined to comment, except to reiterate that the board has a history of meeting every year at the end of August. It is a meeting where the dividend is declared too.Nevertheless, Wall Stall continues to see Mr Camillieri’s words and Altria’s actions as a signal that Wednesday is the crossroads for Philip Morris and PMI. For months, analysts have looked ahead to the board meeting.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, has predicted for months that Wednesday’s meeting would produce the decision to spin off PMI.Christopher Growe, analyst at AG Edwards, said: “We believe the company will announce its intention to spin-off Philip Morris International and increase its dividend by 9 per cent.”He estimates PMI comprises nearly 70 per cent of Altria’s potential break-up value, or roughly $52 per share, because of profits and growth prospects.Filippe Goossens, analyst at Credit Suisse, said: “Following the successful Kraft spin-off, we believe that Altria’s board will likely use its next scheduled board meeting to decide on a potential spin-off of PMI in order to maintain its current momentum.”But Mr Goossens also sees potential merit in keeping Philip Morris units combined, as the stabilised US litigation situation has closed the valuation gap between it and overseas competitors. He, along with other analysts, sees a large share buy-back – as big as $28bn – as an alternative strategy, but that a spin-off is still most likely. Other Altria’s moves signalled that it could be preparing for the spin-off of PMI.In June, the group made PMI self-sufficient, but removing overlaps in cigarette production and shifting remaining US production of PMI cigarettes to Europe by third quarter next year.Altria also has exhibited a methodical approach to restructuring, mirroring Mr Camillieri’s strategy of restructuring in “chronological” order.Altria is expected to use a similar template in a PMI spin-off to that used for Kraft, where it first announced an intent to separate the food group, then in several later steps updated investors on timing.There is also the potential for legal challenges by tobacco litigation plaintiffs to try to block a spin-off of PMI.
150;MO;Altria Group;2007-08-20T18:00:35Z;Observer: Painting the town ‘Rudd’;;Kevin Rudd’s tilt at becoming Australian prime minister has stumbled after revelations of alcohol-fuelled late night shenanigans in a New York “gentlemen’s club” four years ago.Rudd, who has enjoyed favourable polling since he was elected Labor leader last year, was forced to admit and then apologise for his clandestine visit to the Scores strip club with Warren Snowdon, a fellow Labor MP, and Col Allan, New York Post editor, after an Australian newspaper reported in some detail the night’s proceedings.Although Allan says Rudd acted “like a perfect gentlemen” it is unclear what actually transpired on the premises. Rudd confesses to a lapse in memory owing to being heavily intoxicated.Reports of the drunken Manhattan affair contrast with Rudd’s clean-cut, family-man image.However, Rudd said: “I’ve never seen myself as some holy Joe”, and says he told his wife about the incident the next morning.How much this error of judgment will affect his popularity is not yet clear, especially as the incident took place some time ago.On Monday Labor was pointing fingers at Alexander Downer, foreign affairs minister, for leaking the story because of an unrecorded aside he made in parliament three months ago. “We know all about you and Col in New York,” Downer reportedly said to the Labor leader. Rudd may fear further revelations are yet to come.A generous lotThe numbers are in, and it looks as though 2006 was another banner year for charitable giving from corporate America.According to a survey published on Monday in the Chronicle of Philanthropy, the total amount of cash donations from 81 of the biggest US businesses rose from $3.5bn in 2005 to $3.8bn in 2006. Of the 75 companies that estimated how much they would donate to charity during 2007, 28 said their philanthropy would grow by more than 3 per cent.At least one company, however, plans a dramatic slash in its giving budget. The Altria Group, parent company of cigarette manufacturer Phillip Morris, said it would decrease its philanthropy as it spins off some of its holdings.Kraft Foods, for example, left Altria this year. Amina Dickerson, senior director for Kraft’s corporate community involvement, said the company would now have more say in how it spent its philanthropic dollars and would probably direct more money to “fight hunger and promote good eating habits by Americans”, according to the Chronicle.“We are very clear our work will not sell more boxes of mac and cheese,” she told the magazine, but “as a food company we have a responsibility there”.X-rated?The European Union recently found itself mired in an unusual controversy after it posted films on YouTube that included sex scenes. The YouTube clips, part of a campaign to promote EU-backed films, include shots of 18 couples in the throes of passion taken from EU-sponsored films.Now it seems that the project will continue, according to Margot Wallström, EU communications chief. Wallström notes that uploading the clips entails no extra cost to the European Commission, and so it plans to continue to post clips reflecting “various EU policies”.So, Observer wonders, can sex help to sell the European Commission?The unloved Brussels body said matter-of-factly: “In general the comments made by users of YouTube have been positive.” But it also added this: “It may be expected that some of those who have viewed the clips will be encouraged to seek out other material about the European Union.”An early leadIt wasn’t a bad weekend for Thaksin Shinawatra, the exiled former prime minister of Thailand, ousted in a coup last year. Although Thai voters endorsed a new military-backed constitution that he has described as an act of “political revenge” against him, the strength of opposition to the charter suggests he still carries plenty of clout on the Thai political stage in some quarters – even from afar.And Thaksin’s prestige could be enhanced by the shock victory of Manchester City, his newly acquired English Premier League soccer club, over its hometown rival, Manchester United.Before Thaksin purchased it, Manchester City was languishing at the bottom of the Premier League. But buoyed by a new coach, Sven-Göran Eriksson, and a new roster of foreign players, the team is now at the top of the league so far.But with Thailand’s state-controlled broadcast media still largely shutting Thaksin out, he is hopeful that Manchester City, and its seemingly dramatic turnround, will help him keep grabbing headlines and keep him in the public eye.A total bust?A storm in a B-cup is brewing over the estate of the Hooters founder and chief executive, who died last year. Robert Brooks, owner of the Hooters chain of restaurants whose main gimmick is large-busted waitresses, left $20m to his second wife, who wants more.According to Investment News, Brooks’ son, Coby, by his first wife, is challenging her claim. Brooks’ will left the second wife $1m a year for 20 years, but she is claiming, under state law, that she should instead qualify for an elective share of the estate, which would be a third of it, and almost certainly more than $20m.Observer promises to keep readers, ahem, abreast of the situation.observer@ft.com
151;MO;Altria Group;2007-07-19T14:28:47Z;Wall St lower on poor earnings;;A combination of disappointing earnings and guidance, renewed worries over financials and cautious remarks on the outlook for the economy from Ben Bernanke, the US Federal Reserve chairman, roiled Wall Street on Wednesday.Stocks pared some of their earlier losses late in the day, and the S&P 500 index closed 0.2 per cent lower at 1,546.19. Just three of the main 10 sectors in the index rose. Energy stocks were boosted by oil prices to 11-month highs and utilities also rose as Treasury bond yields fell on safe haven buying amid renewed jitters over subprime mortgages and hedge fund exposure.Leading the declines among the S&P sectors were financials, technology and telecoms.Financials floundered after Bear Stearns said late on Tuesday that subprime mortgage-related assets held by two of its hedge funds were virtually worthless.Bear’s stock fell 0.4 per cent to $139.34. The American stock exchange’s Broker-Dealer index closed 1.7 per cent lower. Notable decliners included Merrill Lynch, down 3.3 per cent at $83.40, Lehman Brothers, 2 per cent lower at $71.57, while Morgan Stanley fell 2.8 per cent to $70.85.JPMorgan said its second-quarter net income rose 20 per cent, but noted weakness in regional banking and car finance. The stock closed 2.4 per cent lower at $48.74.In prepared remarks before Congress, Mr Bernanke stressed concerns over inflation and the housing market and the Fed lowered its growth forecast for the US economy for 2007 and 2008.“There is no doubt that housing is a headwind for the economy,” said Gerald Lucas, senior investment advisor at Deutsche Bank. “Bernanke’s testimony is fairly well balanced, but based on the June consumer price index [report] there are concerns that service sector inflation is not coming down.”The combination of a lower growth forecast and continued concern over inflation compounded the bearish open for stocks yesterday said traders.Higher oil prices were also on the radar screen of investors.“The market has broadly overlooked the recent rise in oil, but with sentiment turning negative, that has also become an issue,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The rise in oil prices during the past month does not bode well for future inflation numbers.”On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to close at 2,699.49 and led the major benchmarks lower. Sentiment for technology stocks was hit hard after Intel and Yahoo disappointed investors with their latest results.Intel posted better-than-forecast earnings, but its gross margin fell and the stock was 4.8 per cent lower at $25.06, after the chip maker had set a 52-week high of $26.52 on Tuesday.Yahoo’s quarterly results met estimates but guidance for the third quarter was lowered and the stock was off 4.8 per cent at $26.20.After the closing bell on Wednesday, IBM’s posted a rise of 12 per cent rise in second quarter profit and raised guidance for earnings in 2007. The stock set a 52-week high of $111.88 before the report and was trading higher in after-hours activity.Earnings after the bell from eBay also beat estimates and the stock rallied in after-hours trade, following a decline of 0.6 per cent to $34.05 in regular trade. Google reports on Thursday.Blue chips were hit by a number of earnings reports on Wednesday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.4 per cent at 13,918.22.Mr Pado said: “The market had enjoyed a big run up ahead of earnings results and as a result we were bound to see some pullback once the numbers arrived.”An example of this was the performance of United Technologies which reported a second-quarter net income rise of 4 per cent from the same quarter last year, beating estimates. UTX fell 1.7 per cent to $75.56, after a rise of around 6 per cent in the past week.David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management said equities were suffering “bull market fatigue” after their recent record run. “Provided that earnings growth is sustained, valuation concerns can probably be put to one side for now.”A bright spot for earnings was Humana as the health insurer reported better than expected earnings and raised its 2007 earnings outlook. The stock rose 9.8 per cent to $68.31.In contrast, Altria said second-quarter income fell more than 18 per cent. The stock slid 1.4 per cent to $70.30 as full-year guidance was lowered.Pfizer’s quarterly profit fell 48 per cent, hurt by restructuring costs and weaker-than-expected drug sales. Pifzer did endorse its guidance for 2007 and 2008 and the stock fell 3.2 per cent to $25.13.Macy’s, the department store, surged 7.6 per cent to $43.09, amid talk that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm, could make a $24bn buy-out.Earnings from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola, Dow Jones, Bank of New York and Bank of America are due on Thursday, while Dow stock, Honeywell also reports.In economic news on Wednesday, the consumer price index rose 0.2 per cent in June. The core rate excluding food and energy rose 0.2 per cent, and was up from a 0.1 per cent rise in May. Economists had expected a 0.1 rise in headline CPI, with a 0.2 per cent core rate forecast.The overall CPI rose 2.7 per cent over the past year, while core CPI was up 2.2 per cent, steady with the annualised rate for May.Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital said: “Core inflation has behaved considerably better in the past few months and the near-term worries have receded, but the risks of too-high inflation remain and will keep the Fed uneasy.“In his prepared remarks before lawmakers, Mr Bernanke said the Fed expected core inflation to remain in a range of 2.00 per cent to 2.25 per cent in 2007, and then fall to a band of 1.75 per cent to 2.00 per cent in 2008.“Whether core inflation, at 2.2 per cent year-over-year, is contained or entrenched will remain a debate,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Mr Stanley said: “If the economy strengthens in the second half, as we expect, then core inflation will likely become a bigger concern, ultimately forcing the Fed to hike rates at some point, either late this year or in the first half of 2008.”Meanwhile, housing starts rose 2.3 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 1.467m annual rate in June, reversing some of the 3.4 per cent slide in May. However the May starts were revised lower from an original decline of 2.1 per cent.
152;MO;Altria Group;2007-07-17T21:56:41Z;Wall St rallies amid solid earnings;;US blue chips crossed a fresh milestone on Tuesday as solid earnings, deals and buybacks helped Wall Street extend its bullish run.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.15 per cent at a record level of 13,971.55. The benchmark also set an intra-day record high of 14,021.95.The broader S&P 500 index pared early gains and closed relatively flat at 1,549.40.Among the major S&P sectors, industrials, materials and technology led gains. Consumer stocks, energy, healthcare and telecoms were lower.“Investors are seeing strong momentum on earnings, a growing economy and low inflation,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.He said that investors had likely turned cautious ahead of the June consumer inflation report, due on Wednesday.Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, testifies before Congress on the US economy and monetary policy on Wednesday and on Thursday.“There is no doubt Bernanke could create some volatility for stocks,” Mr Paulsen said.After the closing bell, Bear Stearns said that the sub prime mortgage related assets held by two of its hedge funds were virtually worthless. Bear’s stock price was around 2 per cent lower at $137.20 in after-hours trade. The bank recently extended a loan of $1.6bn to the less levered fund, whose assets are now worth 9 cents in the dollar.Leading the major benchmarks was the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite, up 0.55 per cent at 2,712.29.Semiconductor stocks advanced after Novellus provided stronger guidance for future orders.The chipmaker’s shares surged 11.3 per cent to $33.03, while the Philadelphia exchange semiconductor index rallied 3.1 per cent.After the closing bell, Intel posted better-than-forecast earnings, but its gross margins fell. Intel set a 52-week high of $26.52 on Tuesday, and fell in after-hours trade. Yahoo also reported after the closing bell and while results met estimates, the internet search company lowered guidance for the third quarter. Yahoo fell in after-hours trade after a rise of 3.1 per cent to $27.53 in regular trade.Ebay and IBM are scheduled to report on Wednesday and Google on Thursday.For the year to date, the Dow is up 12.1 per cent and remains shy of the Nasdaq’s climb of 12.3 per cent.The Dow’s failure to hold early gains above 14,000 was sparked in part when companies, that had reported better-than-expected earnings, attracted profit taking.Johnson & Johnson slid 1.7 per cent to $62.74 after its second-quarter profits rose 9.3 per cent, with international sales up 18 per cent.Coca-Cola recorded a 1 per cent rise in profits and a sales increase of 19 per cent. The stock fell 1.3 per cent to $53.17.Banks in the Dow rallied on Tuesday. Several financials reported solid earnings and allayed concerns the sector was being hurt by the troubles in subprime mortgage and structured credit markets.JPMorgan rose 0.2 per cent to $49.92 ahead of quarterly results on Wednesday, while Citigroup was 0.5 per cent higher at $52.46 and will report its earnings on Friday. Notable Dow members United Technologies, Altria and Pfizer are due to report earnings on Wednesday.In deal news, Plains Exploration said it had agreed to buy Pogo, a rival oil and gas company, for $3.6bn in cash and stock. Pogo surged 13.9 per cent to $57.50, while Plains was 6.5 per cent lower at $47.88.Buy-backs were in focus after Rohm & Hass, a speciality chemicals and plastics company, was upgraded by brokers after it announced a $2bn share repurchase plan. The stock soared 9.8 per cent to $61.18.Among banks reporting on Tuesday, Merrill Lynch revealed a 31 per cent increase in second-quarter earnings. But after an initial rise to $89.23, Merrill shares closed down 1.4 per cent at $86.20.Matthew Albrecht, brokerage industry analyst at Standard & Poor’s equity research, said growth in equity underwriting and the private client business mitigated Merrill’s slowdown in the mortgage business and some subprime exposure.Wells Fargo said earnings rose 13 per cent and its stock rose 0.4 per cent to $35.59.Charles Schwab recorded a 16 per cent rise in profit and its stock was unchanged at $22.25.State Street said its profit rose 61 per cent and also upwardly revised its revenue forecast for 2007. The stock gained 2.1 per cent to $71.87.KeyCorp rallied 4.6 per cent to $36.71 after the midwest bank reported an 8 per cent gain in profit.News Corp rose 2.6 per cent to $24.25 after it reached a tentative agreement to buy Dow Jones, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal.Approval of the $5bn deal faced a vote by the Dow Jones board later in the day. However, the Bancroft family, which controls 64 per cent of Dow Jones’s voting stock, will ultimately decide whether the deal is approved. Dow Jones slipped 0.9 per cent to $56.45, below News Corp’s $60-a-share offer.On Wednesday, the focus of investors will turn to Mr Bernanke, and his testimony on the economy and monetary policy. The Fed chairman speaks before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, and the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.Traders said he may seek to reassure the markets that problems in the subprime mortgage market are likely to remain contained. Before Mr Bernanke speaks, the June consumer price report is released on Wednesday.“A further decline in core inflation could allow Bernanke to focus more on the housing market as a risk for the economy,” said Richard Gilhooly, senior fixed income strategist at BNP Paribas.Economists at Lehman Brothers said June consumer prices “should decelerate sharply on softer energy prices, but it is unlikely to ease concerns about underlying inflation pressures.”Lehman expects the headline Consumer Price Index will rise 0.17 per cent in June, or 2.6 per cent year-on-year, while the core CPI should rise 0.22 per cent, “for the largest monthly gain since February.”
153;MO;Altria Group;2007-06-11T20:38:59Z;Blow to Philip Morris in class-action suit;;The US Supreme Court ­on Monday reinvigorated some tobacco lawsuits when it refused to allow Philip Morris to fight cases involving deceptive marketing of “light” cigarettes in federal court, rather than in more plaintiff-friendly state trials.The court ruled unanimously that Philip Morris, the big US cigarette maker, could not transfer a class­action lawsuit alleging deceptive marketing of light cigarettes from the Arkansas state court, where it was filed, to federal court. US companies often prefer to fight class-action lawsuits in federal court, which they see as fairer to corporate defendants.Philip Morris argued that the case should be shifted to federal court because the Federal Trade Commission, the US consumer watchdog, closely supervises testing of cigarettes.“We can find nothing that warrants treating the FTC/Philip Morris relationship as distinct from the usual regulator/regulated relationship,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the court. Ruling the other way could have let companies in a wide range of highly regulated industries escape from state courts, against the wishes of Congress, he wrote.The ruling could affect all “lights” cases alleging deceptive marketing, including those involving other tobacco companies. Smokers have filed similar suits in 20 states.The plaintiffs who brought the case said Philip Morris engaged in unfair business practices in marketing its lights brands. The case centred on a federal law that says a “person acting under a federal officer” can shift lawsuits to federal court. Philip Morris argued that the tobacco companies were “acting under a federal officer” by testing cigarettes for tar and nicotine.If that argument had been accepted, it would have “severely damaged the ability of consumers harmed by corporate fraud to achieve a remedy in state court”, said Edward Sweda, senior attorney for the Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University School of Law.The Supreme Court also ruled in several other business-related cases yesterday. The justices decided against imposing new restrictions on how US companies in bankruptcy can handle their pension plans. They also refused to impose minimum wage and maximum hours rules for home healthcare workers who are employed by an employment agency.The court also ruled that companies that voluntarily clean up environmental problems can try to recoup their costs by suing other businesses and the federal government.
154;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;S&P 500 narrowly misses new closing high;;The S&P 500 index failed to set a new closing high on Monday, after the benchmark briefly transcended a record level for the first time since the bursting of the dotcom bubble more than seven years ago.The S&P closed 0.15 per cent firmer at 1,525.10, after it reached a high of 1,529.87 earlier in the day. That peak was above its record close of 1,527.46 set in March 2000 but shy of the intraday high set the same day. Within the S&P, energy and technology were the leading industry groups.Deals and earnings results were in focus as the week began, with investors searching for a catalyst that could extend the past seven weeks of gains for blue chips and put the S&P in record territory.Merger and acquisition activity was led by AllTel, whose shares rose 6.7 per cent to $69.60. TPG Capital and GS Capital Partners, a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, made a $27.5bn, or $71.50 a share, bid for the wireless telecoms company.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards, said the market had been trading quietly, but the latest deal news kept investors mindful that merger activity was unlikely to slow down any time soon.AG Edwards has a year-end target of 1,550 for the S&P, but Mr Wren said: “We could get a surge that takes us above that level in the next few months.”A record pace of buy-outs and hefty stock buy-backs from companies have instilled a bullish backdrop for stocks, analysts said.Monday’s extension of the rally in stocks came as oil prices and Treasury bond yields remained near their recent peaks. Traders said asset allocation out of bonds into stocks had gathered pace last week.Mr Wren said rising Treasury yields were not hurting equity sentiment as “anything below 5 per cent is still reasonable”.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent higher at 2,578.79, with earlier gains pared by a slide in semiconductor stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 13,542.88, after blue chips set a new all-time high of 13,586.03 earlier in the day.Shares in Altria rose 1.3 per cent to $70.85, and the stock was one of the leading blue chips in the Dow.Citigroup believes the tobacco company will soon spin off Philip Morris International, a move that could propel the stock higher. “We continue to reiterate our strong ‘buy’ rating on Altria Group and our conservative $82 price target ahead of the PMI spin-off,” it said.That bullish tone was highlighted by current activity for options on the stock. TradingMarkets Options said put options for Altria that expire in June – contracts that profit should the stock price fall – “are the most under-priced puts of all stocks in our database”.Financial stocks were highlighted by analysts at Bespoke Investment Group. They noted that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan had registered gains of more than 10 per cent “since the subprime-driven declines in late February shook the group slightly”. By contrast, shares in Bear Stearns and Lehman “have basically gone nowhere”.General Electric rose 0.4 per cent to $37.10 after the $11.6bn sale of its plastic business to Saudi Basic Industries.Hologic fell 6.3 per cent to $54, after the medical equipment maker said it would buy Cytyc for $6.2bn, boosting the diagnostic device company by 22.7 per cent to $43.Yahoo slipped 1.3 per cent to $29.35, amid talk that the internet search engine may buy Bebo, a UK social networking site, for about $1bn.Dow Jones fell 3.5 per cent to $51.10, after a research group said News Corp was likely to give up its $60-a-share bid in the face of resistance from the Bancroft family, which wields voting control. News Corp rose 0.9 per cent to $23.90.In earnings, Lowes, the home improvement chain, said first quarter profit fell 12.1 per cent. The results were worse than analysts expected and the company’s shares fell 2.4 per cent to $31.88. Shares in rival Home Depot fell 0.6 per cent to $38.63.Saks reported an 86 per cent slide in first quarter profits from the year-ago period, which included gains on asset sales. Shares in the upmarket retailer fell 6 per cent to $21.33.
155;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
156;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;The John Browne: dignified new way to separate;;Goldman Sachs is known for innovation in finance. Lord Browne was a visionary in the oil industry. So it is no surprise that, together, they have managed to develop a new technique that offers an elegant third answer to the traditional question: “Did he jump or was he pushed?”Make no mistake, had his lordship been a mere vice-president or managing director of the investment bank, his lie in court would easily have been enough to end a promising career in derivatives or corporate finance. It is therefore hard to see how Goldman could have countenanced the former BP chief continuing as chairman of the group’s audit committee. Allowing him to retain his board membership might have been an option. It would, as Charles Pretzlik pointed out in his Business Blog Thursday, have avoided unpleasantness the next time the bank had to deal with Lord Browne’s prominent and powerful supporters.But for Goldman, reputation is paramount. So it was that the former BP chief and the investment bank found their way towards a dignified solution. Nobody behaved badly. Nobody was embarrassed.Boards around the world should be grateful to both parties. It is rare, for one thing, that Goldman Sachs offers an innovation to the world of business without charging a fee for it. But next time a company chairman wants to hint to a distinguished director that time is up, he need only slide a piece of paper across the boardroom table with two words on it: John Browne.One size cannot fit allPublicly listed private equity firms such as 3i, which reported full-year results Thursday, and Candover Investments are obliged to be franker than their unquoted counterparts. Their best practice offers some guidance to those drawing up a voluntary disclosure code for the industry.Self-interest is already driving improvements in disclosure at individual firms. Politically, it makes sense for them to explain more to employees and a wider public – influenced until recently by unchallenged critics of private equity ownership. Commercially, given that flotation or sale is often the destination for private equity-owned companies, it makes sense to outline the trajectory of current performance for potential future investors.It would be difficult, however, to make private equity disclose much more, without requiring the same of, say, foreign companies. Abbey, with its 17,000 or so employees, merits only three pages in Santander’s report for 2006, its second year as part of the Spanish group. Indeed, when closer integration is the aim of an acquisition – as in Nippon Sheet Glass’s takeover of Pilkington – the acquirer’s investors would find it odd if the subsidiary were not fully absorbed.Private equity firms could be speedier and clearer in their disclosure of what is happening at portfolio companies. The test for the working group is to ensure that a new code does not burden smaller firms with requirements that only a FTSE 100 constituent such as 3i can achieve and that much larger owners of UK subsidiaries can easily avoid.Smoke without fireGood things come to those who wait. This is the attitude Imperial Tobacco should take as it pores over Altadis’s books and ponders whether to make a third, revised, higher offer for the Franco-Spanish tobacco company.CVC, a rival bidder, is willing to pay €50 a share to secure Altadis and it plans to keep the target’s three business divisions – cigarettes, cigars and logistics – together. Of course, there will be cost cuts but Imperial would have done the same, only called them synergies instead.In any contested bid for a scarce asset such as Altadis, bidders can get carried away and be drawn into a heated auction. But Imperial Tobacco has good reason to sit tight and not counter-bid, because it could provide the perfect exit for CVC in a couple of years when the private equity group needs to sell to generate a return for its own investors. The same is true for British American Tobacco, which has been undecided about whether to participate in this particular round of consolidation.For the private equity firms, selling to a strategic buyer is almost always preferable to passing the investment on to a rival via a secondary buy-out, or risking the mixed reception of an initial public offering. Of course, the main risk in waiting is that Imperial Tobacco could leave itself vulnerable to a bid from Altria, the US owner of Philip Morris.But that deal may make as much sense for Imperial shareholders as a tie-up with Altadis, so either way, Gareth Davis, Imperial’s chief executive, would have done his job of maximising the value of the company for his own shareholders.Imperial: lina.saigol@ft.comandrew.hill@ft.com
157;MO;Altria Group;2007-04-25T18:29:07Z;The Short View: Insignificant landmark;;Needed: one bucket of cold water. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the world’s best-known stock market benchmark, passed 13,000 for the first time early yesterday. It was a symptom of the air of optimism in Wall Street. But ultimately a landmark for the Dow signifies little or nothing.This column has addressed the Dow’s technical limitations before. It is weighted by share price, not market value, so the biggest companies do not have the biggest impact. A third of the 1,000 index points by which the Dow has increased since it passed 12,000 last October came from just four companies – Altria, Boeing, Honeywell and ExxonMobil.It is too heavily weighted towards industrials to be a barometer of corporate America. But with constituents such as Citigroup, Wal-Mart, Microsoft and McDonald’s, it is not a true industrial index either.It is not even a true benchmark for “mega-cap” large companies. These are under-performing but you need the Russell Top 50 index, up only 1.6 per cent this year, compared with a 4.2 per cent rise in the Dow, to tell you this.Its defenders point out that the Dow continues to be correlated closely with the S&P 500, by far the most important index in terms of the money linked to it. But that acknowledges the importance of the S&P, which needs to grow only 2.7 per cent to set its first record high since 2000 – a much more important event.Ironically, another Dow Jones benchmark set up at the same time as the Industrials may be more interesting. The 20-stock Transportation Average is also at a record high. It is up 14 per cent for the year – 10 percentage points better than the Industrials.Transport stocks are highly exposed to the global economy, and a joint high for Industrials and Transportation is traditionally viewed as a very bullish indicator. It at least suggests that if there is a risk at present, it is of overheating, not a slowdown. That, maybe, is of some interest.Video: John Authers on Dow’s new milestone
158;MO;Altria Group;2007-04-19T23:52:16Z;Altria off to a disappointing start;;Altria, the US parent of Philip Morris, the world’s largest cigarette maker, got off to a rocky start Thursday as a pure-play tobacco company as it reported disappointing first-quarter earnings – hurt by weaker than expected US demand.The group, which missed Wall Street estimates, reported a 6 per cent rise in profits to $2.17bn, or $1.03 per share, excluding one-time items and its former food unit Kraft, which it spun off to shareholders last month.Altria decided the time was right to spin off Kraft to focus on tobacco after its US litigation and legal uncertainty has largely cleared. Growth prospects continue overseas for tobacco, as US demand is in likely terminal decline.Reporting earnings for the first time without Kraft, Altria said US industry volume fell 4-5 per cent in the quarter significantly higher than its long-term trend.First-quarter revenues increased 8 per cent to $17.6bn, helped by international tobacco and a weaker dollar. Its shares fell 1 per cent to $69.40.
159;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:55:11+0000;Wall St edges up amid solid earnings;;US stocks recovered from sharp early losses on Friday and edged into record territory as solid earnings updates helped investors shrug off concerns about the Chinese economy.Wall Street was rattled in morning trade by a sharp jump in China’s gross domestic product, which raised fears that the country might lift interest rates to cool the economy.But strong profit at Merrill Lynch and Schering-Plough helped to settle the mood and push the Dow Jones Industrial Average marginally above the record close it set on Wednesday.The Dow rose 0.04 per cent to 12,809.2 after recovering from a 70-point fall.However, just 17 of the Dow’s 30 stocks made gains and other market indicators sagged, highlighting the relatively narrow base of the rally. The broader S&P 500 index slipped 0.1 per cent to 1,470.74 while the Russell 2000 index of small companies fell 0.6 per cent to 819.31.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 2,505.35.Schering-Plough jumped 8.6 per cent to $31 after the drugmaker beat expectations with a 52 per cent increase in first-quarter net income.Analysts at Deutsche Bank expected the group’s earnings to be “conspicuously ahead of other drug companies” over the next few years.Google fell 0.9 per cent to close at $471.65 but its stock was trading higher after the bell as the internet group announced a 79 per cent rise in first-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates.Shares in Merrill Lynch surrendered early gains to stand 0.6 per cent lower at $91.11 after the bank’s first-quarter profit jumped fourfold on the back of investment banking revenues.Bank of America slid 1.8 per cent to $50.91 after it reported a 5.4 per cent increase in first-quarter profit, which was broadly in line with analysts’ estimates.Ebay slipped 3.7 per cent to $33.19 after investors were left unimpressed by guidance from the group.Altria Group fell 1 per cent to $69.40 after weak performance in its Philip Morris US tobacco business pulled its profit below analysts’ forecasts. The contrast between the company’s domestic and overseas sales fed speculation that Altria might split the two business divisions this year.Dinyar Devitre, chief financial officer, told investors that Altria would “examine a spin-off of Philip Morris International”.Southwest Airlines were down 1.9 per cent to $15.37 after Gary Kelly, chief executive, played down speculation that the group might be a takeover target.In deal news, CBOT fell 1.1 per cent to $192.42 after the group said that price would not be the only factor it would consider when judging the merits of two merger proposals.Shares in HJ Heinz jumped 3 per cent to an eight-year high of $48.13 on reports that the food group might put itself up for sale.
160;MO;Altria Group;2007-04-19T19:36:33Z;Altria’s next move;;The next phase is drawing nearer. Having spun-off Kraft Foods, Altria looks increasingly likely to separate its domestic and international cigarettes businesses.US operations remain a major drag on Philip Morris. Compared with last year, cigarette shipments in the US were down more than 6 per cent in the first quarter. The decline was accentuated by temporary factors, such as advance purchases last year because of an excise tax increase in Texas. The overall market share of Philip Morris USA was steady, with decent gains in the premium segment. But the volume shrinkage of 3 to 4 per cent that Altria envisions for the US market as a whole this year, underlines how challenging the environment remains. Skilful marketing and pricing can only go so far to offset such pressures.By contrast, Philip Morris International remains fast-growing, in spite of a few trouble spots. Brands such as Marlboro still have plenty of potential internationally. A split would also distance PMI further from US litigation risks and give it a more attractive acquisition currency. With regards to the latter, though, global sector valuations are already high by historic standards and investors should think twice before applauding any move by PMI to join the acquisition frenzy. With potential targets already scarce, it could easily end up paying over the odds. Anti-trust concerns would complicate most big deals.A separation might also end up slowing, rather than speeding up the process of gearing up Altria’s under-leveraged balance sheet. Such risks are hard to capture in sum-of-the-parts valuations, which suggest further gains in Altria’s share price in the event of a break-up. But the glee with which shareholders have already rewarded the company in anticipation of this suggests caution is now required. As Sigmund Freud reportedly said, sometimes, a cigar is just a cigar. The same might prove true of the world’s largest cigarette maker, no matter how you slice it.
161;MO;Altria Group;2007-04-06T16:39:50Z;Wall Street up 2% on week;;Wall Street spent another week repairing the damage inflicted by the late February sell-off. Investors are looking ahead to next week’s start of the first quarter earnings season.According to Thomson Financial, the average rise in profits for the first three months of the year compared with 2006, is forecast at 3.6 per cent. That is down from 8.7 per cent estimated at the start of January and would mark a break from 14 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth.David Dropsey, senior research analyst at Thomson, said the reduction in expectations reflected “a lack of positive guidance from companies. No one wants to over-promise and under-deliver on earnings.”Although companies may ultimately beat reduced expectations, investors are likely to focus on the outlook for the second quarter and beyond.‘‘Earnings will likely beat sharply reduced expectations, but guidance will dominate and that will be downbeat,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank. “I’m not a bear, but the market faces further challenges before it can advance in a sustained way.”Recent data on the economy has revealed a combination of slower growth and elevated inflation that could erode revenues and raise costs for companies.That trend was countered by the unexpectedly strong March employment report released yesterday. The data suggested US economic growth is not slowing as much as some had feared.While the cash equity market was closed, S&P 500 futures rose after the payrolls data was released, suggesting upward pressure on stock prices on Monday.For the Easter-shortened week, the S&P 500 gained 1.6 per cent to 1,443.76 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.05 per cent to 2,471.34. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.65 per cent to 12,560.20 and is back in positive territory for the year to date.Among companies in the spotlight this week, was Altria, which in its first week of trading after spinning off Kraft Foods, rose 7.35 per cent to $70.75. Analysts believe Altria could announce shedding its international business when it releases earnings later this month.One of the week’s poor performers was Monster, whose price slumped 13.8 per cent to $40.85 after the job placement website cut its first-quarter sales outlook below analyst expectations.Poor earnings pressured Micron and it fell 4.7 per cent to $11.51 this week after the maker of flash memory posted a loss for the second quarter.Boosting sentiment for technology was Research In Motion, up 6.8 per cent to $145.77. Goldman raised its earnings estimates for the maker of the BlackBerry hand held personal organiser and maintained a price target of $185 a share.Hewlett-Packard gained 4.1 per cent to $41.80 this week, while another tech heavy-weight, Microsoft, rose 2.4 per cent to $28.55 after Citigroup raised its fiscal third-quarter earnings estimate for the software giant.Financial stocks remained in the spotlight, and the sector is the only major industry group within the S&P that is negative for the year, down 2.9 per cent.This reflects concern over the sector’s exposure to US mortgages, particularly those issued to borrowers with high loan-to-value ratios and sketchy documentation.M&T Bank slid 8.5 per cent to $105.99, after the New York based regional bank said its exposure to risky Alt-A mortgages would reduce first-quarter net income.But, there was a sliver of good news as Accredited Home Lenders closed the week up 4 per cent at $9.64. The big subprime mortgage lender said it had secured a $1.1bn line of credit from two banks.The S&P homebuilders index finally snapped a run of eight days of losses and closed 0.7 per cent higher for the week.Deal activity was led by a $29bn purchase of First Data, the credit card and payment company, by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The private equity firm will pay First Data shareholders $34 a share, a premium that sent the shares 20 per cent higher to $32.29.Xerox said it would purchase Global Imaging Systems for around $1.5bn and sharesits jumped 48 per cent to $28.83.In its first week trading as a combined entity, NYSE Euronext rose 3.2 per cent to $96.74.
162;MO;Altria Group;2007-04-04T20:45:58Z;Wall Street edges higher in cautious trade;;Wall Street stocks rose modestly yesterday although the mood was contained by concerns about the economy and earnings.Iran’s release of 15 UK sailors and royal marines held for nearly two weeks sent oil prices lower and helped stocks.That helped counter data showing that US non- manufacturing activity in March fell to its worst level since April 2003 and that price pressures remained high.The Institute of Supply Management’s non-manufacturing survey slipped to 52.4 in March. That was down from a reading of 54.3 in February and below a forecast rise to 55. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion in activity.Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital said the ISM report “continued a string of numbers with disappointingly weak growth numbers, and disappointingly strong high price indices.” It was a combination that “will only fuel the ‘stagflationary’ talk,” among investors in spite of an economy that is still likely to grow more than 2 per cent with core inflation below 3 per cent.The combination of faltering growth and troublesome inflation worried investors who suspect corporate margins could show signs of erosion when the first-quarter earnings season begins next week.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said lower oil prices helped stem the extent of losses in stocks yesterday. But he said: “The market is at a crucial point and there are serious concerns about the state of the economy and the outlook for earnings guidance.”Several companies released figures and updated quarterly forecasts yesterday and the mixed tone contributed to choppy trading in stocks.By the close yesterday, the S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent higher at 1,439.37. Telecom services and financials were the weakest sectors in the index, while information technology stocks led gains.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,458.69.A leading stock in the S&P was Monsanto, which jumped 3.2 per cent to $57.79 after the maker of herbicides and genetically modified seeds reported a 23 per cent rise in profit for the quarter ending February 28.A weight on the S&P was Monster, whose stock slumped 13.2 per cent to $42.10 after the job placement web site cut its first-quarter sales outlook below analyst expectations.Two major electronic retailers presented a contrast in fortunes with their latest quarterly results.On the plus side, electronics retailer Best Buy said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit for the period ending March 3 rose 18 per cent. The increase beat expectations but the shares relinquished an early rise to trade 2.5 per cent lower at $47.89.Meanwhile, rival retailer Circuit City Stores posted a $12.2m loss for its fourth quarter due to weaker sales and charges from closing stores. The retailer reported a $141.1m profit a year ago and its shares fell 0.4 per cent at $18.21.Another stock in the news was Microsoft, up 2.3 per cent at $28.50 after Citigroup raised its fiscal third-quarter earnings estimate for the software giant.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.15 per cent to close at 12,530.05, buoyed by both Microsoft and Altria. Analysts believe Altria could soon spin off its international business and the stock was up 1.1 per cent at $70.44.In its first day of trading as a combined entity, NYSE Euronext slid 3.4 per cent to $97.55.In other data news, the ADP-Macro Advisors said it expected private sector employment to have increased by 106,000 jobs in March.Economists expect around 150,000 private and government sector jobs in total to have been created last month. The March employment report is due on Friday.Mr Ruskin said the ADP forecast “was a little weaker than expected, but will not change market expectations for non-farm payrolls on Friday.” RBS expects the March payrolls data to show jobs rose by 175,000 in March. The stock market will be closed on Friday for the Easter break.
163;MO;Altria Group;2007-04-02T21:02:40Z;US stocks eke out modest gains;;Wall Street edged higher on Monday, as a flurry of deal activity offset concerns about financial stocks and the economy ahead of the first-quarter earnings season that kicks off next week.Trading lacked conviction and the mood in stocks softened in morning trade when monthly manufacturing data were weaker than expected and revealed rising prices.The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index for March was 50.9, below an expected reading of 51.1 and down from 52.3 in February. The prices paid component of the ISM rose to 65.5 last month, from 59 in February. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion in activity.The inflation picture damped hopes among some investors that the Federal Reserve would cut rates soon.While losses in stocks were pared yesterday afternoon, the slowing economy has investors wary about quarterly profits, analysts say.“The economy is slowing, but the important element is how that ultimately affects earnings growth,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Investors expect year-on-year growth in corporate profits during the first quarter to fall well below 10 per cent, breaking a run of 14 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth.According to Thomson Financial, the average rise in profits for the first three months of the year is forecast at 4.4 per cent. That is down from a forecast 8.7 per cent made at the start of January and follows an 11.4 per cent rise in profits for the fourth quarter of 2006.“There is some trepidation about earnings, they could come in below already reduced expectations,” said Doug Peta, market strategist at J&W Seligman.Financial stocks have been a big contributor to profit growth in recent quarters, and the sector weighed upon the S&P 500 index on Monday, amid concern over bank exposure to Alt-A mortgages – home loans that are slightly less risky than subprime loans but still involve risks such as high loan-to-value ratios and sketchy documentation.M&T Bank slid 8.7 per cent to $105.75, after the New York based regional bank said its exposure to Alt-A mortgages would reduce first-quarter net income by $7m, or 7 cents a share.Other Alt-A lenders suffered. IndyMac Bancorp fell 4.4 per cent to $30.65 and Countrywide Financial slid 2.7 per cent to $32.73.In spite of selling in financials, utilities and energy stocks boosted the S&P and it closed up 0.25 per cent at 1,424.55.The Nasdaq Composite rebounded from a loss of 0.4 per cent in early trade and closed a fraction firmer at 2,422.26.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 12,382.30, boosted by a 3.5 per cent rise to $68.22 in Altria as the cigarette maker completed its spin-off of Kraft Foods. Another Dow component, Merck, rallied 1.9 per cent to $45.01 after its diabetes drug won Federal approval.American Express, down 1 per cent to $55.86, and Citigroup, off 0.6 per cent at $51.05, were are a drag on the Dow.Beyond the economy, deal activity continued to boost pockets of the market, led by a $29bn purchase of First Data, the credit card and payment company, by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The private equity firm will pay First Data shareholders $34 a share, a premium price that sent the shares 20.6 per cent higher to $32.45.In other deal news, Tribune media group, which owns the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times and various television stations accepted an $8.2bn buyout offer from Sam Zell, a Chicago based real-estate investor. Shares in Tribune rose 2.2 per cent, to $32.81, and the company had been the subject of twin bids, from Zell and Eli Broad and Ron Burkle, investors based in Los Angeles.Xerox announced it would purchase Global Imaging Systems for around $1.5bn. Shares in Global jumped 46.9 per cent to $28.64, while Xerox gained 1.1 per cent to $17.08.Meanwhile, AirTran Holdings raised its offer for Midwest Air Group to $15 a share, up from an $11.25 price offered last year. Shares in AirTran rose 1.3 per cent to $10.40, while Midwest was 7.3 per cent higher at $14.50.Shares in Starwood Hotels & Resorts rose 4.6 per cent to $67.82, after Steven Heyer, the company’s chief executive, resigned.Earnings season looms after a tough first quarter for the leading benchmarks. Last week, stock indices closed out the first quarter of the year well off their highs – set in mid-February – as sentiment for homebuilders and financials soured amid growing problems in the subprime mortgage market.The Dow’s first quarter was its worst quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2005 and the blue chip barometer is well off its record high of 12,786.64, set on February 20.Leading the laggards in the Dow this year are Johnson & Johnson, off 9 per cent, Home Depot, down 8.4 per cent, and Citigroup, also lower by 8.4 per cent. By contrast, Alcoa with a gain of 13 per cent, AT&T, up 10.4 per cent, and Caterpillar, higher by 8.8 per cent, are the leaders within the Dow.While the Dow suffered a loss for the quarter, transport and utility shares were some of the better performing sectors. The Dow Transportation Average gained 5.6 per cent, and the Dow Utilities Average rose 9.5 per cent during the first quarter.Bonds also prospered during the first quarter. The Lehman Aggregate index, containing Treasuries, corporate bonds, agency and mortgage securities and other securitised products, returned 1.5 per cent during the last three months. It was the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of last year when the index produced a gain of 3.81 per cent.For all of 2006, the Lehman Aggregate index returned 4.33 per cent, while the leading stock benchmarks posted double-digit gains.
164;MO;Altria Group;2007-03-30T20:59:11Z;Wall St lower as housing gloom persists;;A series of small shocks about the housing market and economy knocked Wall Street off its stride this week but investors regained some of their poise to leave stocks only moderately lower.The steepest decline came as Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, damped hopes that the central bank had adopted a softer policy stance by reiterating his concerns about inflation and saying the Fed had not abandoned its bias towards raising interest rates.Sharp falls in stocks were also caused by fresh signs of slowing demand for housing, federal probes into mortgage lending by Beazer Homes, and oil price rises spurred by increased tension between Iran and the UK.Rumours of US preparations for a conflict with Iran sparked another sharp sell-off in shares on Friday, with the S&P 500 falling by as much as 1 per cent from its earlier highs.However, after each slip the market showed a degree of resilience. “This pattern of recovering from shocks may speak to the fact that this market wants to go up,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “[Interest] rates are just too low and liquidity is too high to take this thing down.”Sentiment was boosted by an unexpected upward revision of economic growth in the final quarter last year and lower than expected jobless claims last week. In addition, consumer spending and income rose at almost double the forecast rate.The US government’s imposition of duties on paper imports from China also unnerved investors on Friday. The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,420.85, putting it 1.1 per cent down on the week and 0.2 per cent higher on the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent stronger on Friday at 12,354.35, down 1 per cent this week. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.1 per cent lower on the week at 2,421.64.The steel sector made big advances after US Steel’s bid to buy Lone Star Technologies prompted speculation about further consolidation.In a sign of investor appetite for steelmaking deals, shares in US Steel rose 3 per cent on the week to $99.17 on the back of this week’s $2.1bn cash offer for Lone Star. Lone Star soared 35.6 per cent to $66.03.There was also interest in other steel groups that could be takeover targets. IPSCO jumped 13.7 per cent to $131.40 while Reliance Steel rose 4.3 per cent to $48.40.Dell was on the defensive on Friday as the group revealed that it had found evidence of as yet unspecified misconduct after an investigation into its accounting practices.The company said it was delaying the release of its annual report until the investigation was completed.The market reaction was negative but contained, with Dell shares down 0.8 per cent to $23.21 on Friday. Credit Suisse encouraged investors to buy on weakness “with the understanding that the time horizon for recovery has been extended”.Homebuilders set new lows for the year this week as weak sales of newly built homes and a profits warning from Lennar aggravated fears about a prolonged housing market slump.Lennar, which said the typical pick-up in spring sales had “yet to materialise”, fell 7.4 per cent to 42.21. KB Home slid 8.9 per cent to $42.67.Meanwhile, Beazer Homes plunged 12.5 per cent to $29.03 after it said it was co-operating with FBI inquiries into its mortgage lending. No allegations of wrong-doing have yet been made.Energy groups were lifted by rising oil prices this week, with Chevron up 0.4 per cent at $74.12.Archer Daniels Midland, surrendered early gains to stand 0.2 per cent down at $36.70 on Friday after the US government forecast a steep rise in corn planting.Shares in papermakers surged on Friday after the imposition of duties on Chinese imports. International Paper gained 1.4 per cent to $36.40.Altria rose 2.7 per cent to $87.81 over the week on speculation that the tobacco and food company might spin off its Philip Morris cigarette division.In deal news, the battle to buy Tribune intensified as California billionaires Ron Burkle and Eli Broad sweetened their offer in an effort to trump Chicago property magnate Sam Zell’s bid.Mr Burkle and Mr Broad offered $34 a share, a bid that tops Mr Zell’s $33 offer. Tribune shares rose 1.8 per cent to $32.11 on Friday.
165;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Troubled Pakistan;;Pakistan is having a wretched time. In recent weeks it has received a stern rebuke from Capitol Hill and witnessed an ugly backlash against the president’s decision to suspend the country’s top judge – to say nothing of the murky murder of its World Cup cricket coach, Bob Woolmer.Global investors, who have poured money into the country in recent years, should take note. Political risk, normally par for the course when dealing with a military regime, has largely been shrugged off: testament to the US partnership and fruits of the economic reforms carried out by President Pervez Musharraf, who came to power in a 1999 coup. Partly due to those reforms, which helped reduce the fiscal deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product and rolled back state ownership, Pakistan has enjoyed average annual economic growth of 6-7 per cent in the past four years. Foreigners now own 5 per cent or so of the $50bn stock market, and cross-border mergers and acquisitions are on a roll. Standard Chartered of the UK paid $500m for Pakistan’s eighth biggest bank and earlier this month Philip Morris International, the US tobacco company, completed a $350m acquisition.Politics is the biggest stumbling block. Any sign that the extended honeymoon with the US is over, or that President Musharraf’s grip is weakening, would undermine stability. The series of national strikes that kicked off on Monday in protest against his suspension of the Supreme Court judge certainly point to disillusionment with the military leader. But there are other causes for concern. Pakistan is suffering its own fallout from consumer credit – pace South Korea and Taiwan among others. That has implications for the banks, which rushed into consumer finance in the early part of the decade, and for economic growth, which is heavily reliant on private consumption. Cashing in now, with the Karachi stock market up 13 per cent this year and 82 per cent since the beginning of the 2005, could avoid nasty shocks.
166;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Tobacco’s future;;Imperial Tobacco’s approach to Altadis is the latest sign of tobacco industry consolidation. There are now many possible permutations. Imperial may be successful, if it lifts its €45-a-share indicative bid for Altadis. Philip Morris, owned by Altria, may feel bounced into making a bid for Imperial, knowing that a joint Imperial/Altadis would have too large a market share for it to swallow. Altadis, in turn, may launch a ‘Pac-man’ bid of its own for Imperial. Not to forget that British American Tobacco could also bid for Altadis.Whatever the outcome – and the likeliest seems to be a successful takeover by Imperial of Altadis – this will probably be the last big deal in the tobacco sector, which has already slimmed down from six to five big listed players. Between them, these control nore than 90 per cent of the European tobacco market and competition concerns make further consolidation unlikely.The industry will thus have to stop focusing on the struggle for global domination and turn to issues closer to home. Investors are likely to demand greater balance sheet efficiency from those with excess capacity, like BAT and, particularly, Altria, which after the spin-off of Kraft Foods is completed, will have a market capitalisation of about $132bn and no net debt.The companies, in turn, will have to concentrate once more on improving profitability via pricing and canny branding, rather than by adding volume, though small deals – in the emerging markets especially – remain an option. Organic earnings growth, even in the mature markets, is still achievable. Imperial, for example, has been able to increase profitability in the UK despite declining volumes.When the dust settles from this latest round of consolidation, the main impact, therefore, is likely to be on valuations. Buoyed by bid hopes, Imperial’s shares are currently more expensive in price/earnings terms than they have ever been and the sector as a whole is trading at a 20 per cent premium to its historic p/e average. As the industry returns to a more normal state, so should the rating of its shares.
167;MO;Altria Group;2007-03-17T01:25:22Z;Altadis rejects buy approach from Imperial;;Altadis, the Franco-Spanish tobacco group, early on Saturday rejected an £8bn approach by Imperial Tobacco, saying the unsolicited bid was too low.The move came as Altria – owner of the Philip Morris cigarette brands – considered whether to intervene in the process. People familiar with the matter said they were “looking hard” at the situation.Anticipation of the next move in the battle for the tobacco market prompted sharp moves in the shares of both Altadis and its would-be predator on Friday.Shares in Imperial rose 108p to £23.30, on top of the previous day’s almost 8 per cent rise after its bid for Altadis was announced.Meanwhile, Altadis shares slid by almost 4 per cent in a late-market sell-off as it appeared to be stalling over its response to Imperial.Rejecting the bid early on Saturday, Altadis said in a short statement that it was reviewing its options.“The board…has carefully considered this approach and has unanimously rejected it on the grounds that it does not reflect the strategic value of the company and its unique and diversified assets, as well as their future growth prospects.”Analysts agreed on Friday that Imperial’s bid for Altadis would be the catalyst for “large-scale consolidation in the global tobacco industry”.“[This] might well be Altria’s last chance to bid for Imperial,” said Goldman Sachs analysts. Dresdner Kleinwort said Altria would want Imperial to gain market leadership in the UK.There was also speculation about a counter-offer for Altadis by BAT. Paul Adams, BAT chief executive, said recently that mergers and acquisitions were part of the company’s growth strategy. But he said there was nothing “of any real substance” to buy. “We are always open to acquisitions, but there is nothing at the moment that would offer shareholder value,” he said.“There are a number of businesses which I think would have a good strategic fit with us, but it’s really the finances.”Philip Morris International and BAT declined to comment.
168;MO;Altria Group;2007-03-06T22:01:22Z;Wall St rallies on weaker yen;;"Wall Street stocks on Tuesday made their biggest one-day gains since July as a rebound in overseas equities and a weaker yen lifted spirits.After a torrid week for equities, almost all sectors advanced, led by some of the financial, materials and technology stocks that have particularly suffered of late.The tentative recovery came in spite of moderately disappointing economic data that showed a higher-than-expected rise in labour costs and lower-than-expected pending home sales and factory orders.“The market was deeply oversold in a bloody week that quickly changed from greed to fear. We are well overdue for at least a knee-jerk bounce,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite surged 1.9 per cent to close at 2,385.14, lifted by Cisco and Google.The S&P 500 Index rose 1.6 per cent to 1,395.41 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.3 per cent higher at 12,170.34. The rally recovered Monday’s losses in the biggest one-day percentage rise in the S&P and Dow for more than six months.Investment banks and brokerages improved after a bad week as fears about the financial markets began to ease. Bear Stearns was 3.1 per cent higher at $149 while Lehman Brothers leapt 4.4 per cent higher to $74.23.Shares in mortgage lenders also experienced a bounce after Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, said the subprime mortgage problems were contained.Countrywide was 4.7 per cent stronger at $36.85 while subprime lender New Century Financial gained 10.1 per cent to $5.02 after losing almost two-thirds of its market value on Monday.Real estate investment trusts were on the march, with the MSCI Reit Index up 3.5 per cent while shares in the Simon Property Group rose 4.7 per cent to $109.07.Analysts at Bear Stearns raised their rating on Texas Instruments to “outperform”, lifting its shares
1.5 per cent to $31.35. Texas was one of a number of technology groups that showed strength.Google and Apple rose 3.7 and 2.2 per cent respectively to $457.55 and $88.19 on signs that the two companies were working together more closely. Cisco rose 2 per cent to $25.96.Rising commodity prices helped materials stocks recoup some losses, with the aluminium group Alcoa up 2.1 per cent to $32.41 and US Steel rising 3.2 per cent to $87.67.Altria made gains after analysts at Deutsche Bank upgraded the group from “hold” to “buy”, arguing it was undervalued. Its shares rose 2.7 per cent to $84.42.Sentiment was given an additional boost by merger and acquisition activity, such as Citigroup’s $10.75bn bid for Nikko Cordial, Japan’s third-largest brokerage. Citigroup’s stock gained 2.7 per cent at $50.58."
169;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Europe can help snuff out smoking;;"From the people who brought you cigarettes, here is another addictive and unhealthy product. Stick a pouch of tobacco in your mouth and get a nicotine kick that way.It does not sound that great an idea, does it? As smoking slowly declines in the developed world, cigarette companies are seizing on snuff tobacco as an alternative. British American Tobacco, Reynolds American and Philip Morris are all diversifying into smokeless products, an area cornered in the US by the US Smokeless Tobacco Company, which makes Skoal Bandits.Europe has been here before and unhappily so. When UST introduced Skoal Bandits to the UK in the 1980s, it faced an outcry over its apparent attempt to hook youngsters on sweet tobacco. Tobacco pouches were banned in the UK in 1990 – although chewing tobacco remains legal – and the ban was extended across the European Union two years later.Groups such as the World Health Organisation and the American Cancer Society think it is wise to remain suspicious of so-called oral snuff. A pouch tucked between the upper lip and gum delivers a bigger dose of nicotine than a cigarette, while chewing tobacco, still widely used in south Asia, causes cancer of the mouth and lips.It is, however, time to rethink. Tobacco regulation in Europe is bizarrely inverted: there are strict controls on smoking cessation aids such as nicotine patches; there is an outright ban on snuff; chewing tobacco is legal, if hard to find; but cigarettes, undoubtedly the most hazardous way to consume nicotine, are sold at every corner shop.As it happens, Europe has already experimented with the legalisation of oral snuff. Sweden is the only EU country where snus (pronounced “snooze”) – the local name for oral stuff – has been legal since the 1992 ban. It was given an opt-out from the ban when it joined the EU in 1995, because oral snuff is widely consumed both there and in Finland.Sweden has also been the most successful of all industrialised nations in reducing smoking and deaths from lung cancer among men in the past two decades. Only 16 per cent of Swedish men now smoke, compared with 27 per cent in the UK and 47 per cent in Japan, and the rate has fallen steadily as Swedes have taken to snus as an alternative to smoking.True, Sweden is often an outlier in matters of health and environment. It sometimes seems as if the world would be a better place if we were all Swedish or we all lived there (even if it would be a bit of a squeeze). Only the other day, Sweden came second to the Netherlands in a Unicef study on which industrialised country was the best place to be a child.But the Swedish experiment should be taken seriously. One reason for the comparative benefits of snus is that Swedish Match, the biggest maker of the stuff, has worked hard to reduce its carcinogens. It does not lead to smoking-related conditions such as bronchitis and has largely been cleared of causing cancer (with the exception of pancreatic cancer).What, after all, is the purpose here? After two decades of concerted efforts to reduce smoking through health warnings, bans in public places and hefty taxation, governments have little to show. Smoking has edged downwards in industrialised countries but is rising rapidly enough in developing nations for tobacco to remain a growth business.There have been few better places to invest your money over the past few years: BAT’s shares have more than tripled in value in five years. Tobacco companies have deflected legal liability in the US by reaching settlements with states and are gaining millions of new customers in countries where their brands connote wealth and sophistication.In short, telling people not to smoke on the grounds that it is extremely dangerous has mostly failed. Under these circumstances, luring them towards a safer form of consumption of nicotine is worth a try. “Nobody can put his hand on his heart and claim that snus is harmless but it is a lot less harmful than cigarettes,” says Adrian Payne, head of corporate social responsibility at BAT.We should no doubt be wary of anything that tobacco companies push. Much of the research in the US in support of oral snuff is financed by, you’ve guessed it, UST. But it also has some impartial and even some surprising backers. The Royal College of Physicians has supported snus as an alternative to cigarette smoking and so does Ash, the British anti-smoking organization.Deborah Arnott, director of Ash, says it wants snus to be made legal only if it matches the safety standard established by Swedish Match and is marketed to adult smokers as a way of kicking cigarettes. Given the murky history of Skoal Bandits, safeguards are needed but it is absurd to stick with a blanket ban in Europe.The EU will soon have a chance to act. A committee of experts is examining the record of snus and will report to the European Commission this year. Any effort to alter the directive would face difficulty because it would need to be approved by the European parliament, which is likely to be suspicious of anything that smacks of endorsing tobacco.Well, tough. Sometimes you have to choose the lesser of two evils, no matter how compromised it makes you feel. Smoking tobacco is a deadly pastime that no government has yet found an acceptable way to eradicate. If the Swedes have come up with a safer alternative, it behoves other countries to give it a chance."
170;MO;Altria Group;2007-02-28T21:55:33Z;Bernanke remarks lift US stocks;;Reassuring comments from Ben Bernanke soothed investors’ nerves on Wall Street on Wednesday and helped stocks edge upwards following one of the biggest one-day falls since 2001.After a tentative start the market began to rally with some conviction as the Federal Reserve chairman said in testimony to Congress that there had been no material change in his outlook on the economy.Defensive stocks that are less sensitive to a downturn in the economy fared well, while the homebuilding sector continued to decline after weak new home sales data.“Calm heads prevailed,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist, Cantor Fitzgerald. “There was no overwhelming reason to continue the decline and the market took the opportunity to bounce back. Bernanke’s statements had a calming effect.”The S&P 500 index closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,406.82, slightly off its peak earlier in the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.4 per cent higher at 12,268.63.But, in spite of Wednesday’s gains, the Dow and the S&P closed the month lower for the first time since June and May respectively.In a sign of that nervousness was beginning to ease, the Vix index, a measure of market volatility nicknamed Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 15.5 per cent to 15.47. It jumped more than 60 per cent on Tuesday.Procter & Gamble was one of the best performing stocks with a rise of 3.6 per cent to $63.49. There was little to explain the sharp rise except for investors seeking a safe haven. Shares in the tobacco group Altria rose 2 per cent to $84.28.Sprint Nextel jumped 4.6 per cent to $19.30 after the mobile phone operator reported higher quarterly profits and said it expected the number of its subscribers to rise.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,416.13, buoyed by Apple stock, which gained 0.8 per cent to $84.61 after bullish comments about expected sales of its new mobile phone.The sharpest fall in new home sales in 13 years somewhat tempered the more positive mood, however, and sent shares in homebuilders lower.The S&P Homebuilders index was down 1.2 per cent while shares in Toll Brothers were 2.4 per cent softer at $29.86.Investors in Alcoa remained on the defensive as doubts over Chinese demand raised concerns about the aluminium maker. It fell 1.1 per cent to $33.41. Meanwhile shares in Caterpillar were 0.6 per cent lower at $64.43 after recouping some early losses driven by worries about its Chinese sales.Merck’s stock advanced after the drugmaker raised its earnings forecast for the year. Its shares were 2.3 per cent higher at $44.15.Home Depot said it expected sales to slow because of the weak housing market. Shares in the retailer were 0.6 per cent lower at $39.59.
171;MO;Altria Group;2007-02-26T23:05:55Z;Tobacco regulation back under spotlight;;A renewed proposal to regulate tobacco by federal health safety authorities will make its way back under the bright lights of US political theatre on Tuesday in a Senate health committee hearing.Senator Edward Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, has called the hearing as part of his effort to reintroduce legislation that would authorise the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate cigarettes and tobacco.The hearing is likely to air a number of public health groups’ favourable views on the bill, which also has support from congressman Henry Waxman in the House of Representatives.Groups including the American Cancer Society and the influential Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids are trying to increase momentum for the bill, which would add strict pharmaceutical-like regulation of tobacco and its promotion.Proponents of the bill hope Mr Kennedy will move it forward next month and that a Democratic-controlled Congress can finally pass the regulation.But the bill is exactly the same as several that have failed since 2000.It would give authority to the FDA to mandate strict warnings and any claims that a certain product had less risk than other products.The agency, which regulates medicines, medical devices, food and cosmetics, could monitor and set standards for contents and ingredients in tobacco products under the bill.“Unbelievably, despite all the harm they cause, tobacco products are exempt from basic health and safety regulations that apply to other products . . . even dog food,” said a coalition of US public health groups.There are more questions for others in Congress. Some Republicans are sceptical about regulation as a solution, or its effect on the FDA.The FDA has come under intense recent scrutiny over its resources pertaining to ensuring drug safety following Merck’s withdrawal of painkiller Vioxx in 2004 due to heart risks.A bi-partisan debate on the FDA and drug regulation could overshadow the tobacco question.Scott Ballin, a tobacco and health policy consultant, predicted that the tobacco bill “is going to get pulled into this whole issue of FDA authority and FDA resources”.Some industry analysts also see passage of the bill as a long shot, given other bigger issues looming in Washington. However, it could be beneficial to the large groups, if it ever succeeds.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, said: “If FDA regulation did become a priority for legislators, we believe the result would actually help the major cigarette manufacturers since it would entrench their positions.”Yet the tobacco industry appears split on the proposal. Philip Morris USA, the US unit of Altria group, is strongly in favour of the proposal, saying it provides more certainty for the industry, while Reynolds American is more cautious.Steven Parrish, head of corporate affairs at Altria, said: “We think creating a new kind of tobacco industry under FDA regulation is in the best interest of shareholders.”
172;MO;Altria Group;2007-02-25T20:14:45Z;Altria;;Health risks aside, life has lately been good for bankers specialising in tobacco. The latest rumours of Altria and Altadis joining forces to carve up rival cigarette maker Imperial Tobacco may have been more smoke than fire. Altria would probably prefer to get next month’s spin-off of Kraft Foods out of the way first. There is still a risk, albeit small, of tobacco litigation causing a delay. Even so, Altria’s days of abstinence from major dealmaking should soon end.As the world’s largest cigarette maker, Altria will have a massively undergeared balance sheet. It will probably boost share buy-backs and new debt issuance, generating a decent fee stream for banks in the process. The bigger opportunity, though, lies in Altria finally pulling its weight in consolidating the sector.That would arguably be easier if it were to split itself up, yet again, between its domestic activities and the rest of the business. That would give Philip Morris International a more attractive acquisition currency by further removing it from remaining US litigation risks. Admittedly, these have receded anyway, while Altria itself could take on more debt. But a split should also alleviate antitrust issues, including those arising from Imperial’s recently announced US acquisition.In the meantime, Altria might well make a purchase in the US smokeless tobacco sector. But when it comes to international cigarette deals, there are two drawbacks to waiting too long. One is that European targets such as Altadis and Imperial might not be available forever. Meanwhile, Gallaher has already agreed to a takeover bid from Japan Tobacco. Second, there is a chance that Philip Morris USA might one day be interested in the same assets as Philip Morris International. That prospect is tantalising for bankers – but less so for Altria’s current shareholders.
173;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:55:11+0000;US ruling puts new limits on punitive damages;;The US business community on Tuesday won a limited ­victory in the battle to restrain high punitive damage awards, when the US Supreme Court imposed a new constitutional curb on such awards.But the 5-4 ruling, which came in a case involving Philip Morris, the big tobacco company, stopped short of the tough clampdown on punitive damages sought by US business.The court ruled it was unconstitutional for a jury to award punitive damages to punish harm to individuals who were not involved in a lawsuit – as they did in the Philip Morris case, where the jury punished the tobacco company for the injuries to all Oregon smokers, not just the smoker whose widow brought the lawsuit.The court said that amounted to “a taking of property . . . without due process”. It set aside the $79.5m punitive award and sent the case back to the lower court.“To permit punishment for injuring a non-party victim would add a near standardless dimension to the punitive damages question,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the court.“This is a big win for the business community,’’ said Robin Conrad, of the US Chamber of Commerce’s litigation unit. “Today’s decision correctly addresses business’s concern that punishing defendants for harm to those not involved in the lawsuit denies a company the right to defend claims against it.”Philip Morris said the ruling would give it an opportunity “to fully and fairly defend itself in this and other cases”.But the court refused to rule on the larger question of the size of such awards: the punitive award in the Oregon case was almost 100 times compensatory, or actual damages. The US business community had hoped for a clear statement that such an award was excessive.In addition, the court made clear that juries might consider harm to others in determining the size of punitive damage awards – just not directly.The majority said juries could consider such harm in determining the “reprehensibility” of the defendant’s conduct – one factor used in setting the size of a punitive award.“A lot will depend on future cases, whether that is practical protection or mere paper protection,” for defendants, said Mark Levy of Kilpatrick Stockton, a law firm.Still, the ruling is good news for tobacco companies and drug companies such as Merck, which faces more than 27,000 lawsuits over its painkiller Vioxx.■The US Supreme Court overturned a $79m antitrust award against Weyerhaeuser, the lumber producer, in a ruling that will help to shield companies from claims that they illegally tried to drive a competitor out of business, Bloomberg reports.The ruling is a victory for large US companies, giving them more room to bid aggressively for raw materials and other supplies without the risk of violating federal antitrust laws. Dow Chemical, Verizon Communications, Coca-Cola and Microsoft were among the companies that supported Weyerhaeuser.
174;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Kraft unveils plans to boost sales growth;;Kraft Foods on Tuesday announced a long-awaited reorganisation which will see the US group increase marketing spending and refocus its product line-up in a bid to boost organic sales growth to 3-4 per cent next year.Irene Rosenfeld, who took over as chief executive last June, said the company will “hit our stride” by 2009, after admitting in recent weeks that its existing turnaround plan was “not broad-based enough”, while its response to competitors has been viewed by analysts as sluggish.Ms Rosenfeld’s task has been complicated by recent mis-steps, such as the $245m write-off for its poorly-performing Tassimo coffee brand. Sales at Kraft, best known for its cheese slices, Oreo cookies and Maxwell House coffee, rose 0.7 per cent last year.Kraft, like rivals such as Sara Lee, is combining a mix of cost-cutting and increased spending on product development and marketing, while rejigging its portfolio to boost margins and secure stable sales growth. However, the industry also faces volatile raw material and energy costs, which have eroded pricing power in some segments.The Illinois-based company has already sold products with annual sales of $1bn, and is cutting 6,000 staff – 6 per cent of its workforce – as part of an effort to generate annual savings of $400m.Kraft said savings from the two existing restructuring plans were on target, and aims to reinvest the savings to bolster growth. The company will also pursue acquisitions – notably overseas – with a balance sheet strengthened by next month’s spin-off from Altria, the US tobacco group which still owns 89 per cent of Kraft.The increased spending saw Kraft cut its earnings per share guidance for 2007 to $1.50-$1.55 – compared with $1.85 last year - with Kraft shares dipping 2 per cent to $34.23 by midday in New York.Analysts also expressed some scepticism about the potential impact of lifting marketing expenditure by little over 1 per cent.Ms Rosenfeld, a 22-year Kraft veteran and the former head of PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay North America unit, said in a presentation to analysts that she would “rewire the organisation for growth”. From 2009, the company is targeting earnings growth of 7-9 per cent and organic sales growth of 4 per cent.Kraft is not expected to announce any more large-scale divestitures, with Ms Rosenfeld focusing on how the company – the largest US packaged food group by revenues – can leverage its scale, a strategy successfully employed by PepsiCo.The company is viewed as having a strong sales force, and a presence across the range of key food segments – frozen, refrigerated and on-the-shelf. Ms Rosenfeld has talked of focusing more effort on higher-margin ready-meal offerings, as well as brands such as its “Back to Nature” line-up which tap into rising demand for healthier foods.
175;MO;Altria Group;2007-02-09T00:32:27Z;Imperial Tobacco moves on US;;Imperial Tobacco on Thursday agreed to buy Commonwealth Brands, the fourth-biggest US cigarette manufacturer, for $1.9bn cash – its first significant move into the world’s most profitable tobacco market.The purchase of Commonwealth Brands from Houchens Industries adds five brands, including USA Gold and Sonoma, to Imperial’s business and gives it 3.7 per cent of the $376bn US market.Gareth Davis, chief executive, said the deal satisfied his desire to make a “low risk” entry into the US market. Commonwealth Brands, created in the 1990s, had never lost a smoking-related lawsuit or been named in a class-action lawsuit, he said.Imperial, the world’s fourth-biggest cigarette company, already sells Rizla and Joker cigarette papers in the US through its Robert Burton unit. But the UK group had estimated that it would cost £20m ($39m) a year to increase sales of cigarettes in the US by itself.“Commonwealth Brands is a terrific, young business which gives us immediate access to the world’s most profitable tobacco market,” said Mr Davis.Imperial, which has a presence in 130 countries, said it expected the acquisition to be profitable this financial year, before taking into account brand amortisation and deferred tax on intangibles. In the year to September 30, Commonwealth Brands generated revenue, less duty, of $348m and profit before tax of $59m.In spite of what some have called a “strategic business fit”, the market reacted negatively.The announcement sent Imperial shares – which had shot up on bid speculation – down 63p to £21.68.Takeover talk heightened last month after Imperial refused to update the market about its £600m-a-year buy-back. It suspended the programme after rival Gallaher received a £7.5bn approach from Japan Tobacco.Peter Czerniawski, tobacco analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, said: “It seems the market sees Imperial’s acquisition of Commonwealth as a small poison pill in that it adds 6 to 7 per cent to [Imperial’s] operating profit in a market that Altria already dominates and therefore would not be allowed to keep for antitrust reasons.”The net cost was $1.5bn including tax benefits related to goodwill – 8.6 times Commonwealth’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Imperial shares fell 2.3 per cent to £21.79. Shares in Altria also fell, down 90 cents at $85.08.

177;MO;Altria Group;2007-02-08T20:16:42Z;Imperial expansion;;What a difference a few years can make. Not so long ago, tobacco companies would count themselves lucky for having little exposure to the litigation-prone US. By contrast, Imperial Tobacco now sees its agreed $1.9bn purchase of Commonwealth Brands as a potential growth engine.Imperial’s surprise decision to buy the fourth largest US cigarette maker – with a 3.7 per cent market share – says a lot about how the sector is changing. Smoking bans, increasing taxes, advertising restrictions and better health awareness are spreading in western Europe. Meanwhile, litigation risk has receded in the US and price increases have largely offset sector-wide volume declines.Thanks to its focus on the growing discount segment, Commonwealth has been gaining market share in recent years. Its financial record looks a little patchy but Imperial has left some margin for error. Including a putative $400m tax benefit, Imperial is paying 8.6 times 2006 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. That is below other recent deals and sector multiples.A new owner could make Commonwealth a more tempting litigation target. But it seems to have managed such risks carefully during its short history. Add a modern manufacturing facility running at less then half potential capacity and Imperial can make an appealing case.The snag for its shareholders is that the deal makes larger and more lucrative transactions harder to pull off. Linking up with Altadis, which would generate sizeable cost savings, looks less likely in the near future. Commonwealth’s absorption is also likely to make a generous bid from a US rival, such as Altria, more complicated because of antitrust concerns. After all, takeover defences are a bit like passive smoking – intensely annoying, even in small doses.
178;MO;Altria Group;2007-02-08T14:25:30Z;FTSE slips despite rate hold;;Imperial Tobacco was one of the biggest FTSE 100 fallers on Thursday falling 2.7 per cent to £21.70 after the cigarette maker surprised the market by announcing plans to enter the US through the acquisition of Commonwealth Brands for almost £1bn.Traders said the deal made it more difficult for Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, to launch a bid for Imperial as it would run into antitrust problems.But analysts countered by saying that it would be easy enough for Altria to dispose of Commonwealth if it bid for Imperial.Smith & Nephew bucked a weaker market in London on Thursday gaining 6.1 per cent to 613p after the medical devices group impressed investors with better-than-expected full year results and a $1.5bn share buyback.In the wider market, the FTSE 100’s recent strong run came to an end as investors paused to digest a flurry of results and decided to bank some profits.The FTSE 100, which hit a six-year high on Wednesday, closed 23.1 points, or 0.4 per cent, lower at 6,346.4, while the FTSE 250 faded 60.1 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 11,441.9.Reckitt Benckiser, up 4.5 per cent to £25.95, was in demand after its full-year results beat expectations.Better-than-forecast figures were also behind the advances in BG Group, up 4.2 per cent to 725p, BT Group, 1 per cent stronger at 319¾p, and GlaxoSmithKline, 1.6 per cent higher at £14.22.HSBC dipped 1.5 per cent to 917p as investors responded to news that its bad debt charge for 2006 would be around $10.6bn (£5.4bn) – or 20 per cent above forecast – because of problems at its US mortgage business.On a more speculative tack, Scottish & Southern Energy eased 0.6 per cent to £15.23 in spite of talk that it could be a takoever target for EDF.Away from the insurers, St James Place, the upmarket life assurer, was the top performer. Its shares gained 4 per cent to 476¼p on vague talk that HBOS, off 0.3 per cent at £11.31, might make a bid for 40 per cent of the company it does not own.Elsewhere, Forth Ports gained 1.4 per cent to £21.76, although traders said the rise had little to do with fresh takeover rumours. They pinned the advance on news that Cemex, the Mexican owner of RMC, had been granted approval to build a £27m port facility at the Port of Tilbury, which is owned by Forth.Investec Securities said the news was further evidence that Forth should benefit from the 2012 Olympics and the regeneration of Stratford in east London.British Energy sank 4.8 per cent to 419p in heavy volume of 19m on worries ahead of Tuesday’s third-quarter results. Investors will scour the results statement for news on when its Hinkley Point and Hunterston power stations will come back on line.Just before Chiristmas, British Energy said the stations would return to service before the end of March.Mitchells & Butlers firmed 1.5 per cent to 763p on talk financier Robert Tchenguiz might add to his 15 per cent stake in the pub group. Earlier this week, Mr Tchenguiz banked a €300m (£198m) profit from selling his shareholder in Sampo, the Finnish insurance company.Emap, the magazine publisher and radio group, gained 0.6 per cent to 778½p on talk that it is vulnerable to a bid from a private equity group.
179;MO;Altria Group;2007-02-02T18:53:02Z;Sainsbury leads FTSE higher;;Imperial Tobacco climbed to a fresh all-time high on Friday but the J Sainsbury takeover story took centre stage in London.The catalyst was a research note from one of the tobacco sector’s most respected analysts arguing that the cigarette manufacturer was a target for the owner of Marlboro.Philip Morris International is due to separate from parent company Altria next month and is widely expected to join in the sector consolidation that began with Japan Tobacco’s $19bn approach to Gallaher.Michael Smith, analyst at JP Morgan, noted comments this week from Louis Camilleri, Altria chief executive, that there were “no limitations” to Philip Morris’s ability to complete a large debt-financed tobacco deal.Mr Smith said Imperial Tobacco was the most likely target and the US group could afford to pay up to £28 a share: “We estimate Philip Morris is already essentially debt free and could [complete] debt finance deals in excess of $30bn”. Imperial Tobacco shares closed up 4 per cent at £21.75.In the wider market, shock news that a private equity consortium was considering a bid for Sainsbury sent the FTSE 100 to within a whisker of its six-year high in heavy volume of 4.2bn shares. The index rose 28.7 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 6,310.9 while the FTSE 250 jumped 121.8 points, or 1.1 per cent, to an all-time high of 11,343.3. Over the week, the blue-chip index rose 1.3 per cent while the mid-caps jumped 2 per cent.The approach for the UK’s third largest supermarket chain sent its shares 13.9 per cent higher to an eight-year peak of 507p amid speculation that the consortium would look at a sale-and lease back deal for Sainsbury’s property portfolio, worth £7.5bn according to some estimates.Fellow grocers Wm Morrison and Tesco rose 5.9 per cent to 300¾p and 3.7 per cent to 435p respectively while Marks & Spencer added 4.1 per cent to 717½p and B&Q owner Kingfisher rose 3.5 per cent to 252½p.Other property-backed stocks also gained including Enterprise Inns, up 2.8 per cent to 665½p, and Mitchells & Butlers, 4.4 per cent higher at 736p. The All Bar One owner was further boosted as it was added to Goldman Sachs’s “conviction buy” list. Brewer Marston’s, the former Wolverhampton & Dudley, rose 3.2 per cent to 443¾p. There were also rumours of predatory interest from a private equity house.Elsewhere, Prudential firmed 2.1 per cent to 705½p amid rumours that the life assurer could be a takeover target for HSBC, up 0.3 per cent to 935p. Traders said there could be something in the speculation. Prudential is seen as more attractive now it has sold Egg, its loss-making internet bank, while HSBC wants to more double the profits it makes from insurance in the next five years.Of the fallers, a flurry of downgrades dragged Royal Dutch Shell 1.8 per cent lower to £17.07 as this week’s news of record profit was overshadowed by fears of rising capital expenditure and modest production growth.Sage Group fell 1.8 per cent to 272p after the accounting software group was downgraded by Merrill Lynch. Centrica lost 1.4 per cent to 371p as Morgan Stanley said gains for the gas company’s shares had been “overdone”.Meanwhile, mining stocks were unsettled by rumours that a hedge fund had run up large losses in the commodities market. Rio Tinto fell 2.2 per cent to £26.91.Crest Nicholson rose 0.9 per cent to 621.5p on talk of a rival bid for the housebuilderLower down the market, Tanfield gained 12.8 per cent to 84p as the zero-emission vehicle technology group signed a deal to supply its battery powered Newton vans to Marks & Spencer.Hogg Robinson improved 1 per cent to 100p after Kaupthing Bank cleared an overhang by placing 7.5m shares at 99p. Kaupthing also handled an order of 7.8m shares in Intec Telecom, up 0.6 per cent to 43p, for a client, and was the most active broker in Sainsbury yesterday, turning over 40m shares.Interactive World, the digital media content business spun out of the Daily Sport, climbed 13.8 per cent to 87½p after an upbeat trading statement.However, Dawson International, the cashmere group that supplies Prada and Gucci, slumped 13 per cent to 5.87p as takeover talks ended without agreement.
180;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:51:47+0000;Altria chief’s clear view of the tasks ahead;;"The last time Louis Camilleri gave an interview, in 2003, he accompanied his remarks about the future of Altria, the tobacco and food conglomerate he led, with occasional puffs on a Marlboro Light.Almost four years to the date, much has changed.Mr Camilleri faces the press with not a whiff of smoke in sight, in compliance with the “no smoking” signs dotted around Altria’s elegant Manhattan headquarters in the shadow of Grand Central Station.He is no longer in charge of Kraft Foods, having just announced its long-awaited spin-off from Altria’s Philip Morris tobacco businesses.Mr Camilleri’s years spent out of the limelight have also been marked by significant changes in the regulatory and competitive environment.Several US states have imposed tough rules on smoking, including banning smoking in offices and public places, and many more are considering it.However, the threat of litigation that had been hanging over Altria and its rivals for decades has receded and is now at the lowest level in years.Part of the rationale for the Kraft spin-off is that the tobacco industry’s survival is no longer threatened by massive damage claims that might have had to be met by the food business’s cash.But with domestic consumption in the US market, where Altria has a 50-plus per cent market share, inexorably declining, and competition abroad increasing, life as the leader of a stand-alone tobacco company promises to be challenging.Three significant items stand on Mr Camilleri’s to-do list in the face of these challenges. He must get tobacco federally regulated in the US; move into the growing smokeless tobacco products market in the US; and grab more of the enormous and growing international cigarette market – particularly in Asia.On the domestic front, Altria and Philip Morris USA (PM USA) are championing government oversight of the industry by the Food and Drug Administration.Senator Edward Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Health Committee, and Representative Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, are soon expected to introduce legislation that would give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco. Introduction of such a bill could come as early as next week.Mr Waxman said: “Tobacco is the only product that when used as directed kills, and it is mindboggling that it remains unregulated.”Many proponents of federal oversight believe any regulatory framework should include smokeless products – a market Philip Morris is planning to enter.“We – and PM USA – believe quite strongly that [regulation] would be in the best interests of the entire industry,” Mr Camilleri told the Financial Times.“It would bring a lot of clarity and ultimately it would assist our common objective, which is to reduce the harm caused by smoking.”RJ Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of Reynolds American, is more cautious, fearing regulation could put them at a competitive disadvantage.“We’re ok with reasonable regulation. But reasonable for us may not be reasonable for someone else,” said a company spokesman.Internationally, Mr Camilleri faces a different challenge – pushing Philip Morris International (PMI) to capture more of the huge cigarette markets in developing countries.China accounts for 35 per cent of the world consumption of cigarettes, and markets including India and Vietnam also beckon.Mr Camilleri said: “Less than 5 per cent of PMI’s income today comes from markets that represent more than 60 per cent of world consumption of cigarettes. Last year our share of the world market was only 15.5 per cent, so that gives you a sense of what we believe is our growth potential across the world.”With all the changes in the past years, Mr Camilleri acknowledges that Wall Street continues to look for more."
181;MO;Altria Group;2007-02-01T18:48:16Z;American Standard to break up;;American Standard is to break up into three, unravelling a $10bn toilets-to-brakes group dating back to the 19th century and sounding another death knell for out-of-favour US conglomerates.The decision by American Standard to spin off its vehicle controls business, sell its bath and kitchen products division and retain its air-conditioning division reflects growing investor dissatisfaction with sprawling groups.The disenchantment is a rejection of the notion – popular in the 1960s and 1970s – that conglomerates’ vast array of businesses offered investors protection from swings in the economic and business cycle.The current trend in favour of more focused companies such as Google and Apple has contributed to the demise of several diversified groups and raised questions over the strategies of some of the surviving ones, such as General Electric and Citigroup.This week Altria announced the spin off of Kraft Foods from its Philip Morris tobacco business, while scandal tainted Tyco is to break itself up into three in the next few months, mirroring moves by the property-to-travel group Cendant and the media group Viacom.Pressure on conglomerates to break up has been intensified by the rise of private equity funds, which have often used their vast cash resources to buy divisions of large groups.Analysts said that buyuot groups or foreign buyers, possibly from China, could bid for American Standard’s bath and kitchen unit. The business has been hit by high commodity prices and unsuccessful products, but its brands are popular in Europe and America.The vehicle controls division, called WABCO, could also be bought before the planned spinned off on the stock market, industry experts said.Fred Poses, American Standard chairman and chief executive, echoed the sentiment of many business leaders and investors when he said the break-up was the “best way to enhance shareholder value.”Although shares in American Standard, which began as a tinware shop in Massachussets in 1872, have risen more than 35 per cent over the past year, Mr Poses said the three businesses would be better off on their own.The surviving company is to take the name of the $6.8bn air-conditioning unit Trane. Investors reacted positively to the break up, sending American Standard shares more than 7 per cent higher in New York midday trading – the biggest gain in over six years.
182;MO;Altria Group;2007-02-01T02:10:03Z;Altria ready to spin off Kraft;;"Altria Group, the world’s largest tobacco company, wants to expand its international operations and offset sagging US consumption with smokeless tobacco products after spinning off Kraft Foods, Louis Camilleri, its chief executive, said.Mr Camilleri said the separation of Kraft from Philip Morris, whose brands include Marlboro, would leave both companies free to pursue acquisitions and focus on expansion.The move, announced on Wednesday, unravels a combination built two decades ago in a more uncertain time for the industry.Tobacco companies sought to diversify into more highly valued food businesses amid the threat of litigation and lack of opportunities outside the western world.“Tobacco has grown faster than food,” Mr Camilleri said. “All our competitors are pure-play tobacco companies and I think today focus is very important…the market rewards focused players rather than diversified conglomerates”.Mr Camilleri, who will step down as chairman of Kraft, said the tobacco company’s greatest opportunities were in developing economies such as China and India. “Less than 5 per cent of Philip Morris International’s income today comes from markets that represent more than 60 per cent of world consumption of cigarettes,” he said.“Last year our share of the world market was only 15.5 per cent so that gives you a sense of what we believe is our growth potential across the world.”Analysts expect Wednesday’s spin-off to be followed by a separation of the faster-growing international tobacco operations from the profitable but mature US business as early as this year. A split would enable Switzerland-based PMI to take advantage of its strong balance sheet for investment and acquisitions.In the US, where cigarette consumption has been falling for decades, Altria is looking to growth markets such as snuff and chewing tobacco.Mr Camilleri said Altria was to launch several products and look for acquisitions. “We probably have been slow at developing our own products. We like to come up with products that are innovative and we believe we have reached that point on several
levels,” he said.The spin-off of Altria’s 89 per cent stake in Kraft will take place on March 30, with Altria shareholders receiving about 0.70 of a Kraft share for every share of Altria they owned.Altria and Kraft reported divergent fourth-quarter earnings. Altria’s profit rose from $2.29bn, or $1.09 a share, a year ago to $2.96bn, or $1.40 a share, while Kraft’s net income fell 19 per cent."
183;MO;Altria Group;2007-01-31T22:01:04Z;Wall Street rallies after rates kept at 5.25%;;US stocks rallied broadly on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve concluded its policy meeting and noted the economy was “somewhat firmer” and core inflation had “improved modestly in recent months”.That outlook followed evidence of robust economic growth during the fourth quarter. Once investors had read the Fed policy statement, stocks shrugged off their earlier mixed performance, marked by weakness in technology shares, and rallied across the board. Blue-chips and small capitalised companies led the ensuing charge.“Growth and inflation look better and the equity market doesn’t need a rate cut if the economy is growing at 3.5 per cent,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global market strategist at JPMorgan Global Asset Management.At the close, the S&P 500 had risen 0.7 per cent to 1,438.24, after being unchanged before the FOMC meeting ended.The Dow ended up 0.8 per cent at 12,621.69, and had set a new intra-day record high of 12,657.02. The Dow was boosted by stellar earnings at Boeing. Its quarterly result of $1.16 a share beat estimates of 98 cents, and the aircraft maker also raised earnings guidance for 2007. The stock rose 4.1 per cent to $89.56.The Russell 2000 index of small companies closed above 800 for the first time and rose 0.5 per cent to 802.12.The Nasdaq Composite rebounded from negative territory earlier in the day and ended 0.6 per cent higher at 2,463.93. After the close, Google reported earnings of $3.18 a shares that beat estimates of $2.92. In after-hours trade the stock fell 1 per cent to $489.Other companies in the spotlight included, Bristol-Myers Squibb. It rose 2.7 per cent to $28.79, after the Financial Times reported that the pharmaceuticals company had appointed Lehman Brothers to work alongside Citigroup and Morgan Stanley to examine its options ahead of an expected takeover bid from Sanofi-Aventis.Altria posted fourth-quarter earnings of $1.40 a share, above estimates of $1.23, and said the long planned distribution of its 89 per cent stake in Kraft would take place on March 30. The tobacco conglomerate fell 0.2 per cent to $87.39.Time Warner slid 0.8 per cent to $21.87, later reporting fourth-quarter profits rose more than 30 per cent. Excluding one-off items, earnings were 22 cents a share.Eastman Kodak rebounded to a fourth-quarter profit from a year-earlier loss. It rose 1.3 per cent to $25.86.CBOT said fourth-quarter profit more than doubled. The derivatives exchange, which is being acquired by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said net income for the latest quarter totalled $1.03 a share excluding merger expenses. That was above estimates of 99 cents a share and the stock fell 0.2 per cent to $168.80.
184;MO;Altria Group;2007-01-29T18:25:45Z;FTSE falls amid defensive shift;;British American Tobacco was among the few talking points in a quiet London market on Monday.Its shares topped the FTSE 100 leaderboard, rising 2.8 per cent to a record high of £15.60.Traders said BAT was in focus ahead of results and demerger news from Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, later this week.They added that in spite of its recent strong run, its shares still looked cheap compared to rivals such as Imperial Tobacco, up 0.8 per cent to £21.24, and Altadis.However, BAT was also buoyed by speculation that it could increase the amount of cash it returns to shareholders.In a recent note, Citigroup estimated that BAT could return £1.5bn to shareholders without a downgrade to its credit rating. At the moment, BAT is returning £500m a year.In order to do this BAT would need to increase its distributable reserves and amend a standstill agreement with its US partner Reynolds American.However, there are ways round both issues and analysts would not be surprised if the company were already working on a solution.In the wider market, leading shares moved higher in low volume. The FTSE 100 came to rest 11.9 points, or 0.2 per cent, higher at 6,239.9, as strength in tobacco, aerospace and media stocks offset weakness in oils and utilities.Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 fell 13.9 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 11,104 - the first time it has underperformed the FTSE 100 since last Wednesday.Market turnover was poor, with less than 2.5bn shares changing hands. Traders said there was an increasingly jittery feel to the market, with institutions buying downside protection as the yield on the 10-year gilt rose above 5 per cent for the first time since late 2004.On a brighter note, British Airways climbed 2.7 per cent to 542p on relief that a 48-hour strike by cabin crew members of its largest union had been averted.In the media sector, WPP rose 0.8 per cent to 742½p after Merrill Lynch reiterated its “buy” rating and 810p target price. Merrill believes advertising agencies like WPP provide the best hedge against media fragmentation.Meanwhile, Yell Group, publisher of the Yellow Pages, added 1.5 per cent to 608p after a push from the same broker.“Yell is one of the few stocks in the media sector that offers good double-digit earnings growth, with a high degree of visibility, yet trades on a sub-sector valuation,” Merrill said.On the downside, the miserable recent run of Drax Group continued, with shares in the operator of Europe’s biggest coal-fired power station falling a further 3.4 per cent to a three-year low of 675½p.Traders pinned the fall on wholesale gas prices, which for February delivery were trading at 24.85p-a-therm yesterday. According to analysts that means gas-fired power stations can produce electricity more cheaply than stations fuelled by coal.However, further downside in the Drax share price looks limited. At 650p its prospective dividend yield would be over 8.4 per cent and that should provide a powerful support.Sugar producer Tate & Lyle remained in the doldrums. Its shares, which fell sharply last week after a surprise profits warning, shed 2.1 per cent to 582½p after the EU called for 2m tonnes of the European sugar quota to be withdrawn.SABMiller slipped 1.1 per cent to £11.70 after Goldman Sachs removed the brewing giant from its “buy” list, citing valuation. SAB shares have risen 15 per cent in the past six months.J Sainsbury faded 1.1 per cent to 432½p as one shareholder took advantage of the supermarket group’s recent strong run to place 13m shares through Morgan Stanley at 432p each.Away from the blue chips, engineering group FKI rose 5.1 per cent to 113¾p after being tipped in Barron’s.Pub company Mitchells & Butlers improved 1 per cent to 686½p as traders reacted to Friday’s after hours news that financier Robert Tchenguiz had increased his holding to nearly 15 per cent.One theory doing the rounds yesterday was that Mr Tchenguiz could use his holding to pressure the company into creating a Real Estate Investment Trust (Reit) for its property assets. These are currently valued at £5.5bn, or 746p-a-share.M&B was also buoyed by expectations that Thursday’s trading update would impress. Gyrus dipped 1.4 per cent to 403¾p despite UBS starting coverage with a “buy” rating.

185;MO;Altria Group;2007-01-28T23:53:02Z;Altria to breathe more easily without Kraft;;"Altria Group will this week end a 20-year era marked by tobacco litigation –
and an unusual conglomerate-like structure – with the spin-off of Kraft Foods from its core Philip Morris business.The move, to be announced on Wednesday, is the first step of a broader strategy likely to include the separation of Altria’s international tobacco business from its US operations.Altria’s market valuation is more than $180bn.Its break-up comes as other diversified groups are pursuing similar strategies in response to investor disaffection with sprawling conglomerates.In the next few months, Tyco will try to move beyond its scandal-ridden recent history by splitting into its three main divisions. Cedant, the real estate-to-travel agency group broke itself up last year.Even General Electric, one of the most successful conglomerates, has embarked on a spree of acquisitions and divestitures to refocus on higher margin industries.Altria acquired Kraft in 1988 for $13.1bn cash. Its separation is a sign that the cloud of litigation that has hung over Altria and other US tobacco companies for decades is dissipating.Louis Camilleri, chief executive, first signalled his intention to restructure the company into two or three separate entities in November 2004. But he said it was contingent on improvements in the litigation environment.Moving ahead before at least three outstanding litigation issues were resolved could have exposed the company to charges of “fraudulent conveyance” or disposing of assets to protect them from being used to pay damages.Last year Philip Morris USA, Altria’s domestic arm, won several big legal victories, setting the stage for the break-up.Altria, which also has a 28.7 per cent stake in SABMiller, the London-based brewer, will release details of what will be one of the largest tax-free corporate spin-offs on the day it reports fourth-quarter earnings.David Adelman, analyst at Morgan Stanley, told clients he expected a “plain vanilla” spin-off.Altria is likely to spin its 88.6 per cent stake in Kraft by giving its shareholders 1.46bn Kraft shares. Shareholders would receive about 0.69 of a Kraft share for every share of Altria they own.Mr Adelman expects a spin-off record date some time after March 15 – the approximate record date for Altria’s first quarter dividend – with a distribution date in April.The break-up is expected to unlock value in the tobacco operations as Altria has traded at a discount to the sum of its parts.When Mr Camilleri announced his plans two year ago, he said the group’s conglomerate structure left its tobacco businesses undervalued.On Friday, Altria’s shares closed at about $88. Some analysts put the break-up value of the company closer to $100 a share.With the Kraft spin-off out of the way, Altria is expected to pursue acquisitions, both in the US and overseas. In the domestic market, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes may make a strategic acquisition in the high-margin smokeless arena.Philip Morris International, the company’s growth engine, is also expected to participate in the consolidation of the global tobacco industry.“Given past statements about longer-term acquisition opportunities in the US and elsewhere, we believe Altria ex-Kraft is well positioned to be a buyer of other tobacco assets, notably UST at home and Imperial abroad,” Marc Greenberg, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a report.An independent Kraft will also be able to pursue large stock-based acquisitions, something it cannot do now because Altria must maintain at least an 80 per cent stake in the company in order to arrange a tax-free spin-off."

buyers.Stronger-than-expected job creation in December sent stocks lower on Friday and tipped them into negative territory for the week. Equity investors began the year optimistic that a Federal Reserve rate cut before June would offset slower earnings growth.“A rate cut is looking less likely in the first half of this year,” said Gerald Lucas, senior investment adviser at Deutsche Bank. “The most important factor for the equity market this year will be evidence of inflation moderating and trending lower as it will give the Fed the flexibility to cut rates should the economy slow further.”The S&P 500 settled down 0.6 per cent at 1,409.71 on Friday, a fall of 0.6 per cent this week. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent lower at 2,434.25, but was 0.8 per cent higher for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had slipped 0.7 per cent to 12,398.01, a fall of 0.5 per cent this week, and was down from a new record high of 12,580.35 on Wednesday.Although a $6 plunge in the price of oil this week should help allay fears of inflation, energy stocks were hit hard and the S&P 500 energy index slid 4.8 per cent for the week. But the S&P information technology sector was 1.5 per cent firmer.Among technology stocks that fared well was BMC Software, rising 8.4 per cent to $34.92, while Yahoo, which declined 35 per cent last year, rose 8.6 per cent to $27.74. Another laggard from 2006 was Intel, but the stock rose 4.2 per cent to $21.10 this week and was the best stock in the Dow.Cisco shares rallied 4.2 per cent to $28.47 after the company announced that it had bought e-mail security company IronPort Systems for $830m.“Technology has a higher weighting in our portfolios than was the case a year ago,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at RiverSource Investments.He said large software companies were also attractive “as they are very good cashflow generators and trade at cheap multiples”.Not all tech shares rose. Motorola plunged 7.9 per cent to $18.94 for the week after the mobile phone maker said lower sales would reduce fourth quarter earnings below estimates.AT&T led the Dow lower this week, falling 5 per cent to $33.96. Another Dow laggard was Exxon Mobil, as its shares fell 4.4 per cent to $73.24 on plunging oil prices. Chevron slid 4.1 per cent
to $70.55. ConocoPhillips slumped 6.3 per cent to $67.42 after the oil producer lowered refining and marketing margins for the fourth quarter.Wal-Mart rose 2.6 per cent to $47.39 as its same-store sales were better than expected, making it the second best performing stock in the Dow.Goodyear Tire & Rubber shares jumped 10.9 per cent to $23.28 after an upgrade to “buy” from Deutsche. Workers ended a three-month strike against the company’s plans to cut costs.Constellation Brands slumped 15.9 per cent to $24.41 and led losses in
the S&P as the beverage maker’s quarterly profits missed estimates and it lowered guidance for this year.Shares in Home Depot slid 0.8 per cent to $39.79, although they did trade up at $41.84 after the home improvement chain said that Bob Nardelli, chairman and chief executive officer, had departed.Citigroup noted that while the change at the top “may be viewed as a near-term positive” any “potential disruption at Home Depot could provide Lowes with a unique opportunity to gain market share”.The bank rates the home improvement chain as one of its top picks for 2007, and Lowes rose 2.1 per cent to $31.79 this week.Home builders were weaker after Lennar said it expected a loss in the fourth quarter and its shares fell 5.3 per cent to $49.66. KB Homes slid 5 per cent to $48.72.Altria Group set a series of 52-week highs this week on expectations of solid fourth quarter earnings this month. The stock rose as high as $87.94, and gained 1.5 per cent over the week to $87.15.Monsanto posted a sharp rise in first quarter 2007 net income, but said full-year results would fall shy of analysts’ forecasts.

Uncertainty over the economy and interest rate policy has buffeted sentiment for stocks, outside of technology, in the first week of trading this year.“Stocks don’t seem to have the robust feel they showed during the fourth quarter,” said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos. He expects equity volatility to continue rising as the debate over the economy and Federal Reserve policy plays out.The S&P 500 settled 0.1 per cent, or 1.74 points, firmer at 1,418.34. Of the 10 major index groups in the S&P, information technology led gains, with a rise of 1.8 per cent, while energy fell 1.9 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent, or 6.17 points, to 12,480.69.The Nasdaq Composite closed 1.3 per cent, or 30.27 points, higher at 2,453.43.

QualComm gained 4.5 per cent to $39.15, while broker upgrades helped boost Amgen 4.3 per cent to $71.33.Cisco shares reversed an early decline to trade 2.6 per cent higher at $28.46 after the company announced that it had purchased e-mail security company IronPort Systems for $830m.The 9 per cent slide in oil prices this week kept the energy sector under pressure, with Exxon Mobil down 1.9 per cent at $72.72 and Chevron off 1 per cent at $70.28.But the big news in the sector was from ConocoPhillips. Its shares slipped
3.1 per cent to $66.07 after the oil producer lowered refining and marketing margins for the fourth quarter.On the up was Altria Group, which set a 52-week high for the second consecutive day on expectations of solid fourth-quarter earnings this month.The stock rose as high as $87.87, before closing $87.65, up 1.3 per cent.In earnings news, Monsanto posted fiscal first quarter 2007 net income of
16 cents a share, beating a forecast of 10 cents.But shares in the seed company fell 1.7 per cent to $50.79 as it said full-year results would fall shy of analysts’ forecasts.Choppy trading infused the retail sector as same-store sales for December were a mixed bag.According to Thomson Financial, 22 companies beat estimates, while 24 missed their forecast sales last month. Wal-Mart rose 0.5 per cent to $47.78 as it confirmed that sales rose 1.6 per cent last month. Shares in Costco rose 2.3 per cent to $54.07 as it beat sales estimates.

188;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Vice beats virtue in the battle for high returns;;"Bugs Bunny would occasionally have an angel sitting on one shoulder and a devil on the other. Each one would be pulling on his ear, telling him what to do in critical situations. Vice versus virtue. Virtue versus vice. Those two opposing poles distract us at every major decision point during out lives.This year Vice is the winner. The Vice Fund, run by Charles Norton, is up 20 per cent so far this year, while the Ave Maria Catholic Values Fund is up 14 per cent. While keeping pace with the market - no small feat - Vice has clearly pulled ahead thanks to stalwart companies like Las Vegas Sands (up 131 per cent) and cigarette company Reynolds (up 40 per cent). I had a chance to sit down with Norton and dig a little further on how Charles, a self-described family man, finds value in vice.Define “vice”?The Vice Fund (VICEX) is really an alternative sector strategy that focuses on the alcohol, tobacco, gaming and defense industries, and we do so because we believe they offer true investment merit. By the way, many of the most widely held and well-known mutual fund families own shares in companies engaged in the alcohol, tobacco, gaming or defense businesses – Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest holders of Anheuser-Busch. We just happen to focus exclusively on these four sectors.Why is that an investment theme?The ideology is simple: people around the globe have been drinking, smoking, gambling for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Wars have been around since the earliest, hunter-gatherer societies. Few industry groups have a history that dates back that far. And no matter what is happening in the world economy, people will continue to drink, smoke, gamble and nations will need to defend themselves. As a result, in general these companies tend to be steady performers in good times and bad – they are mostly insulated from economic slowdowns.Besides the unvarying demand for their goods and services, there are other investment merits in the companies within these sectors. These businesses have high barriers to entry, and, in general, these companies are highly profitable with deep management teams. With regard to tobacco and alcohol specifically, the products are never made obsolete by a newer technology. And these businesses are global in nature; we have roughly 23 per cent of our portfolio invested in foreign companies that trade in the U.S. via ADR, and many of the domestic firms we have a stake in operate internationally.Do you think the Vice Fund presents a more attractive opportunity than funds like Ave MariaVirtues Fund?We do not perceive them as our competitors. It’s a gray area. I should point out that many of the companies we own in the Vice Fund are stand-up corporate citizens.What are some of your current holdings and why are they cheap?Our top holding right now is Altria Group. The stock is trading at a significant, 20-plus percent discount to the global consumer staples industry despite in-line earnings growth prospects. I believe there are three issues that have depressed MO’s valuation: litigation risk; its current corporate structure; and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the break-up of the food and tobacco businesses. All of those issues are now largely removed, but the valuation still doesn’t reflect that. On the litigation front, the industry has enjoyed a huge streak of defense verdicts. Today, the U.S. tobacco industry has a legal risk profile comparable to other large-scale industries. The timing of Altria spinning off Kraft is now certain – it will be announced on January 31 and will likely be effective in the first quarter. As the restructuring approaches, I believe the stock move towards its sum-of-parts valuation, which is conservatively $100, or around 20 per cent higher than current levels.Las Vegas Sands has been a core holding of ours for well over a year, and it’s been a huge winner for our shareholders. The stock isn’t cheap, but the growth potential here is off the charts. In 2004, Las Vegas Sands opened the first casino in Macao after the long-time monopoly was liberalized in 2001. Macao is just exploding – this year, only two short years after the first non-monopoly casino opened, total Macao gaming revenue is going to surpass the Vegas Strip. The company recently expanded the Sands Macao and is developing the Cotai Strip. As a result, Las Vegas Sands will benefit tremendously as Macao goes from largely a VIP market to a mass market, and convention business booms. Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore ended a 40-year casino ban last year and Las Vegas Sands will open the first casino there 2009. And Japan and Thailand are also studying whether to allow casino gaming; Las Vegas Sands has already been in talks with Japanese officials. Today, roughly 60 per cent of Las Vegas Sands’ revenue and EBITDAR comes from Macao. All told, in the coming years, around 90 per cent of revenue and EBITDAR will come from Asia.On the alcoholic beverages side, our largest holding is Diageo, the leading premium spirits business in the world by volume, by net sales and by operating profit; it also manages 9 of the world’s top 20 spirits brands. North America is experiencing the fastest growth in spirits volume in the world, as consumers are choosing spirits (and wine) over beer. The market leader in the fast-growing U.S. spirits market is Diageo, with about a quarter of the market. The company is a key supplier of liquor to Wal-Mart, which is aiming to aggressively boost its liquor sales, and it’s buying back stock hand over fist.What’s your outlook for the US economy over the next year and how do you think the Vice Fund will behave in various economic climates?The alcohol, tobacco, gaming, and defense sectors, in aggregate, are defensive in nature and tend to outperform the broad market in periods characterized by relatively low returns and periods with relative stagnancy, or worse, in the U.S. economy. Ironically, the Vice Fund was launched in August 2002 and has only operated in an economic expansion. It would logically seem that a defensive fund like the Vice Fund would lag the market in that environment, but in fact the Vice Fund has outperformed the S&P 500 – and is in the top decile of all multi-cap core funds – over every time period, according to Lipper.But the fact is, when the economy contracts these sectors truly shine. And that is the precise environment we seem to be entering.The economy is slowing rather dramatically, led by a sharp contraction in the housing market, and the yield curve’s steep inversion suggests a recession cannot be entirely ruled out. The Fed Chairman himself has said that the time lag from when a policy action is taken and when it’s fully felt could be as long as 18 months; there have been 9 interest rate hikes in the past 18 months that might not have made their way through the system, so further slowing is a real possibility. And, of course, geopolitical tensions are high: conflicts in the Middle East, North Korea’s missile tests, and Iran’s nuclear arms intentions.We think that with time and the changing economic environment, the Vice Fund will perform strongly in all seasons.Do you use all the products you invest in?I’m a family man. My wife and I live in the Dallas suburbs with our three-year-old and infant daughters. I don’t smoke, rarely gamble, and drink only on occasion. We are not making a political statement or advocating these activities in any way. Our job is to analyze the fundamentals of these businesses. We are very serious investors and we take a very methodical, analytical approach in investing in these sectors."
189;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:51:47+0000;JT agrees to buy Gallaher for £7.5bn;;"Japan Tobacco has agreed to buy Gallaher for £7.5bn ($14.6bn) in a move that marks the biggest Japanese acquisition overseas and which is expected to spark sector consolidation.At £11.40 a share, the offer price represents a 16 per cent premium to the 979p share price the day before Gallaher announced it had received a bid approach on December 6.Shares in Gallaher closed at £11.55 on Thursday, giving the UK tobacco group a market capitalisation of £7.58bn, after it said it was in formal talks with a bidder. The higher price suggested the market was hoping for a higher offer or a counter-bid.However, Japan Tobacco said that Gallaher’s board had accepted its offer.Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, is to help finance the acquisition via a loan. Gallaher has agreed to pay Japan Tobacco a break fee of £52m if it goes on to accept a higher offer.Other potential bidders are thought to include Altria of the US, Spain’s Altadis and BAT of the UK. But most analysts think no such deal is likely. Altadis is thought too small to buy Gallaher while Altria’s Philip Morris would run into competition problems in Sweden, Austria and Germany. BAT has said it thinks tobacco companies are too highly priced for takeovers.Japan’s leading companies have been scouring the globe for acquisitions this year, flush with cash amid the country’s most prolonged economic recovery since the end of the second world war.Toshiba bought Westinghouse, the US nuclear power plant manufacturer, for $5.4bn; Softbank acquired Vodafone’s Japanese operations for Y1,800bn; and Nippon Sheet Glass bought the UK’s Pilkington for $4.2bn.Japan Tobacco shares closed 3.1 per cent higher at Y597,000 in Tokyo. The stock has surged nearly 15 per cent since it emerged that the company was considering a bid for Gallaher.The acquisition is the biggest deal in the European tobacco industry and will give Japan Tobacco the biggest market share in terms of volume in Russia, Europe’s largest cigarette market.Japan Tobacco, which is 50 per cent owned by the Japanese government, controls about 70 per cent of the Japanese tobacco market. The group owns the Camel and Winston brands outside the US and generates most of its income overseas.Gallaher has been struggling with a long-term decline in cigarette volumes in western Europe. Its four core markets of the UK, Ireland, Sweden and Austria account for about 70 per cent of group profits.The company has also suffered from price wars as well as from higher taxes and from smoking bans in several countries. In the UK, the company has been trying to protect its share of premium sales while increasing its share of the low-price market.Analysts had speculated that Philip Morris International or BAT could both make a rival offer because neither would face competition issues.Founded in 1857 by Tom Gallaher in Londonderry in Northern Ireland, Gallaher became a public company in 1928. It was acquired by American Brands in 1968 but was subsequently demerged in 1997. In 2000, it acquired Russian cigarette maker Liggett-Ducat and in the following year bought Austria Tabak.In addition to Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut, Gallaher’s brands include Mayfair, Old Holborn, and Hamlet.The shares rose 3p to 1158p on Friday.Satoru Aoyama, analyst at Fitch, said: “Japanese companies have been shifting from restructuring mode to growth mode, and since the domestic market is mature in most industries, they are looking abroad to boost their top-line growth.”"
190;MO;Altria Group;2006-12-07T20:04:57Z;Tobacco consolidation;;It is a sector that has beaten global equities in each of the past 10 years bar one (1999), and by 277 per cent since 1996 in dollar terms. Yet demand is stagnant and shifting to low-margin developing markets. Its products face bans and punitive taxes and its companies litigation. Tobacco is an unlikely success story. Japan Tobacco’s approach to Gallaher may spark wider consolidation aimed at kickstarting further performance.It is easy to see why deals are on the agenda. Although 12-month forward earnings estimates continue to tick up – by 9 per cent so far in 2006, according to FTSE – the four engines of performance are running out of steam. First, most companies have by now adopted the consumer goods strategy of promoting core brands. Second, bolt-on acquisitions of inefficient businesses are now hard to find and no longer big enough to move the needle. Third, litigation risk has already, as Philip Morris put it recently, “substantially improved”. Fourth, more generous cash payouts – JT excepted – are now reflected in a forward price/earnings ratio, which at 15 times, exceeds the market’s for the first time in a decade.Is consolidation really the answer? The last big deals, aimed at gaining brands and geographic reach, were in 1999, when British American Tobacco bought Rothmans International and JT bought RJ Reynolds International. Recent efforts have been bolt-ons but highly synergistic ones. Imperial Tobacco’s 2002 purchase of Reemtsma generated savings worth 40 per cent of the target’s enterprise value. Global tobacco’s balance sheet is in good nick. Excluding Altria, owner of Philip Morris, net debt is just 11 per cent of market capitalisation. Once Altria spins off Kraft Foods next year, it will have only $2bn of net debt.The small companies will be bought. Gallaher might attract rival interest from BAT. While JT is busy, Imperial could finally tackle Spain’s Altadis. The big risk is that a decade of discipline is blown on deals at decade-high valuations. BAT’s management have expressed this fear. And JT’s then chief executive said valuations were “very expensive” – way back in August 2005.
191;MO;Altria Group;2006-12-07T12:49:21Z;Gallaher shares light up;;Today the markets get their first chance to assess Gallaher’s statement that it has received a takeover approach. That announcement came late yesterday, just as most of the UK Companies desk was walking out to a pub quiz.The poor souls who stayed behind or filed from the restaurants will take the story on today, with the focus so far being on the 20 per cent rise in Gallaher’s share price. The approach has come from Japan Tobacco, which owns the Camel and Winston brands outside the US. However, stand by for others – perhaps Altria (Philip Morris) or BAT – to have a go as well. We’ll tell you with whom Gallaher, owner of Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut, would fit (with JT, they would be a powerful force in the former Soviet bloc).Elsewhere, Caffe Nero is being bought by its management and its two leading shareholders for £225m. The independent directors are recommending this 270p offer even though in September they received a higher proposal at 300p from a trade bidder. The higher proposal was conditional on due diligence and on Caffe Nero’s two largest shareholders backing it (they have 43 per cent) but they didn’t want to sell.Premier Oil shares are down sharply after the company said talks with potential bidders were off.A drop in annual profits at First Choice looks a bit better than expected. However, the real story may lie in any update we get on the sale of their mainstream package holidays business (to MyTravel or Thomas Cook, probably) or in what they say about the new air passenger duties announced in the PBR yesterday.Rank confirmed our story about the sale of the Hard Rock Cafe chain for $965m (£490m) to a company set up by Florida’s Seminole Native American Indians. The company will return £350m to shareholders. It also unveiled a decline in bingo revenues and the appointment of a new chairman (Peter Johnson, chairman of Inchcape).Rumours of the Day: Two old favourites: Barclays (up 4 per cent) and SSL (up 5 per cent) are both being lifted on takeover rumours.Make or read a commentSee previous blogs
192;MO;Altria Group;2006-12-07T00:45:51Z;Japan Tobacco in talks with Gallaher;;Japan Tobacco, the world’s third-biggest tobacco company, has made a takeover approach for Gallaher, the UK group that owns the Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut brands.The approach is expected to trigger a counterbid for Gallaher, which has a market value of £6.4bn ($12.6bn).Philip Morris is the most likely suitor. BAT and Imperial Tobacco might also be interested but they would face heavy competition issues.People familiar with the situation said on Wednesday night the talks were at a preliminary stage. The two companies have had one discussion.Gallaher has been the subject of persistent takeover speculation in recent weeks. The UK company’s shares have risen strongly over the past two months, gaining 13 per cent to close on Wednesday at 979p.On Thursday, shares of Japan Tobacco surged 5.5 per cent to Y533,000 in midday trading in Tokyo.Gallaher said on Wednesday night it had received an approach but declined to name the company involved. It said there was no certainty an offer would be made.Japan Tobacco, which also owns food and pharmaceutical businesses, controls about 70 per cent of the Japanese tobacco market. A former state-owned monopoly, it sells the Camel and Winston brands outside the US. Japan Tobacco’s international tobacco business is stronger than its domestic operations.International sales rose 12.2 per cent in the six months to the end of September, helped by the growth of Camel in Italy and France, and Winston in Russia, Italy and Spain. Domestic sales fell 8.3 per cent, partly due to higher retail prices.Gallaher, by comparison, has been struggling with a long-term decline in cigarette volumes in western Europe. Its four core markets of the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden and Austria account for about 70 per cent of group profits.It has also been suffering from price wars, especially in Spain, as well as from higher taxes and from smoking bans in several countries. Gallaher has estimated that a UK smoking ban in pubs would lead to a 4-5 per cent decline in smoking volumes.Sales have been stronger in the Commonwealth of Independent States, which includes Russia and Ukraine, but these markets are relatively small for Gallaher.In September, Gallaher reported a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 of £259m, helped by a £23m drop in restructuring costs year-on-year.
193;MO;Altria Group;2006-12-04T23:45:31Z;Jakarta tax to hit cigarette maker;;"Gudang Garam, Indonesia’s leading cigarette manufacturer, is likely to be the biggest casualty of the government’s decision to increase minimum prices next March, analysts said on Monday.Beneficiaries are expected to be HM Sampoerna, the number two producer bought by Philip Morris last year for $5.2bn, and, to a lesser extent, Bentoel and privately-owned Djarum.From next March minimum cigarette prices will increase by 7 per cent and an additional graduated charge will be levied on each cigarette. The rise is to ensure that tax revenue from the tobacco industry meets the 2007 budget target, which is increasing 9 per cent from this year to Rp42,030bn ($4.6bn), the finance ministry said.The graduated charge will be Rp7 per cigarette for companies that produce more than 2bn cigarettes a year; Rp5 for between 500m and 2bn cigarettes; and Rp3 for fewer than 500m.Gudang Garam’s market share has been falling for a decade and analysts say there is no end in sight to the slide. Its share fell to 25.9 per cent in the first half of 2006, according to sales figures from AC Nielsen.Sampoerna, which overtook Djarum last year, saw its share rise to 23.5 per cent from January to June.Cigarette producers said on Monday that they were still assessing the likely impact on business.“It will put more pressure on the cigarette industry but we are still calculating how big the impact will be on Bentoel,” said Christianto Tedjo, finance director of Bentoel, one of the five largest manufacturers.Nick Cashmore, an analyst at CLSA in Jakarta, said the producers could not claim the hike was unexpected.“The government is just clamping down on a health issue,” he said. “They

194;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Tobacco regulation high on Congress’ agenda;;"When the newly elected Democratic Congress convenes next year it is likely to take up a controversial issue: proposed federal regulation of tobacco products, including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Lawmakers will also have to grapple with the increasing number of tobacco-free nicotine-based products.In 2000 the Supreme Court ruled that the Food and Drug Administration did not have the authority to regulate tobacco as a drug and made clear that Congress would have to change the law if it wanted the agency to supervise cigarettes. Two years ago, the Senate twice approved a bipartisan bill giving the FDA power to regulate, but not ban, cigarettes and tobacco products. But the legislation failed in the House of Representatives.With Democrats in control of both houses from January, many in the political and public health arenas see a renewed opportunity.Senator Edward Kennedy, an advocate of FDA regulation, outlined his priorities for the 110th Congress earlier this month: “Empowering the FDA to regulate tobacco products is long overdue …Enacting this important public health legislation should be a top priority for the new Congress.”Matthew Barry, director of policy research for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said: “We are more optimistic [about regulation] given that the last real effort was blocked by the House Republican leadership and with that change now, there appears to be a more conducive environment.”Many proponents of federal oversight, including Altria Group’s Philip Morris USA, the world’s largest cigarette-maker and the only big tobacco company to support FDA regulation, believe any regulatory framework should include smokeless products. Regulation advocates say government oversight would allow companies to start making explicit health claims for their products and hold them accountable to an agency that would verify claims of fewer toxins or less harm. It would also create a scientific gatekeeper to monitor new products.One such product, Blue Whale, is made from a blend of tea leaves and a nicotine additive called NicoDip: it is not made with tobacco, but it does contain nicotine.Launched in September in Texas and Nebraska, Blue Whale is touted as a “smokeless alternative” with the “look, feel, taste, and smell of premium smokeless to-bacco without the 28 cancer causing agents found in tobacco leaves”.Blue Whale sits in the grey area between FDA jurisdiction – the agency regulates smoking cessation aids that contain nicotine but not tobacco products – and regulations that would tax it as a tobacco product.“This is certainly an area or a type of product that is needed in terms of the need to help people who chew tobacco because there isn’t anything on the market that is approved by the FDA,” said Mr Barry. “But where I take issue is that whether or not it contains tobacco is not an issue – the fact that it contains nicotine very much puts it under the jurisdiction of the FDA.”Bill Whalen, chief executive of Blue Whale Worldwide, said the company had been in discussions with the FDA about how to market the product. “Our goal is to be transparent from the jump,” he said. “It is really important to me that we are doing the right thing; not to do harm but to do good.”Jeff Stier, associate director of the American Council on Science and Health, said he “applauds” new efforts to help people quit smoking. But, he added: “I would be cautious that we need to go about it in a scientific manner and evaluate scientific data.”The rise in the number of nicotine alternatives comes as more public places go smoke-free and some consumers look for “safer” substitutes. “There is a nicotine war between different products and companies,” said Scott Ballin, a tobacco and health policy consultant. “It all begs the need for a level playing field with regulation so that the consumer can understand the risk and relative risk of the products and what they do and don’t do, and you can’t do that if companies are all playing by a different set of rules.”"
195;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Cigarettes and alcohol;;Emerging markets, the last bastion of growth for purveyors of cigarettes and alcohol, are cracking down on bad habits. Thailand plans to ban alcohol ads from next month, while Indonesia is mulling higher taxes on cigarettes.This is a blow for profitability as well as vice. Cigarette manufacturers have assiduously sought to sell more in less health-conscious nations. Philip Morris last year paid $5.2bn for a cigarette manufacturer in Indonesia, a populous country where about 70 per cent of young men smoke. Similarly, brewers endeavour to cash in on countries where binge-drinking is on the rise: young Thais knock back an estimated 8.5 litres of alcohol each year. Others benefit too: tobacco is a big contributor to government revenues in Indonesia, while alcohol advertising helps fill the pockets of the media industry.Yet those who make money from the bad habits of others need not fret too much. Emerging markets typically exhibit fast economic growth and slow legislative processes. Industry lobbyists have clout, and could yet stymie the new proposals. Sin industries are generous sponsors and both Thailand and Indonesia, often in the news for the wrong reasons, need all the help they can get to woo tourist dollars. Thailand’s plans threaten to scotch next year’s Johnnie Walker Classic golf tournament in Phuket and the Bangkok Rock Festival. The government may well surmise there are less painful ways to beat the scourge of alcoholism.

198;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Scandal-tainted Tyco name to live on;;The scandal-tainted Tyco name will survive the company’s planned break-up, following the decision by Tyco Electronics, one of US conglomerate’s three main units, to retain the brand despite its association with recent corporate excesses.The surprising move comes after Tyco Electronics concluded that the value placed on the name by customers and employees was more powerful than the memory of Dennis Kozlowski, the former head of Tyco who has been convicted of looting the company.The decision - to be announced on Wednesday - runs counter to recent trends that have seen companies such as Phillip Morris and British Petroleum change names and logos, often at great expense, in an effort to refresh their image and break with the past.Tyco International, the group’s main division which sells fire and security systems, is also expected to retain its name after the conglomerate splits into three next year, leaving the healthcare business as the only one seeking a new name.Mr Kozlowski’s actions earned Tyco a place in the unholy trinity of companies that exemplified the US corporate scandals of the late 1990s alongside Enron and WolrdCom, at least in the eye of the press and the investing public.Tyco has tried to resist this perception, pointing out that, unlike the other two companies, the $40bn-a-year conglomerate stayed in business and made a fresh start under new management.The decision by Tyco Electronics, which has revenues of about $13bn a year from selling electronic components, to change its logo but not its name came after it asked an independent research company to canvass more than 10,000 employees and over 1,000 customers across the globe.“I joined Tyco Electronics in January and if you’d asked me then I would have said there was a high chance of a change in name,” said Tom Lynch, Tyco Electronics’ chief executive. “But employees and customers told us that the value of the brand was much more than any of the things that went on”.The company said the perception of a scandal-tainted company was predominantly a US one and that employees and customers in the rest of the world, which accounts for the majority of Tyco Electronics’ business, liked the brand.The move by Tyco’s new management, which conducted most of the brand analysis in-house, could also mark a swing in the balance of power on image matters away from outside consultants and towards corporate executives.However, brand experts said that, in general, companies with a troubled past should grasp the chance to start with a clean slate.“Brand awareness and customers’ liking of a name make a very small contribution to customers’ engagement and loyalty,” said Robert Passikoff , president of New York-based Brand Keys. “The name may be known but it is known for a reason”.By keeping the Tyco name on the electronics unit, the group has preserved the company’s connection with its roots. Tyco Laboratores was incorporated in 1962 and some of its earliest work was in electronics. For almost 30 years Tyco remained a relatively small unknown company in New Hampshire, until Mr Kozlowski became chief executive in 1992 and perhaps sullied the name forever.He and Mark Swartz, his chief financial officer, were convicted in 2005 for theft and fraudulent gains of more than $600m. They are serving at least eight years in prison and must pay about $240m in restitution.Known as “deal-a-day Dennis,” Mr Kozlowski grew Tyco from its roots and $2bn in sales in 1990 to a conglomerate with $36bn in 2002, when he was indicted by New York City prosecutors for fraud and theft.
199;MO;Altria Group;2006-11-10T12:00:32Z;The wages of sin can outperform more responsible investments;;"There are literally
hundreds of funds which follow socially responsible or green investment criteria. But what about funds which take the opposite view, specifically targeting the gambling, tobacco, alcohol and armament industries?Charles Norton, a straight-talking Texan, manages such a fund. It is aptly named the Vice Fund.The manager of this US mutual fund admits he does not fit the bill when it comes to being sinful or nefarious. He never smokes. He rarely drinks. And he moved home to Texas from New York City because he and his wife wanted to raise their two children in a more peaceful environment than the East Coast urban jungle offered.“People think the fund would be managed by some sort of cowboy who comes to work drunk, but I’m more of a conservative family man,” he says somewhat earnestly.For Norton, investing in “vice stocks” is simply about looking for the best return.Norton likes to invest in these four types of sinful stocks for no other reason than they are “very strong” performers. Why? They are all in recession-proof industries. Whether markets swing up or down, wars will be waged, gamblers will head to the tables and people will light up cigarettes and have a beer or a gin and tonic.Norton is not the only notable investor who subscribes to this theory. He points out that Ben Bernanke, before he was made chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that Altria, the cigarette maker, is the lone stock he has in his portfolio.Tobacco is the most popular sector within the portfolio. Altria is the biggest holding at 5.33 per cent. Other large ones include British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Diageo, Constellation Brands, MGM Mirage and Harrah’s Entertainment. Almost 70 per cent of the fund is invested in US stocks and about 22 per cent is in non-US ones. About 7 per cent of the fund remains in cash. Norton’s strategy is to take a “30,000-foot view” and look at trends and then conduct research to figure out which companies to invest in.What are his views? When it comes to alcohol, breweries with considerable exposure to the US market are not a particularly good pick as more Americans are electing to drink wine and spirits.“That trend would lead us to buy a Heineken or AmBev, which have more exposure to Europe and emerging markets,” Norton says. US tobacco stocks are a better bet largely because many companies have won lawsuits filed by smokers. And the future for gambling companies also looks rosy as the market for casinos is expected to open up in Asia. And last, defence stocks represent a particularly good deal given the amount of money dedicated by governments to funding wars. This year, defence stocks are set to outperform the Standard & Poor’s 500 for the sixth time in the past seven years, according to Norton.Norton took the reins of the Vice Fund, which is based in Dallas, in September last year. The fund now has $64m in assets and 54 holdings. For Europeans, the fund is only open to investors with accounts at certain US brokerages such as Fidelity and Ameritrade.During his short tenure, Norton has had no need to atone for performance as the fund has reported a 14.7 per cent return in the last 11 months, against an 11.7 per cent return by the index for all-cap growth mutual funds, according to Standard & Poor’s.The fact that prissier types might avoid putting money into his portfolio is only an advantage, says Norton. “These sectors are widely overlooked,” he says.Norton is careful to declare himself an agnostic when it comes to debating the merits of smoking, drinking, gambling or war. “We’re not advocating or promoting these businesses. And I wouldn’t want to tell any of our investors that smoking or drinking might be good for them.”"
200;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

The rise came as Altria lifted its guidance for its full-year earnings.Drugmaker ImClone rose 5.3 per cent, or $1.56, to $31.00 after it announced investor Carl Icahn as its new chairman and also reported an 85 per cent rise in its third quarter earnings.Shares in WellPoint were $2.09, or 2.66 per cent, lower at $76.53 after the health insurer said third quarter net income grew to $810.8m, up from $640.7m for the same quarter last year. The performance fell short of analyst estimates.
203;MO;Altria Group;2006-10-19T21:59:49Z;Altria delays earnings release;;Altria Group, parent of the Philip Morris tobacco companies and Kraft Foods, has postponed its earnings release by a day. The move surprised analysts and prompted speculation about the long-awaited spin-off of its Kraft stake and the possibility of a share buy-back announcement.Altria will report earnings next Wednesday – two days after Kraft discloses its results and a day later than previously expected. The earnings release and conference call now fall on the same day as a planned informal board meeting.In the past, Altria reported the morning after the Kraft afternoon earnings call the prior afternoon – a routine that has remained unchanged for years.“Altria does not do anything by accident,” David Adelman, analyst at Morgan Stanley, told clients. “The key question, therefore, is what does Altria want to review with its board of directors prior to releasing earnings and holding its quarterly conference call?”Mr Adelman said Altria would “most likely” remain “intentionally ambiguous regarding break-up timing but would both authorise and initiate a moderate ongoing share repurchase programme”.An announcement of the tax-free spin-off of its 88.1 per cent Kraft stake “although possible . . . is very unlikely” next Wednesday, he added. The company could, however, announce its “revised thinking regarding the likely timing of, and the precise remaining hurdles to, a corporate restructuring”.Last month Bill Ohlemeyer, Altria vice-president and associate general counsel, doused market speculation of an imminent Kraft spin-off after a US federal judge ruled that the Schwab case, involving the big cigarette makers and tens of millions of smokers of “light” cigarettes, could proceed to trial as a national class action.Investors are growing weary of waiting for Altria’s corporate restructuring into two or three standalone entities. The company signalled its intentions back in November 2004, but says it has been waiting for improvements in the litigation environment.In a report, Christine Farkas, analyst at Merill Lynch, said she does not expect Altria to announce the Kraft spinoff, but said it was possible “the board has since reconsidered the legal issues surrounding Schwab and is now prepared to be more aggressive”.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, took a bullish stance on the timing, saying the “most likely” reason for the earnings delay is that the board will announced the Kraft spinoff. “Although there could be other reasons, possibly an acquisition, we are maintaining out thesis that Altria’s board realises it must act now and spin off Kraft Foods since there is risk in waiting,” she said in a report.
204;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Investec: No interest in small change;;Change is important for a business. So, Mark Breedon, manager of Investec’s £200m (€135m) Global Free Enterprise Fund, looks to invest in companies undergoing some sort of metamorphosis.This can come in several forms. Mr Breedon has constructed a portfolio of businesses going through a variety of about-faces. Some have adopted new technology. Others are benefiting from deregulation and a few are seeing new customers as they cater their products to people of different ages.Mr Breedon and his analysts examine thousands of companies with market capitalisations of more than $1bn. This list is whittled down to 500 stocks, which are then judged by their quality and valuation. Stocks are screened each week, indices are not examined and no bets are placed on countries and sectors.The portfolio is quite concentrated at 20 stocks. Top holdings include stakes in Kbc, Japan Tobacco, JP Morgan Chase, Kraft, Metlife and Tempur Pedic.The portfolio remains underweight in oil and gas owing to the declining oil price. Mr Breedon’s philosophy is that you should not invest in a stock because the price of oil is rising. The fund is overweight in food producers as Mr Breedon thinks there are some interesting companies in the sector. The market for makers of high fructose corn syrup looks attractive in particular as the supply has become more limited.James Hand, a research analyst who works with Mr Breedon, says: “A lot of capacity previously used to produce corn syrup is now being put towards producing ethanol. The market is benefiting from a real structural change and some of these companies’ earnings are much higher than they have been in the past.”Another favourite pick is Tempur Pedic, the foam mattress maker, which has built a strong business developing material to shield astronauts while in space.Air France has proved another good stock – purchased because it was going through a period of consolidation following its merger with KLM. “When they were first put together, no one believed they would do an effective job in terms of getting the costs right. The market perception was quite negative, but they have delivered,” Mr Hand says. The presence of two hubs in France and Holland has also helped increase revenues and the airline group has hedged the oil price well.Mistakes in recent months include taking a stake in Altria, the tobacco group. Last quarter, the group’s shares suffered following a court ruling against it.“In the short-term, the stock has gone a bit askew,” says Mr Hand. “But the reason we bought Altria…is we think they are doing a good job of running their underlying business.”In the short-term, the fund’s results have been disappointing, but in the long-term they are better. In the past six months, the fund reported a loss of 6.81 per cent against a loss of 5.56 per cent by the benchmark for global growth unit trusts, according to Standard & Poor’s. In the last year, the fund reported a 15.3 per cent return and in the past three years 77.12 per cent.Total expense ratio: 1.68%Sector average: 1.62%Source: Lipper Fitzrovia
205;MO;Altria Group;2006-09-29T20:57:50Z;Wall Street lower after week-long rally;;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its highest level in more than six years on Friday after a week of strong advances for equities. The S&P 500 reached a five-and-a-half year high during the week.The main indices made their strongest gains early in the week, buoyed by bullish analyst sentiment, higher earnings forecasts and upbeat comments on the US economy and inflation from the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve.Tobacco stocks sank after a federal judge in New York granted class action status to smokers of light cigarettes. Altria, parent of Philip Morris, tumbled 7 per cent to $76.55 on the week, and the S&P Tobacco Index had its worst week in more than two years.The semiconductor sector had a mixed week. Shares in Broadcom gained 8.9 per cent to $30.34 after BMO Capital Markets raised its fourth-quarter and 2007 earnings forecasts for the company.Intel surged 7.9 per cent during the week to $20.57 – its best week since August 2003. On Tuesday, it said it would begin shipping microprocessors containing four cores in November. The chipmaker also won a legal victory with the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by rival Advanced Micro Devices.PMC-Sierra, however, lost 8.2 per cent to $5.94 after it lowered its revenue forecasts for the third quarter due to weak demand for communications chips.The slowdown in the
communications sector fed through to Ciena, maker of networking equipment for the telecommunications industry, which sank 9.3 per cent to $27.25.General Motors jumped
8.6 per cent over the week to $33.26, as GM’s chief executive Rick Wagoner met in Paris with Carlos Ghosn of Nissan and Renault to discuss a possible alliance. The stock was further boosted when Kirk Kerkorian said his Tracinda investment group, which already owns nearly 10 per cent of GM’s stock, might increase its holding by 10m shares.At the close on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent, or 39.38 points, for the day at 11,679.07, up 1.5 per cent on the week.The Dow reached its second-highest intra-day level on Friday, and also had its second highest close ever on Thursday. However, the blue-chip index was still about 70 points short of its all-time high.The S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent, or 3.30 points, for the day at 1,335.85, a gain for the week of 1.6 per cent. It too rose to a multi-year high on the week, at one stage reaching its highest level since February 2001.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent, or 11.59 points lower, for the day at 2,258.43, a 1.8 per cent rise for the week.Both the Dow and the S&P 500 had their best quarters since 2004, rising 4.7 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively. The Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks still gained over the quarter but by less, rising 4 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.The Dow and S&P 500 also outperformed the Nasdaq and Russell in the previous quarter.“It’s been an extremely strong quarter and it’s certainly been a surprisingly strong September,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach, who believes equities will advance at a slower pace in the final three months of the year. “I expect another positive quarter, but I don’t think it can be as strong as last quarter,” he said.Since the beginning of the year, the Dow has risen 9 per cent, followed closely by the Russell, which added 7.9 per cent. The S&P 500 has returned 7 per cent, while the Nasdaq remains a laggard, gaining 2.4 per cent.Heavy machinery makers made strong gains on the week. Caterpillar fuelled much of the Dow’s advances as it added 4.8 per cent to $65.80. Deere, which makes farm equipment, gained 8.1 per cent to $83.91 following bullish comments on the stock in investor magazine Barron’s.After falling for the past four weeks, crude oil closed higher this week. Oil services group Weatherford International added 8.6 per cent to $41.72, and Marathon Oil rose 8 per cent to $76.90.Ebay rose 8.6 per cent to $28.36 after Goldman Sachs raised its third-quarter revenue estimate on the stock. Ebay’s Paypal payments unit also reached a settlement with the attorneys general of 28 states to improve how it notifies users of their customer rights."
206;MO;Altria Group;2006-09-28T12:41:00Z;Wall St pares gains as crude rebounds;;Blue chip stocks were stymied in their attempt at a record close in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index on Wednesday after a rebound in crude oil prices.Oil rose 3 percent and settled near $63 a barrel amid expectations that the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries might slash output in order to defend prices that have significantly fallen in recent weeks.That left investors with the consolation of making the second best close in the Dow for the second day running.The blue chip benchmark settled up 0.17 per cent, or 19.85 points, at 11,689.24, after reaching a high of 11,720.77, within a gasp of its record close of 11,722.98 on January 14 2000. The S&P 500 was up 0.02 per cent at 1,336.59, while the Nasdaq was up 0.09 per cent, at 2,263.39.Earlier in the session, investors downplayed back-to-back monthly declines in durable goods and took some comfort from an increase in new home sales for August.The mix of data suggests that the US economy is in for a soft landing that tempers inflation and does not overly damage corporate profits. “The market clearly wants to hit the record, and yet it has been in a narrow range,’’ said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management.“The Fed is getting its way, growth is slowing down, and inflation will likely follow.’’A number of components in the Dow grabbed the spotlight. An antitrust lawsuit brought against Intel by competitor Advanced Micro Devices was largely dismissed by a federal judge on Tuesday. Shares in Intel were up by 2.15 per cent, while AMD was down 2.58 per cent. McDonald’s rose 1.95 per cent after saying it would boost its dividend 49 per cent.Altria Group Inc also recovered ground, up 2.02 per cent after falling 8 per cent in prior sessions. In auto news, the Wall Street Journal reported that General Motors was seeking a multi-billion-dollar payment from Nissan and Renault before it enters into any alliance with the two carmakers. Shares in GM were higher by 2.77 per cent. Conversely, shares in rival Ford were down 4.88 per cent while they were up 1.08 per cent for parts maker Visteon amid buyout talk.Merck rose 1.53 per cent after it was vindicated in a federal lawsuit regarding painkiller Vioxx in New Orleans.Shares in Red Hat Inc., fell 23.21 per cent after the company’s second quarter net income of $11 million missed expectations. Jabil Circuit., was up 3.84 per cent on better revenues, Level 3 Communications was off 3.66 per cent, Conexant shares jumped 3.65 per cent on a $100mn gain from its stake in Jazz Semiconductor Inc., Marvell rose 4.46 per cent and Amkor was off 7.93 per cent.
207;MO;Altria Group;2006-09-26T12:31:09Z;Wall Street rises on Fed comments;;The S&P 500 closed at its highest level in five years on Monday as investors took heart from comments by a Federal Reserve official that slowing economic growth would probably temper inflation.Apple Computer gained 3.8 per cent to $75.75 – its highest level since January – after ThinkEquity raised its price target on the stock from $90 to $100, saying the computer maker would benefit from the back-to-school season.Dell gained 3.4 per cent to $22.16 after it announced it would hire an additional 500 engineers to work in one of its facilities in Texas.Semiconductor stocks also made strong gains, buoying the Nasdaq. Broadcom rose 9 per cent to $30.36 after BMO Capital Markets raised its 2006 earnings estimate on the company, while Lam Research added 8.9 per cent to $45.04.Tobacco group Altria sank 6.4 per cent to $77.06, its worst day in more than two years, after a federal judge in New York approved a class-action suit from smokers of “light” cigarettes. Reynolds American, maker of Camel and Winston cigarettes, dropped 3.7 per cent to $59.75.Drugstore chain Walgreen’s shed 5.2 per cent to $44.47 in spite of reporting a 25 per cent increase in fourth quarter profit. After a gain of $7.3m from litigation was stripped out, earnings fell just short of analyst expectations. CVS tumbled 5.8 per cent to $31.10.Both stocks sank last week after Wal-Mart announced plans to sell generic prescription drugs at $4 for a 30-day supply.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent, or 11.59 points, at 1,326.37, its highest close since February 2001.The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4 per cent, or 30.14 points, at 2,249.07. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent, or 67.71 points, to 11,575.81.Stocks traded lower in the morning following a report that showed home prices registering their first year-on-year fall in 11 years. But the major indices bounced back in broad-based gains on comments by Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, that slowing economic growth should temper inflation.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, believes stocks will continue to push higher next week. “Earnings disappointments can still come up, but it’s hard for me to envision a whole lot of downside,” he said.Homebuilders surged on Mr Fisher’s comments. Pulte gained 4.3 per cent to $32.66 while DR Horton rose 3.8 per cent to $24.39.American Power Conversion, maker of surge protectors for computers, fell 2.4 per cent to $20.89 after it said it would cut an additional 330 jobs to bring its total layoffs to 7 per cent of its workforce.Archer Daniels Midland fell 2.2 per cent to $37.62 after Prudential cut its earnings estimate for the group due to falling ethanol prices.
208;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Judge allows suit on ‘light’ cigarettes;;A US federal judge on Monday dealt a blow to the tobacco industry when he ruled a case involving the big cigarette makers and tens of millions of smokers of “light” cigarettes could proceed to trial as a national class action.The Schwab claim – filed in 2004 under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (Rico) – alleges cigarette companies defrauded smokers into believing “light” cigarettes were safer than regular ones.The class includes anyone in the US who bought cigarettes that were labelled “light” or “lights” between 1971 and 2006.Lawyers are seeking as much as $200bn (£105bn) in damages, which would automatically be tripled under Rico.The ruling by US District Judge Jack Weinstein sent tobacco shares lower. Altria Group, parent of Philip Morris USA, closed down 6.39 per cent at $77.06, while Reynolds American, owner of R.J. Reynolds, ended the day down 3.66 per cent at $59.75.Altria said the ruling would delay plans to spin-off its 88.1 per cent stake in Kraft Foods.”Today’s decision inevitably delays any restructuring,” said William Ohlemeyer, Altria vice-president and associate general counsel.“The board is committed to the restructuring strategy because it makes good sense for the company and its investors. A prerequisite …has been clarity in the overall litigation environment . . . Today’s decision, however isolated it is, is not a step toward clarity, it is a step back of sorts.”Judge Weinstein denied the industry’s request for a pre-trial appeal of the class certification, which means Schwab will proceed to trial as a national “lights” class action claim. Jury selection is expected to begin in January.“This is a significant judgment,” said Michael Hausfeld, partner at Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, the firm representing the smokers. “It is another condemnation on the merits of the tobacco business practices over more than a quarter of a century, and a milestone with respect to the procedures for class action as it certifies the largest class in terms of period, number and potential damages.”PM USA and R.J. Reynolds said they would seek review of the class certification decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals – where the industry has a successful record of defending itself – and a stay of the trial court proceedings pending a decision by the appellate court.Last year the Second Circuit threw out the Simon II class action that Judge Weinstein certified on behalf of millions of US smokers claiming punitive damages against the industry.“We adamantly believe the 2nd Circuit Court will decertify the class given the past success the tobacco industry has experienced in this court,” said Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, in a report.
209;MO;Altria Group;2006-09-25T16:50:42Z;Market Overview: Equities, bonds in US rise;;"Oil prices seesawed on Monday, while equity and bond investors continued to ponder whether weakening US housing data would spark a hard or soft landing for the world’s largest economy.Both US stocks and Treasuries extended gains after Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said: “The recent tempering of US economic growth to a more sustainable rate . . . should act to lower the inflation rate over time.”A slowing economy was reinforced by news that median US house prices for existing homes fell 1.7 per cent year-on-year to $225,000 in August, the biggest fall since November 1990 and the second-biggest fall in the survey’s 38-year history.“The sentiment in the bond market is that when house prices go south, the overall economy will slow,’’ said Rick Klingman, head of Treasury trading at ABN Amro. The big question is whether the sliding housing market sparks “broad based weakness across the economy and that remains to be seen,’’ he said.US Treasury prices continued to rally, with yields on 10-year bonds falling to a seven-month low of 4.55 per cent, aided by the tone of the housing data and Mr Fisher’s comments.The housing data buffeted stocks, but they rebounded after Mr Fisher spoke.By the close of trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.6 per cent, with the S&P 500 up 0.9 per cent and the Nasdaq
Composite sporting a gain of 1.4 per cent.Tobacco stocks were noticeably weaker, with Altria Group, the owner of Philip Morris and Reynolds American, falling after a federal judge ruled that a lawsuit accusing tobacco companies of defrauding smokers into thinking light cigarettes were safer than regular brands was a class action.Crude oil erased early losses that pushed prices to a six-month low under $60 a barrel on Monday. Prices rebounded above $61 a barrel amid comments from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that the 11-member group was looking at the supply of crude after a 20 per cent fall in prices in the past six weeks.The early losses in oil prices pressured energy and natural resources stocks across the Atlantic where Statoil, Neste Oil and Norske Hydro, as well as miners such as BHP Billiton and Xstrata, were among the biggest fallers.Major continental markets just about managed to keep their heads above water, with Germany’s Xetra Dax firming up 0.3 per cent, as ongoing merger and acquisition activity supported prices.But oil-heavy markets were unable to shake off the sectoral weakness, with
London’s FTSE 100 slipping 0.4 per cent and Norway’s Oslo All Share tumbling
3.4 per cent. Earlier, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 had closed flat.Oil prices fell, aided by BP saying late on Friday that it would restore most of its shut-in output at the Prudhoe Bay oilfield in Alaska this week, and amid signs of reduced tension between Iran and the west.Interest rate expectations and demand for carry continued to drive the currency market, with the high-yielding New Zealand dollar rising 1.2 per cent to a seven-month high of $0.668 against its US counterpart.Sterling strengthened to £0.6708 against the euro, within a whisker of last week’s 15-month high, as Sir John Gieve, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said he considered voting for a second successive rate rise at the Bank’s September monetary policy committee meeting."
210;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;US judge to rule on ‘light’ cigarettes action;;"A US federal judge will on Monday rule on whether a tobacco lawsuit can proceed as a class action of tens of millions of smokers of “light” cigarettes. If certified, it could be the largest-ever class action case.The Schwab claim, filed in 2004 under the federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico), alleges big cigarette makers defrauded smokers into believing “light” cigarettes were safer than regular ones. Lawyers are seeking as much as $200bn in damages, which would automatically be tripled under Rico.Tobacco investors are closely watching the suit as it is one of the industry’s more important remaining legal risks. The ruling is key for Altria Group, parent of Philip Morris USA, as it is preparing to spin off its 88.1 per cent stake in Kraft Foods.Monday’s decision by District Judge Jack Weinstein will eliminate the legal uncertainty surrounding the case and provide Altria’s board with clarity on the legal environment.Some suspect it is waiting for the ruling before giving the spin-off the green light.Paul Gallagher, a partner with Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, the firm representing the smokers, said the Schwab case “has the best practical and legal opportunity to hold the cigarette industry worldwide accountable”.“At the same time the industry was denying cigarettes were bad for you, they were offering lights as an alternative to quitting,” he said.During recent oral argument, Judge Weinstein – who has in the past allowed large-scale aggregated tobacco claims to proceed to trial – focused his questions on whether there was a way to determine the number of smokers that would be in the class and how damages would be calculated.Judge Weinstein told the courtroom that without a satisfactory model for damages, even if he granted class certification, the claim could not go forward.Following the hearing, industry watchers said there was a low probability the class would be certified as the plaintiffs had failed to address the four-year statute of limitations or come up with a sound damages model.But Christine Farkas, analyst at Merrill Lynch, cautioned clients that given Judge Weinstein’s “past record in tobacco claims . . . we would not be completely surprised if he certified the Schwab class while requiring further work from the plaintiffs on the damages model.”In addition to Philip Morris USA, the defendants include RJ Reynolds; Brown & Williamson (part of Reynolds American); Lorillard; British American Tobacco; and Liggett."
211;MO;Altria Group;2006-09-22T12:41:53Z;Corporate name changes;;Name changes can work, as Saloth Sar, Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu and Robert LeRoy Parker discovered. For corporations, rebranding usually invites ridicule. The decision on Friday by the UK’s MFI to sell its retail DIY unit and rename the residual joinery business is a case in point. “Galiform” ticks all the right boxes: a first letter near the beginning of the alphabet, easy pronunciation, a hint of dynamic activity, and, critically, meaninglessness.At least Galiform has a decent excuse. Newly independent businesses need names. Occasionally their baptisms actually succeed. The City mocked BT Mobile’s transformation into mmO2 until it became a highly successful brand. Lucky timing meant that Accenture escaped the fall out that might otherwise have hit the former consulting arm of disgraced accounting giant Arthur Andersen.Other companies change names to muffle history. Keen to appear global, EDF, BP, and BAE Systems now avoid spelling out names which spell out their nationality. The uninitiated would never guess that Altria mainly sells Philip Morris cigarettes. Only a lone few corporations haul around their historical baggage proudly. The colonial-era operator of the world’s busiest canal still calls itself Suez. Aeroflot provided the spectacle of a company being floated with a Soviet hammer and sickle in its logo.Deals are the main explanation of name changes. The diplomatic alternative can get cumbersome, as Schoder Salomon Smith Barney and Vodafone Airtouch Mannesmann discovered. Still, mergers have supplied a spate of bland, classical or latinate names such as Verizon, Eon, Aviva, Corus, Diageo and Fortis. At least they have not sunk to the level of Dixons, an unglamorous UK electrical goods retailer, mysteriously renamed DSG International. That rechristening is something that even Pol Pot, Mother Teresa and Butch Cassidy would find hard to understand.
212;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Philip Morris faces key ruling on ‘lights’;;"Philip Morris USA, the cigarette maker owned by Altria Group, faces a key hearing on Wednesday in a case that seeks class-action status for all US smokers who bought “light” cigarettes.The Schwab case, filed in 2004, alleges the major US tobacco companies violated federal racketeering laws by falsely claiming “light” cigarettes were safer than regular ones. It is seeking damages in the tens of billions of dollars.Investors are closely watching the case as it is one of the industry’s more important remaining legal risks. Most analysts, however, do not believe the case will delay Altria’s plans to spin off its 88.1 per cent stake in Kraft Foods.“The lawsuit presents a risk principally because of its potential scale, and perhaps more importantly, because it is proceeding before Judge [Jack] Weinstein, who in the past – and in contrast to the overwhelming majority of other US judges – has allowed novel, large-scale aggregated tobacco claims to proceed,” said David Adelman, analyst at Morgan Stanley, in a report.Judge Weinstein, who crafted class settlements in litigation over asbestos and Agent Orange, will on Wednesday hear arguments on class certification; the statute of limitations; and the effect, if any, of US District Judge Gladys Kessler’s findings in the government’s civil racketeering case against the industry, Mr Adelman added.Because the Schwab case is being brought under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, there is a four-year statute of limitations. That means the plaintiffs’ lawyers have to show the class members were not aware “light” cigarettes were not safer than regular cigarettes until after 2000.The federal RICO statute also requires the plaintiffs’ attorney to prove “reliance” – that the class of smokers relied on the same false statements made by the cigarette companies when buying “light” cigarettes, and did so to their detriment.“Reliance and statute of limitations are excellent examples of why class actions cannot work in tobacco cases,” said William S. Ohlemeyer, Altria vice president and associate general counsel. “These issues can be resolved only by examining the particular and unique facts of each individual smoker – what they knew, when they knew it and how they made their decisions about smoking.”Judge Weinstein is not expected to rule on Wednesday on class certification but may give an indication of his likely decision. Even if the case is ultimately certified, the industry has the right to appeal against the decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit before the start of the trial."
213;MO;Altria Group;2006-08-18T21:12:06Z;Wall St in week-long rally led by tech;;The Nasdaq Composite index yesterday recorded its best weekly advance in three years, as the main indices were buoyed by a week-long rally that pushed the S&P 500 past the 1,300 level for the first time in more than three months.The technology-led rally was precipitated by weaker than expected readings on consumer and producer price inflation, which investors interpreted as signalling that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates in the short term.The Nasdaq’s gains would have been greater had it not been for bad news from Dell. On Friday, the computer maker reported a 51 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings, and announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission had been investigating it for the past year over accounting issues. The news dented some of the 8 per cent gain it had made on the week but, by the close, Dell was still up 5.2 per cent for the week at $22.16. The stock has dropped 26 per cent this year.Dell’s main rival, Hewlett-Packard, fared even better, climbing 7.5 per cent to $35.52 after it reported third-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ expectations.

214;MO;Altria Group;2006-08-18T20:24:35Z;Ruling clears way for plan to split Altria;;Shares of Altria Group, the parent of the Philip Morris tobacco companies, gained 4 per cent on Friday after a favourable legal ruling cleared the way for the tax-free spin-off of its Kraft Foods unit.Altria and Philip Morris USA, both defendants in the Justice Department’s civil racketeering case against the industry, late Thursday said they would seek a review of the complex ruling, which found the big US cigarette makers guilty of racketeering.However, the key element of Judge Gladys Kessler’s ruling was that she said she did not have the ability to award substantial financial penalties against the companies.Altria will therefore be encouraged to move forward with its plan to split into two or three separate entities.The judge did, however, order the companies to remove descriptions such as “light” or “ultra light” from cigarette packages and to publish statements concerning smoking and health issues, among other things.Christine Farkas, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the potential financial liability resulting from the DoJ case action had “acted as a major impediment” to Altria’s long-promised restructuring.With the spectre of substantial monetary damages removed, the question is: How soon will Altria announce the spin-off of its 88 per cent stake in Kraft?Analysts are divided on the timing. Citigroup’s Bonnie Herzog told clients she expects a press release to be issued during the board’s meeting on August 30, if not earlier.Judy Hong, of Goldman Sachs, said the “best-case scenario” for a spin-off announcement is “late” this year as the board may want to get a better understanding of what Judge Jack Weinstein is thinking in the Schwab case.He is expected to rule in the coming months on whether the case can move forward as a nationwide class-action for millions of light cigarette smokers.Oral arguments are scheduled for September 13.Altria’s shares rose 3.4 per cent to $83.46 in midday trade, while Kraft’s shares fell 0.67 per cent to $32.69.
215;MO;Altria Group;2006-08-18T00:12:14Z;Tobacco companies ‘deceived smokers’;;Altria Group, parent of the Philip Morris tobacco companies, moved closer to spinning off its Kraft Foods unit after a federal judge ruled it had lied about the consequences of smoking but decided against imposing significant financial penalties.In a 1,652 page opinion released on Thursday, Judge Gladys Kessler ruled the largest US cigarette companies violated anti-racketeering laws and ordered them to make corrective statements about the health effects and addictiveness of smoking. She also banned them from using terms describing cigarettes in ways that convey health claims.“Cigarette smoking causes disease, suffering, and death,” Judge Kessler said. “Despite internal recognition of this fact, defendants have publicly denied, distorted, and minimised the hazards of smoking for decades.”The judge stopped short of ordering the companies to fund a big anti-smoking campaign, as the government wanted.Analysts have said Altria was holding off on a Kraft spin-off because of uncertainties over the judge’s ruling and any remedies that might be imposed.The DoJ suit, which dates back to 1999, alleged that the tobacco industry violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by conspiring for decades to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking.“The defendants will now be referred to as adjudicated racketeers and that status will undermine their public relations campaign of portraying themselves as responsible corporate citizens,” said Ed Sweda, senior attorney for the Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University School of Law in Boston.The DoJ suit is considered the last major legal hurdle before the Altria board announces the beginning of the break-up of the company into two or three stand-alone entities. The board is due to hold its next regular meeting on August 30.“This is a home run for the tobacco industry, except for the part where they have to admit to the American people that they were lying for many years,” said Anthony Sebok, professor at Brooklyn Law School. “It’s a moral victory for the government, but not a decision with much financial consequence.”Both sides could now appeal to a US federal appeals court.
216;MO;Altria Group;2006-07-26T20:46:29Z;Smoke still hasn’t cleared in tobacco case;;"When the Florida Supreme Court this month upheld a decision to toss out a $145bn verdict against the big cigarette makers, the ruling put Altria Group, parent of the Philip Morris tobacco companies, squarely on the path to spinning off its Kraft Foods unit.But the Marlboro maker still has another key legal hurdle to clear: the Department of Justice’s civil racketeering case against the industry.This is one of three roadblocks identified by the company to splitting into two or three stand-alone entities.What started out with a bang – a sweeping $280bn racketeering trial that posed a grave threat to the industry – was reduced to a whimper last summer when the government drastically cut its proposed remedies to $14bn over 10 years.However, the high-profile case is still important for Altria.While the proposed remedies are seen as financially manageable for the company and industry, Altria’s board will only have clarity once Judge Gladys Kessler, who presided over the bench trial, releases her pending ruling.The DoJ suit, which dates back to 1999, alleged that the industry violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by conspiring to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking.It said the defendants should “disgorge”, or forfeit, $280bn of “ill-gotten gains”.But last February an appeals court rejected the government’s effort to recover past industry profits, removing the biggest penalty that could have been imposed against the cigarette makers.It limited the case to “forward-looking” remedies that would prevent future violations of the law, rather than punish past conduct.The result, said David Adelman, analyst at Morgan Stanley, is an “emasculated” case.Still, he wrote in a report, given Judge Kessler’s past rulings, “it is naive to believe that she will not determine that the industry violated civil RICO in the past; there is a reasonable likelihood …of future RICO violations; and award certain remedies presumably intended to prevent and restrain future RICO violations”.Mr Adelman said much of the DoJ’s requested remedy – a $10bn national smoking cessation programme and a $4bn public education and counter-marketing campaign – “is arguably barred by the earlier disgorgement ruling”.That did not dissuade the government from persisting in its demands for far-reaching changes to the way the industry markets cigarettes.These include asking the judge to make companies sell research and development arms aimed at developing safer cigarettes; stop all motor-racing sponsorship; meet targets for cutting youth smoking; and pay for newspaper advertisements “correcting” their past health messages.If Judge Kessler rules against the tobacco industry and determines there is a “reasonable likelihood” of future industry RICO violations, she must fashion remedies that “prevent and restrain” future RICO violations, but she need not heed the government’s proposals.She could also find there is no reasonable likelihood of future wrongdoing, or that while there is a reasonable likelihood of future wrong-doing, most of the requested remedies are legally unavailable.Since the trial ended last June, the industry and its foes have been on tenterhooks. But even if Judge Kessler rules in the next few months, a final outcome could be several years away because of the appeals process.Analysts diverge on whether there needs to be a ruling before Altria’s board, which holds its next regularly scheduled meeting on August 30, gives the spin-off the green light.Louis Camilleri, Altria’s chief executive, has said a potential restructuring would proceed on the company’s own timeline and it would “not act prematurely”.But with two of the three big multi-billion dollar cases behind it, and continuing improvements in the overall litigation environment, there appears to be momentum for a near-term break-up.Should Judge Kessler rule against the industry, it could have far-reaching consequences for the cigarette companies and positive implications for the tobacco control movement.“A judicial finding that the defendants are, quite literally, racketeers would likely galvanize tobacco control legislative efforts at the state and local levels,” said Mark Gottlieb, director of the Tobacco Products Liability Project at the Northeastern School of Law."
217;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Kraft;;Irene Rosenfeld, the new chief executive of Kraft Foods, was always likely to have a lot on her plate. Kraft’s $1.1bn deal with United Biscuits, just a fortnight after Ms Rosenfeld’s return, certainly suggests a healthy appetite.While the timing is a little odd, the long-rumoured move itself is not. Swapping Kraft’s minority stake in UB, worth some $520m, for the British company’s Spanish and Portuguese operations makes sense. It secures Kraft leading positions in those country’s biscuit markets, which are comparatively fast growing. The total price tag of about 2.7 times sales, including net debt, is hardly outrageous by sector standards, especially as the deal also returns to the fold the rights to Nabisco trademarks, such as Oreo and Ritz.Given Kraft’s size, this is unlikely to move the needle much in itself, but should, in theory, open up new opportunities in other markets. The trouble is that Kraft has proven notoriously unable to make the most of its global scale. The bulk of promised cost savings from buying Nabisco either seem to have fizzled out or been passed on to customers.Kraft’s latest restructuring efforts sound sensible, but using the savings to jump-start growth through innovation continues to look challenging. Even if the highly respected Ms Rosenfeld manages to deal with execution risks more effectively than her predecessors, Kraft’s businesses will remain heavily skewed to mature markets and segments for the foreseeable future.Fortunately, it might no longer take much of an improvement to lend some appeal to Kraft’s shares after their long underperformance compared to peers. The expected spin-off from Altria will only increase pressures to perform. And, should Kraft yet again fail to deliver, that would only lead to renewed pressures to sell off chunks of its unwieldy business portfolio. That alone suggests some upside, if past transactions in the industry are any guide.

219;MO;Altria Group;2006-07-07T20:46:23Z;Tobacco;;A huge legal cloud has been lifted from the tobacco industry, now that Florida’s Supreme Court has thrown out a $145bn award against tobacco companies. There remains the potential for individual smoker trials - as opposed to the class action that was decertified in the same legal decision - but the financial impact would be negligible compared with the unique and vast financial risk that has now effectively disappeared.That should hasten moves by Altria to break itself up - something which was on hold until the litigation outlook improved - much to investors’ relief since there should be considerable value to be unlocked.Altria currently trades at a roughly 10 per cent discount to a sum of the parts valuation, if one were to apply industry earnings multiples to Altria’s Philip Morris International (PMI) and Philip Morris USA. That discount widens if one were to award a premium to the Philip Morris businesses because of the strength of the brands, including Marlboro, and the benefits of scale. In addition, investors are surely hoping that the tobacco balance sheets are geared up, post their spin-offs - bringing them more in line with industry peers. That too might yield some extra value that the market does not appear to be assigning.Splitting PMI off from Philip Morris USA would have the additional benefit of insulating the former from further US litigation risks, however much reduced these may now seem.

One consequence of the ruling is that Altria, the parent company of cigarette maker Philip Morris and Kraft Foods, can now start formally planning its break-up, a process that should be completed by the end of the year.According to analysts, this will inevitably raise the question of what Altria plans to do with its 28.7 per cent holding in SAB.Credit Suisse’s Michael Bleakley thinks Altria will wait for SABMiller shares to recover from their recent weakness before selling. The shares have fallen 14 per cent in the past three months on concerns about the company’s exposure to emerging markets.He says it is also possible the stake will be retained by Philip Morris USA as collateral against any future US tobacco litigation.But with traders taking the view that “overhang” rumours will continue to dog the share price, SABMiller closed 1 per cent lower at 960½p.In the wider market, leading shares fought back from early weakness to close the session almost changed.The FTSE 100 closed down just 1.1 points, or 0.02 per cent, at 5,888.9 – a decent performance given early weakness on Wall Street.

221;MO;Altria Group;2006-07-06T23:32:00Z;Cigarette makers breathe a sigh of relief;;The history of US litigation is strewn with superlatives and highly charged emotions, but there is little doubt that Thursday was Big Tobacco’s biggest day in court.The decision by the Florida Supreme Court to uphold a previous ruling and reject a $145bn punitive damage award claim against some of the biggest US cigarette makers lifts a huge financial and legal threat for the industry.Although the outcome of the so-called “Engle” case was expected – partly because the requested damages were so high – Thursday’s ruling puts an end to years of uncertainty for companies, investors and even plaintiffs.“For the most part, the court has done what we wanted them to do,” is how William Ohlemeyer, associate general counsel for Philip Morris USA, summed up Big Tobacco’s mixture of relief and elation at the Florida ruling.But if the end of Engle is likely to neuter once and for all the potential for class action lawsuits and their astronomical damage claims, the decision was no slam dunk for Big Tobacco.Aside from confirming damages worth some $7m to two of the 700,000 plaintiffs, the court left the door open to individual lawsuits against the tobacco companies provided they sue them within a year.“This is not a complete victory for the tobacco industry,” said John Coffee, an expert on tobacco litigation at Columbia University Law School. “It will be Chinese water torture, drop by drop.”Indeed, Stanley Rosenblatt, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, said that some of the court’s findings, namely that smoking is harmful and that the companies marketed “defective and unreasonably dangerous” cigarettes, could help future individual cases.“The job of plaintiffs’ lawyers will be much easier in future cases,” he said.But even if tobacco companies are hit by a raft of smaller cases – a prospect they claim is unlikely – they have avoided a pay-out that would have bankrupted the whole industry.“The industry is still looking at significant but not lethal liability, particularly in the area of low-tar cigarettes,” where plaintiffs have had considerable success using state consumer protection laws, said Jonathan Turley, of George Washington University law school.The point was not lost on investors, who sent the share prices of the main companies involved – Philip Morris owner Altria, Reynolds American and Carolina Group, the tracking stock for Loews Corp.’s Lorillard Tobacco – higher.Altria investors had other reasons to look forward to the Engle verdict. The company has been waiting for a resolution of legal disputes to spin off its 87.6 per cent stake in Kraft Foods.Altria declined to comment on Thursday but its chief executive Louis Camilleri has indicated that a positive Engle verdict would remove a roadblock to the break-up.Although a pending Justice Department investigation into Big Tobacco, and Philip Morris’s hint it might appeal against part of the Engle verdict, could further delay the spin-off, Wall Street analysts are expecting it before the end of the year.According to Goldman Sachs, a three-way split of Altria, into Kraft, Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International – one of the options considered – could add 26 per cent to the market value of the companies.The Altria board has already paved the way for a sale with last month’s ousting of Roger Deromedi as chief executive and his replacement with Irene Rosenfeld, a food-industry veteran who returned to Kraft after a two-year stint running PepsiCos snack food division.Ms Rosenfeld is expected to accelerate the efforts to boost growth in sales and earnings. In order to achieve those goals, she could hit the acquisition trail.Wall Street bankers have long expected that once Kraft was free of the Altria link, it would look at take-overs, taking advantage of a share price no longer affected by the prospect of litigation risk.Among the most commonly mentioned targets is Danone, the large French yoghurts maker which was unsuccessfully pursued by PepsiCo last year. This would allow Kraft to expand away from more traditional products such as processed cheese into higher growth products such as yoghurt.Ironically, Big Tobacco’s ability to survive litigation over the nefarious effect of smoking could prove a boon for investors in dairy products popular among health-conscious consumers.Additional reporting by James Politi and Lauren Foster in New York and Doug Cameron in Chicago

223;MO;Altria Group;2006-07-06T16:44:01Z;$145bn tobacco ruling goes up in smoke;;The tobacco industry won a decisive legal victory on Thursday when Florida’s highest court threw out a $145bn damage award, the largest in US history, in a move that substantially reduces the risk of crippling litigation against cigarette makers.The decision by Florida’s Supreme Court to rule against punitive damages that could have bankrupted the tobacco industry is expected to pave the way for the long-awaited spin off of the food group Kraft from Altria, the cigarette maker.The court said the damage award was “clearly excessive” and would “result in an unlawful crippling of the defendant companies,” which included Altria’s Philip Morris USA, RJ Reynolds Tobacco and Loews Corp’s Lorillard Tobacco.The outcome of the so-called “Engle” case is also likely to mark the end of the era of sprawling class actions that have threatened the financial stability of tobacco companies for more than a decade.Although other lawsuits are still outstanding, including a Department of Justice’s civil racketeering case against the industry, legal experts believe that future class actions seeking huge damages would have little chance of succeeding.“It is increasingly clear that the US tobacco industry is in its strongest overall legal position since the 1994 emergence of the state [litigation],” wrote David Adelman, Morgan Stanley analyst, in a report issued before Thursday’s ruling.However, the Florida ruling will still allow the 700,000 smokers in the Florida class to go ahead with individual cases against the tobacco companies within 12 months, and to use some of the favourable rulings from the previous verdict to help them win their cases.Nevertheless, news that the $145bn damage claim had been thrown out was welcomed by investors, partly because it came just before a summer recess that could have prolonged the uncertainty hanging over the tobacco industry.Shares in Altria rose more than 7 per cent, while shares in both Reynolds American, RJ Reynolds’ parent group, and Carolina group, the tracking stock for Lorillard Tobacco, hit record highs in intra-day trading.The Engle case - filed more than a decade ago and originally led by the pediatrician Howard Engle - was the first class-action brought by smokers to go to trial.Theoretically, Thursday’s ruling could be appealed to the US Supreme Court, but legal experts said it was virtually certain that such an appeal would not succeed.Most analysts believe that the improving legal landscape will prompt Altria to quickly spin off its 87.6 per cent stake in Kraft - a move that will streamline the parent company’s business and free Kraft from a large share overhang.Altria has said the break-up hinges on continuing improvements in the “entire litigation environment”, which also includes the DoJ case and a lawsuit in New York.
224;MO;Altria Group;2006-06-26T18:03:50Z;Deromedi forced out as Kraft Foods’ CEO;;Roger Deromedi was on Monday ousted as chief executive of Kraft Foods, the world’s second-largest food company, after presiding over two big restructurings aimed at reinvigorating its sluggish performance.He is succeeded by Irene Rosenfeld, who spent more than 20 years with Kraft and General Foods before joining Frito-Lay, the snack food division of PepsiCo, in 2004 as chairman and chief executive.The move comes as parent Altria Group prepares for a potential restructuring, including spinning off its 87.6 per cent of Kraft shares to Altria shareholders, and reflects frustration at the pace of progress in boosting sales and profit growth.“While the fundamentals of the business continue to improve, we are confident that Irene will accelerate the execution of Kraft’s growth strategy, build value for shareholders, and lead Kraft when it becomes a fully independent company,” said Louis Camilleri, Altria’s chief executive and chairman of the Kraft board.David Palmer, analyst at UBS Investment Research, told clients this was “the strongest signal yet that Kraft would be spun out of Altria”, possibly “by year-end”.Kraft said Mr Deromedi had “mutually agreed with the board to leave the company to pursue other interests”. He took over as sole chief executive in late 2003 – ending an unwieldy dual-CEO structure that the company briefly experimented with.The maker of Ritz crackers and DiGiorno frozen pizzas has battled high commodity costs and private label competition. By the end of 2008 it will have cut about 14,000 jobs and closed up to 40 plants.Christopher Growe, analyst at AG Edwards & Sons, said in a reasearch note that it appeared Ms Rosenfeld was returning to Kraft to “accelerate” the restructuring programme and sales and profit growth, “which have been lagging”.In her previous stint with Kraft Ms Rosenfeld oversaw the integration of the $19bn Nabisco acquisition as president of Kraft’s North American business.At Frito-Lay, she earned respect for maintaining solid growth through a challenging period of increased raw material costs and heightened consumer concern about health and obesity.She cut hundreds of jobs as part of a cost-saving drive and introduced a range of reduced calorie versions of its most popular snacks, such as Lay’s potato chips and Doritos tortilla chips.Her departure is a blow to PepsiCo, where she was considered a rising star and potential successor to Steve Reinemund, chief executive.PepsiCo said Ms Rosenfeld would be succeeded by Albert Carey, a 25-year group veteran who was most recently group president of sales.
225;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
226;MO;Altria Group;2006-06-25T19:16:45Z;Smoke clears for Philip Morris;;Philip Morris USA, Altria Group’s domestic tobacco unit, faces the lowest number of new lawsuits in nearly a decade – a sign that the cloud of litigation over the industry is lifting.The dip is a contrast to the years following the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement between 46 states and the industry, when plaintiffs’ lawyers inundated cigarette makers with claims. As part of the deal, companies were ordered to make public thousands of pages of internal documents that showed how they strove to cover up smoking’s effects. The revelations fuelled a new wave of litigation.Last year, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes had 268 suits pending at the end of the year compared with 509 in 2003. So far this year, only seven suits have been filed and one case is scheduled to go to trial. That is down from 1997 when 437 cases were filed – the highest ever number.“Recent trends reinforce our belief that the litigation climate continues to evolve favourably and that greater clarity is slowly, but surely, emerging,” Louis Camilleri, Altria’s chief executive, said in the annual report.The shift is partly due to changes made following the MSA, which imposed marketing and advertising restrictions on cigarettes. It also stems from a reticence among tobacco lawyers to file new individual personal injury cases and class actions and the industry’s success in defending itself.“The personal injury individual cases are legally viable but less attractive than ever before,” said Anthony Sebok, a professor at Brooklyn Law School.In total, 1,549 cases have been filed against PM USA but only 51 have gone to trial. While some lawsuits have sought billions of dollars, PM USA and has only paid plaintiffs a total of $103m in the four cases it has lost on appeal.The change bodes well for Altria’s potential restructuring into two, or possibly three, parts – PM USA, Philip Morris International and Kraft Foods. The company has said the break-up hinges on “continuing improvements in the entire litigation environment”, including three lawsuits: Engle, Price, and the Department of Justice’s civil racketeering case against the industry.In December, PM USA won its appeal in the Price “lights” case but is still waiting for a ruling in the DoJ suit and the Engle class action, considered the biggest legal hurdle to Altria’s plans. In that case, the Florida Supreme Court is reviewing a decision to throw out a $145bn verdict against the industry.Tobacco watchers hope the justices will rule in the two weeks remaining before summer recess. If not, they will have to wait until the court resumes releasing opinions at the end of August.
227;MO;Altria Group;2006-05-30T18:41:09Z;US Supreme Court might clamp down on damages;;The US Supreme Court is to consider tightening limits on punitive damage awards by hearing a case later this year that could have big implications for every company that makes or sells products in America.The court said on Tuesday that it would review a $79m award won by the widow of a former smoker against Philip Morris, the big cigarette maker.But the case reaches far beyond the world of tobacco, and could test the justices’ determination to restrict the size of damage awards that juries can impose against a wide range of businesses.The court has tried several times recently to rein in punitive damage awards that measure juries’ outrage at corporate conduct, but are not closely linked to the damage caused to plaintiffs.But many judges around the country are ignoring the Supreme Court’s warnings on the issue.The US Chamber of Commerce has tried repeatedly to persuade the justices to intervene to try to enforce its past rulings, which it will now have a chance to do.Philip Morris says jurors in the current case were wrong because they punished the company not just for the health problems of the former Oregon smoker involved in the lawsuit, but also for the illness of other smokers who were not involved.The punitive damages awarded by the jury were nearly 100 times the damages awarded to compensate the victim – a figure far above the constitutional maximum of 10 times compensatory damages established by the justices in 2003.But the Oregon Supreme Court ignored these guidelines, saying the award was warranted due to Philip Morris’s “extraordinarily reprehensible” conduct in deceiving the public about the dangers of smoking.The case, which will be heard in the court’s next term that begins in October, could affect a wide range of US companies and multi-nationals that do business in the US, says Robin Conrad of the National Chamber Litigation Center, the legal arm of the Chamber of Commerce.“The problem continues to occur,” he says, “because the courts are not requiring adequate jury instructions so that the jury understands that harm to others is not something that can be taken into account.”In a separate ruling, the Supreme Court limited lawsuits by government whistleblowers, by making it harder for government workers to file lawsuits claiming they were retaliated against for speaking out about official misconduct.
228;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Tobacco war shifts between cheek and gum;;In the latest tobacco war, there is no smoke. And no fire. And there certainly isn’t any spitting.The battleground is unconventional, too: between cheek and gum.It started last month when Reynolds American, the second-largest US cigarette maker, announced plans to test-market Camel Snus, a smoke-free and spitless pouch product.Camel Snus is touted as “another tobacco pleasure” for adults, that can be used “anytime, anywhere”. Unlike other moist smokeless tobacco products, also known as snuff, the tobacco in Camel Snus is pasteurised, not fermented, and contains less moisture and salt. The result is that users do not have to spit.Philip Morris USA, Altria Group’s domestic tobacco arm, followed a week later with plans to test-market a smoke-free and spit-free tobacco pouch product. Taboka is aimed at smokers looking to switch to smokeless alternatives.Not to be left out, UST, the largest US smokeless tobacco maker, last week said it would test Skoal Dry, a spit-free smokeless tobacco product. It, too, will be marketed as an alternative for adult smokers.The tobacco companies hope the spit-free version will attract consumers who balk at the spitting associated with snuff but are looking for another way to get their nicotine fix. The new snuff products, they point out, are not marketed as a way to quit smoking.There is more at stake than offering consumers a more palatable choice: the smokeless business has attractive margins and rising sales while the number of smokers in the US is falling.The latest smokeless products have created a buzz in the tobacco industry – and in anti-smoking circles. The two sides have long been at war over federal regulation of tobacco products.Smokeless tobacco has also prompted renewed calls from anti-tobacco advocates for oversight by the US Food and Drug Administration, which oversees drug approvals and food labelling.Like cigarettes, smokeless tobacco products are not subject to federal regulation. Anti-smoking groups worry cigarette companies will encourage smokers to switch to smokeless products instead of quitting.Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, says the entry of the leading US tobacco companies into the smokeless market makes the need for FDA regulation “even more urgent”.“Without regulation, there is a significant risk that these new smokeless tobacco products will be marketed to kids who don’t currently use tobacco products or to smokers who are seriously considering quitting,” he says.He says that while Philip Morris has supported FDA regulation, RJ Reynolds, a subsidiary of Reynolds American, and UST have “vigorously opposed” it.In 2000 Philip Morris admitted for the first time that cigarettes were addictive and harmful and said publicly it supported “sensible” regulation of tobacco products.Altria said this week: “Altria Group and Philip Morris USA remain firmly committed to our long-standing support for comprehensive regulation of tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration.”Rival RJR says it is “committed to achieving a sensible consistent framework of laws and policies that govern the tobacco industry”, while UST says the company “would be willing to consider regulation that takes into account the differences between smokeless tobacco and cigarettes”.In 2004, the Senate twice approved a bipartisan bill giving the FDA power to regulate – but not ban – cigarettes and tobacco products. The legislation gained support in the House but failed in October.Last March legislation to provide the FDA authority to regulate broadly tobacco products was reintroduced to Congress. Anti-smoking advocates say it is unlikely legislation will be passed during this Congress but that the issue could gain traction next year.Scott Ballin, a tobacco and health policy consultant, says the role of an agency such as the FDA “cannot be underestimated”.“Without a neutral governmental agency charged with overseeing the manufacture, sale, distribution, labelling and marketing of all tobacco products, there is no way that a consumer will really know what products are available to them and the risks and relative risks associated with those products,” he said this month at a meeting of the Tobacco Merchants Association.While a united front on tobacco regulation does not appear imminent, Mr Ballin believes federal oversight is inevitable. “The industry is beginning to change and see that its long-term future is going to require – for its own marketplace protection – that there is regulation,” he says.
229;MO;Altria Group;2006-05-05T21:14:07Z;Premier and Kraft join forces to break up UB;;"Kraft Foods, the US group that owns Philadelphia cream cheese, Oreos, Ritz crackers and Dairy-lea, has teamed up with Premier Foods of the UK to break up United Biscuits, maker of McVities and Jaffa Cakes, which is valued at about £2.3bn ($4.3bn) including debt.Kraft, which owns about 25 per cent of UB through its acquisition of Nabisco in 2000, is understood to be interested in buying the southern European part of UB.However, people close to the situation stressed that discussions were at an early stage and no formal offer had been made.UB owns seven of the top 10 selling biscuits in Spain where its brands are bought by more than 97 per cent of the population. It owns 39 per cent of the Portuguese biscuit market through the Triunfo biscuit brands.Premier, which owns Branston pickle and Hartley’s jam, this week confirmed it was looking at parts of UB, though it declined to name its consortium partners.However, the third member of the group is understood to be a small private equity firm, which would take UB’s northern European brands. These include Delacre, which has operations in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and France.UB was taken private in April 2000 for £1.26bn by Finalrealm, a consortium of three private equity firms and Kraft. Cinven and PAI Partners each own 30 per cent of UB; Kraft, part of Altria, owns 25 per cent; and MidOcean Partners 15 per cent.In February, the owners, which have held the investment for longer than is typical in the buyout industry, appointed Goldman Sachs to carry out a strategic review of the business.UB owns three of the UK’s five top-selling biscuits including McVitie’s, bought by 85 per cent of UK households. Last year, retail sales of McVitie’s chocolate digestives rose 1.4 per cent to £66.2m, according to market research group AC Nielsen.Asked on Friday whether Kraft would acquire all of United Biscuits, Roger Deromedi, Kraft CEO, told the FT: “I can’t comment specifically about that . . . but we’ve been very clear that biscuits is one of our global cores and we want to compete in that business on a more global basis. How we enter those businesses I won’t give specifics on. But we [will] use both organic and acquisitions to do so.”Kraft’s biscuit and cookie brands also include Chips Ahoy, mostly sold in North America. Its European business is largely based on coffee and the Toblerone, Milka and Carte d’Or chocolate brands. Premier is also looking at acquiring some of Campbell’s Soup brands, which include Homepride Sauces and Oxo stock and gravy.Last year Kraft derived 19.7 per cent of its net revenues from the European Union, with 68.3 per cent from North America and the rest Asia and other developing markets.Lehman Brothers said it made sense for Kraft to buy United Biscuits because it could give it a growth platform in Europe.Andrew Lazar, the bank’s analyst, said: “Without a large scale acquisition, we believe Kraft remains overly focused on just two categories in the European Union.” He said that while Europe was not the most attractive region in which to grow - due to macro-economic difficulties and a tough retailer environment - an acquisition there “could aid in building scale, and related fixed cost absorption, lessen the volatility of having just two businesses, offer potential geographic expansion of key products and … expand greater global scale in one of Kraft’s core businesses”.He suggested that for £2.6bn ($4.8bn), United Biscuits could “prove modestly accretive to ongoing EPS” at Kraft once three years of cost synergies were taken into account.Premier, UB and Goldman Sachs declined to comment."
230;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:51:47+0000;Premier Foods joins forces to bid for UB;;Premier Foods, the Branston pickle, SunPat peanut butter and Hartley’s jam grocery products group, has formed a consortium to bid for United Biscuits, owner of brands such as McVitie’s, Jaffa Cakes and Hula Hoops.UB is thought to be worth about £2.3bn. However, this is estimated to include some £1.9bn of debt.The Premier consortium, which includes another trade buyer and two private equity houses, has made an approach to UB but talks are still at a preliminary stage.However, if successful, the consortium would break up UB, with Premier taking the UK biscuits business. Even so, that would constitute a big deal for Premier, which has a market value of £736m at yesterday’s closing share price of 297p.The snacks business, which includes KP Nuts and two recently acquired brands, Nik Naks and Wheat Crunchies, and the continental European biscuit brands, which are made for the French, German, Spanish, Portuguese and Benelux markets, would go to other members of the group.UB was taken private in April 2000 for £1.26bn by Finalrealm, a consortium of three private equity firms and Kraft, the US good group. UB’s owners, Cinven and PAI Partners, each with 30 per cent, Kraft, now part of Altria, with 25 per cent and MidOcean Partners with 15 per cent, have held the investment for longer than is typical in the buyout industry.In February, the owners appointed Goldman Sachs to carry out a strategic review of the business, which could include a sale or flotation.
231;MO;Altria Group;2006-04-27T17:18:24Z;Reynolds to test-market smokeless tobacco;;Reynolds American, the second-largest US cigarette maker, plans to test-market a smokeless, spitless tobacco product called Camel Snus in the second quarter as the company looks to extend its popular cigarette brand.The announcement comes two days after Reynolds agreed to pay $3.5bn for Conwood, a smokeless tobacco company owned by Chicago’s Pritzker family. The deal will give Reynolds the number-two position in the fast-growing smokeless market.Camel Snus will come in a small pouch that is placed between the lip and gum. The product is different from most moist snuff sold in the US: its tobacco is pasteurised, not fermented, and it contains less moisture and salt than moist snuff, Reynolds said on Thursday. As a result, it does not require the user to spit.Smokeless tobacco companies hope a spit-free product will attract a wider audience as it can be touted as more discreet and suitable for indoor use.UST, the leading smokeless tobacco company, is testing a spitless product called Revel Tobacco Packs in the US and has launched a spit-free product called Access in Canada.In Scandinavia, where “snus” is popular, users place the finely ground tobacco between the upper lip and gum, which mitigates the need to spit, according to Swedish Match, a tobacco company headquartered in Stockholm. In the US, moist snuff users usually place the tobacco under the lower lip, creating the need to spit.Reynolds on Thursday said first quarter profit rose 23 per cent, helped by a $65m tax benefit. The company earned $345m, or $2.34 a share, up from $281m, or $1.90 a share, a year ago. Sales were flat $1.96bn.Separately, Altria, the US conglomerate that owns the Philip Morris tobacco unit and 87 per cent of Kraft Foods, on Thursday indicated a corporate restructuring would wait until the big lawsuits facing the industry are resolved.Louis Camilleri, chief executive, told shareholders that in 2005 Altria had “advanced preparations” for a break-up into two or three entities but emphasised that “continued improvements” across the “entire” litigation landscape was a prerequisite for action.“Any potential restructuring will proceed on our own timeline, and we will not act prematurely,” Mr Camilleri said.
232;MO;Altria Group;2006-04-20T21:01:37Z;Dow hits best level in six years;;Blue chip stocks rode on a wave of strong earnings reports on Thursday as solid results from General Motors, Intel and Merck helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its best level in more than six years.General Motors was the top performer on the Dow, jumping 10.1 per cent to $22.64 as the troubled carmaker showed signs of progress in its recovery efforts after it sharply narrowed its losses from a year ago.The $323m first-quarter loss recorded by GM was better than Wall Street had forecast. Chris Ceraso, motor analyst at Credit Suisse, pointed out that excluding special items and healthcare charges, the company would have made a small profit in the quarter.Ford Motor, which will report its quarterly results on Friday, rode on GM’s coat-tails, rising 4.6 per cent to $7.95. Meanwhile, drugmaker Merck and tobacco giant Altria added further steam to the Dow’s rally, rising 1.7 per cent to $35 and 1.6 per cent to $70.04, respectively, after delivering double-digit rises in their quarterly profits.The Dow ended the session 0.6 per cent higher at 11,342.89 – its highest level since January 2000.The index’s all-time high was 11,722.98, which was set also in 2000.In the wider market, the other indices did less well. The S&P 500, checked by a sell-off in energy stocks, rose only 0.1 per cent to 1,311.46, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 per cent to 2,362.55 despite positive earnings from Apple.Instead the technology-heavy index was dragged lower by a sell-off in Ebay.The internet auction group sustained heavy losses after it announced lower-than-expected sales and profitsfor 2006.The stocks fell 8.9 per cent to $36.77 and the loss accounted for most of the Nasdaq’s 8-point drop.Losses on the Nasdaq were limited by Apple Computer, which rose 3 per cent to $67.63 after announcing second-quarter revenue rose by 41 per cent to $410m.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said the fall in technology stocks was caused by investors cashing in after a strong run earlier in the week. “We’ve had a very good week and there’s been some profit-taking,” he said.“It’s nothing to be concerned about.”Gold miners and metal producers also fell to profit-taking, with Newmont Mining down 5.2 per cent at $55.42 and US Steel down 4.1 per cent at $66.18.Elsewhere, energy stocks pulled back following a dip in crude prices.The Amex oil index fell 0.9 per cent, led by Chevron, down 1.6 per cent at $60.03.Elsewhere, Bank of New York added to gains seen by the financial services sector in recent days as it delivered an 11 per cent increase in first-quarter net income, although its shares fell 2.2 per cent to $34.77.
233;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:51:47+0000;Altria’s profit jumps 34 per cent on tax gains;;Altria Group on Thursday reported a 34 per cent jump in first quarter profit as a tax gain and robust domestic tobacco sales helped offset weakness overseas, especially in Spain.The US conglomerate, which owns the Philip Morris tobacco unit and 87 per cent of Kraft Foods, earned $3.48bn, or $1.65 a share, up from $2.6bn, or $1.25 a share, a year ago.Stripping out a tax benefit of 46 cents and other one-time items, Altria earned $1.28 a share, one penny above analysts’ average forecast.Revenue rose 3.1 per cent to $24.4bn from $23.6bn.“Our domestic tobacco business delivered strong share and income gains in the first quarter of 2006, reflecting the strength of the Marlboro brand,” said Louis Camilleri, chief executive. “Our international tobacco business achieved solid volume and share gains in many markets, but as previously anticipated, income growth was adversely impacted by a combination of factors, including unfavourable currency movements, lower results in Spain and a difficult comparison to the prior year.”In Spain, increasing sales of deep-discount products are cutting into Altria’s cigarette sales. Moreover, a smoking ban went into effect in most public places in January and the government increased taxes.“Unfortunately in Spain we have had to bear short-term pain to produce long-term gain,” Dinny Devitre, chief financial officer, told analysts. “But I believe we are on track to position ourselves well for the long term.”Altria reaffirmed its 2006 projection for earnings from continuing operations of $5.25-$5.35 a share.
234;MO;Altria Group;2006-04-19T16:44:28Z;Search for Altria lawsuit’s outcome becoming a habit;;If it is Thursday, it must be Engle-watch.Every Thursday at 11am, tobacco lawyers, investors and journalists browse the website of the Florida Supreme Court in the hopes the justices have reached their long-awaited decision in the Engle class action lawsuit.Altria Group, the US conglomerate that owns the Philip Morris tobacco unit and 87 per cent of Kraft Foods, has a lot riding on the outcome.The maker of Marlboro cigarettes is preparing to restructure and spin off of its Kraft Foods division but has repeatedly said the break-up hinges on continuing improvements in the litigation environment.This incudes three lawsuits: Engle, Price/Miles, and the government’s civil racketeering case against the industry.The Engle suit, led by Howard Engle, a retired paediatrician, was filed more than a decade ago and was the first class-action brought by smokers to go to trial.A July 2000 verdict in the case produced the largest punitive damages award in US history - $145bn - after jurors found the five largest cigarette companies liable for the illnesses of thousands of Florida smokers.The state’s highest court is considering whether to reinstate the original ruling after an appellate court in 2003 unanimously overturned the judgment, saying the trial plan was flawed, the damages excessive, and the original trial proceedings “irretrievably tainted” by the “misconduct” of lawyers representing the smokers.In a strongly worded ruling, the judges ordered the class be decertified, saying the individual issues were too diverse to be lumped together in one class.A year later, however, Florida’s Supreme Court unexpectedly agreed to review the case.Oral arguments were heard 17 months ago.Christine Farkas, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said Engle is “critical” to Altria “as a decision against tobacco could derail its promised restructuring until such time as it ultimately prevails”.In the Price/Miles “lights” class action, the Illinois Supreme Court in December threw out the $10.1bn verdict, handing cigarette makers a big win. It is now deciding whether to reconsider that decision.Ms Farkas said both the Engle and Price/Miles claims “have the ability to delay or - in the worst case - prevent” Altria’s plans.Altria is also awaiting news on the Department of Justice’s racketeering case.US District Judge Gladys Kessler is expected to rule in the near future but the case no longer poses the crippling financial threat it once did.Last year the government reduced its requested “remedy,” should it prevail, to $14bn from $130bn. Analysts expect the ruling to be financially manageable for the industry.Litigation is not the only issue tobacco investors will be thinking about this Thursday.Altria reports first quarter results this morning. The consensus forecast is for earnings of $1.27 a share. In the year ago quarter, earnings from continuing operations, including one-time items, were $1.24 a share.Investors will likely focus on Philip Morris International and challenges in Western Europe, particularly Germany and Spain.
235;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Tobacco groups win ruling over settlement;;Big tobacco companies, including Altria?s Philip Morris USA and Reynolds American, on Tuesday won an arbiter ruling that could bolster their chances of reducing an upcoming settlement payment to US states.The major cigarette makers are due to pay about $6.5bn to 46 states on April 17 as part of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement to reimburse healthcare costs.The ruling could allow tobacco companies to withhold about $1.2bn because the MSA settlement contains a provision that allows cigarette makers to adjust their payments based on market share.Cigarette makers contend their market share declined to 92 per cent in 2003 from 99.6 per cent in 1997.The Brattle Group, an economic consultancy hired by the states and cigarette makers, said the MSA, which imposed advertising restrictions, was ?a significant factor? in that drop.Generic cigarette makers, whose market share is rapidly growing, do not face the same restrictions in advertising and financial payments.Rob Campagnino, analyst at Prudential Equity Group, said the decision was not surprising, but added: ?Given what we see as the level of dependency the states have on tobacco settlement funds, [the] ruling will likely trigger a wave of litigation.?The states have increasingly come to rely on the payments to finance operating expenses, healthcare programmes and education and public works. Many states, cities and counties have also issued bonds secured by the stream of tobacco dollars.The National Association of Attorneys General on Tuesday said the states believe tobacco makers should make the payment ?in full?.Tom Miller, Iowa attorney general, and Lawrence Wasden, Idaho attorney general, co-chairs of the tobacco committee for the NAAG, said: ?Although the MSA does contain a mechanism…that could reduce these payments, the requirements of that mechanism have not been met. As a result, the settling states believe that it would not be appropriate to withhold any portion of the April 17 payment.?The NAAG added the states are in discussions with the big cigarette makers to ensure they make full payment and it expected those discussions to be successful. This month the NAAG said US cigarette sales fell to a 55-year low last year after tobacco companies agreed to restrict advertising.According to figures compiled by the Treasury Department?s Tobacco Tax Bureau, cigarette sales in 2005 were down 4.2 per cent from overall sales in 2004 ? the largest consumption decline in a single year since 1999.
236;MO;Altria Group;2006-03-08T21:32:52Z;Falling energy prices light Wall Street revival;;A late rally saw US equities recoup early losses to finish higher on Wednesday as fears over inflation gave way to the positive impact of falling energy prices.In the absence of any major US economic data, stocks initially traded lower as investors focused once again on 10-year US Treasury yields, which held near 21-month highs.Rising yields on the benchmark note have raised fears over the effect of higher borrowing costs on corporate profit and put pressure on US equities in recent days.However, news of soaring US crude stockpiles saw oil prices slide and propelled the S&P 500 to its first positive finish in five days.The S&P 500 closed 0.2 per cent higher at 1,278.47, while the Nasdaq Composite ended flat at 2,267.46.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 11,005.74, with defensive stocks to the fore amid worries over rising interest rates. Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, rose 1.2 per cent to $72.65, while consumer products giant Procter & Gamble climbed 1.3 per cent to $61.07.Shares in Google fell 2.9 per cent to $353.88 after the company advised investors to disregard an internal financial forecast mistakenly posted on its website.The forecast highlighted concerns about the online search engine leader’s profits narrowing amid tougher competition.Goldman Sachs lowered its price target on the shares from $500 to $490 on the news but kept its “buy” recommendation. “We continue to recommend owning the stock as our favourable view of growth and valuation is not changed by recent gaffes,” analysts said.Elsewhere, attention was focused on the first day of trading for the New York Stock Exchange following its acquisition of electronic rival Archipelago.NYSE shares jumped 24.5 per cent to $80 as the world’s biggest stock market ended its 213-year history as a member-owned club.The sparkling debut put pressure on rival exchanges as investors adjusted their portfolios. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange slipped 0.6 per cent to $419.74, while the Chicago Board of Trade fell 2.9 per cent to $118.04.Lexar Media soared 24.5 per cent to $8.83 after Micron Technology agreed to acquire the flash memory card maker in a stock-for-stock deal valued at $675m. Shares in Micron fell 0.7 per cent to $14.87.Fashion retailer Urban Outfitters rose 2.5 per cent to $25.41 after Citigroup upgraded the stock from “hold” to “buy”.“Short-term volatility in the stock has provided an attractive entry point to own one of the best-run high growth retailers in the sector,” said analyst Kimberly Greenberger.Sothebys jumped 12.2 per cent to a five-year high of $23.40 after the auction house reported sharply higher earnings thanks to the booming art market.
237;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Magellan looks overseas to boost returns;;Fidelity’s flagship Magellan fund has redrawn its strategy, dumping big-name US consumer stocks such as Procter & Gamble and Pfizer and moving a fifth of its $51bn under management into overseas markets.The move follows the appointment in October of Harry Lange, who had a mandate to return the mutual fund to its glory days. A star performer under the management of Peter Lynch and the biggest fund in the US, Magellan has underperformed the S&P 500 index in recent years and shrunk by half.Magellan’s search for higher returns is a further indication of how large-cap stocks have fallen out of favour as their stock prices have remained flat.Magellan raised its non-US holdings to 25 per cent from only 4 per cent during the December quarter, according to regulatory filings. Mr Lange took the axe to nearly all the fund’s top holdings, and raised exposure to technology companies, including Google.General Electric is the only name that remains in Magellan’s top 10 holdings, although Nokia, the Finnish mobile telephone operator, has replaced it as the fund’s biggest holding. Magellan bought 60m Nokia shares in the quarter, raising its holding by 56 per cent. It sold 44.4m GE shares at the same time. Magellan also increased greatly its investment in Royal Dutch Shell, to 21m shares from just 1m.US investors last year put more money into international stock funds than they did into US domestic funds for the first time in at least a decade.At the same time, many diversified stock funds moved money from the US market to other markets.Magellan has been criticised for sticking too closey to the S&P 500, making it difficult for the fund to offer returns above the index, especially after trading costs and fees are deducted.It appears the fund’s new direction will see it sharply diverge from the index. In the December quarter, Magellan sold 88m shares of its second-biggest holding, Microsoft, a stake worth about $2.4bn at Wednesday’s price.Intel, Tyco, Altria, Cisco and AT&T were also sold down heavily, according to analysis from Georgeson Shareholder Analytics. Magellan’s holding in Intel and Pfizer is at its lowest in at least seven years.Apart from overseas stocks, Mr Lange has lifted buying of tech stocks, which now account for 25 per cent of the portfolio, well above the benchmark.
238;MO;Altria Group;2006-02-06T19:27:18Z;Snuff back as Big Tobacco feels the pinch;;"With fewer Americans smoking and more cities adopting smoking restrictions, US tobacco companies face a key question: how to take their businesses beyond cigarettes.The answer may be in a can.The US is the world’s largest market for moist smokeless tobacco, also known as snuff, with more than 900m cans sold a year.While the cigarette industry is large and profitable, industry volumes have fallen at an annual rate of 1-2 per cent a year for the past 20 years – a trend expected to continue.By contrast, the smokeless category in the US, which has about 5.5m consumers, has shown consistent gains and is the only growing segment of the tobacco industry. In 2006 it is expected to show 4-5 per cent volume growth.This has not escaped the attention of the two largest US tobacco companies: Altria, parent of Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro; and Reynolds American, maker of Camel.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, says Reynolds will soon enter the smokeless market with its Camel brand, possibly making an announcement as early as tomorrow when it releases its earnings.“We believe the smokeless market could be an exciting opportunity for Reynolds, especially given the company’s existing sales force and distribution channel, the very high margins on smokeless tobacco and the company’s highly innovative team,” Ms Herzog says.Reynolds refused to comment.Last September, Philip Morris USA, Altria’s domestic tobacco arm, said the company was exploring ways to extend the business beyond cigarettes and was “looking at potential moves into complementary tobacco or tobacco-related products”.Last week, asked about the smokeless category, Louis Camilleri, Altria’s chief executive, told analysts: “Well, for obvious reasons, I wouldn’t want to say too much.”Analysts believe Philip Morris USA will enter the market with Marlboro, the world’s best-selling cigarette brand.Philip Morris USA and Reynolds will be up against a long-established competitor – UST, the largest US maker and distributor of moist smokeless tobacco, with about 75 per cent of the $3.5bn smokeless market. It dominates the premium segment with its Copenhagen and Skoal brands, each of which accounts for more than $1bn at retail.Murray Kessler, UST’s president and chief operating officer, says he will not be surprised if a cigarette company shows interest in snuff. “To some extent it validates what we have been saying: that there is an opportunity to convert adult smokers to smokeless, and that smokeless tobacco is a growing category.”UST has ramped up its efforts to convert adult smokers into snuff users as data suggest 63 per cent of new users are smokers or former smokers. With about 45m adult smokers in the US, opportunity abounds.While most new users enter the category with premium products, analysts say the price gap between the premium and deep-discount brands encourages consumers to trade down.According to Citigroup, the smokeless category grew 6.4 per cent in 2005, with most of the growth coming from the rapidly growing discount segment, which increased 28.8 per cent. The premium category, meanwhile, fell 2.5 per cent.While UST is a giant in the smokeless business – selling about 1.7m cans of snuff a day – it is a dwarf compared with the big cigarette companies.“If Reynolds or Philip Morris are moderately successful, it could have a modest overall favourable impact on their financial results, but it also has the potential to put significant incremental pressure on the incumbents in the market, especially UST,” says David Adelman, analyst at Morgan Stanley.With the premium segment already under pressure, the challenge will be to price smokeless product in a way that does not hurt the brand equity of the cigarette franchise, analysts say. UST’s Mr Kessler says he “couldn’t think of a worse time for a new entrant given the competitive marketplace”. But he concedes it could generate interest in the sector.Vince Gierer, UST’s chairman and chief executive, adds: “It is a validation of the category, and to my way of thinking it is not necessarily bad. To the extent the category could grow more than 4-5 per cent a year, that would be a good thing.”"
239;MO;Altria Group;2006-02-03T22:46:45Z;Wall Street throws the book at Amazon;;Amazon, the online retailer, became the latest internet company to disappoint investors after poorly-received figures from search engine Google earlier this week.Amazon shares plunged more than 10 per cent to $38.33 yesterday as its fourth-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations. Sales missed the target, earnings were sharply lower as aggressive discounts over the holiday period cut into margins, while its earnings forecast for the full year was lower than hoped.Anthony Noto, analyst at Goldman Sachs, cut his price target on the stock by up to $9 to $34-$38 and said the news “reinforced long-term concerns regarding structural issues with Amazon’s business model that are limiting growth in some categories and resulting in rising costs of growth”.Gateway further added to the technology sector’s woes after it also failed to meet analysts’ earnings expectations. Its shares slumped 13 per cent to $2.42 as Bear Stearns slashed its rating to “underperform”.Overall, the Nasdaq Composite index closed down 0.8 per cent at 2,262.58 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 each fell 0.5 per cent to 10,793.62 and 1,264.03, respectively.For the week, the Dow fell 1 per cent, the S&P dropped 1.5 per cent and the Nasdaq lost 1.8 per cent.The pullback capped a difficult week on Wall Street, which had to content with, among other things, mixed earnings results and the prospect of further rises in US interest rates following Tuesday’s Federal Reserve meeting.“This week’s trading, particularly the latter part of the week, has largely been driven by broadening fears of inflation,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Concerns that the Federal Reserve would further raise interest rates in March, and possibly again in May or June, were heightened by yesterday’s non-farm payroll numbers showing a higher-than-expected increase in hourly wages.The data suggested the labour market was tightening, which could lead to higher inflation.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said while higher wage growth could be good for the economy in the long run, in the short term, wage-induced inflation would have adverse effects on US equities since the Fed would be forced to continue its cycle of monetary tightening.“Not only would the cost of borrowing go up for corporate America but an interest rate increase would also make the fixed income market more attractive, drawing money out of stocks,” he said.Along with the Fed statement, the market was also pondering renewed worries about decelerating earnings growth after several sector bellwethers delivered mixed results.On the Dow, record quarterly earnings at ExxonMobil drove shares in the oil giant up 0.2 per cent higher for the week at $61.39, while aerospace group Boeing rose 4.2 per cent to $71.17 after it more than doubled its quarterly profit and raised earnings guidance.However, the strong performances were offset by sharp losses in Altria, down 5.2 per cent at $70.87, and Citigroup, down 3.9 per cent at $45.06.On Nasdaq, Google learned the perils of high expectations this week after an earnings increase that fell shy of investors’ hopes sent shares plummeting more than 16 per cent, or over $20bn, in after-hours trading on Tuesday.Although the numbers largely met analysts’ forecasts, investors have become accustomed to the company trumping such predictions. The stock managed to recover part of its losses however ending the week 12 per cent lower at $381.55.Elsewhere, January retail sales gave a lift to coffee chain Starbucks and clothing retailer Gap. The former jumped 6 per cent to $33.88, while the latter gained 7.2 per cent to $18.63 for the week.By contrast, the auto parts sector was under pressure following weaker-than-expected quarterly figures from Goodyear Tire & Rubber. The stock skidded 19.4 per cent to $15.21 over the five sessions, making it the worst performer on the S&P.Industrial group Honeywell was the best performer on the Dow, up 3.8 per cent after Citigroup upgraded the stock from “hold” to “buy”..
240;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Altadis enters Spain’s cigarette price war;;Altadis, the Spanish-French tobacco group, succumbed to a price war in its home market on Wednesday, announcing price cuts that could wipe €170m from group profits by the end of the year.Responding to last week’s move by US manufacturer Philip Morris to cut Spanish prices on its best-selling Marlboro cigarettes, Altadis said it would drop the price of its main Fortuna and Nobel brands from €2.50 to €1.85 and of most Ducados brands from €2.50 to €2.Tobacco companies are adjusting to new anti-smoking measures by the Spanish government, including a ban on smoking in offices and enclosed public spaces which took effect at the start of the year, with anecdotal evidence that people are responding.Aiming to curb the runaway growth of cheap brands, the government has also stopped kiosks selling tobacco, posing a challenge to tobacco companies’ logistics, and raised cigarette taxes.Altadis, which raised prices only last week in an attempt to pass the tax increase on to consumers, was taken aback by Philip Morris’s decision and said it wanted “to reiterate that it was impossible to act differently in these market conditions.”If prices remained at their new level, operating profit would take a hit of €170 in 2006, after a savings programme that would generate €80m in 2006, Altadis said. Michel Favre, finance director, said the cuts had been essential to maintain the group’s 30 per cent share of the Spanish market, and that it aimed to mitigate the impact by cutting €200m from costs over three years.In addition to the €80m, Altadis would save €46m in 2006 from the restructuring programme already in train, which would generate a total of €60m by 2008, he said. Altadis would reach its target with a further €60m saved from general and marketing expenses.Mr Favre told a conference call that Philip Morris’s price cuts had challenged the government, and that it was the responsibility of manufacturers to move pricing upward to a level where it could maintain a virtuous cycle.Competition has driven both Altadis and Philip Morris to launch brands selling as low as €1.35 recently. In comparison, a packet of low-cost cigarettes in the UK costs about £4.20 (€6.16)Altadis’ shares, which fell 10 per cent last week after Philip Morris’s price cut, were up 0.5 per cent to €34.68 by mid-morning.
241;MO;Altria Group;2006-01-31T22:28:14Z;Possibility of further rate hike weighs on Wall St;;"US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors interpreted comments that accompanied a widely expected quarter-point interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve to mean that the US central bank was not done with its cycle of monetary tightening.The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark interest rate to 4.5 per cent and signalled in its accompanying statement that further interest rate rises might be implemented to keep inflation at bay.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 per cent at 10,864.86 while the S&P 500 traded 0.4 per cent lower at 1,280.08.The Nasdaq Composite managed to recover most of its earlier losses however and ended the session one point lower at 2,305.82.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards and Sons, said the statement was more vague than he expected. “I find it disheartening that they would let economic data dictate what they would do with their [rate] policy,” he said.“You want the Fed to be proactive not reactive. By the time they get the data, it’s already in the rear view mirror.”Along with the Fed statement, the market was also pondering renewed worries over decelerating earnings growth after Altria and Goodyear Tire & Rubber delivered mixed results.Goodyear was the session’s worst performer, plunging more than 16 per cent to $15.64 after it delivered weaker-than-expected earnings for the fourth-quarter.The results prompted analysts at Deutsche Bank to cut their rating on the stock from “hold” to “sell”, citing among other things, concerns over the persistence of high raw material costs.The news also prompted a run on fellow tyremaker Cooper Tire & Rubber, down 8 per cent at $14.99Cigarette maker Altria and drugmaker Wyeth added to investors’ disappointment.Altria, owner of Kraft Foods and Philip Morris International, fell 2.1 cent to $72.34 after its fourth-quarter earnings came in below analyst estimates.Although Wyeth swung into a fourth-quarter profit, the figure came in a little below market forecasts, causing its shares to fall 1.5 per cent to $46.25.On the upside, ailing drugmaker Merck said cost-cutting and strong demand for its asthma and cholesterol medicines helped push its fourth-quarter profit slightly higher to beat Wall Street forecasts. Its shares edged up 0.1 per cent to $34.50.Fellow drugmaker Sepracor surged 17.6 per cent to $56.91 after it topped market expectations with its results.Elsewhere, Napster, the digital music company, shot up 25.3 per cent to $3.91
following reports that Google might be looking to buy it in an attempt to develop its own online music service.While Google ended up 1.4 per cent to $432.66 in regular trade, its shares slumped over 15 per cent in the after-market as earnings came in well short of what the market had been expecting.Google stock was down 15 .7 per cent at $364.85 in after-market trading."
242;MO;Altria Group;2020-04-24T06:51:47+0000;Altria reports growth but cuts forecasts;;Altria Group, the world’s largest tobacco firm, said fourth quarter profit rose 17.6 per cent as a strong performance in the tobacco business helped offset weaker results at its Kraft Foods subsidiary.But the company offered a cautious outlook and lower-than-expected 2006 guidance. Its shares fell 0.88 per cent to $73.26 in midday trade.“Circumstances affecting some of Philip Morris International’s key markets, most notably Spain, dictate a cautious earnings outlook this early in the year,” said Louis Camilleri, Altria’s chairman and chief executive.This month Spain’s government raised excise taxes on cigarette manufacturers in response to the proliferation of cheap cigarette brands, which it believes has led to increased consumption. PMI, Altria’s overseas tobacco arm, responded by reducing the prices of its cigarettes, including Marlboro.Mr Camilleri said the move was necessary to “restore the competitiveness” of its brands in a market where the deep-discount segment is growing. Spain is one of PMI’s most profitable markets and the move “comes at a huge price”, he added.Dinyar Devitre, chief financial officer, said the “painful but necessary action” would “severely impact” income levels in Spain this year.Altria forecast 2006 earnings from continuing operations of $4.85-$4.95 a share, with profit reduced by costs of 69 cents, including a charge of 36 cents a share for restructuring Kraft. A stronger US dollar will cut profit by 14 cents while lower income from Spain will slice off about 10 cents a share.Net income rose to $2.29bn or $1.09 a share from $1.95bn or 94 cents a year earlier. Revenue increased 9.4 per cent to $24.5bn.Altria is preparing to restructure the company and spin off Kraft. Mr Camilleri said the legal environment was improving and Altria remained “committed to the corporate restructuring we have talked about for some years”.
243;MO;Altria Group;2005-12-15T19:33:36Z;Court reverses $10bn Philip Morris ruling;;Philip Morris began to emerge from the cloud of litigation overshadowing the tobacco industry since the 1980s on Thursday after judges in Illinois reversed a $10bn verdict against Marlboro Lights and other low-tar cigarettes.The class action award, alleging that smokers were misled about whether such cigarettes were safer, was seen as the most challenging of three big cases remaining against Altria, the parent company, and may hasten a proposed corporate break-up.It also points to an improving litigation environment for corporate America more broadly, as legislation to reform class action law and a changing mood among judges begins to weaken the power of plaintiff lawyers.“Any industry that confronts cases under consumer protection statutes – and that is every industry in America – will breathe a huge sigh of relief after this ruling,” says Michael Greve, a class action expert at the American Enterprise Institute, which advocates reform of the American litigation system.Analysts said the nature of the ruling was a “best-case scenario” for Altria because it made it harder to bring similar class actions by smokers of “lights” in other states. “The lights case has been the biggest hurdle for Altria’s board to break up its company and there is no question that it is now much closer to this event,” said Bonnie Herzog of Citigroup.Altria declined to comment other than to say it was “gratified” by the court’s decision. But Louis Camilleri, its chief executive, recently told analysts he thought emerging legal “clarity” should pave the way for an imminent restructuring likely to involve spinning off its Kraft Foods subsidiary and possibly Philip Morris overseas businesses too.The Illinois court’s ruling focused on the fact that the Federal Trade Commission, the federal consumer protection watchdog, had authorised tobacco companies to describe their products as “light” or “low tar”. The court found that Illinois state law precludes such suits when a federal agency has acted in this way.“The FTC could, and did, specifically authorise all United States tobacco companies to utilise the words ‘low’, ‘lower’, ‘reduced’ or like qualifying terms, such as ‘light’,” the majority ruling said.The opinion was written in a way that makes review by the US Supreme Court extremely unlikely, legal experts said.The court made clear that it disapproved more generally of such lawsuits, in which the plaintiffs fail to establish “that they sustained actual damages”, in the words of two justices who wrote a concurring opinion.Although the Illinois court’s ruling has no direct impact on other state courts, the fact the state has long been among the most plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions means a change of of heart by its justices is viewed as significant nationwide.“One would be foolish to bring a tobacco class action in Illinois or most other kinds of consumer class actions in Illinois,” says Prof Dick Daynard of the Tobacco Control Resource Centre at Northeastern University law school. “The court clearly is sending out signals that we don’t like these things.”
244;MO;Altria Group;2005-12-14T18:29:02Z;BAT puts issue on hold as suit looms;;"British American Tobacco on Wednesday postponed a planned bond issue amid investor uncertainty about the outcome of a US litigation case on Thursday, which could have implications for the whole tobacco industry.The company planned to sell a bond of benchmark size, which typically means £300m or more, with a 10-year maturity this week.BAT said on Monday morning that it had hired Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank and HSBC to lead-manage the sale. A few hours later, news emerged that the Illinois Supreme Court would today announce whether it would throw out a $10.1bn claim against Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes and part of the Altria Group.Yesterday, BAT, the maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes, told investors it had postponed the issue. “BAT has determined that, in light of the delay caused by the pending US litigation announcement on Thursday, and the proximity to seasonal slowdown in the
capital markets, [it] will not progress with the potential sterling transaction at this time,” said a spokesperson.Investors welcomed the decision. “It was a sensible thing to do. Investors would have found it very difficult to commit to a deal one day before a big announcement,” said Neil Murray, portfolio manager at Scottish Widows Investment Partnership.The judgment against Philip Morris USA is known as the Price “lights” case. The Illinois Supreme Court is considering an appeal against a $10.1bn damages award that was granted after a judge ruled Philip Morris had deceived consumers into thinking that “light”, or low-tar, cigarettes were safer than regular-tar ones."
245;MO;Altria Group;2005-11-22T21:31:46Z;Wall St gets a boost from Fed minutes;;Wall Street enjoyed an afternoon bounce on Tuesday after minutes from the most recent meeting of the Federal Reserve suggested that an end to the current series of interest rate rises could be in sight.Minutes of the November 1 meeting of the US central bank’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said “some members cautioned that risks of going too far with the tightening process could also eventually emerge.”By the close of trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading 51.15 points, or 0.47 per cent, higher at 10,871.43. The broader S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent, or 6.38 points, at 1,261.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index, was up 0.53 per cent, or 11.89 points, at 2,253.56.Interest-rate-sensitive stocks bolstered the Dow, including retail giant Wal-Mart, which rose 1.2 per cent to $50.20, and, Altria, parent of cigarette maker Philip Morris, which climbed 2.1 per cent to $73.12.Retail stocks were also helped by the National Retail Federation, which raised its growth forecast for the Christmas shopping season to 6 per cent from the 5 per cent rate it projected two months ago. The group cited lower petrol costs and strong October sales as the reasons for the revised forecast. Target gained 0.3 per cent to $55.07.The car sector was back in focus after General Motors was hit by a fresh wave of selling.Once a bellwether stock in the US, the ailing carmaker added to Monday’s 2 per cent loss, dropping another 1.3 per cent to $23.27.Not even the news of a radical restructuring on Monday could lift sentiment towards GM. The shares have lost 14 per cent of their value since the beginning of the month and 42 per cent since the start of the year amid mounting concerns over GM’s financial problems and fears that a strike at Delphi, its main supplier, could bankrupt it.GM’s woes weighed on the rest of the sector, with parts maker Visteon off 1.1 per cent to $6.91.In the absence of major economic data, earnings provided much of the direction elsewhere in the market.Contact lens maker Cooper Companies fell 20.55 per cent to $51.50 after it lowered its fiscal fourth quarter revenue and earnings estimates. Sentiment was further dented after Citigroup cut its rating on the stock.Tech Data had a better day, surging 10.2 per cent to $38.42 after third-quarter earnings fell less than expected. The company, which distributes technology products, is widely considered to be a good thermometer for demand in the sector.Chipmakers Micron Technology and Intel were in high demand after the two announced a joint venture to manufacture Nand flash memory chips in an effort to tap into one of the chip industry’s fastest-growing segments. Micron rose 3.3 per cent to $14.67 while Intel gained 3.6 per cent to $26.16.
246;MO;Altria Group;2005-10-19T21:14:35Z;Global investors face heavy dose of worries;;A sharp sell-off spread across global equities on Thursday on the 18th anniversary of the start of the 1987 stock market crash.European and Asian markets suffered heavy falls on concerns that rising inflation and interest rates in the US and elsewhere may trigger a bout of investor risk aversion and investment outflows out of riskier assets such as emerging markets.Disappointing results from Intel also put pressure on technology stocks worldwide and those markets with a heavy reliance on the sector.A raft of markets racked up heavy losses. In Asia, the fallers included Tokyo, where the Nikkei 225 Average dropped for the sixth day in a row, sliding 1.7 per cent. That took its fall since an October 11 peak to 3.2 per cent.The tech-heavy Seoul market dropped 2.8 per cent, Singapore eased 2.4 per cent, Taipei fell 2.3 per cent, Hong Kong slipped 1.5 per cent, Sydney retreated 1.8 per cent and India dropped 1.9 per cent.The selling spread to Europe, which also was hit by concerns that rising inflation will put pressure on the European Central Bank to raise interest rates. The biggest faller of the day was the German market, given the high exposure of its largest companies to US exports. The Xetra Dax index dropped 2.1 per cent to 4,845.98.The falls on other European markets were not so steep, but the UK market experienced its biggest one-day drop of the year. The FTSE 100 fell 1.83 per cent to 5,167.8.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index declined 1.7 per cent to 1,172.70, its biggest fall since the London bombings on July 7.Wall Street showed a little more resilience as the market was bolstered by a slew of strong earnings reports from heavyweight companies, including Yahoo, JPMorgan Chase, Altria and Motorola.By the close of trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent at 10,408.45, while the S&P 500 index advanced 1.4 per cent to 1,195.13. The Nasdaq Composite finished 1.6 per cent ahead at 2,089.44.“Investors are besieged by a heavy dose of worries,” said Quincy Krosby, strategist at The Hartford insurance group.That cautious mood reflected in an increase in the so-called “investor fear gauge” – the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index or Vix. The Vix, which reflects the implied volatility of options on the S&P 500 index, gives an indication of the price investors are willing to pay for insurance against sharp market moves.When it rises, investors are clearly becoming more risk-averse. The index firmed by 0.36 per cent to 15.59 – below peaks of nearly 18 after the credit downgrades of Ford and General Motors in May but up from a low of 9.88 in July.Spreads on emerging market bonds – another benchmark of investor risk appetite also widened. The spreads on JPMorgan’s EMBI+ index over US Treasuries widened 6 basis points to 273 points.Bonds in the US and Europe benefited from their safe-haven status. Yields on the 10-year US Treasury note dropped 3.2 basis points to 4.443 per cent, while yields on the 10-year Bund fell 2 basis points to 3.259 per cent.The dollar was also an initial beneficiary of speculation about rising US interest rates. The greenback hit a two-year high against the yen and three-month peak against the euro before sliding back.
247;MO;Altria Group;2005-10-19T14:02:57Z;Marlboro sales boost Altria;;Altria, the tobacco and food group, saw its market share of the US tobacco business rise above 50 per cent in the third quarter, as strong cigarette sales offset weakness at its Kraft Foods subsidiary.The company, which owns the Phillip Morris tobacco companies, reported an 9.3 per cent increase in net earnngs from continuing operations to $2.88bn, or $1.38 a share, against the same period last year, ahead of Wall Street’s expectations.The company also narrowed its earnings guidance for 2005, to $5.05 to $5.10, from $5.00 to $5.10 previously. Louis Camilleri, chief executive, said the year “is shaping up to be a year of robust progress”.“During the third quarter, particularly strong results in our tobacco businesses were partially offset by continuing challenges at Kraft,” he said.Altria’s Kraft Foods, which trades separately as a public company, on Tuesday cut its full-year earnings forecast as it succumbed to persistently high energy and commodity costs, reducing its third-quarter earnings by 11 per cent.The maker of Oreos and DiGiorno frozen pizzas highlighted the rising cost of PET resin, used in plastic packaging, which was up “substantially”.Plastic-related costs are Kraft’s second-largest input cost after cheese.Kraft’s energy and commodity costs rose by $200m in the third quarter, with year-to-date costs up by $600m.The company’s Philip Morris USA unit shipped 47.9bn cigarettes in the quarter, down 0.9 percent from a year earlier. But market share for its top-selling Marlboro brand rose to 40.1 percent from 39.6 percent, and the company’s overall market share increased to 50.1 per cent from 49.9 per cent previously.Philip Morris International shipped 217bn cigarettes, up 9 percent. The volue of sales in Asia increased 40.4 per cent, which the company said was primarily because of the acquisition of Sampoerna in Indonesia, as well as gains in the Philippines. Excluding Sampoerna, volume was up 0.8 per cent. Philip Morris International achieved a 26.7 per cent share in Indonesia in the third quarter following the acquisition of Sampoerna..
248;MO;Altria Group;2005-10-17T20:25:18Z;Blue-chip stocks boosted by GM news;;Blue-chip stocks led Wall Street higher on Monday as rare good news from automaker General Motors and a court victory for the tobacco industry outweighed worries that another tropical storm could be heading for the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico.In spite of a jump in oil prices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.6 per cent higher at 10,348.10, with the wider S&P 500 gaining 0.3 per cent at 1,190.10 and the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite firming 0.3 per cent to 2,070.30.Citing the news from GM and the relative success of the weekend’s referendum in Iraq, Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said: “I would have been upset if the market hadn’t risen. We’ve had two weeks of sloppy action and the market was oversold.”With valuations “reasonable” and money piling up on the sidelines, Mr Goldman said the “table was set for a party” if the newsflow turned positive. GM did its best to provide some cheer by saying it had reached an agreement with the United Auto Workers’ union that would reduce its long-term retiree healthcare liabilities by $15bn and save it $3bn a year in healthcare costs. GM added that it was exploring the possible sale of GMAC, its financing arm and planned to cut 25,000 jobs.GM shares rose 7.5 per cent to $30.09 as the news overshadowed widening third quarter losses.Auto parts supplier Lear rose 4.8 per cent to $30.52 on news that it was to team up with private equity group WL Ross to explore acquisition possibilities in the troubled sector.Parts maker Dana, 13.1 per cent better at $7.19, was buoyed both by the news that the UAW was ready to strike deals and that Lear was on the acquisition trail. Peer Visteon also rose 3.7 per cent to $8.40.Tobacco stocks rose after the US Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision that the US government could not levy $280bn in penalties if it wins a civil racketeering lawsuit against the industry. Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, rose 6.1 per cent to an all-time high of $74.96 and Reynolds American added 6.4 per cent at $83.80.But Citigroup fell 0.5 per cent to $44.70 as third quarter results were in line with forecasts. Peer Wachovia rose 0.6 per cent to $48.12 as its results fractionally beat expectations.Newell Rubbermaid jumped 8.7 per cent to $23.73 as Joseph Galli resigned as chief executive after failing to turn round the plastic container group.Nortel Networks rose 5.5 per cent to $3.48 as the telecoms equipment maker named former Motorola No.2 Mike Zafirovski as its new CEO.Krispy Kreme Doughnuts fell 5.4 per cent to an all-time low of $4.60 when trading was re-started after an earlier suspension. The company said its Freedom Rings subsidiary had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy owing the doughnut chain $24.1m.
249;MO;Altria Group;2005-10-17T15:10:54Z;Supreme Court rejects tobacco ruling appeal;;Altria moved a crucial step closer to breaking itself apart after the US Supreme Court rejected government efforts to use racketeering laws to fine the tobacco industry $280bn.The court's refusal to hear a last-ditch government appeal lifts the spectre of bankruptcy from much of the industry and helps pave the way for Altria, the largest US cigarette maker, to try to unlock shareholder value by spinning its Kraft Foods and Philip Morris subsidiaries into separate companies.Several multi-billion-dollar court cases remain outstanding, but the failure of prosecutors to use organised crime laws in pursuit of record-breaking fines against Big Tobacco begins to clear a cloud that has overshadowed the industry for much of the last two decades.“This is the big one,” said Wesley Moultrie, an analyst with Fitch Ratings. “It removes once and for all the potential of a fine that would have crippled the industry.”Altria shares surged in Monday morning trading - rising eight per cent to an all time high - as did those of other companies affected such as RJ Reynolds and BAT.The case, which began under the Clinton administartion, went to trial between September 2004 and June 2005 and sought the so-called $280bn “disgorgement” against companies as remedy for years of alleged fraud in promoting smoking despite knowledge of the health risks.A judge has still to rule on the case itself and the US Justice Department is department is separately seeking $10 billion to fund a five-year smoking cessation plan and $4 billion for a separate public education campaign.The industry is already banned from advertising cigarettes on billboards and displaying brand logos on ball caps and other merchandise under a 1998 settlement with 46 US states.The US Chamber of Commerce welcomed the decision to rule out the larger disgorgement yesterday, saying it could help to protect businesses well beyond the tobacco industry.Though the court gave no reason for its decision not to hear the case, the fact that it refused a government request to intervene suggests that the justices want to discourage “an unauthorized and unprecedented expansion of the RICO [rackateering] statute”, according to Robin Conrad of the Chamber's litigation arm, the National Chamber Litigation Center. “This should be a strong signal to the government not to pursue this remedy against any other industry,” she said.But William Corr, director of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an anti-smoking advocacy group, yesterday called on the government to pursue strong remedies against the tobacco companies, despite yesterday's setback to their case.The government “should not use the Supreme Court's decision as an excuse to let the tobacco companies off the hook with a weak settlement,” he said in a statement, noting that the court could still require the industry to pay tens of billions of dollars to fund smoking cessation and public education programmes, or impose other remedies.William Ohlemeyer, associate general counsel for Altria, said: ”Philip Morris USA believe the US Supreme Court appropriately denied the Government's petition to review the February 2005 opinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That opinion concluded disgorgement was not an available remedy under the civil RICO statute used in this case.”
250;MO;Altria Group;2005-08-09T22:59:25Z;Tobacco groups advertise more but sell less;;"The five biggest tobacco companies spent $15.2bn on US advertising and promotion of cigarettes in 2003, an increase of more than 20 per cent from a year earlier and the highest figure ever reported to the Federal Trade Commission.A report issued on Tuesday by the Washington regulator said the five tobacco giants nevertheless sold 19.8bn fewer cigarettes in 2003 a 5 per cent decline in sales in spite of the advertising and marketing push.Tobacco companies opted to increase the marketing of cigarettes even as they began to roll back their campaigns in order to reduce youth smoking, the report found.Cigarette manufacturers in 2003 spent $72.9m on ads intended to reduce smoking directed towards youth or their parents, a decline of 1.8 per cent from the previous year.The annual report also shows tobacco companies have more than doubled their marketing campaigns since 1998, the year the tobacco industry reached a landmark $206bn settlement with the US states. The report is based on information released to the FTC by Altria, the parent of Philip Morris; Reynolds American; Houchens Industries, parent of Commonwealth Brands; and other tobacco companies.Anti-tobacco lobbyists said the marketing figures underscored that the tobacco industry has done little to “change its ways” in recent years, in spite of promises to curb advertisements directed at youth.“The main thing is the staggering amount that is spent marketing a product that kills half the people that use it,” said Danny McGoldrick, director of research at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The FTC said price discounts paid to retailers and wholesalers to reduce the price of cigarettes represented the biggest category of expenditures, accounting for nearly $11bn in spending in 2003.The next two largest spending categories were “retail-value-added” promotions involving free cigarettes and coupons."
251;MO;Altria Group;2005-07-20T21:00:32Z;Wall Street bounces back after GM disappointment;;Shares staged a strong recovery on Wednesday after Wall Street was knocked off course by an unexpected loss from General Motors and disappointing results from two leading tech companies.Before the start of trading, GM reported a financial performance that even the car marker’s chief executive described as “very disappointing”, sending shares down 0.7 per cent to $36.58.The markets then spent much of the first half of the day in negative territory as results from Yahoo and Intel raised concerns about revenue growth.Intel made a slight recovery but was still 4.4 per cent down at $27.44 after the chipmaker announced earnings on Tuesday that satisfied expectations on Wall Street. Margins, however, were less than expected.It was a similar story at Yahoo, which hit earnings forecasts but missed revenue targets. The internet search engine saw shares close 11.5 per cent down at $33.40. Google also fell 0.7 per cent on the news, down to $312.Analysts said the market had become overly-sensitive to poor earnings figures and that recent upward momentum would be sustained.“The earnings numbers have been getting better and better all week and that has raised expectations too high,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist, at Wells Capital Management. “Even when Yahoo met expectations it still got hit. But despite the bad headlines the market is basically unchanged.”By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average had recovered and up 0.4 per cent at 10,689.15. The S&P 500, which had been down 0.3 per cent, was up 0.5 per cent at 1,235.2 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent at 2,188.57.Alan Greenspan helped dispel the market’s suddenly bearish mood when he testified to Congress. The Federal Reserve chairman said the outlook for the US economy was good and that the central bank should keep tightening interest rates.The S&P 500 was also bolstered by a good performance from the world’s largest biotechnology company. Amgen saw its share price jump by 15 per cent to $81.17 after reporting a 38 per cent increase in second-quarter profit and raising its full year forecast.PepsiCo shares slipped after Dominique de Villepin, the French prime minister, condemned speculation that the soft-drink maker was ready to take over Danone, the French food group.Mr Villepin said he would defend the interests of one of the “flowers of our industry”. Danone shares rose in Paris, while PepsiCo’s fell 1.7 per cent to $54.60.Eastman Kodak fell 2.2 per cent to $28.10. The world’s largest photography company announced its third consecutive quarterly loss, saying it would cut 10,000 more jobs.Maytag shares fell 11 per cent to $15.61 after Chinese company Haier announced it had given up trying to takeover the US appliance maker. Shares in Whirlpool, which offered $1.35bn earlier in the week, were up 0.9 per cent at $76.10.
252;MO;Altria Group;2005-06-08T23:23:40Z;Tobacco debate inflamed by cut in penalties;;The US Justice Department's decision to reduce radically the penalties it was seeking in a landmark case against tobacco companies from an expected $130bn (£71bn) to $10bn prompted the federal judge overseeing the case to question the government's motives on Wednesday.Gladys Kessler, a US district judge, said of the change: “Perhaps there are some additional influences being brought to bear on the government's position in this case.”This week an attorney for the Justice Department, Stephen Brody, surprised both tobacco company executives and anti-tobacco lobbyists when he called for tobacco companies to pay $10bn an “initial request” over the next five years to fund an anti-smoking campaign. Michael Fiore, a government witness and medical professor, had suggested the companies pay $130bn over 25 years in an earlier phase of the trial.The decision prompted outrage among Democratic lawmakers. Senator Edward Kennedy and others called on the inspector-general to investigate the Justice Department's request and accused the Bush administration of pandering to the powerful tobacco lobby.The long-running case, filed in 1999, centres on the government's allegation that the leading tobacco companies, including Altria's Philip Morris, Loews's Lorillard Tobacco, and Reynolds, among others, conspired to promote smoking and misled the public on its dangers. Ted Wells, an attorney for Philip Morris, maintained yesterday that the government's proposed sanction whether it cost the industry $10bn or $130bn was “a fatally flawed programme”.The Justice Department's case was dealt a severe blow in April when a federal appeals court declined to reconsider a ruling that prevented the government from seeking $280bn in past profits from cigarette makers.The department on Wednesday night said: “The government's suggested cessation programme is only an initial requirement…the court can extend and expand the programme to exceed the $10bn/five-year programme proposed in order to prevent and restrain the continuation of fraudulent activities by the tobacco companies.”
253;MO;Altria Group;2005-06-08T20:25:17Z;Wall St lower despite semiconductor boost;;A fall in oil prices and the prospect of improved fortunes in the semiconductor industry failed to inspire investors on Wednesday amid uncertainty about the prospect for further interest rate rises.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 6.21 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 10,476.86. The S&P 500 fell 2.59 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 1,194.67, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 6.98 points to 2,060.18.A sputtering late-afternoon performance erased early gains and mirrored the stock market’s disappointing showing on Tuesday, when the Dow firmed but the S&P and Nasdaq ended lower after trading higher for much of the day.Semiconductors led technology shares higher after Texas Instruments raised its guidance for the coming quarter. But investors hesitated ahead of testimony on Thursday from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who is expected to provide guidance on the likelihood of further interest rate rises.Margaret Patel, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investments in Boston, said low bond yields meant stocks remained attractive in spite of their dithering this year.Ms Patel said she was putting money into shares in speciality chemicals groups and other economically sensitive sectors.Texas Instruments rose 2.3 per cent to $27.90. The company said cost savings and a pick-up in demand should lead to profits at the high end of the expected range.National Semiconductor, an analogue chip rival, rose 0.3 per cent to $19.90.Shares in Intel, the world’s biggest maker of computer chips, traded 0.9 per cent higher at $27.10. The company is expected to give an update on its third-quarter prospects today.International Business Machines slipped 0.3 per cent after it said it would open up the source code of one of its computer chips to developers.Google, the internet search company, pulled back after nearing $300 a share on Tuesday. The shares fell 4.6 per cent to $279.56.Tobacco shares rose after the US Justice Department cut the amount of money it wants to claim from tobacco companies to help fund anti-smoking campaigns.Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, rose 1.4 per cent to $68.75. Reynolds American, which makes Camel cigarettes, rose 0.6 per cent to $83.48.IAC/InterActiveCorp, the media group controlled by Barry Diller, jumped 4.8 per cent to $25.81 after it agreed to sell its 5.4 per cent stake in Vivendi Universal, the entertainment group, to NBC Universal for $3.4bn.Shares in General Electric, which owns 80 per cent of NBC, fell 0.1 per cent on news of the deal.McDonald’s, the fast food chain, fell 1.2 per cent to $29.23 in spite of same-store sales rising in May.General Motors, the carmaker, rose 4.2 per cent to $32.02 after Kirk Kerkorian, the financier, raised his stake to 7.2 per cent. Mr Kerkorian fell short of his stated goal of raising his stake to 8.8 per cent.Siebel Systems fell 1.9 per cent after the software group gave in to shareholder pressure and declared a quarterly dividend. Investors had been clamouring for a piece of the company’s significant cash pile.
254;MO;Altria Group;2005-05-19T12:45:42Z;Lex: SABMiller;;There is always something new coming out of Africa, the ancient Greeks feared. But then, they never had to deal with the solid news from SABMiller. With underlying revenues up 8 per cent and operating profits up 18 per cent for the year, it continues to stand out among the world's brewers, even leaving aside the latest boost from currencies.Weak spots were rare. But some might yet cause headaches. Peroni, SABMiller's last big acquisition, is under pressure in its Italian home market. In the US, the evidence that Miller Lite's strength is benefiting its other brands has weakened. Renewed aggression from Anheuser-Busch limits the scope for price rises.Add renewed acquisition fears and a looming share-overhang, and it is no wonder that SABMiller's shares have underperformed in recent months. But on most valuation measures, they are again quite appealing. A quick sale of Altria's effective 36 per cent stake with the lock-up expiring on June 30 seems unlikely, while macroeconomic risks in South Africa appear limited for now.Given its growing war chest, SABMiller might be tempted into a pricey purchase in Latin America. But it has historically shunned most trophy hunts and instead focused on gaining commanding positions in attractive markets. Its progress on margins suggests that there might actually be such a thing as cross-border synergies in brewing. If so, there are currently few more attractive ways to bet on it.
255;MO;Altria Group;2005-04-20T13:06:03Z;Cigarette companies win in court;;A federal appeals court on Wednesday declined to reconsider a recent ruling that prevented the US government from seeking $280bn in past profits from cigarette makers.The 3-3 vote by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit leaves standing a three-judge panel’s rejection of “disgorgement” as a remedy in the civil racketeering case against the industry.The lawsuit, filed in 1999, is aimed at Altria Group and its Philip Morris USA unit, among others. The decision is a blow to the Justice Department’s case and a big victory for the tobacco industry. It came on the same day Altria reported an 18.3 per cent rise in first-quarter profits, helped by strong cigarette sales and improvements at Kraft Foods.The US conglomerate that owns the Philip Morris tobacco group and 85 per cent of Kraft said net income rose to $2.6bn from $2.19bn a year ago. Earnings from continuing operations, including one-off items, were $1.24 a share, a penny better than forecasts. Revenue rose 8.7 per cent to $23.6bn from $21.7bn.“Philip Morris USA delivered another quarterly increase in retail share, driven by Marlboro, and strong income growth,” said Louis Camilleri, the chairman and chief executive. “In another difficult quarter for the entire cigarette industry in western Europe, Philip Morris International posted widespread share gains and a 13.1 per cent increase in income, which was enhanced by favourable currency and a one-time inventory sale to its new distributor in Italy.”During the quarter PM USA, Altria’s domestic tobacco arm, shipped 42.8bn cigarettes, down 0.7 per cent from a year ago but flat when adjusted for an extra shipping day in the first quarter of 2004 and the timing of promotional shipments.PM USA’s share of the US market improved in the first quarter of 2005, driven by sales of Marlboro cigarettes, Altria said.PMI, Altria’s overseas tobacco arm, shipped 200.9bn units, up 2.1 per cent. The rise reflected higher volume in Italy as a result of a one-off inventory sale to PMI’s new distributor, continued strong recovery in France and gains in many other markets in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Asia, partially offset by lower shipments in Germany, the company said.On Tuesday, Kraft reported a 27 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings on lower restructuring costs and a tax boost. However, it lowered its full-year earnings estimate by 2 cents a share to $1.73-$1.78 a share because of higher than expected restructuring charges..
256;MO;Altria Group;2005-03-20T22:01:47Z;Indonesia to raise cigarette tax;;Indonesia plans to increase cigarette taxes, just days after Philip Morris announced the biggest takeover in the country's history the proposed US$5.2bn acquisition of local producer HM Sampoerna.In an interview with the Financial Times, Jusuf Kalla, Indonesian vice-president, praised the investment by Philip Morris International part of Altria, the world's largest tobacco group as an act of ?very big confidence? in the Indonesian economy.But he warned that the government was working on a plan to increase excise taxes on cigarettes, a move he said was necessary to increase government revenues and ?for health?.Altria's proposed acquisition follows years of declining foreign direct investment in south-east Asia's biggest economy amid concern over the country's high levels of corruption and regulatory risk.Jakarta has been reluctant to raise cigarette taxes because of pressure from a powerful indigenous clove cigarette industry which Altria is now seeking to join by acquiring Sampoerna, the number three producer.Anti-tobacco activists argue that reluctance to raise taxes or impose other restrictions has helped make Indonesia one of the most smoking-friendly countries in the world, with 217bn cigarettes expected to be sold there this year.According to the World Bank, taxes now make up just 33 per cent of the average retail price of cigarettes in Indonesia, compared with 75 per cent or more in many developed countries.Mr Kalla said the government of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, which took office last October, planned to change that, although it had yet to determine a time frame for any cigarette tax increases and planned to make any changes ?step by step? and ?not dramatically?.It was also still considering how it could sign on to the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which took effect this month and has 58 signatory countries. The convention calls for strict limits on advertising and prominent health warnings on cigarette packs.Jakarta's decision is unlikely to affect Altria's interest in Indonesia, one of the few growing cigarette markets worldwide.After announcing the deal last Monday, the company said it expected taxes eventually to increase. But Mr Kalla's announcement caught the company off-guard with a spokeswoman for Philip Morris Inter-national saying: ?We are not aware of any planned increases.?Altria's acquisition is seen as remarkable in Indonesia because it has the blessing of the family that has controlled Sampoerna for almost a century.As in many parts of Asia, the country's family-owned conglomerates have traditionally been reluctant to cede control to outsiders.The US company has already acquired 40 per cent of Sampoerna, mostly from the family, and has made a tender offer for remaining shares.
257;MO;Altria Group;2005-02-27T20:47:26Z;Treaty to curb tobacco use comes into force;;A landmark international pact to curb tobacco use, the world's first-ever public health treaty, came into force on Sunday amid concerns by anti-smoking activists that tobacco industry lobbying and lack of resources will weaken its implementation.The World Health Organisation says the treaty, endorsed by its 192 member states in 2003, could save millions of lives. Tobacco is the second leading cause of death worldwide, killing nearly 5m people a year, and on current trends may kill double that number by 2020, 70 per cent of them in developing countries.Known as the framework convention on tobacco control, the treaty has been ratified by 57 countries, representing 2.3bn people, and signed by 167 nations and the European Commission.It requires governments to ban or severely restrict all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, ensure large explicit health warnings on cigarette packets and outlaw misleading terms such as ?light? or ?mild?.Other provisions are designed to curb smuggling, prevent sales to children, raise cigarette prices and protect people from second-hand smoke.But anti-tobacco groups and WHO officials accuse the tobacco industry, which lobbied against the treaty during the negotiations, of trying to delay ratifications and water down domestic legislation intended to translate the convention into national law.Corporate Accountability International, a US non-governmental organisation, says leading tobacco companies such as Philip Morris (Altria), British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are using ?dirty tricks? in a bid to derail the treaty. The group claims that BAT last year paid for a beach weekend for 75 Kenyan members of parliament, intended to influence their consideration of a tobacco control bill now before the legislature.Vera da Costa e Silva, director of WHO's tobacco-free initiative, also accuses tobacco companies of working to discourage countries from ratifying the convention. She cites Brazil as an example, where the industry has enlisted the support of influential tobacco farmers.Another concern is the waning interest of the international community and declining funding for tobacco control in the face of the huge financial clout of the industry. Combined revenues for the ?big three? tobacco companies amounted to nearly $150bn (?113bn, ?78bn) in 2003.Derek Yach, professor of global public health at Yale University in the US and previously the top WHO official responsible for the treaty negotiations, says other health priorities such as Aids have elbowed tobacco out of the limelight and many leading donors have stopped supporting tobacco control.Work on additional protocols to the treaty needs to start urgently, he says, noting that in 2003 Altria and BAT spent over $500m on developing new tobacco products.www.who.int/tobacco
258;MO;Altria Group;2005-02-15T19:27:06Z;Questions remain as smoke clears;;"In tobacco land, everyone is watching for smoke signals.Now a federal appeals court has thrown out the possibility of a $280bn penalty against the tobacco industry as part of the government's civil racketeering suit, there are two key questions left.Will the government pursue a settlement with the cigarette companies? And when could Altria Group, the US conglomerate that owns the Philip Morris tobacco units and 84 per cent of Kraft Foods, be in a position to spin off the rest of its food subsidiary?If the industry opts tosettle, as some think it might, analysts said that the amount involved would be small and would belikely to go towards funding stop-smoking or public education programmes.Judy Hong, US food and tobacco analyst at Goldman Sachs, does not expect the tobacco companies to agree to a settlement involving any “meaningful” financial sum. “However, a settlement involving marketing restrictions could be possible,”she said in a report.The Federal Appeals Court ruling this month is a serious blow to the US government's case - now in its fifth month - because it essentially leaves only non-monetary remedies, such as further restrictions on advertising and marketing, if the government wins the racketeering case.But for the tobacco industry, it was a major victory. Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Smith Barney, said the industry “is in the driving seat and has the leverage” and a settlement may be a way for the tobacco companies to resolve some of the legal uncertainty.Morgan Stanley said a settlement might now be more likely given that the ruling “is likely to cause a drastic reduction in the DOJ's assessment of the case's value”. Also, given thatthe industry would probably still prefer to avoid therisk of an adverse rulingby Judge Gladys Kessler, who is hearing the racketeering case, “there is probably increased incentive to reach a settlement beforethe end of the trial”.Investors, the firm noted, would view a “‘reasonable' settlement, perhaps with extra marketing restrictions and some concessions on regulation, favourably”.The government will on Wednesday file a brief laying out the non-monetary remedies it is seeking from the industry.Speculation over the outcome of the racketeering case in which the government alleges that tobacco makers defrauded consumers by denying the dangers of smoking and second-hand cigarette smoke comes as Altria is positioning itself for a possible restructuring.Louis Camilleri, Altria's chairman and chief executive, has worked hard to reduce litigation threats against Philip Morris USA but the company still has big hurdles to overcome before it can attempt a break-up.Doing so before three outstanding litigation issues are resolved the DoJ suit and two pending multi-billion-dollar appeals could open it to charges of “fraudulent conveyance”, or disposing of assets to protect them from being used to pay damages.In November, when Mr Camilleri announced that Altria was considering splitting into two or three separate entities, he said it was “beginning to make the necessary preparations to assure execution readiness” once litigation risks subsided but added: “I need to stress that continuing improvements in the litigation environment are a prerequisite to consideration of such action by the board.”Mr Camilleri specified three big ongoing lawsuits as hurdles to restructuring: the DoJ case; Engle; and Price “lights”.In the Engle class-action case, the Florida Supreme Court is considering whether to reinstate a $145bn damages award against tobacco makers of which Altria's share is $74bn. The award had been thrown out by an appeals court.In the Price class-action claim, the Illinois Supreme Court is considering an appeal against a $10.1bn damages award that was granted after a judge ruled Philip Morris USA had deceived consumers into thinking that “light” or low-tar cigarettes were safer than regular ones.Analysts expect decisions on both class-action cases to be handed down during the first half of 2005, or early in the third quarter.Given the timing of the expected rulings, a further announcement on Altria's restructuring is seen as unlikely before the second half of the year. And if the government appeals the recent disgorgement ruling to the US Supreme Court would that scuttle Altria's restructuring plans?Ms Herzog said while there was a “decent” chance - 60 per cent, she reckons - the government would appeal, there is also a chance the industry decides to settle.“Although there is a higher chance that the government pursues an appeal …we do not believe this will prevent a break-up of Altria Group,” she said."

The Nasdaq Composite index inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,104.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent up at 10,572.55, mosrtly thanks to Altria Group.Stocks have enjoyed a prolonged rally and have yet to experience a retrenchment that even bulls admit will be needed before the market can climb further. Optimists say such a retreat would be healthy and see it only as a pause en route to further gains.The present rally has lasted 17 sessions and approaches the four consecutive weeks noted by some traders as the average lifespan of so-called buyer panic rallies, which the current rally resembles. During such advances, trading volumes rise alongside share prices, indicating that investors buy stocks motivated primarily by the fear of missing out on gains.However, Louise Yamada and Ron Daino of the technical research team at Smith Barney have pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reversed a medium-term sell indication into a buy signal. They add that all other equity market indices are giving similar signals and said their initial target for the Dow is 11,300, about 6.4 per cent from its level on Thursday.Among mostly tepid performances for Dow stocks, Altria Group shares put on 2.2 per cent to $58.70 after an upgrade by Goldman Sachs and Prudential analysts who were sceptical that a government lawsuit against the tobacco industry would succeed. Altria owns Philip Morris USA, the largest of the companies targeted.Elsewhere on the corporate news front, the shares of Applied Materials were 1.8 per cent higher at $17.65 after the chipmaker announced its best financial year since 2000 but warned that momentum was likely to peter out.Meanwhile Intel begged to differ as its chief executive officer said he saw ""improved performance"" for the first half of the next year. Shares put on 2 per cent to $24.80.News of a possible mad-cow disease case sent McDonald's shares 1.5 per cent lower to $29.95, alongside Tyson Foods, a beef processing company, which gave up 1.7 per cent to $16.63.The fallout from the global withdrawal of Merck's Vioxx drug threatened to spread to other drugs groups as a regulatory official told lawmakers in Congress other similar drugs needed to be monitored. The NYSE-listed shares of AstraZeneca fell 8.6 per cent to $40.34 while GlaxoSmithKline's US-listed shares lost 3.22. Merck's stock saw limited action while Pfizer's was fractionally lower.Genesco was one of a latest batch of retailers this week to report quarterly results and saw shares put on 9.8 per cent to $29.36, in one of the best showings at the New York Stock Exchange after the company said its Johnston & Murphy shoe brand helped it walk to higher profits and increase its outlook for the year.However, Claire's Stores sounded a less sanguine note for the upcoming quarter and saw shares put one of the worst performances at the Big Board, down 15.7 per cent to $22.45.Williams-Sonoma fared equally badly, down 6 per cent to $36.77 after the retailer of high-end houseware guided investors lower for the fourth quarter after it missed estimates with its results for the current quarter.Kmart shares staged a retreat after a sharp rally in the previous session when the company's $11bn merger with Sears was announced. Sears was 1.5 per cent up to $53.80 and Kmart gave up 4.9 per cent to $103.71.After the closing bell, investors will also get quarterly results from Gap, another clothing retailer. Gap shares were down 2 per cent to $22.54.The shares of Medtronic, the medical device maker, were 7 per cent lower at $48.65 after the company guided analysts towards the lower end of its range for third-quarter profits.Meanwhile Multimedia Games shares rebounded 5.4 per cent to $13.14 from sharp earlier falls after the casino games maker reported a 3 per cent decrease in profits.Salesforce.com, one of the most eagerly anticipated initial public offerings earlier this year, saw shares decline 14.5 per cent to $17.82 amid disappointment at the guidance given by the company after the Wednesday close. The news prompted a downgrade to ""underperform"" from ""neutral"" by Credit Suisse First Boston.On a more upbeat note, the shares of Netflix rose 14 per cent to $11.92 after the internet DVD rental company increased its forecasts for revenues and subscriber growth in the fourth quarter."
260;MO;Altria Group;2004-11-18T13:25:33Z;Lex: SABMiller;;Lions only roar after they have brought down their prey. Following yet another set of outstanding results, SABMiller has every reason to bellow. The South African brewer has made remarkable progress in digesting most of the assets it swallowed in recent years.Underlying operating profits grew 21 per cent at constant currency and before acquisitions in the first half. The dollar's weakness, exceptional gains from asset sales and a strong performance of its non-brewing interests have given its earnings extra fizz. But it has also combined robust top-line growth with sturdy margin expansion in its core business - for the most part already a well-run operation. At Miller, its biggest bite so far, there are encouraging signs that the strength of low-carb Miller Lite is starting to rub off on its other brands. The overall prospects for US brewing remain lacklustre. But at least, Miller's beefed-up US distribution network should help it sustain recent market share gains.The snag is that SABMiller has already been a roaring success on the stock market. On most measures, it is now trading in line with the sector. This looks rather generous. While the brewer may have become more cautious on the acquisition trail, its heavy emerging market exposure increases its growth as well as its risk profile. Adding to the uncertainty is the expiry of its lock-up agreement with Altria in June 2005, which holds a 36 per stake. The lion's share of the gains have already been made.
261;MO;Altria Group;2004-11-17T21:44:02Z;Oil price rebound curbs Wall Street rally;;"Wall Street closed off intraday highs on Wednesday, as a late rebound in oil prices trimmed the gains of a broad stock rally on the back of positive corporate and economic news.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.6 per cent higher at 10,549.57, while the broader S&P 500 index was 0.6 per cent higher at 1,181.93. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 1 per cent to 2,099.68.There were slightly more than two advancing stocks for every losing one at both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, where 1.7bn shares were traded. A senior trader at the Big Board said this was a strong signal of buying by ""basket"" investors picking up S&P 500 stocks irrespective of the fundamentals underpinning the respective share prices.The late-afternoon retreat was caused by a rebound in crude oil prices following reports that heating oil reserves declined last week in the US. With winter fast approaching, the news trumped the rise in crude oil stockpiles. Crude settled near $47 as heating oil rallied.Todd Leone, head of listed trading at SG Cowen, said: ""The market was just a little bit heavy, we're resting a bit and it's healthy.""He added that from a technical standpoint the market looks ""phenomenal"", as several resistance points have been broken.Some market commentators have said in the last week that the recent rally is in danger of getting ahead of itself on inadequate support from economic realities.However, another trader on Wednesday said the end of the year tended historically to be a positive period for the market. He added that there was evidence of significant new inflows of capital and of short-sellers getting squeezed and covering their positions.""The shorts are throwing in the towel, hopefully we'll carry this into next year,"" Mr Leone said.Corporate and economic news helped the market higher. Following news of a blockbuster merger in the retail sector, the US government reported that consumer price inflation rose 0.6 per cent in October owing to climbing energy prices. Investors appeared to be encouraged that US companies were able to pass on cost increases, reflected in Tuesday's producer prices, to consumers.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, consumer inflation was 0.2 per cent, double what economists had expected.Evidence of inflationary pressure fuelled fears that the Federal Reserve would continue to tighten monetary policy in December. The US central bank has already raised benchmark borrowing costs four times to put them at 2 per cent from 1 per cent.In addition, industrial production rose twice as much as economists had expected last month, further boosting the bulls case.On the corporate front, the retail sector continued to command the centre stage in corporate news as Kmart and Sears Roebuck announced an $11bn merger that will create the third-largest retailer in the US. Kmart shares rose 7.7 per cent to $109 while Sears Roebuck stock put on 17.2 per cent to $52.99.The deal was seen as an indication of confidence among US companies in the outlook for the economy.Shares in Martha Stewart Omnimedia gained 6.3 per cent to $18.49 amid optimism that the Kmart-Sears merger would help the company, which provided Kmart with branded merchandise.Vornado Realty Trust, which has recently increased its stake in Sears, saw shares edge off 2.6 per cent to $70.52.Technology stocks received support from Hewlett-Packard,which reported a 27 per cent increase in third-quarter profits and a 7.7 per cent rise in revenues. The news sent shares 2.6 per cent up to $20.20 and confounded expectations that technology spending by US companies and consumers was set to slow down.Shares in Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, which power most of Hewlett-Packard's personal computers, rose 2 per cent to $24.32 and 5.3 per cent to $21.99, respectively.The Dow received further support from Altria Group, up 5.6 per cent to $57.42 on news that the company and other tobacco producers asked a federal court to block a $280bn lawsuit against the industry.Also higher were shares in Network Appliance, a data storage company that reported a 14 per cent rise in profits thanks to strong demand. Shares gained 18.2 per cent to $29.57."
262;MO;Altria Group;2004-11-05T00:23:01Z;Lex: Altria;;The hinting is over. Instead of the usual health warnings, Louis Camilleri on Thursday stuck a clear health improvement plan on to Altria. The tobacco and food group’s chief executive said that he was looking into a possible break-up.In reality, that is little surprise. Altria which owns both Philip Morris and Kraft has long traded at a steep discount to its sum-of-the parts. Altria’s business diversification has not reduced the risk for investors. Instead, the scale of the tobacco litigation danger has simply tainted the food business as well. In the unlikely event that Philip Morris was hit with a legal liability it could not meet, lawyers could try going after Kraft.A break-up should add significant value. Kraft, which already has a small listed free float, would be cut free. Ideally, Philip Morris would also be split into separately listed international and US businesses. That would leave any future US litigation risk focused on just one business. After Thursday’s rally, the shares trade at $54. Using peer group multiples as a base to value each Altria business can yield over $70 a share.Life is not quite so simple. Before such a move would be allowed, much of the litigation risk would have to disappear. That, by itself, would light up Altria’s shares. A break-up would then add to the momentum. Investors can position themselves now. But they will have to wait many months for the smoke hanging over Altria from its three biggest legal threats to clear.
263;MO;Altria Group;2004-10-05T23:40:46Z;Golden leaf voters may sway tight tussle for US Senate;;"North Carolina, an agricultural bastion of the deep south, likes to present its glass skyscrapers, famous universities and sophisticated science and technology sector as the hub of the ""New South"".But the state's tobacco industry - the largest of the sector in the US - remains its biggest economic and political force: a $7bn sector that employs 250,000. The ""golden leaf"" might sway this year's tight Senate contest between Richard Burr, a five-term Republican congressman, and Erskine Bowles, the Democrat who served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton from 1996-98.With control of the Senate in question, both parties are sparing no expense to win the Burr-Bowles contest. But this year, unusually, the two pillars of the tobacco industry - the farmers and the cigarette manufacturers - have a disagreement, and its resolution could determine the race's outcome.With demand for US tobacco declining, farmers have rallied behind a proposed government buyout of the growing quotas that govern the supply side.Mr Burr and Mr Bowles are striving to outdo each other's support for the buyout plan, which would lavishly compensate the state's farmers in exchange for introducingfull competition to its tobacco industry.Mr Burr this year co-sponsored a $9.6bn taxpayer buyout, which the House approved. Mr Bowles says he supports a different $12bn version approved by the Senate, which would also give the Food and Drug Administration oversight of tobacco, and would saddle the tobacco companies with the cost of the buyout.Advocates of each man are carrying the case on Capitol Hill. House Republicans have attached to a must-pass corporate tax bill a buyout plan that would exclude FDA oversight, while Senate Democrats are warning they may kill the bill if FDA regulation is excluded. House negotiators on Tuesday blocked the Senate effort to include FDA regulation as part of the bill.In spite of its health risks, tobacco is among the only ingestible goods not federally regulated. FDA oversight could mean larger warning labels on cigarette packaging, further restrictions on cigarette marketing, and more openness from tobacco companies.Most North Carolina tobacco farmers lease permission to grow from absentee quota holders. The proposed buyout would compensate these quota holders for their investments, while giving farmers a per-pound payment to ease their transition into an unprotected market. Farmers argue that the buyout would make their crops more competitive against cheaper foreign tobacco.Their openness to either the House or Senate version puts them at odds with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, the second-largest US cigarette manufacturer. RJR, with its headquarters in Mr Burr's district, opposes the Senate bill's company-funded buyout and FDA regulation.Whether a buyout gets through Congress could help tip the outcome of the Senate race.Scott Bissette, tobacco programme administrator at North Carolina's Department of Agriculture, says the state's ""tobacco dependency"" leaves rural farmers desperate for the quota buyout in whichever form - and therefore ready to vote for the candidate most likely to deliver the windfall.The latest polls show Mr Bowles essentially tied with Mr Burr, and the tobacco industry has helped keep the race competitive. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance monitor group, RJR and its employees are collectively Mr Burr's largest campaign contributor. Mr Burr has received contributions from at least 10 other tobacco- orientated political action committees hoping to tilt a buyout bill in their favour.Among big tobacco groups, only Altria, parent company of Philip Morris, the industry leader, prefers the Senate version, favouring FDA tobacco regulation.Critics note Altria would be better able to absorb the higher cost of new regulations than its competition. But Altria's political action committee has not contributed to either candidate.Mr Bowles' advocates argue that his flexibility on FDA regulation and payment will enable him to pass the bill. Senate Democrats voted overwhelmingly for the proposal in July.Doug Heye, Mr Burr's spokesman, says the congressman may be willing to compromise on FDA regulation, but not on a tobacco company-funded buyout: ""It's a federal programme, and the federal government should pay for it."" For farmers and quota holders, he says payments from either buyout would be approximately the same. While there is some bristling at FDA oversight of tobacco, the prospect of a buyout trumps concerns about bureaucracy.Mr Bissette says farmers have told him: ""The FDA man can get in the same van to my farm as the banker and the pesticide inspector. Just one more person coming and getting in line.""As a sitting congressman, Mr Burr would benefit if a buyout passes before the November 2 election, Mr Bissette says. But politically, Mr Bowles' declared support for the Senate version might be more effective. ""It would be easier to sell in Washington if the companies pay,"" Mr Bissette says."
264;MO;Altria Group;2004-09-27T12:31:19Z;Lex: Tobacco litigation;;"There is no smoke without fire. That is the view of bond markets, which have marked down the value of US tobacco company debt since last week's start of a major trial. This is in contrast to the equity market's lack of reaction to the case, in which the Department of Justice is seeking $280bn in ""ill-gotten gains"" from tobacco companies.The different responses are justified. For bond investors, what matters is credit ratings. If the Department of Justice wins, tobacco companies will need to pay $280bn - enough to effectively bankrupt the entire industry. This seems unlikely, but there may be outcomes which do not threaten company survival but do lower creditworthiness.The most affected would be Altria, formerly Philip Morris, with the biggest US market share. Rated in the triple-B investment grade category, its bonds are trading in line with junk bonds. This reflects the fact that US cigarette companies would have trouble passing on the costs of a sizeable settlement to smokers. Moreover, the companies' financial flexibility is constrained - Altria's US tobacco subsidiary, for example, has over $8bn tied up in bonding arrangements with various courts.An important point in the trial will come around the end of November, with hearings on the issue of disgorgement, or forfeiting, of profits. If the tide turns against the companies, shareholders would need to be even more cautious. Until then, bond investors look set to remain the only ones reading the smoke signals."
265;MO;Altria Group;2004-09-23T11:41:15Z;Philippines? tax move to hurt Philip Morris;;Less than two years after Altria?s Philip Morris invested $300m in a new factory in the Philippines, the world?s biggest cigarette maker is finding that its hopes for healthy market growth is about to be dashed by Manila?s plan to raise taxes on the industry.President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo last month said the Philippines was ?in the midst of a fiscal crisis? and proposed legislation increasing taxes on cigarettes, beer and alcohol as a priority measure to boost government revenue.The finance department is now asking Congress to raise taxes on the so-called ?sin products? by a third and reclassify some low-priced brands into the higher-priced categories where they will be subject to higher tax rates.The twin moves would double the government?s tax take from cigarettes from 19bn pesos ($337m) to 37bn pesos.That is worrying cigarette makers such as Philip Morris which is banking on continued domestic market growth to recoup its investment in a new factory that began commercial operations in January 2003. Before that, the company?s brands were made and distributed in the Philippines by a licensee.Chris Nelson, managing director of Philip Morris? Philippine unit, told lawmakers during a congressional hearing this week that a big jump in tax rates in a short period of time could price cigarettes beyond what smokers could afford and cause a drop in tobacco consumption.?That?s what happened in France and Germany, where they increased the tax rates very fast and the market contracted? he said.Since Philip Morris started building its factory in the Philippines in 2001, cigarette consumption in the country had been rising by an average of 7.6 per cent per year, more than double its long-term growth rate of 2.6 per cent.With four of every 10 adult Filipino puffing an average of 13 sticks a day, the Philippines now ranks as the world?s 12th largest cigarette market, according to Philip Morris.?Clearly, the Philippines is a growing market compared to other markets which are in decline,? said Mr Nelson.Philip Morris is urging lawmakers to increase taxes by a fixed amount of 50 centavos ($0.09) per pack gradually over the next five years, as an alternative to the finance department?s plan to raise tax rates by a third this year.The company argues its proposal will yield more revenues for the government, as it won?t force smokers to shift to lower-priced brands which are taxed at a rate that is a fifth of those on higher priced brands.
266;MO;Altria Group;2004-09-07T19:47:40Z;‘50 years of fraud';;"On December 15, 1953, presidents of several of America's largest tobacco companies gathered at New York's Plaza Hotel for an unusual meeting. Under discussion were growing health concerns about smoking's health risks. Five epidemiological studies had already suggested links between smoking and cancer - and the press was picking up the story.In one of the hotel's baroque meeting rooms, the heads of American Tobacco, Benson & Hedges, Philip Morris and US Tobacco took the first step in creating what would become a unified strategy to reassure the public that there was no evidence that smoking was harmful.Over the next 50 years, US tobacco companies would conspire to defraud consumers by denying the dangers of smoking and second-hand cigarette smoke. They would fund sympathetic scientists to carry out research to cloud the issue. They would manipulate nicotine levels to keep smokers hooked, and deliberately market cigarettes to youth. Much of that time, however, they knew there was a causal link between smoking and disease.That, at least, is what the US Department of Justice will attempt to prove - in the face of vehement industry denials - in a court case due to begin on September 21. Testimony from the government's opening witnesses is due to be published next Monday. The case may be the biggest judicial assault ever launched by a government on a legal industry.The essence of the case is similar to arguments heard in lawsuits brought by US states and in class actions and individual smokers' suits (see right). But this trial will differ from anything seen in the courtrooms of Mississippi or Alabama.On one side is the US justice department, which - using incriminating documents leaked from inside the companies or uncovered in earlier cases or by its own investigations - has spent five years putting together the most comprehensive anti-tobacco industry case yet assembled. On the other are the combined resources of the industry's biggest companies and their phalanxes of top-flight lawyers.The government says the defendants should “disgorge”, or forfeit, $280bn of “ill-gotten gains” - more than enough to bankrupt them. To bring that about, however, it will have to prove - to a single judge, not a jury - not only that the cigarette companies were guilty of fraud in the past, but that they are likely to continue to offend in the future, a high barrier. The government will also have to justify the size of its $280bn demand.The reason is that this is not the kind of product liability suit, alleging that its products injured a particular smoker or group of smokers, that the industry typically faces. It is being brought instead under the 1970 Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organisations (RICO) Act, designed to fight organised crime.“The government's primary allegation is that the US tobacco industry was essentially an illegal enterprise, just like the mafia,” says Martin Feldman, tobacco analyst at Merrill Lynch.The industry denies past wrongdoing and says it believes the government will never persuade the judge, Gladys Kessler, that it is likely to violate RICO laws in the future. Moreover, it says, restrictions on cigarette marketing that the government is demanding alongside its $280bn claim largely duplicate those put in place by the Master Settlement Agreement of 1998. That was the deal in which tobacco companies agreed to pay $246bn over 25 years to the 50 US states. It ended the states' litigation - and inspired the federal government to bring its own legal assault (see below).“When [the federal government's] lawsuit was filed in 1999, we said we didn't think it was right on the law, on the facts or on the policy, and nothing has changed,” says William Ohlemeyer, associate general counsel at Philip Morris, the biggest US tobacco maker.Philip Morris, together with its parent group, Altria, is one of six corporate defendants. Others are RJ Reynolds, the US number two tobacco company; Brown & Williamson, the number three; Loews Corporation's Lorillard; Vector Group's Liggett; and British American Tobacco (Investments), a unit of the UK's British American Tobacco. Two now-defunct trade organisations are also on trial.The allegations in the US government's latest proposed findings of fact, published in July, are damning:● Cigarette companies “have engaged in and executed - and continue to engage in and execute - a massive 50-year scheme to defraud the public”.● Working with the two industry organisations, the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research, they waged a public relations campaign to deny the harms of smoking and generate controversy around the scientific research. The campaign kicked off shortly after the Plaza Hotel meeting with the “Frank Statement to Smokers”, a signed full-page announcement by the companies in 448 US newspapers. “We believe the products we make are not injurious to health,” it stated, but promised to conduct research to establish the truth.● The defendants, through the CTR, funded scientists willing to generate information that would bolster the industry's litigation defences, and cast doubt on evidence that smoking caused cancer - while acknowledging internally that it did.● They collectively agreed not to develop or market “safer” cigarettes, for fear it could undermine the claim that regular cigarettes were not harmful.● They “engaged in a global effort to fraudulently deny and distort the harms” of second-hand cigarette smoke.● They manipulated nicotine levels in cigarettes to “create and sustain nicotine addiction” in smokers, while denying nicotine or smoking was addictive.● They promoted the health benefits of “light” or low-tar cigarettes, knowing these were no safer than regular cigarettes (many smokers compensate for the lower tar content by inhaling more deeply, or smoking more).● The defendants “intentionally marketed cigarettes to youth under the legal smoking age while falsely denying they have done and continue to do so”.● They destroyed and concealed documents to cover up these activities.The industry rejects all those claims, saying there was no fraud. A central plank of its defence will be that from 1966 - two years after a US Surgeon General's report stated unequivocally that smoking caused cancer - cigarette packets carried a federally-mandated health warning that cigarettes could harm health. How could the companies have deceived anyone?“When the cancer link was established, Congress had to decide whether to ban cigarettes, or provide warnings and information so people could make an informed decision,” says William Ohlemeyer, associate general counsel at Philip Morris, the biggest US tobacco maker. “They decided not to ban them, but to provide warnings.”There was, the companies add, no conspiracy. The meeting in the Plaza Hotel said to have spawned the whole scheme was never even secret: it was notified to the Department of Justice to avoid violating an antitrust decree prohibiting meetings between the companies, and reported in several newspapers. The subsequent “Frank Statement to Smokers” reflected the scientific consensus at the time.The shape of the industry has also changed radically in 50 years - which the companies say reflects dynamic competition inconsistent with the idea of a conspiracy. Philip Morris has gone from the number five player to number one; American Tobacco lost the number one slot it occupied in the 1950s and later became part of British American Tobacco's Brown & Williamson - which recently merged into RJ Reynolds.The companies add that both the Tobacco Institute and Council for Tobacco Research were disbanded after the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement. The former, they add, was a legitimate trade organisation. The latter produced high-quality research on tobacco cited repeatedly in US Surgeon General's reports, and often funded research jointly with government organisations or bodies such as the American Cancer Society.On safer and low-tar cigarettes, Bob McDermott, a lawyer with Jones Day who is lead trial counsel for RJ Reynolds, says there is an incongruity in the government's case. Why would the companies market low-tar cigarettes as safer, knowing they were not, but deliberately not develop cigarettes that were genuinely safer?And companies did develop safer or “reduced-risk” cigarettes, he adds. RJ Reynolds developed two - Premier in 1988, and the “smokeless” Eclipse in 1994 - though neither was a hit with smokers. Low-tar cigarettes, on the other hand, were developed with the encouragement of the government, and it was the government, not the industry, that marketed them as safer. Claims of manipulating nicotine and youth marketing are also denied.The industry may go on the offensive by highlighting the long ties between the US government and tobacco - and the billions the government makes in corporate and excise taxes from tobacco products. “The government makes more money when Philip Morris sells a pack of cigarettes than Philip Morris does,” the company says.Tobacco companies are confident the defence honed in dozens of cases will prevail. “It is the exact same evidence that juries look at in other cases, and for the most part, they return defence verdicts,” says Mr Ohlemeyer.But Dick Daynard, a long-time tobacco industry foe and chairman of Northeastern University's Tobacco Products Liability Project, which encourages tobacco litigation, says that claim is disingenuous. In some cases, he says, the most incriminating industry documents were not introduced into trials, because judges directed that they were not directly relevant to establishing whether smoking had caused a smoker's cancer. In others, Mr Daynard says, juries decided tobacco companies had engaged in wrongdoing but could not be held responsible for an individual's decision to smoke.In this case, no such linkage needs to be found; it is all about the companies' conduct. And the most damaging documents will be presented.Since the government has chosen to bring the case under civil rather than criminal RICO statutes, the case must be proven only on “a preponderance of the evidence” rather than beyond reasonable doubt.“When a jury looks at this evidence, they say, ‘These guys committed one humongous and extended fraud',” Mr Daynard says. “I think there is almost no chance that Judge Kessler isn't going to come to the same conclusion.”Even if she does, however, under the RICO statute the government will have to persuade her that this shows the companies will continue to commit fraud.The tobacco industry argues that the restrictions put in place by the MSA already make future violations virtually impossible. These include bans on marketing to youth, most outdoor advertising, paid-for product placements in films or TV shows, and branded merchandise such as clothing, as well as a ban on any material misrepresentation of fact on smoking's health risks. The agreement is policed by the 50 states' attorneys-general.Mr Daynard disagrees. “The MSA is a very mild restriction on what they do,” he says. “There has been a long history of either outright violations of the MSA, or treating it as basically a marketing challenge.”But winning the argument that only “disgorging” $280bn will prevent the industry from offending again may be the government's biggest challenge. For a start, the industry says, the word disgorgement does not appear in the RICO statute.An appeals court ruled in the so-called Carson case in 1995 that disgorgement could be used to “prevent or restrain” future fraud. But it had to be limited to ill-gotten gains that “are being used to fund or promote the illegal conduct, or constitute capital available for that purpose”. That means the justice department must prove that all the $280bn it seeks is ill-gotten, and that the companies have it to hand.The industry charges that the government has made no attempt to separate ill-gotten from fair gains. Its claim is based on an estimate that cigarette makers made $75bn from selling cigarettes between 1971 and 2000 to smokers who were smoking at least five cigarettes a day by age 21 - what it terms a “youth-addicted population”. Having the use of that $75bn over nearly 30 years enabled the defendants to earn another $205bn.“The government takes the position that if anyone began smoking before the age of 21, that is solely attributable to industry misconduct,” says Mr McDermott, counsel for RJ Reynolds. He says it also ignores the fact that cigarette companies have paid out billions in taxes, and dividends to shareholders. “The government acts as if these so-called ill-gotten gains were all in a piggy bank,” he says.Mr Feldman of Merrill Lynch believes the government's case will ultimately fail, either at the trial stage or on appeal, not least because its disgorgement claim is poorly founded. A similar assumption among investors, he says, explains why the market is not panicking about the case - despite the potentially cataclysmic results if the government won its claim in full and the judgment was upheld by the appeals court and US Supreme Court.Such an outcome, however remote a possibility, could potentially be double-edged. The companies say that, since they do not have $280bn, the government would in effect end up owning them - and would have to decide what to do with them. If the big manufacturers disappeared, thousands of jobs would be lost and the industry would be in the hands of hundreds of small, discount cigarette manufacturers that have sprung up since the MSA - many of whom are not regulated by it.For long-time anti-tobacco campaigners such as Mr Daynard, the outcome is less important than the mere fact of seeing the companies on trial in such a high-profile case. “Whatever the result, I think it will be a very damning indictment of the behaviour of this industry over 50 years,” he says.Case pursued from Clinton to AshcroftWhy is a Republican administration, the traditional friend of the tobacco industry, about to sue it for $280bn? Many on both sides of the case are surprised it has made it this far.The case originated in the late 1990s when the Master Settlement Agreement was being negotiated between cigarette makers and the 50 US states who were attempting to recoup money they had spent through Medicaid, the healthcare programme for the poor, on treating sick smokers.Some lawyers involved, such as Mike Moore, attorney-general of Mississippi, the first state to sue the tobacco companies, and Dick Scruggs, the lawyer who represented Mississippi, tried to persuade the federal government it should do likewise.The government was not convinced. Janet Reno, then attorney general, told a Congressional hearing in 1997 that she thought the federal government “did not have an independent cause of action” against tobacco manufacturers.Yet in January 1999, President Bill Clinton announced in his State of the Union address that the justice department would sue tobacco companies. The aim was to recoup some of the billions spent by the federally-funded Medicare programme, which provides healthcare for the elderly, military veterans and federal employees, on smoking-related illnesses.Judge Gladys Kessler, assigned to handle the case, threw out its medical cost reimbursement elements in 2000. But she allowed an anti-racketeering element of the government's case, under the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organisations statute, to proceed.When George W. Bush became president the case was widely expected to be dropped. He had criticised it during his campaign, and John Ashcroft, his attorney general, had been one of the senators most responsible for blocking legislation in 1998 that would have strengthened federal regulation of the industry.Six months into Mr Bush's term, Mr Ashcroft said he had named a team of lawyers to explore a settlement of the suit. But no deal was reached, apparently because the two sides were so far apart.John Coale, a lawyer who brought class action suits against tobacco companies in the 1990s, suspects the Bush administration concluded dropping the case would be unpopular with voters. “Maybe they polled focus groups and decided it was politically not advantageous for them to settle this, so the Democrats would not have an issue against them,” he says.The tobacco industry remained convinced it could get the case thrown out, or limit its scope. But Judge Kessler has ruled against a series of pre-trial motions from the defendants aimed at doing that.Their best hope of defanging the case may be an appeal, due to be heard in November, over Judge Kessler's rejection of their motion challenging the size of the government's $280bn claim for “disgorgement” of ill-gotten gains. But that appeal is not due to be heard until November - when the main case will be two months old.Key dates in tobacco litigation● Jun 1988 Family of deceased smoker Rose Cipollone wins $400,000 damages against Liggett Myers, which is the first plaintiff’s verdict in a tobacco case.

267;MO;Altria Group;2004-08-09T11:36:17Z;Altadis takes controlling stake in Russian group;;Altadis, the Franco-Spanish cigarette maker, has signed a deal to buy a 80.75 per cent controlling stake in Russian tobacco company Balkan Star for ?147m ($180m), as it hits the acquisition trail to make up for falling sales in western Europe.The Russian deal follows the ?566m purchase last week of a majority stake in British American Tobacco?s Italian distribution business. Altadis added the 96 per cent stake in Etinera to its own distribution arm, Compania de Distribucion Integral Logista. Etinera?s largest customer is the European industry leader Phillip Morris International, also BAT?s biggest competitor.The Italian deal was given the thumbs-up by industry analysts last week, who had previously downgraded Altadis as sales of cigarettes in France tumbled in its second-quarter results.As part of the latest deal, Altadis said it would extend the offer to minority shareholders in Balkan Star, holding the remaining 19.25 per cent of the shares. The total cost of the purchase would amount to ?182m for the whole company, as a result.The company said that the total consideration, to be paid out of existing facilities, could be increased by up to ?20m depending on Balkan Star?s operational performance until the completion date.Michael Smith of JP Morgan said that although the deal was small given Altadis? size, the price was lower than many had expected and gave it exposure to an attractive growth market. ?They are clearly trying to balance their portfolio towards emerging markets.?But he warned that the increased competition in Russia?s premium segment, which has caused Gallaher to up its marketing spend this year, could make achieving success harder. ?Unless you have a Marlboro or a Camel it?s difficult. They have Gauloises Blondes, which does have resonance, but it will need some support.?The joint-chairmen of the Franco-Spanish company, Messrs Jean-Dominique Comolli and Pablo Isla, said the deal would give Altadis a position in the fourth-largest cigarette market in the world and reinforce its presence in central and eastern Europe.?With Balkan Star, Altadis will gain access to a significant distribution network allowing further development of the company and of its leading brands,? it said.The Russian tobacco maker said it had had interest from a ?number of investors? before doing the deal with Altadis. Its flagship brand is Balkanskaya Zvezda, which claims to be the second-largest brand in Russian with 21 billion sold, operating out of a plant in Yaroslavl, north of Moscow.For the December 2003 year, it reported net sales of ?107m and earnings before interest, tax and depreciation of ?18.2m.Altadis? main brands are Gauloises and Fortuna. It had previously been suggested by analysts at UBS that if it went into Russia, where Altadis had been examining a purchase for months, that the brand that Altadis was expected to launch there was Gauloises Blondes.The expansion of Altadis in Europe comes amid a restructuring in its main domestic markets, where the company is preparing to close five production and logistics facilities between now and the end of the year.The closures, which will result in the loss of 701 jobs, include a cigarette plant and distribution centre in Lille, a cigar plant in Morlaix, a tobacco processing plant in Tonniens and a technical centre in Dijon.
