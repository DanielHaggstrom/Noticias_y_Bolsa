0;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2019-02-25T08:35:47Z;Marathon Oil units snapped up in latest shake-up of North Sea operators;RockRose to buy units for $140m as oil and gas basin changes;Oil and gas group RockRose is to buy Marathon Oil subsidiaries in a reverse takeover in the latest instance of a US company withdrawing from the North Sea and being replaced by an independent operator.RockRose has agreed to pay Marathon Oil $140m and its shares will be suspended until the deal prospectus is published.While the sale of the Marathon assets is one of the smaller deals anticipated in the region in 2019, it is among the first since the international oil benchmark Brent crude slumped more than 30 per cent in the fourth quarter. As the UK North Sea matures and its cost base appears high compared with other regions, its place on the list of investment priorities at some oil and gas groups is slipping away.Private equity firms have over the past few years poured billions of dollars into the ageing oil and gas basin and executives and analysts say more could be spent to shake up the industry.Marathon Oil UK holds about 40 per cent operated interests in the Greater Brae Area while the West of Shetland division controls 28 per cent in the BP-operated Foinaven Field unit.“This acquisition marks a major step change in the group’s reserves and production profile,” said Andrew Austin, RockRose executive chairman. “Given the quality of these assets the board’s view is this is a good opportunity to make the transition to the role of operator.”
1;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2017-08-02T13:14:51Z;Futures show US equities heading for yet another record;;Futures in US equities are pointing to a higher open on Wednesday, setting up the Dow Jones Industrial Average for a record close for the sixth day in a row.The Dow Jones Industrial Average came within striking distance of the 22,000 mark on Tuesday, but ultimately closed at 21,963.9 at the end of trading in New York.The morning’s ADP job report, which showed a slow but still solid growth rate in private sector hiring, should provide a lift to equities.Futures in the Dow are 0.2 per cent higher, while those in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are also up 0.1 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively.The US dollar index, which measures the buck against a basket of its peers, has pared back some of its early morning’s losses, and is flat at 92.98.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, is up just 1.4 basis points to 2.267 per cent.On the docket for the day, the Federal Reserve’s Loretta Mester and John Williams will give speeches. Brazil will also vote on whether to put its President Michel Temer on trial for corruption.After markets close, Telsa, Fitbit, AIG, Occidental Petroleum and Marathon Oil will report quarterly earnings.
2;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2017-07-23T16:46:51Z;US oil output growth hit by lack of operators and equipment;Number of drilled but uncompleted wells rises sharply;"US oil production growth this year is on course to be significantly lower than government forecasts, as companies struggle to find the operators and equipment they need to complete the wells they have drilled, according to a new energy research firm.The steady rise in shale oil output from the US has weighed on global crude prices but the projections Kayrros, a Paris-based research firm backed by former Schlumberger chief executive Andrew Gould, suggest there may be less oil coming than expected coming on to world markets over the next few months. This would help support oil prices that have already risen about 10 per cent since the Brent benchmark dipped below $45 per barrel last month.The signs of capacity shortages are also good news for oilfield services companies such as Halliburton and Schlumberger, enabling them to raise rates after steep cuts during the industry downturn that began in 2014, but suggest the profitability of US oil and gas producers will remain under pressure.Once a shale well has been drilled it needs hydraulic fracturing or fracking and other procedures to start production. The number of drilled but uncompleted wells, often known as DUCs, in the US main shale oil and gas regions has been rising sharply this year, going from 4,944 last December to 6,031 in June, according to the US government’s Energy Information Administration.Kayross argues that the number will continue to rise, slowing the growth of US oil output. By October, the firm sees onshore US production in the lower 48 states growing by 560,000 barrels per day from the end of last year to 7.09m, compared to the 900,000 b/d increase forecast by the EIA.Antoine Rostand, president of Kayrros, said: “The fracking industry is taking time to ramp up; there are not enough crews available to complete all the wells that have been drilled.”Activity in the US shale industry has been recovering for more than a year, even though companies have in aggregate been unable to cover their capital expenditures from operating cash flows at present oil and gas prices.The number of wells being drilled in the US has more than doubled, from 2,168 in the second quarter of 2016 to 4,433 in the equivalent period of this year, according to S&P Global PlattsRigData.As the recovery continues, capacity constraints have started to emerge. Brad Handler, an analyst at Jefferies, estimated that if all the wells being drilled in the US were to be brought into production promptly, they would need about 14m horsepower of pump capacity for the fracking to complete them, and the industry actually had only about 12m horsepower of active capacity. He said prices for fracking services had nearly doubled from their lows a year ago, although they were still below their peak in 2014.Patrick Schorn, vice-president for new ventures at Schlumberger, the oilfield services group, said on a call with analysts on Friday that its revenues from US hydraulic fracturing in the second quarter were up 68 per cent from the first quarter, and its capacity was already fully booked well into the fourth quarter.The number of rigs drilling the horizontal wells used for shale oil production last week dropped for a second week in succession, the first such fall since May 2016, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group, in a sign that financial pressures and the decline in crude prices between April and June may have constrained activity.Nevertheless, the larger exploration and production companies including EOG Resources, Hess, Pioneer Natural Resources and Marathon Oil have been saying that their “2017 plans are more or less set at this point”, Paul Sankey, an analyst at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note earlier this month.Some analysts believe that the capacity constraints will ease by the start of next year. Mr Rostand said that DUCs would be available to be brought into production in the future, but their contribution could be offset by a slowdown in activity and declining drilling productivity."
3;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2017-05-09T13:14:14Z;US shale groups roar back to life after oil slump;Biggest risk for sector is increased output causing new crude price crash;Members of President Donald Trump’s cabinet have a new catchphrase for how they see the future role of the US: not just “energy-independent”, but “energy-dominant”. As Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, put it at an industry conference in Houston last week: “Dominance is what America needs.”It would be tempting to dismiss that talk as hype, except that every week the US energy sector is coming up with evidence to justify that ambition. The latest round of earnings reports from US exploration and production companies, the leaders of the shale revolution, has shown fresh evidence of their resilience and growth potential.The resurgence of the US shale industry after the oil slump of 2014 was a key factor in how crude prices fell sharply last week, to back below $50 per barrel. The market is concerned about whether efforts by Opec, the producers’ cartel, to tackle a supply glut by curbing output will be undermined by reinvigorated US shale companies.These companies are proving that they are able not just to stay in business, but increase production as well, with oil prices close to today’s levels of about $47 per barrel for benchmark US crude.The great weakness of the shale industry has always been that the companies have typically not generated enough cash to pay for their capital spending, and have relied on debt and equity sales to finance their growth. But producers have typically cut their costs by about 40 per cent in the past three years, and many are now at or close to the point where they are covering their spending from operating cash flows.Before the oil crash of 2014, Harold Hamm, the billionaire majority owner and chief executive of Continental Resources, used to say that prices below $70 per barrel could not be sustained for any length of time, because neither Saudi Arabia nor the US shale industry could bear it.Now Continental is planning for 20 per cent annual production growth financed by its own cash flows with oil at $50 to $55, and says it can invest enough to keep output stable even with crude in the low $40s.Mr Hamm told analysts on a call last week: “The United States has retaken its place as a world energy leader, and we will compete effectively in this new regime.”Across the shale industry, drilling activity is increasing even faster than it did in the final stages of its first boom, up until 2014.The number of active rigs in the US drilling the horizontal wells used for shale oil production has more than doubled over the past 12 months, from 248 to 598 last week, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group. In the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the red-hot heart of the new boom, the number of rigs running has already hit the levels that were expected for next year, says Benjamin Shattuck of Wood Mackenzie, the research firm.“We thought activity was coming back, but it surprised us that it happened so quickly,” he adds. “I don’t think anybody expected that.”Several companies have suggested the pace at which they are adding rigs would slow down.Jack Harper, chief financial officer of Concho Resources, which operates in the Permian, said that while the company’s plans showed a rising number of rigs in use in the next three years, “it doesn’t move up in a hugely dramatic fashion”.However, as companies build up experience working in shale, the wells can be drilled faster and each is on average more productive. This month 662 barrels per day will be produced from new wells in the Permian for every rig that is running there, according to the US government’s Energy Information Administration. That is triple the rate of 217b/d per rig at the end of 2014.Jamie Webster of the BCG Center for Energy Impact says that on average across the shale industry, each additional rig coming back into service can be expected to result in 2.5 times as much oil as when activity started to drop off in the autumn of 2014.As a result, many shale producers are predicting production growth this year. Pioneer Natural Resources is the star performer, forecasting growth of 15 to 18 per cent for 2017, and an annual average of at least 15 per cent out to 2026, but many others have projected solid increases.For example, Marathon Oil thinks that between 2017 and 2021 it can achieve 10 to 12 per cent annual growth, excluding its troubled operations in Libya, with US crude at $55.Not every US exploration and production company is expecting short-term growth, but enough are predicting expansion to support the EIA’s forecast that US oil output will hit a record above 10m b/d next year.So far, there are few signs that the recovery in the industry is stoking cost inflation that would stop the increased production being translated into higher earnings. EOG Resources, one of the largest shale producers, said on Monday that even though suppliers’ charges were rising, it had cut the cost of drilling and completing wells by 6 per cent in the first quarter compared to the average for 2016, through improved efficiency and signing new service contracts at lower prices.It seems right now that the greatest threat to the US shale industry is its own success. Adam Sieminski, a former head of the EIA now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank, draws an analogy with the Tragedy of the Commons. Rapid growth that is rational for the individual producer could turn out to be collectively disastrous by flooding the market.“One sheep eating the grass on the commons works,” he says. “But an entire flock soon turns the grass into mud. You overwhelm the system. Who is going to buy all that light [US shale] oil globally? Is there a market for it?”A slide from a ConocoPhillips presentation given to a conference in January is headlined rather plaintively: “Permian: We have a shiny object, too.” The message is that assets in the Permian Basin are all investors want to hear about at the moment, and Conoco’s operations there have been unfairly neglected.It is the Permian that has been the strongest the US shale oil regions in terms of crude production.From peak levels in the first half of 2015, output in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas has declined 29 per cent, according to the EIA, while in the Bakken formation of North Dakota it is down 17 per cent. By contrast in the Permian, production is at record highs, up 19 per cent in the past year alone.This boom has been matched by steep rises in the share prices of some of the companies that focus on the Permian.Since the start of 2016, the shares of Concho Resources are up 41 per cent, Diamondback Energy 50 per cent, and Parsley Energy 74 per cent. Over the same period, Conoco’s stock has risen 1 per cent.Shale oil development in the Permian was slower to get going than in the Eagle Ford or the Bakken, and companies have been experimenting with production techniques to maximise output.One of those advances is that companies are using higher volumes of sand in hydraulic fracturing or “fracking”: the pumping of fluid into a well to crack the rock so that oil can flow out.Pioneer Natural Resources said last week that in the Permian it was experimenting with using 3,000lbs of sand per foot of well, instead of 2,500. A single well could use more than 12,000 tonnes of sand.Productivity gains resulting from improved techniques mean that although the Permian needs $55 per barrel oil to be fully developed, there are areas that can be profitable with prices down in the mid-$30s, according to Wood Mackenzie, making it the lowest-cost region for crude production anywhere in the “Lower 48” states of the US.
4;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2017-03-30T00:42:11Z;ConocoPhillips sells oil sands assets for $13.3bn;Deal is third this month of international groups selling to Canadian specialists;ConocoPhillips of the US has become the third company this month to announce a large sale of assets in the oil sands of western Canada, agreeing a $13.3bn deal with Calgary-based Cenovus Energy for heavy crude and gas operations.Houston-based ConocoPhillips said the sale would enable it to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders, and also cut the average cost of its production from about $40 to about $35 per barrel.The deal follows Royal Dutch Shell’s decision, announced earlier this month, to sell most of its oil sands assets to Canadian Natural Resources for $7.25bn.Marathon Oil of the US sold its Canadian subsidiary, which owns 20 per cent of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, for $2.5bn to Shell and Canadian Natural Resources in a related deal.All three deals involve international companies selling operations in the oil sands to Canadian companies that are specialists in that industry.Shell said Alberta’s oil sands had ceased to be a priority in its investment plans, which were focused on deep water developments and petrochemicals. Conoco similarly said it was making sure that its capital spending was focused on its lowest cost and most profitable operations.Conoco will retain one oil sands asset: a 50 per cent stake in the Surmont joint venture with Total of France. But heavy Canadian crude will drop from 15 per cent to 5 per cent of its production.The deal received an initially favourable reaction from the market, with Conoco shares rising 5.8 per cent in after-hours trading in New York.Under the deal, Conoco will sell its 50 per cent stake in the Foster Creek Christina Lake oil sands partnership and the majority of its western Canada Deep Basin gas assets to Cenovus. The Canadian company already owns the other half of Foster Creek Christina Lake.Conoco will receive $10.6bn in cash and 208m Cenovus shares, valued at $2.7bn on March 28. There is also a small extra payment triggered if the oil price goes high enough: Conoco will be paid an extra $6m for every C$1 of the benchmark Western Canada Select oil price above C$52 per barrel, every quarter for five years.The cash will be used to pay down its gross debt from $27bn at the end of last year to $20bn at the end of 2017, and for a $3bn share buyback.Conoco was forced to cut its dividend last year because of its strained financial position. Ryan Lance, chief executive, said the Canadian asset sale would “make us a much stronger company and put us in an advantaged position for strong free cash flow generation and improved returns”.The moves by international companies to reduce their exposure to the oil sands do not look like a sign that the industry is stagnating, at least in the near term.The International Energy Agency, the watchdog backed by rich countries’ governments, said earlier this month that it expected Canada to “remain a key contributor” to global oil supply growth over the next few years.It highlighted production ramp-ups at Conoco’s Surmont project and Cenovus’s Foster Creek as two of the principal developments driving that production growth.
5;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-08-23T20:44:04Z;Oil sector shares jump on Iran-Opec hopes;US equities near record levels, coming within one point of fresh peak;Oil companies broadly advanced on Tuesday as crude rebounded, buoyed by speculation that Iran will attend a meeting of Opec producing countries next month.Members of the oil producing cartel are expected to meet to discuss actions to support the crude market, which despite Brent rallying 34 per cent this year remains 57 per cent below a 2014 peak.Brent crude, the global benchmark, reversed earlier losses and rose 1.6 per cent to $49.96 a barrel after Reuters said Iran was “sending positive signals” about supporting joint efforts, citing unnamed sources in Opec and the oil industry.West Texas Intermediate, the US oil marker, advanced 1.5 per cent to $48.10 a barrel.Shares of Chesapeake Energy climbed 6.1 per cent to $6.46, Marathon Oil rose 5.1 per cent to $16.43, Southwestern Energy advanced 4.2 per cent to $14.04 and Anadarko Petroleum gained 3.3 per cent to $56.05.Ted Harper, an energy and commodities fund manager with Frost Investment Advisors, noted that while Nigerian oil minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu had said a production cut was unlikely at the forthcoming meeting, the talks had fuelled hope that it could “shore up crude prices”.“He doesn’t see them cutting volume but commented that all options are on the table and other actions could have an impact,” Mr Harper said. “Given the organisation’s history, we remain fairly sceptical as to the likelihood of any forthcoming production cuts.”Toll Brothers, the US homebuilder, led an advance in the housing sector after it eclipsed sales expectations in its fiscal third quarter and projected fourth-quarter revenues ahead of Wall Street forecasts.The Pennsylvania-based company said revenues rose 24 per cent from a year earlier to $1.27bn in the three months to the end of July. Net income advanced 58 per cent to $105.5m, or 61 cents per share.“Through the first three weeks of August, the beginning of our fourth quarter, our non-binding reservation deposits are up 23 per cent,” said Douglas Yearley, the company’s chief executive. “Every region showed growth in contracts of anywhere from 9 per cent to 29 per cent.”The report preceded stronger than expected new home sales in the country, which climbed 12.4 per cent to an annualised pace of 654,000 units, according to the US Census Bureau. The figure marked the fastest pace of newly built home sales since 2007.“Homes are literally flying off the shelves here with a record pace for this long recovery from the great recession,” said Chris Rupkey, an economist with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ. “We expect the sales gains to continue with the labour market tightening and wages starting to pick up.”Shares of Toll Brothers advanced 8.8 per cent to $31.91. Rivals in the industry also climbed on the results, with Lennar up 3 per cent to $47.94, DR Horton rising 2.9 per cent to $32.99 and KB Home gaining 4.9 per cent to $16.13.US stock markets neared record levels on Tuesday with the benchmark S&P 500 briefly coming less than one point from touching its all-time high.The S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent to 2,186.9 on the day in New York. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 5,260.1 while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.1 per cent to 18,547.3.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
6;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-08-22T20:56:26Z;Marathon Oil slips on broad sector fall;US stocks make little progress at start of the week;Marathon Oil led a broad decline in the oil sector’s stocks as crude prices fell back after a bumper seven-session rally.West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, fell 3 per cent to $47.05 on Monday, ending a rally that saw its price rise more than 20 per cent since August 2.Last week’s rise came off the back of hopes that Opec and other big oil producers might finally be looking at a long-discussed output freeze. Positive data and bets by hedge funds that the oil price would rise also helped to send prices higher.But Monday’s pullback led to a broad decline in oil company stock prices.Marathon, the Houston-based exploration and production company, led the pack, falling 6.9 per cent to $15.64 amid the additional investor pressure triggered by managerial changes.JR Sult, the company’s chief financial officer, left the company on Monday, citing personal reasons. Pat Wagner, vice-president of corporate development and strategy, has been named interim chief financial officer.Marathon, also the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 index on Monday, has struggled due to the prolonged drop in oil prices.It reported its sixth straight quarterly loss this month, cutting its production outlook for the year. It has curtailed spending and sold off more than $1bn in assets.It said its revenue fell below $1bn in May for the first time since it became a standalone company in 2002.Other oil stocks also struggled. Murphy Oil was down 3.3 per cent to $29.07, Noble Energy fell 1.5 per cent to $35.57 and Southwestern Energy declined 1.8 per cent to $13.47.At the other end of the spectrum, pharmaceutical companies saw early gains after Pfizer reached a deal worth $14bn to acquire California biotechnology company Medivation.Pfizer, the world’s second-largest drugmaker, saw its stock tick up by 0.2 per cent before giving up ground and closing 0.4 per cent lower at $34.84. Medivation, not in the S&P 500 index, soared higher, up 19.7 per cent to $80.42.The top three performers in the S&P 500 index were pharmaceutical companies.Regeneron rose 3.6 per cent to $418.65, Vertex Pharmaceuticals gained 3 per cent to $100.96 and Alexion Pharmaceuticals climbing 3.3 per cent to $136.53.Elsewhere, clothing brand Urban Outfitters saw its stock fall 3.2 per cent to $36.61 as Goldman Sachs downgraded it from buy to neutral. The bank suggested it was at “near peak” operating performance, leaving less room for meaningful improvement.The S&P 500 was relatively unchanged at 2,182.6, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 18,529.4, and the Nasdaq Composite ticked 0.1 per cent higher to 5,244.6.
7;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-08-18T20:54:07Z;US energy stocks a bright spot for equity investors;Rising oil price supports the sector as cyclicals are favoured over defensive shares;US energy groups remained a bright spot on Thursday for investors in what has otherwise been a lacklustre week for Wall Street as the rally in crude oil gathers pace.The S&P 500 energy sector has climbed 2.8 per cent over the past four days, for a gain of 4 per cent during August, handily outperforming the broad market.While energy has led the market, investors have this month also sought technology and financials, while selling the high-dividend paying stocks within the utilities and telecoms sectors.The advance in energy shares on Thursday came as the price of West Texas Intermediate, the US oil marker, climbed $3.81 to $48.28 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, advanced beyond the $50 threshold on Thursday for the first time since July 5. It gained $3.90 to $50.86.The oil price has been supported by several factors, including bullish weekly inventory data released on Wednesday by the US energy department, a weakening US dollar and renewed talk over a potential Opec production freeze.The gains for energy groups this week are broad, with 35 of 37 stocks in the S&P 500 energy index in the black. Among the sharpest risers have been Marathon Oil, an exploration and production group, up 13.3 per cent to $16.68. Halliburton, a large oilfield services company, has risen 6 per cent to $46.46, while integrated energy group ExxonMobil has ticked up 1.2 per cent to $88.91.Elsewhere, the shares of Harley-Davidson fluctuated after the group was accused by the US Environmental Protection Agency of selling after-market devices that circumvent emissions checks built into its motorcycles’ engines.Harley allegedly sold almost 340,000 Screamin’ Eagle engine tuners from 2008 to 2015 that boost the power of the motorcycles’ engines, but that also bypass “a device or element of design installed on the motorcycles in compliance with applicable regulations”, according to a complaint filed in federal court in Washington.The company contended in a statement that the products were “intended for off-road and closed-course competition” and not for use on public roads as the US alleged.Still, it said on Thursday morning that it forged a settlement with the US where it would “no longer sell its competition-only tuner in the US”, but would continue to sell a performance tuner “designed to ensure Harley-Davidson motorcycles retain 50-state and EPA on-road emissions compliance”. It will also pay a $12m civil penalty.Harley added that “this settlement is not an admission of liability but instead represents a good faith compromise with the EPA on areas of law we interpret differently”.Harley’s shares fell as much as 8 per cent on Thursday, but trimmed the decline to 1.7 per cent after the pact with the US was unveiled. It closed the day at $53.54.The shares of Hormel Foods, meanwhile, climbed after the group said it expected a “strong finish to fiscal 2016”.As a result, Hormel, which makes meat products, raised its earnings per share guidance for the period to $1.60-$1.64, from a previous view of $1.56-$1.60.Hormel shares rose 1.9 per cent to $37.04, reducing the year-to-date fall to 6.3 per cent.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,187, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 18,597.7, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.2 per cent to 5,240.2.
8;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-08-08T21:00:31Z;Allergan setback prompts healthcare slide;US stocks lack direction after post-payrolls record;Healthcare stocks in the US slid on Monday in a lacklustre trading session as investors digested disappointing results from Allergan, days after a potential blockbuster cancer treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb failed a large clinical trial.Allergan shares fell as much as 5 per cent before it pared its losses to close 2.2 per cent lower at $248.31 after second-quarter revenues fell short of Wall Street expectations.The Botox maker said revenues rose 2 per cent from a year earlier to $3.68bn, below the $3.72bn projected by analysts covering the group, as its dermatology medications business slowed.Weakness in Bristol-Myers Squibb added pressure to the healthcare industry as the company’s shares dropped a further 4.7 per cent to $60.30, the worst performing stock on the benchmark S&P 500.Nearly $25bn has been sliced off the New York-based group’s valuation since it said Opdivo, a lung cancer drug, was not significantly better than chemotherapy at extending the time before the disease worsened in some patients.The S&P 500 healthcare index dropped 0.9 per cent, its largest one-day decline since the end of June, as shares of Merck fell 1.6 per cent to $62.86, Celgene slid 1.6 per cent to $113.63 and Pfizer dipped 1.4 per cent to $34.93.Energy companies started the week on a firmer footing after Opec said it would meet informally in September, providing a boost to US and international oil prices.Officials from Opec countries would gather at a biennial conference in Algeria late next month, the group said in a statement.Analysts have warned about the ability of the oil cartel to agree to a production freeze after talks failed this year.Nonetheless, Brent, the international oil marker, rose 2.5 per cent to $45.39 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate, its US counterpart, climbed 2.9 per cent to $43.02 a barrel.Shares in Marathon Oil rose 2.7 per cent to $14.25, Chesapeake Energy advanced 2.5 per cent to $5.01 and Murphy Oil gained 2.4 per cent to $28.48.Ski mountain resort owner Vail Resorts climbed 8 per cent to $155.46 after the company said it would purchase Whistler Blackcomb for $1.05bn in cash and stock.The deal, which will add the busiest ski resort in North America to Vail’s portfolio, is expected to be completed by late this year.“Combining Whistler Blackcomb with Vail Resorts’ portfolio of outstanding resorts provides Whistler Blackcomb with increased financial strength, marketing exposure, guest relationships and broadens the geographic diversity of our company with resorts across the US, as well as in Australia and Canada,” said Dave Brownlie, chief executive of Whistler Blackcomb.Mattress Firm, the largest US mattress retailer, gained after the company agreed a sale to furniture group Steinhoff International for $64 a share.The transaction valued the company at $3.8bn, including its debts. Mattress Firm stock climbed 114.4 per cent to $63.75.Overall, US equity markets were little moved on Monday after a stronger than expected jobs report on Friday sent stocks to record levels.The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,180.89, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to 18,529.29, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.2 per cent to 5,213.1.

The period reflected new revenues linked to its $15bn takeover of Jarden, the household goods maker.Molson Coors jumped 4.5 per cent to $102.16 after analysts at Citi upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, citing expected cost savings after its completes the takeover of the portion of MillerCoors it does not own from SABMiller.“Given the reputation for strong cost-cutting cultures at the major brewers . . . most of our recent discussions with investors have surrounded Molson Coors’ $200m annualised cost synergy guidance and the degree of conservatism that might perhaps be embedded in that figure,” Citi analyst Wendy Nicholson said.Shares of hotel operator Wynn Resorts slid 6.4 per cent to $97.95 after the company was allocated fewer gaming tables at its new Wynn Palace in Macau than it had sought.Google owner Alphabet climbed 3.3 per cent to $791.34 as sales growth at its mobile advertising business accelerated.Excluding currency movements, the company would have reported a 25 per cent jump in revenues, up from 18 per cent a year earlier.“The report reaffirmed our view from last quarter that the first quarter underperformance was a temporary event and that the core business was healthy,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 2,173.60 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to 18,432.24. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 5,162.13.
11;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-07-05T21:08:24Z;Harley-Davidson splutters given no evidence for takeover rumour;Southwestern Energy, Chesapeake and Marathon Oil all hit by energy sector weakness;Harley-Davidson, the US motorcycle company, spluttered on Tuesday, as analysts said they saw no evidence of a potential takeover by KKR, a rumour which sent the stock soaring on Friday.The company’s stock fell 10.8 per cent to $48.37 in New York, giving up more than half of its 19.8 per cent rise from Friday, making it the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 index.Friday’s rumours of a $65 per share takeover bid from KKR remain uncorroborated. Harley-Davidson will report earnings at the end of this month.RW Baird noted the company’s strong balance sheet with only $750m of debt, excluding its financial services arm. However, RW Baird cut its rating to neutral from outperform, maintaining its target price for the stock at $54.“We have no information that would corroborate takeout speculation surrounding the company, and are aware of no credible source behind the rumour,” it said in a research note. “With shares above our fundamental price target, we would need evidence to support a takeout scenario to sustain our outperform rating here.”UBS analysts also downgraded the stock to neutral. KKR were previously rumoured to be making a bid for Harley-Davidson in 2010, which was also unconfirmed. RW Baird described the motorcycle company as “among the most valuable brands on the planet with an intensely loyal customer base”.Other big declines were concentrated in the energy sector, which fell 1.9 per cent, as Brent crude lost 4.3 per cent, to close the day at $47.96. The materials and financials sectors also lost ground, falling 1.9 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively.Among the worst performers were Southwestern Energy, which fell 10.4 per cent to $11.66, Chesapeake, which gave up 6.3 per cent to $4.30 and Marathon Oil, which lost 6.1 per cent to $14.72. Murphy Oil, which led the energy sector’s gains last Wednesday, dropped 7.9 per cent to $30.09.At the other end of the spectrum, a number of food, beverage and consumer companies led the S&P 500 index. Dr Pepper Snapple, the soft-drink maker, was the best performers on the S&P 500 — rising 1.8 per cent at $97.34, buoyed by the company’s limited exposure to Europe, good news in light of the UK’s vote to leave the EU.Campbell Soup gained 1.7 per cent to $67.19, Clorox, which manufactures cleaning products, rose 1.5 per cent to $139.24, and US supermarket operator Kroger, moved up 2.1 per cent to $37.33.Consumer staples was the second-best S&P 500 index, rising 0.5 per cent, behind utilities, which gained 0.7 per cent.On the day, the S&P 500 dipped 0.7 per cent to 2,088.6, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6 per cent to 17,840.6, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8 per cent to 4,822.9.
12;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-06-17T20:47:12Z;Wall Street endures second straight weekly loss;Technology and healthcare sectors decline while energy stocks gain on higher oil price;US stocks suffered a second straight weekly decline on Friday, weighed down by the technology and healthcare sectors. The market has been nervous ahead of next week’s UK referendum on EU membership, which has driven up volatility. The Vix index, Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” approached 23 this week, its highest level since February. The barometer eased back below 20 on Friday, its long-term average.Weakness dictated IT companies on Friday, with the S&P 500’s largest sector lagging the broad market. The tech sector has fallen 3.1 per cent this month after May’s robust performance. Financials, down 4.4 per cent, followed by tech are the worst performing major S&P groups for June.Alphabet, parent of Google, dropped 2.6 per cent to $691.72 a share, software maker Microsoft fell 0.5 per cent to $50.13 and the social network company Facebook slid 1.2 per cent to $113.02.Apple fell 2.3 per cent to $95.33, pressured after a Bloomberg report that it may have to interrupt sales of iPhones in Beijing after an authority ruled it had violated a competitor’s patent.The business software company Oracle, rose 2.7 per cent to $39.68, however, after outlining a shift to cloud computing services.Healthcare shares also weakened. Merck, the drug manufacturer, dropped 2.8 per cent to $55.89, Pfizer fell 1.5 per cent to $34.22 and Johnson & Johnson lost 1 per cent to $115.48.At the close the S&P 500 stock index was 0.3 per cent lower at 2,071.2, its sixth decline in seven trading sessions after touching a 2016 high on June 8. The index sits 2.8 per cent below its record peak of May 2015.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 17,675.2, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.9 per cent to 4,800.3.Energy was the only sector to gain on Friday, buoyed by firmer oil prices. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, settled 3.8 per cent higher at $47.98 a barrel.Oil and gas benefited most, with Murphy Oil climbing 4.9 per cent to $29.34, Marathon Oil up 3.9 per cent to $13.16 and Devon Energy 3.4 per cent higher at $35.98.Oilfield services companies, which work under contract with producers to help them drill, also gained. Transocean climbed 7.5 per cent to $11.31 and National Oilwell Varco was up 3.9 per cent to $35.18.Patches of strength appeared among US retailers. Gap rose 4.1 per cent to $20.13, retail chain Nordstrom climbed 1.9 per cent to $37.48 while Bed Bath & Beyond climbed 3.3 per cent to $43.85.Shares of cosmetics maker Elizabeth Arden soared 49.1 per cent to $13.88 after beauty company Revlon said it would buy the company for $14 a share. The acquirer rose 6.7 per cent to $33.25.
13;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-06-12T10:22:16Z;Oil majors find virtue in integration;Slump in crude prices highlights benefits in owning upstream and downstream businesses;He was reporting record losses amid a prolonged industry downturn, and facing a big shareholder revolt against his 20 per cent pay rise. But Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, did manage to find one bright spot amid the gloom at the company’s annual meeting.“Not so long ago I used to hear a lot of advice about how we should separate out our downstream business and sell it off,” he told shareholders in April. “I don’t hear that so much any more.”Mr Dudley was reflecting what executives at the largest energy companies have been saying for the past year or so: that this downturn, the worst in 30 years, has vindicated the business model of the “vertically integrated” oil groups. These companies combine the upstream activities of finding and developing oilfields with downstream functions such as refining crude and selling petroleum products.As in many other industries, oil companies have been facing growing pressure to become more focused. However, since the collapse in crude prices began in mid-2014, that pressure has gone into abeyance. Low prices have crushed profits from oil and gas production, but helped refining and chemicals businesses, supporting integrated groups’ earnings.Yet while the questions over the value of integration may have eased off for a while, they are unlikely to have disappeared for good.There are two principal benefits from being an integrated company. One, in the words of Rex Tillerson, chief executive of ExxonMobil, is that it “captures the highest value for every molecule that flows through our facilities”.As he explained it to analysts in March, Exxon can adjust its production to serve the most profitable markets.“We react more effectively and rapidly to changes in the business environment,” said Mr Tillerson. “Our global supply organisation utilises sophisticated demand planning and marketing tools that provide insights to achieve the best value for our upstream production.”The second professed benefit of the integrated model has come into focus during the oil slump: that owning both upstream and downstream businesses creates a hedge against a drop in the price of crude.In 2014, Royal Dutch Shell generated $16.5bn in profit from its upstream operations and $6.3bn downstream. The following year, the balance flipped: upstream earnings slumped to just $1.8bn, while downstream profits remained roughly flat, adjusting for one-off items.John Abbott, Shell’s head of downstream, says: “The business is very cyclical. Sometimes value will be in the upstream . . . sometimes it will be in the downstream. I’ve lost count, to be honest, over the last 35 years, how many times that has happened.”Weak oil prices helped refiners last year as crude fell faster than the value of refined products, boosting margins. BP reported average refinery margins of $17 a barrel last year, up 18 per cent compared with 2014.For more than 20 years, both of those putative benefits derived from integration have been challenged.Advocates for break-up accepted downstream profits could provide stability during an oil price slump, but argued the costs of the added complexity outweighed the benefits.They also pointed out physical integration — companies refining their own crude — was dwindling. Frederic Choumert of Roland Berger suggests most large international companies might run only 20 per cent of their production through their own refineries.The financial crisis subdued those break-up calls for a while, but as markets recovered the pressure re-emerged. In 2011, researchers at Oppenheimer argued large US oil groups could raise their valuations 20 per cent by spinning off their refining and marketing operations.A few US companies acted on those recommendations. Marathon Oil spun off its downstream operations as Marathon Petroleum in 2011, and ConocoPhillips did the same with Phillips 66 in 2012.Under pressure from Elliott Associates, an activist investor, Hess sold off its terminals and pulled out of refining in 2013, to focus on production.At first glance, the slump in oil prices since 2014 might seem to have made those moves look rash. In the past two years, Hess shares have dropped by 34 per cent, Conoco’s by 41 per cent and Marathon Oil’s by 61 per cent.But adding in the performance of the spun off refining businesses, the break-ups do not look like big mistakes. The weighted average total shareholder return for Conoco and Phillips 66 since the 2012 split, including dividends, has been 40 per cent. Over the same period. Chevron’s total shareholder return has been 12 per cent and Exxon’s 18 per cent.Mr Choumert argues if oil companies want to remain in upstream and downstream activities, they have to show investors there are real advantages to the model, whether in terms of scale and financial strength, or in physical integration.Some companies have been responding to those concerns. BP has restructured its US downstream operations, selling two refineries, to focus on those that are closely linked to its marketing businesses.Tufan Erginbilgic, BP’s head of downstream, says: “We are trying to create differentiated business models so we can generate differentiated returns . . . Then we are not going to have one good month for the company and another month not good.”Some companies are even expanding their downstream operations. Total is planning to get involved in building more liquefied natural gas terminals and power plants, to drive demand for the gas it produces.None of this, however, means the argument for splitting up vertically integrated companies has gone for good, not least because refining margins have slipped back again this year.Occo Roelofsen, a senior partner at McKinsey, which has published multiple papers in the past advocating break-up, says the argument looks weaker now.“The debate has shifted because large companies have improved their performance and lowered their costs during the downturn more than we thought,” he says.Mr Choumert, however, thinks there will still be pressure for change, especially at smaller integrated companies such as Repsol of Spain.“I would not be surprised if there is a move made on them to try to get them to realign their business.”The arguments over what segments of the oil value chain belong in the same company stretch back more than 150 years.John D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil took control of the US oil business in the 1870s by dominating the refining and transport industries, which gave him leverage over the fragmented production companies, but it was not initially a significant producer.Standard subsequently acquired more wells, and by the end of the century accounted for 32 per cent of US crude output, according to Ron Chernow in Titan, his magisterial biography of Rockefeller. Even so, Standard’s position in the upstream industry was always weaker than its grip on refining and transport. At the time of its break-up in 1911, it owned 70 per cent of US refining capacity, but only 14 per cent of its crude productionIn the 1950s and 60s, when the cartel of large western companies known as “the seven sisters” controlled the global market, owning the entire value chain helped them maintain their dominance.In the 1960s and 70s, though, the oil-producing countries of the Middle East and North Africa took control of their industries with a series of nationalisations. Western companies were forced to range further afield in search of reserves, to Alaska, sub-Saharan Africa and central Asia, and as they did so their refineries became increasingly distant from their wells, according to Richard Forrest of AT Kearney.The emergence of a truly liquid global spot market for crude in the 1980s made it less important for companies to lock up supply chains internally to ensure reliable flows of crude. Physical integration — companies processing their own crude in their refineries — went into decline.
14;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-06-07T20:27:38Z;Biogen falls after clinical trial setback;S&P 500 energy sector rallies on rise in price of oil;Biogen shares dropped on Tuesday after the biotechnology company said a potential therapy for a form of multiple sclerosis failed in a clinical trial.The group said that a Phase II study of its opicinumab drug missed its primary target, which evaluated improvement of physical and cognitive function, as well as disability, in patients with relapsing forms of MS.It also failed its secondary goal that gauged whether it slowed the progression of disability from the neurological disorder.Biogen noted, however, that there was “evidence of a clinical effect”, adding that “due to the complex nature of the data set, we continue to analyse the results to inform the design of our next study”.Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Jefferies, said that, while Biogen “clearly has not ruled out further exploration” of the drug, a higher level Phase III trial appears to be “highly unlikely” and that there is “increased risk to the programme overall from mixed results”.Biogen’s shares plummeted by 12.7 per cent to $253.14, extending their 2016 decline to more than 17 per cent.The broader markets were barely moved on Tuesday. The S&P 500 crept up 0.1 per cent to 2,112.1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.1 per cent to 17,938.3, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1 per cent to 4,961.8.The S&P touched its highest level since last July during the day and sits within striking distance of the all-time high the broad-market index set last May.“Low volatility, easing financial conditions and early signs of improving sentiment are all contributing to the rotation into risk [assets],” said Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI.Elsewhere, shares of Ralph Lauren fell after the clothing company announced restructuring plans and forecast a sharp sales decline in its current fiscal year.The company said it expected its revenues to fall at a “low-double digit rate” in the fiscal year that ends in March 2017, compared with Wall Street estimates for a 4 per cent decline.Ralph Lauren also said it would take a restructuring charge of up to $400m as part of a transition led by Stefan Larsson, chief executive, who took the helm last year.The group’s shares fell by 2.4 per cent to $94.06. They have fallen by 30 per cent over the past 12 months.On the other side of the spectrum, the S&P 500 energy sector rallied for the second straight day. US crude oil prices advanced by 1.4 per cent to $50.36 a barrel, the first time it has settled above $50 a barrel since July. Brent crude, the international marker, rose 1.8 per cent to $51.44 a barrel.The oil price has almost doubled since mid-February, which has dramatically lifted sentiment over energy groups.Indeed, the risk premium investors demand to hold the lowliest-rated debt of companies in the sector over Treasury bonds has dropped by more than 50 per cent since oil bottomed in February, according to data from BofA Merrill Lynch.Marathon Oil, an exploration and production company, was among the gainers on Tuesday, jumping 4.7 per cent to $14.62. Chevron, an oil major, rose 2.1 per cent to $103.32.
15;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-04-18T20:39:04Z;US energy groups benefit amid volatility;All main S&P 500 sector in the black with energy and consumer discretionary posting biggest gains;The shares of US energy groups were volatile on Monday after big oil producers failed to reach an agreement over the weekend to freeze output at January levels.The S&P 500 energy sector, which tracks large-cap groups, dropped as much as 1.5 per cent at one point on Monday, but rebounded to a gain of 1.6 per cent by the close of trade.Exploration and production (E&P) groups faced the most intense volatility: Marathon Oil went from a loss of 5.6 per cent to a rise of 2.7 per cent, closing the day at $13.36.Small-cap energy companies, generally seen as more susceptible to fluctuations in the oil price since they frequently have relatively weaker balance sheets, fluctuated in the widest range. The Russell 2000 energy sector tumbled 3.4 per cent before rebounding to a gain of 2 per cent.Oasis Petroleum, an E&P group, having traded lower earlier in the day, ended 0.9 per cent higher at $8.71.Big global oil producers, including Opec leader Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela, were expected to agree on Sunday to freeze production at January levels as they looked to stabilise oil markets amid sustained low oil prices.However, the meeting ended in disarray after Saudi Arabia took a tougher stance with Iran, which has sought to increase production after its international sanctions were lifted in January.“A resurging market share battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran . . . casts a veil over the timing of the realignment of supply and demand” in the energy market, said Michael Scialla, an analyst at Stifel, who advised clients to “stay on defence” regarding US E&P companies.West Texas Intermediate, the US crude oil marker, traded down 1.4 per cent to $39.78 a barrel, having fallen nearly 7 per cent in Asia trading.Elsewhere, Hasbro rallied after posting a jump in quarterly profits and sales as the toymaker benefited from strong demand for Star Wars-related toys, rising 5.8 per cent to $87.18.Profits rose to $48.8m, or 38 cents a share, in the first quarter, from $26.7m, or 21 cents a share, in the same period in 2015.Sales climbed 16 per cent to $831.2m. Wall Street analysts forecast earnings of 24 cents a share on sales of $779.3m.The group is also “very encouraged with global demand and our outlook for 2016”, said Brian Goldner, chief executive.That came as good news since concerns have grown in recent months about the state of the world economy. The International Monetary Fund this month reduced its forecast for world economic growth in 2016 by 0.2 percentage points to 3.2 per cent.At the close, the S&P 500 had climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,094.3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 18,004.2 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4 per cent to 4,960.Every main S&P 500 sector was in the black. Energy and consumer discretionary stocks posted the biggest gains.In addition to the focus on oil, investors were also bracing for a number of quarterly earnings reports and a European Central Bank meeting this week.
16;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-04-18T15:35:23Z;US energy groups roiled amid oil drop;;The shares of US energy groups were roiled on Monday after major producers failed this weekend to agree to freeze output at January levels.“A re-surging market share battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran … casts a veil over the timing of the realignment of supply and demand” in the energy market, said Michael Scialla, an analyst at Stifel, who advised clients to “stay on defense” regarding US oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) companies.The S&P 500 energy sector, which tracks large-cap groups, dropped as much as 1.5 per cent on Monday, but managed to rebound to a gain of 0.2 per cent by mid-morning. E&P groups faced the most intense volatility: Marathon Oil fell as much as 5.6 per cent, before paring its losses to 0.8 per cent. EOG Resources shed a loss of 2.6 per cent to rise 0.6 per cent to $76.13.Small cap energy companies, which are generally seen as more susceptible to fluctuations in the oil price since they frequently have relatively weaker balance sheets, fluctuated in a wider range. The Russell 2000 energy sector tumbled 3.4 per cent, before cutting its losses to only 0.3 per cent.Oasis Petroleum, an E&P group, is trading 4.5 per cent lower at $8.24, having tumbled by as much as 9 per cent earlier. Atwood Oceanics, an offshore rig contractor, was down by roughly the same margin at $8.67.Major global oil producers, including Opec kingpin Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela, were expected to agree on Sunday to freeze production at January levels as they look to stabilise oil markets amid a sustained period of low oil prices. However, the meeting ended in disarray after Saudi Arabia took a tougher stance with Iran, which has sought to increase production after sanctions were lifted recently on the Middle Eastern nation.West Texas Intermediate, the US crude oil marker, recently traded down by 2.5 per cent to $39.34 a barrel, having fallen nearly 7 per cent in Asia trading.
17;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-04-12T18:31:39Z;US energy stocks jump on higher oil prices;;The US energy sector is on track to post its biggest rally in nearly two months as US crude oil prices jumped to their highest closing level since November.The S&P 500 energy index, which tracks the shares of large US energy companies, climbed 2.7 per cent in mid-day trading as all 38 members advanced. That far outpaced the S&P 500′s 0.8 per cent rise.The advance tracked sharp gains in the price of crude oil: West Texas Intermediate, the US market, was up 4.5 per cent at $42.17 a barrel. Brent crude rose 3.9 per cent to $44.50 a barrel.The bullish jolt came after a report that said Saudi Arabia and Russia had agreed to a pact to freeze crude oil production at current levels, even if Iran does not agree to cut its output. It comes at a time when global producers are taking greater action to deal with the glut of supply that has weighed down prices since 2014.Embattled Natural gas group Chesapeake Energy was the biggest winner in the sector, spiking by nearly a third, after it said it secured a fresh credit line. Marathon Oil also posted a strong gain after revealing plans to sell $950m in assets to shore up its balance sheet.Still, the sector as a whole is down 17.8 per cent over the past 12 months.
18;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-02-26T21:42:14Z;JC Penney retail chain jumps after beating forecasts;Materials, energy and financials make gains on muted day for stocks;Shares in JC Penney, the department store in the middle of a turnround, rallied on Friday after the company reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.The Texas-based retail chain jumped 14.7 per cent to $9.59 after the company reported adjusted earnings of 39 cents a share, on sales of $4bn. That compared with analysts’ expectations for earnings of 21 cents a share, on sales of $4bn.However, the company’s net loss widened to $131m, or 43 cents a share, compared with $35m, or 11 cents, a share in the year-ago period.The retailer said that its selling, general and administrative (SG & A) expenses decreased by $218m, or 270 basis points, compared with the previous year.“Although it looks like a big bottom-line beat . . . the entire beat came on SG & A, which in our view isn’t the highest quality,” said Paul Lejuez, an analyst at Citi, but he noted that the beat was “likely to scare some shorts”.“Still, the company seems to be making some improvements to business, which, when combined with easier comparisons, is likely to generate reasonably good results in the near term,” he said.Same-store sales, a key industry metric, advanced 4.1 per cent in line with forecasts.JC Penney has been a bright spot in the department-store sector — with same-store sales declining 4.8 per cent at Macy’s, 2 per cent at Dillard’s and 7.1 per cent at Sears Holdings — amid the rise of ecommerce and competition from off-price retailers such as TJX Cos.Marvin Ellison, chief executive, noted that JC Penney continued to “win market share in a competitive environment”.JC Penney also said it expected adjusted earnings per share to be positive in 2016.Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, said it was “a faster than expected return to profitability”.JC Penney has worked to reinvent itself after a failed turnround led by Ron Johnson, former Apple executive, alienated customers. The retailer has since brought back its popular coupons and discounts.JC Penney shares have advanced 44 per cent since the start of 2016.Elsewhere, the S&P 500 materials sectors rallied 1.4 per cent, outpacing the broader market, as the price of copper rose to the highest level of 2016.Freeport-McMoRan, a copper miner that has been pressured by low commodity prices, rallied 4.4 per cent to $7.43. The stock is still down by almost two-thirds over the past 12 months.Energy stocks also performed well on the back of a rise in the price of US crude oil.Transocean, which operates offshore oil rigs, jumped 5.1 per cent to $8.65.

Meanwhile, utilities, consumer staples and telecommunications, all defensive sectors, fell.
19;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2016-02-03T00:58:53Z;Standard & Poor’s cuts ratings of US oil and gas groups;Chevron hit and shale producers are downgraded to junk;Standard & Poor’s has cut the credit ratings of some leading US oil and gas companies, including Chevron, the country’s second largest, as a result of the agency’s lowered expectations for long-term crude prices.The decisions show how the plunge in oil and gas since the summer of 2014 is hitting not only the highly indebted exploration and production companies that borrowed to finance their growth during the US shale boom, but also the more financially conservative independent companies and even the large international oil groups Chevron and ExxonMobil. Three leading shale oil and gas producers, Continental Resources, Southwestern Energy and privately held Hunt Oil, were downgraded from investment grade to “junk” status. Exxon, the largest US oil group and one of only three companies in the country with an AAA status, was put on watch for a possible downgrade of the rating. S&P said it would decide on Exxon within 90 days.The moves follow the agency’s announcement last month that it would be using lowered long-term oil and gas price expectations to calculate ratings. Its new projection is that both international benchmark Brent and US West Texas Intermediate crude will average $40 this year, $45 next year and $50 from 2018 onwards. In December 2014, S&P was using a long-term Brent price assumption of $85. The agency said on Tuesday that the scale of the reduction in its price expectations meant that even investment grade companies were affected. It added that it expected many of those companies to continue to cut capital spending and raise their productivity, but “these actions, for the most part, are insufficient to stem the meaningful deterioration expected in credit measures over the next few years”. The agency said it would assess Exxon’s “financial policies and strategies for mitigating the potential impact of the downturn”, as well as look at its 2015 results. Exxon reported a 50 per cent drop in earnings for 2015, a smaller decline than for rivals Chevron and BP, and is cutting capital spending sharply, but its net debt rose by $10.6bn during the year to $35bn as it borrowed to pay its dividend. Ratings for Chevron as well as EOG Resources, Apache and Devon Energy, three large independent oil and gas producers, were cut but remained investment grade. Ratings for Hess, Marathon Oil and Murphy Oil, three other leading independent US exploration and production companies, were cut to BBB-, also still investment grade but just one notch above junk. ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, was also put on watch for a possible downgrade within 90 days. S&P said this would depend on the company’s ability to achieve cost savings and asset sales, and to cut capital spending without hurting production rates. There was good news for four others, however: Occidental Petroleum, EQT, Cimarex Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources were affirmed at investment grade ratings. The moves follow S&P’s announcement on Monday that it had cut Royal Dutch Shell’s rating by one notch to A+ from AA-, and put a negative outlook on other large European oil companies including BP, Statoil and Total.Yields on investment grade energy bonds, which move inversely to their price, have climbed rapidly as oil tumbled over the past year, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The yield on the US bank’s energy index had risen to 5.36 per cent on Tuesday, more than 1.9 percentage points above its low last April. The spread of the yield on the energy index above US government bonds has widened to its highest level since the country started to emerge from recession in 2009.

At the close they were flat at $51.50.Meanwhile, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) were expected to rise to between $123m and $131m, compared with $111.2m a year ago and ahead of forecasts.The company said revenues and earnings in Macau, the Chinese casino gambling centre, are estimated to decline from last year.A slowdown in the Chinese economy coupled with the nation’s crackdown on corruption has seen Macau’s gaming revenue decline for 19 consecutive months.Wynn said adjusted ebitda in Macau is expected to be in the range of $156m to $164m, down from $241.2m in the year-ago period. However, the high end of that range was above consensus estimates for $157m.“Given the high short interest in Wynn Resorts, this pre-release should lead to a sharp short covering rally, which recently has led to swings of 10 per cent or more,” said Harry Curtis, an analyst at Nomura.However, he said that investors should wait to “understand the sustainability of the strength in December in Macau” before jumping in.Shares in Wynn Resorts slumped more than 50 per cent last year.Walt Disney shares fell 5.26 per cent to $93.90 after analysts at Barclays downgraded the stock to “underweight” from “equal weight” and reduced their price target to $89 from $98.Analysts noted that despite boosts to the stock from the latest instalment in the Star Wars film franchise, there is a risk to earnings next year as its sports channel ESPN continues to lose subscribers even as sports programming costs climb.Disney shares have been hurt as viewers increasingly choose to “cut the cord” on their cable and network television subscriptions as competition from online streaming sites such as Netflix and Amazon rises.With Brent crude, the global oil marker, and West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, both falling below the $30-a-barrel mark, energy stocks took a hit.Marathon Oil was the biggest loser, falling 10.25 per cent to $8.14, shares in Chesapeake Energy declined 4.04 per cent to $3.56 while shares in Transocean dropped 6.45 per cent to $9.86.The S&P 500 energy sector was one of the worst performing sectors alongside information technology.The decline in technology shares was led by Intel, which slid 9.10 per cent to $29.76, after the company issued disappointing sales guidance for the current quarter and amid a broader sell-off in US equities.US markets were lower on Friday following a sharp sell-off in Chinese equities and oil prices that sapped confidence.By the close, the S&P 500 had declined about 2.1 per cent to 1,880.14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen around 2.3 per cent to 15,985.96 and the Nasdaq Composite was off 2.74 per cent to 4,488.02.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

27;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2015-09-23T13:13:36Z;Financial pressures hit US shale oil output;Several companies have cut their capital spending plans for the year;Marathon Oil has been at the vanguard of the US shale drilling revolution. Year after year it reported double-digit gains in crude lifted from North Dakota’s Bakken, Texas’s Eagle Ford and other hotbed regions.Now, those heady days are over.“Our focus, as we navigate the volatile environment and progress through the planning cycle, will be capital discipline and balance sheet strength, not production growth,” Lee Tillman, Marathon’s chief executive, told an investor conference this month.The collapse of oil prices has turned the attention of producers towards survival. As they conserve cash, US crude oil production volumes are finally heading lower. The government has revealed domestic output peaked in April and forecasts that US production will be down by 400,000 barrels per day next year.The decisive contraction illustrates how Opec’s decision to fight for share in the world oil market is beginning to draw blood. The US is feeling particular pain, as drillers reliant on a steady flow of capital are seeing it dry up. How companies respond will help determine the speed at which an oversupplied market finds balance.The decline in US oil production has lagged behind crude prices. West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, first tumbled below $100 a barrel in July 2014. The slide became a rout by autumn.But the number of rigs drilling for US oil did not start to decline in earnest until five months later, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company. Production reached a 44-year high of 9.6m b/d in April, according to the Energy Information Administration. Living with cheaper oilRead moreSince then supply has shrunk across the country, with only the Permian Basin of Texas still growing. “It’s pretty much across the board,” says John Staub of EIA.US exploration and production (E&P) companies were able to keep drilling early in the slump thanks to investors eager to provide capital. With crude below $50, that support is evaporating.E&P companies raised $9.1bn from bond issues in the first quarter of the year and $10.3bn in the second quarter, but just $1.7bn in total in July and August, according to Dealogic.The next tightening of financial conditions is approaching fast in the shape of redeterminations of E&P companies’ borrowing bases: the limits on bank lending, based on the estimated value of the companies’ oil and gas reserves.Although banks take their own views on the outlook for oil prices, they use the futures market as a reference point, and since the last round of borrowing base redeterminations in March and April forward prices have dropped sharply.Front-month WTI crude is down about $4 per barrel since the beginning of March, but oil for delivery in December 2016 has dropped $11, from about $63 to $52. That downward shift in the futures curve will drag down banks’ valuations of all oil assets.A recent survey of oil industry executives, advisers and financiers by Haynes and Boone, the law firm, found that on average they expected borrowing bases to be cut by 39 per cent this autumn.The impact of the squeeze can be seen in several E&P companies that have cut their capital spending plans for the year since the round of second-quarter results statements over the summer.For example Continental Resources, one of the pioneers of shale oil production, said earlier this month that it was reducing planned capital spending by about 12 per cent “to better align spending with cash flow at current commodity prices”. It is stepping down from running 10 rigs to eight in the Bakken.That cut will affect Continental’s production. For the year as a whole, it still expects its average output to be 19-23 per cent higher than last year. But by the end of the year, it only expects to be producing up to 8 per cent more than the 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day than it reported for the end of 2014.The response of producers will vary relative to their size and financial strength and the quality of their assets. Citigroup analysts note that even if a producer files for bankruptcy protection, its best fields may keep flowing as creditors seek to maintain cash flows during restructuring.Another wild card is what happens to hundreds of thousands of US “ stripper wells,” marginal operations that extract an average 2 b/d from holes drilled decades ago.

It was followed by oil and gas producer Chesapeake Energy, which fell 5.5 per cent to $7.34, its weakest level since 2003.Phillips 66, the oil major that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold out of earlier this year, was another notable loser, falling 2.9 per cent to $80.80.Chevron was down 3 per cent to $80.91 while ExxonMobil, the world’s largest publicly traded energy company, was 2.1 per cent weaker at $76.24.All of which combined to leave the S&P 500 Energy sector down 2.8 per cent, making it the worst performer on the index.The decline extends the sector’s tumble this year to nearly 17 per cent.A note from Citigroup, saying oil at $32 a barrel “is a conceivable reality”, also added to the bearish sentiment towards the energy sector.Retail was also in focus after Target reported better than expected second-quarter earnings and raised its earnings guidance for the year.Shares jumped by as much as 5.4 per cent in early trading to $84.62 — although they later pared gains to trade 0.7 per cent higher at $80.89 by the close of trading.Despite the decline, Target has been handily outperforming the wider retail sector, with the stock up more than a third since Brian Cornell took over as chief executive last August.By contrast, Walmart, which cut its earnings guidance this week, extended its losses for the year to 20 per cent after falling another 1.3 per cent on Wednesday.American Eagle Outfitters suffered its biggest one-day intraday decline in almost nine months after the teen retailer said it expects same store sales growth to slow in the third quarter.The shares fell by as much as 10.5 per cent — the largest drop since December 2014 — before recovering to trade 7.4 per cent lower at $16.92.The tumble comes after a big run up in the stock over the past year. AEO shares have climbed nearly 50 per cent amid signs that the company was making headways in reviving its slumping sales.Hormel Foods, the maker of Spam, Muscle Milk and Jennie-O turkeys, rose 1.2 per cent to $61.22 after raising its earnings guidance for the year.Staples was 0.2 per cent lower at $14.12 after second-quarter revenue came in slightly below expectations.The wider US market followed its Asian and European counterparts lower.The S&P 500 was down 0.8 per cent at 2,079.61, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 17,348.73 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent weaker at 5,019.05.
29;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2015-06-28T10:31:55Z;Hopes rise for malaria vaccine as oil companies fund trials;Equatorial Guinea hosts tests that hold promise of end to disease that kills 600,000 a year;Two US oil companies are pouring millions of dollars into the trials of a promising malaria vaccine in Equatorial Guinea in a rare sign of foreign investors trying to help tackle one of Africa’s biggest health scourges.Marathon Oil and Noble Energy have teamed up with the government of Equatorial Guinea to fund trials of one of the most hotly tipped malaria vaccines in development.Strong results from early trials of the PfSPZ vaccine, owned by Sanaria, a US biotech company, have raised hopes that it could provide a path to elimination of a disease that kills nearly 600,000 people every year.“We’re not in the business of pharmaceuticals but we looked at the data and became more and more enthused about the potential for this vaccine,” said Carl Maas, head of corporate social responsibility for Marathon in Equatorial Guinea..Marathon, Noble and another company they jointly control, Ampco, will commit $11.75m to the trials, with the government investing a further $36.75m. A mid-stage trial involving 450 people will start next year followed by a late-stage trial with 3,000 people in 2017-18.Similar collaborations have taken place before, such as funding bed nets, but this is thought to be the biggest investment of its kind by an African government and industry partners in vaccine development.Stephen Hoffman, Sanaria chief executive, said the funding showed that African governments were recognising the importance of vaccines to long-term elimination of malaria and offering more support for research and development.The first malaria vaccine to reach market is expected to come from GlaxoSmithKline, the big UK pharmaceuticals group, whose product, called RTS, S, is awaiting regulatory approval after 30 years of development.However, in clinical trials, RTS, S only cut infections in children by half and in babies by a quarter suggesting that, while it could help reduce the number of cases, it would not halt the disease.This leaves open an opportunity for smaller players such as Sanaria to develop more effective vaccines but with only a fraction of GSK’s resources it is dependent on outside help to push its product forward. In some small early-stage trials, PfSPZ was 100 per cent effective in preventing malaria.600,000Number of people killed by malaria every yearBig progress has been made against malaria with the death rate halving since 2000. Yet it remains among the world’s biggest killers, especially among the young, and weighs heavily on African economies.Although Marathon says its main motivation is philanthropic, there is also a long-term commercial incentive to help eradicate a disease that affects about 10 per cent of the locals among its 900-strong workforce in Equatorial Guinea each year.Foreign energy companies are among the biggest investors and employers in the oil-rich west African nation of 760,000 people. Other agencies involved in setting up the trials include the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute and Medical Care Development International, a US non-governmental organisation — as well as researchers from Tanzania, where another small trial has taken place.
30;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2015-03-19T09:58:16Z;Demystifying the ‘Fracklog’;Number of uncompleted shale wells will drop as oil prices recover;Sometimes new words are useful additions to the language. Sometimes they can create confusion.“Fracklog” is the catchy neologism for the backlog of US shale wells that have been drilled but not yet brought into production.More prosaically known as “drilled but uncompleted” or “waiting on completions”, these wells still need to be fracked and fitted with production equipment for the oil to flow.Interest in the fracklog started picking up last month when EOG Resources, the largest US shale producer, said it would “intentionally delay” completing some of its wells.Some analysts think this tactic, spread across the industry, will be significant later in the year. They argue that as soon as US crude prices recover a little, companies will start production from those uncompleted wells, bringing a rush of extra supply on to the market. This could stifle any recovery in prices.There may be something in this argument. EOG expects to add about 85 uncompleted wells this year, while Anadarko Petroleum said recently it would drill but not complete 125 wells this year.Apache said it would defer some completions, without giving a number, while Chesapeake Energy said it planned to build a “little bit of inventory” in uncompleted wells in the Eagle Ford shale.For some producers, deferring completions makes sense. Completing a well can account for between a half and three-quarters of its total cost, so slowing completions is a quick way to start delivering the cuts in capital spending.The contango in crude futures, with prices significantly higher for next year than for immediate sales, also creates an incentive to leave oil in the ground and extract it at a later date.And with activity slowing sharply, the cost of completing wells could be lower later in the year, too, as the companies providing fracking and other services cut their rates.However, it is still unclear just how widespread the practice of deferring completions really is.The diversity of US shale producers makes it difficult to generalise about their strategies. Extrapolating from large, financially sound businesses such as EOG and Anadarko is particularly hazardous.There are likely to be many shale producers, with debt payments to meet or loans to repay, that cannot afford the luxury of a fracklog. They may also have commitments with drilling contractors that mean there are limits on how quickly they can lay down rigs. If they have paid for the rigs already, they might as well use them.125Number of wells Anadarko Petroleum said it would drill but not complete this yearIndeed, other leading shale oil producers including Marathon Oil, Whiting Petroleum and Hess, have said they do not plan to defer completions at all.The number of wells “waiting on completion services” has been rising sharply in North Dakota, home to the prolific Bakken shale formation. They have risen from an average of about 650 last October to 825 at the end of January.Some of that increase may, however, be due to tighter regulations on flaring. In the fourth quarter of last year and again at the start of this year North Dakota cut the proportion of associated gas from oil wells that can be burnt off, forcing producers to work out other solutions.Others may also be waiting for the cuts in North Dakota’s state taxes on oil production that will kick in once West Texas Intermediate crude has been below $55.09 for five consecutive months, a point that looks likely to be reached in May.Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, expects that across the US, the fracklog will actually be lower at the end of the year than its estimate of about 3,000 todayUS exploration and production companies may be able to sustain their production this year, but only through intense efforts to improve productivity and cut costs. Expecting them to coast to growth on a cushion of drilled but uncompleted wells would be a mistake.The Commodities Note is an online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
31;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2015-03-10T05:07:28Z;Oil group Whiting’s on the wall for takeover;US producer could catch the eye of a company keen to expand its position in shale;As the price of crude has plunged, speculation about which US oil company would be first to accept a takeover bid has risen. Over the weekend, Whiting Petroleum went to the top of the list of possible candidates when it emerged that the company had hired bankers to sound out possible buyers.As the largest producer in the Bakken region of North Dakota following last year’s acquisition of heavily indebted Kodiak Oil and Gas, with total production of about 163,000 barrels per day, Whiting could be an attractive target for a company looking to expand its position in US shale.If it does find a buyer at the right price, merger and acquisition advisers say, that could catalyse a wave of activity across the sector.With its finances battered by the falling oil price, and a focus on the Bakken, which is a relatively high-cost area, it is understandable that Whiting wants to explore its options. Shares in the company rose almost 11 per cent on Monday to close at $37.71.It seems unlikely that Whiting will be able to carry on as is without taking some remedial action. But while it may be under pressure, it is not yet a forced seller. It could sell more assets, cut capital spending or issue shares before deciding to throw in the towel.The pressure on Whiting comes in large part from the $2.2bn of additional net debt it took on last year by buying Kodiak, which brought the group’s total to about $5.6bn. Between the deal being agreed in July and closing in December, the price of US crude dropped about 35 per cent.In December, Whiting negotiated new credit facilities. Its banking syndicate agreed to a $4.5bn commitment, of which the company had drawn down only $1.4bn by the end of the year.In the wild, some animals puff themselves up as a defence mechanism. Companies sometimes employ a similar strategy through acquisitions, hoping the enlarged entity will be stronger. Whiting Petroleum, the US shale oil explorer, is rumoured to be looking for buyers.Continue readingAs is typical for the US exploration and production industry, that commitment is secured against Whiting’s reserves, opening the company to the risk that if oil prices fall and the value of its assets shrinks, credit will be withdrawn.That does not look like an imminent threat. The borrowing facilities were agreed when oil prices had already fallen, and forward prices in the futures market were actually slightly lower than they are now, suggesting that Whiting will not suffer a sudden shortage of liquidity unless the oil price falls further.Even if that $4.5bn commitment remains intact, however, Whiting is on course to burn through its liquidity quickly. After buying back $750m in Kodiak bonds and covering its planned $2bn of capital spending this year, the company expects to have $1.35bn of that credit commitment left unused if oil prices remain around $50.At that rate of cash consumption, it would be roughly another 18 months before the money ran out.The most drastic move to avoid that fate would be to accept a bid. Whiting’s $11.8bn enterprise value means a buyer would need to be a larger independent or international oil company, but that still leaves a wide field.From the US, Hess, Marathon Oil, Anadarko Petroleum, ConocoPhillips and Pioneer Natural Resources could be interested, bankers say.From Europe, Total of France and Statoil of Norway, the foreign company that has had the greatest success with US shale oil, are also said to be looking at possible North American deals.Whiting might even attract ExxonMobil and Chevron, the two largest US companies, although one banker suggested it might not be large enough to “move the needle” for them.The strongest argument against Whiting’s board and investors approving a deal is the risk that they sell out while asset values are temporarily depressed in a shortlived oil price downturn.The same concerns could inhibit asset sales. Whiting has already announced a $1bn disposal plan, which is expected to include gas processing plants and what the company has described as “lower-value” oilfields.At a time when companies are seeking to invest in the highest-quality assets to maximise returns, there may not be enthusiastic demand for Whiting’s cast-offs.Cutting capital spending further, after a planned 50 per cent reduction already proposed for 2015, is another option. However, Whiting’s production growth is already slowing, to an expected 6 per cent — pro forma including Kodiak — for 2015 overall. If investment were reduced, production could start falling, and investors in independent oil companies have always valued growth.That leaves equity issuance as perhaps the most attractive course. Eric Otto of CLSA notes a robust market for share sales by smaller US oil and gas companies, with several — including Laredo Petroleum, Concho Resources and Noble Energy — issuing equity to raise hundreds of millions of dollars each.Analysts at Simmons & Co suggested this week that Jim Volker, Whiting’s chief executive, might be interested in swapping his Whiting holdings for shares in a larger company.The longer that oil prices remain around these levels, the more attractive such an exit will seem to all of Whiting’s shareholders.
32;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2015-02-09T18:20:23Z;UK North Sea: deconstruction;Decommissioning oilfields will become one large project in the next couple of decades;“There is nothing outside of the text” said the French philosopher Jacques Derrida. His method of operation was not to get caught up in distracting themes, but to focus on the building blocks of the text instead.That is hard to do, when the subject in question is North Sea oil. Big picture themes abound here, from Scottish independence to employment and the economy. But focus on the (slowly rusting) nuts and bolts of the matter — production facilities are ageing, and the decommissioning process will take decades.So look at the companies which will be taking those nuts and bolts apart. Oil & Gas UK, the industry’s lobby group, believes that between 2014 and 2023 oil companies will spend £14bn plugging North Sea wells and removing infrastructure. Wood Mackenzie says that spending on decommissioning will exceed that of developing oilfields in the North Sea from 2022.That £14bn is not much against the £12bn a year that oil companies in the UK pay the oil services industry. But energy companies face the choice of keeping high cost oilfields going or paying to shut them down. Marathon, for example, will probably need to consider doing something with its Brae field. Production, which peaked at 120,000 barrels a day should cease in four years. Help is available. Most decommissioning costs can be deducted for tax purposes. So the decommissioning industry may grow faster even if oil prices stay low. Already, production in the UK North Sea has fallen steadily, down by about two-thirds since 2000.But decommissioning has hardly begun, and even the supply chain for this industry is young. Engineering groups such as Wood Group and AMEC, offshore specialists such as Saipem and Subsea 7 and specialist companies such as Able should all be busy. The North Sea should become one large deconstruction project over the coming couple of decades. That should keep Derrida fans happy.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
33;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2014-12-09T18:08:39Z;US shale industry faces endurance test after Opec rejects cuts;Cartel’s refusal to cut oil output turns screw on US crude producers;"When Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries last month rejected calls for a production cut by Opec, the oil cartel, they put the responsibility for stabilising plummeting crude prices on to the US shale industry. Suhail al-Mazroui, energy minister for the United Arab Emirates, said US shale companies and other producers who had created an oil glut should “respect the needs of the market”. Less diplomatically, Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the leading shale oil producers, said Opec had “declared war” on the US industry.Two weeks on from that Opec decision — and against a backdrop of a 40 per cent fall in the oil price since June — evidence of its negative impact on US producers is starting to emerge.Rather than a war, the US shale industry is braced for a test of endurance. As the pressure on oil producers mounts, weak companies face the threat of dwindling investment, faltering production, forced asset sales and possible bankruptcy.The successful companies will be the ones that both entered the downturn in the strongest position and are most effective at improving their efficiency. They can hope to make it through to better days when the oil price recovers and are also likely to be able to pick up some undervalued assets.On Monday ConocoPhillips, the US’s largest exploration and production company, unveiled plans to cut its capital spending by about 20 per cent next year to $13.5bn — a steeper reduction than analysts had expected — and said it would defer drilling programmes in several North American shale areas.Last Friday Baker Hughes, the energy services group due to be bought by rival Halliburton, published data which showed the number of rigs drilling for oil in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas had fallen by 16 since October to 190. The number of rigs in the Bakken shale and related North Dakota formations had meanwhile dropped by 10 to 188.Also last week Drillinginfo, a consultancy, published figures showing that the number of new permits to drill wells had fallen by about 30 per cent in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford areas last month compared with October. That may overstate the likely drop in activity, because companies will have a backlog of permits they can use, but it is clear the industry is responding to a steep drop in the oil price.Allen Gilmer, Drillinginfo’s chief executive, said: “Because production from shale wells comes on fast and drops off fast, their economics are more exposed to short-term prices.” This applies more than for other types of oil production, where projects can take many years to come on stream, activity and output from shale can be stepped up and down quickly.New extraction techniques and high oil prices boost US oil productionWhile all shale companies are under pressure, their responses to the declining oil price will often be different. The companies vary widely in terms of debt levels, financing, hedging against price falls, product mix, location and quality of their assets and operational efficiency, and those differences have been reflected in share price movements over the past six months.One important issue for companies is their gas production. From 2010 until this summer, many US shale companies were shifting away from natural gas and towards more lucrative oil production.But now gas is back in favour. It has fallen less than oil and is likely to rebound if there is a cold winter in the US. As a result, the shares of gas-focused companies such as Cabot Oil and Gas have often been less affected than their more oil-focused peers.Another critical factor is debt. The shale surge has been built by borrowing: companies have typically spent more on drilling and completing wells than they have generated in cash flows and over the past decade about $163bn worth of high-yield debt has been issued by US oil and gas producers. Some have relied much more heavily on debt than others, however.If US crude were to average about $70 per barrel next year, EOG Resources and Anadarko Petroleum would have debts roughly equal to a year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation — a very comfortable level, according to analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt, the investment bank. Other larger companies including Marathon Oil, Apache, Devon Energy and Chesapeake Energy also have debt burdens that seem manageable.At the other end of the scale, companies such as Laredo Petroleum, SandRidge Energy and Range Resources would have debts about four times their ebitda, according to Tudor Pickering, while for Ultra Petroleum, Exco Resources, Goodrich Petroleum and Halcon Resources the multiple would be even higher.Beyond the financial metrics, the quality of a company’s assets is also important. Some of the companies that are focused on the Bakken shale, including Continental Resources and Whiting Petroleum, have been out of favour with investors, but the early evidence from rig activity and drilling permits is that there is no one “play” — as the different geological formations are known — that has been worse affected than any other.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingMore than the broad region where a company operates, it can be the quality of its specific lease areas within the region that matters, according to Cody Rice of Wood Mackenzie, another consultancy. In an area such as the Eagle Ford, companies in the core where the rocks are most productive can continue to thrive, he says, “but if you’re underperforming your peers, and you’re not in the core of the play, it’s not going to be so good for you”.The other crucial variable is operational performance. Reid Morrison, the advisory leader for US energy at PwC, the accounting firm, says that up until this summer there was very little focus on efficiency in the shale industry. When he tried to advise on cost savings, “the reaction we were getting was: ‘We agree with that, but it’s not important right now’,” he says. “There was a lot of confidence that the new floor for the oil price was around $90 per barrel.” Now that view has changed completely: interest in ideas for cost savings is soaring.Market upheaval: Unwelcome newcomer is likely here to stayWhen Opec members talk about the US contribution to world “oversupply”, they are referring to the growth in US crude production of about 4m barrels per day, about 80 per cent, since 2008. US shale has caused an upheaval in oil markets, and many rival producers, in Russia as well as Opec, hope it will go away.The existence of a group of financially strong shale companies such as EOG Resources and Devon Energy, however, suggests that the US industry is not about to crumble. They have been covering their capital spending from cash flow generation, unlike many of their rivals, and have little debt. They may cut capex next year, but do not face pressure to make deep reductions.Any good US shale assets owned by companies that cannot afford to develop them are likely to be picked up by financially stronger groups. If these can drive down costs, helped by increased spare capacity in the energy services industry, the oil prices needed for development to be commercially attractive could be lower than previous estimates have suggested.Many investors will suffer losses on exposure to oil and gas if prices stay at current levels. But some analysts expect the overall impact on US oil production to be relatively modest.“The rate of increase in production is going to slow down,” says Philip Verleger, an energy economist. “Even at $50 oil, though, US production probably plateaus, but it doesn’t start going down.”"
34;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2014-06-08T07:58:58Z;Shale boom brings its own set of challenges;As the aftershocks of an energy revolution reverberate, the sector is rethinking everything from transport to markets;In one of his characteristically compelling turns of phrase, Bill Clinton said: “So far, every single person that’s bet against America has lost money.”The best recent evidence for the truth of the former president’s 2012 proposition to the Democratic National Convention has been in the energy industry. Ten years ago, the US seemed condemned to inexorably rising imports of both oil and gas.Since the shale production boom took off, the US has switched from worrying about imports of liquefied natural gas to planning its first exports, while in oil it is looking at the prospect of possibly regaining the previous all-time peak in production that it reached in 1970.For the businesses and governments of North America, the boom has created a fresh set of challenges for areas such as oil and gas transport, investment decisions and environment policy. The tensions that accompany success are generally preferable to the problems of failure, but they are real nonetheless.Rising US production has caused a sort of cosmic upheaval in North American energy. Before, the US was the dying star round which its smaller neighbours to the north and south would orbit, as their resources were sucked in by its gravitational pull. But not any more.Before the shale revolution, it was clear for oil and gas producers in both resource-rich Canada and middle-income Mexico that their principal focus had to be on supplying the needs of consumers in the US, the world’s largest energy market.Now they are realising that the US will not necessarily be prepared to buy as much as they are wish to sell.Oil and gas producers are now being forced to seek out new markets, both among domestic buyers and customers around the world. Indeed, both countries are becoming increasingly large importers of gas from the US.An entire trading system is being turned on its head. Across North America, producers and consumers of energy alike are fixated on issues of oil and gas transport.The US shale boom and growing production in the oil sands of western Canada have reconfigured the demand for pipelines and other infrastructure. Regions such as the Bakken shale of western North Dakota, which had very little oil production, have become important producing centres.A surge in gas prices in the north-eastern US during the cold weather at the start of the year was a reminder that, large as the shale gas resources of the US might be, they are not much use if they cannot be delivered to customers when they are needed.The announcement in the first week of June from TransCanada, the pipeline company, that it intended to invest C$1.9bn ($1.73bn) in a project to help supply gas to the proposed Kitimat LNG plant planned by Chevron and Apache for the west coast of Canada, was a reminder of the great opportunities that exist in building the infrastructure that will be needed.For Canada, though, the transport problem is compounded by politics.The Keystone XL project to bring diluted bitumen from the oil sands of Alberta to Nebraska, where it can connect with other pipelines in the US network, has been delayed for more than half a decade by a battle between the industry and environmental campaigners. Reluctant to offend either side, the Obama administration has repeatedly deferred the decision it needs to make on whether the project should be allowed to go ahead. As both sides of the argument admit, Keystone XL is of largely symbolic value. If it continues to be blocked, a big proportion – perhaps all – of the oil it would have carried will move in rail tanker cars instead.The US state department’s report on the project’s environmental impact concluded that greenhouse gas emissions – the focus of green campaigners’ concerns – would actually be higher if the pipeline were rejected and the oil went by rail, and the risk of accidents would probably be higher.Even so, the combatants are now so deeply dug in over Keystone XL that retreat for either side seems impossible.The continuing rapid growth in oil trains is causing safety concerns in both the US and Canada after a series of accidents.For oil and gas companies, the possibilities of shale are still attracting high rates of investment, as many companies reshape their portfolios to increase their weighting in the US.Marathon Oil, for example, said on June 2 it was selling its assets in the Norwegian North Sea for $2.1bn, to redeploy the capital where it would earn higher returns: in US shale.The attractions of the US also raise questions about other investments in North America. Total of France said late last month it planned to shelve its $10bn Joslyn oil sands mining project in Canada because the costs were too high.It comes as the oil sands industry is reflecting on what the implications of increased competition from US production might be.The Mexican government is having to make similar calculations, as it decides the terms for foreign energy investment.There is great interest from the global industry in the possibilities being opened up by Mexico’s energy reforms, but companies say the details need to be right before they can commit themselves.Meanwhile, as Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations points out, there have been two energy revolutions in the US in the past 10 years. As well as the shale boom, there has been rapid growth in the production of energy from renewable sources.The announcement last week by President Barack Obama of plans to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants build on a series of subsidies and regulations that have been pushing in the same direction: towards decreased use of coal and a greater role for renewables.The US administration’s policies, which have been broadly supportive of both shale development and renewable energy, now face a pair of critical challenges.In oil, the boom in production of US light sweet (low-sulphur) crude from shale is creating a mismatch with refining capacity that in recent years has increasingly been configured to take heavy and sour (high-sulphur) crudes.The obvious solution would be to relax the tight restrictions imposed on crude oil exports, to allow overseas sales of light sweet oil, while the US still imports heavy and sour blends. Political pressure to keep American oil at home to benefit American consumers might stymie such a move, however, potentially leading to a glut of light sweet oil and falling prices, in turn hitting production.An unrelated but similarly trade-related issue has cropped up in solar power where, following a complaint from a German-owned company called SolarWorld, the US commerce department has said it plans to impose duties of up to 35.2 per cent on solar panels imported from China. Cheap Chinese panels have helped solar power become competitive with fossil fuels in some parts of the US, and if duties push prices up then its competitive position will be damaged.Above all, while confidence in the outlook for the US is generally high, no one can be certain how shale production will evolve.The US Energy Information Administration expects the country’s oil production to rise to a peak in 2020, and then begin to fall off, albeit slowly. In all the decisions they take, governments and businesses alike need to be alive to that uncertainty.
35;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
36;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2014-06-02T16:45:26Z;Marathon Oil: in the long run;Shale oil, not natural gas, may be the US oil company’s motivation;Sell mature fields all over the globe and buy growing US shale. Marathon Oil is following a familiar pattern as it returns to its roots (it was founded in Ohio in 1887). On Monday the company announced the sale of its Norwegian assets to Det Norske for $2.7bn, including debt. The sale is the culmination of a $6.2bn divestiture plan Marathon has undertaken since splitting off its refining operations in 2011. With the deal complete, two-thirds of Marathon’s oil and gas production will come from North America. The company also has a string of exploration projects from Gabon to Kenya to Iraqi Kurdistan.Marathon will use the proceeds from the Norwegian deal – and from its recent disposal in Angola – to accelerate production in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale fields, where forecasted production growth is a strapping, all-American 30 per cent this year.Marathon is also using part of the proceeds for a $2.5bn share repurchase programme – further underlining its appeal to growth investors by increasing earnings leverage.Is betting on US shale “best in the long run”, to quote Marathon’s 1930s slogan? For big oil, buying into shale fields has not always translated into turning a profit. Marathon is helped by many of its shale assets being “liquid-rich”. They produce oil and natural gas liquids, rather than only natural gas, which is languishing at $4.6 per million btu, well below pre-crisis peaks.So far the market has not been excited at Marathon’s strides into US shale. Marathon is cheaper than peers such as Apache and Hess in terms of valuation relative to debt-adjusted cash flow, according to UBS. After several years of strong performance, its shares have barely kept pace with the S&P this year. With net debt at a $4.5bn, roughly half this year’s expected ebitda, Marathon still has room to double-down on its best performing assets.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
37;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2014-06-02T11:14:24Z;Det Norske seals transformational Marathon Oil agreement;;An oil explorer controlled by one of Norway’s richest men is transforming itself into one of the country’s biggest producers by paying $2.1bn for Marathon Oil’s local assets.Det Norske, half owned by Aker, an oil services company majority-owned by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke, will increase its production 20-fold and become one of the biggest independent companies operating in the Norwegian part of the North Sea.Lee Tillman, president and chief executive of Marathon Oil, said the sale would help his company concentrate its firepower on developing shale projects in the US that offered higher returns.“Marathon Oil has a deep inventory across three high-quality US resource plays with expanding opportunities to further accelerate activity,” he said.Marathon first announced plans to sell its North Sea interests last December, when it said the proceeds would be used to expand rig count across its Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Woodford shale acreage in the US.The sale of its Norwegian interests will take total divestments to $6.2bn since it emerged as an independent exploration and production company in 2011 following the spinout of its Marathon Petroleum refining arm.Nathan Piper, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: “The deal reconfirms the rotations of large independent North American E&Ps out of the North Sea, an environment associated with high costs and project delays back to more predictable domestic energy opportunities which investors should reward them for.”The agreement is one of the biggest made by the buccaneering Mr Røkke, who started out as a teenager working on a fishing trawler before going on to own Wimbledon football club in the UK and Molde in Norway.His main assets are the Aker series of companies, which includes interests in fishing and engineering as well as a big stake in Norway’s leading oil services company.Marathon had intended to sell its UK North Sea assets alongside those held in Norwegian waters. However, the company said it had not received an acceptable offer for the assets.The agreement helps Det Norske finance its part in the biggest oil find in the North Sea in decades. Det Norske has stakes in two out of the three licences in the Johan Sverdrup field, possibly the biggest discovery in Norway in 40 years, and also is involved in the Ivar Aasen discovery that is due to start production in 2016.Øyvind Eriksen, Aker’s chief executive and a close confidant of Mr Røkke, called the agreement a “milestone” for Det Norske and added: “It transforms Det Norske into a major independent European oil and gas producer and enables the company to play an even more important role in the development of the Norwegian continental shelf.”Det Norske’s shares were up 8 per cent, while Marathon’s were up 0.5 per cent in early morning New York trading
38;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2014-04-03T16:25:09Z;Europe’s dangerous addiction to Russian gas needs radical cure;;The way America sees it, Europe has to kick the habit. The continent is dangerously addicted to Russian gas, and it needs a dose of cold turkey.US secretary of state John Kerry reinforced that message on Wednesday. Europe, he said, had to wean itself off Russian energy imports and stop the Kremlin using them as a political weapon.“It really boils down to this: no nation should use energy to stymie a people’s aspirations,” Mr Kerry said in Brussels, just as Russia’s Gazprom raised the price it charges Ukraine for gas.Moscow’s annexation of Crimea has raised massive concerns in Europe about the continent’s energy relationship with Russia. At a summit last month, heads of government asked the European Commission to look at how the bloc could reduce its reliance on Russian hydrocarbons.But kicking the addiction will be a Herculean task. Last year, Gazprom exported about 155bn cubic metres of gas to Europe, or about 31 per cent of European demand, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. It is unclear how it can replace those molecules.Bernstein Research has calculated that to do so, Europe needs to eliminate 15 bcm of residential and industrial gas demand, invest $215bn and incur $37bn of annual costs in the form of higher-priced energy. That works out as $160 for every single person in Europe.“Like it or not, Europe is stuck with Russian gas,” says Bernstein’s Oswald Clint.In theory, there are plenty of alternatives. A new energy corridor has just been sanctioned that will bring Caspian gas being developed by a BP-led consortium into the heart of Europe. Import terminals are being built to receive liquefied natural gas (LNG) from places such as Qatar and Nigeria. And countries such as the UK are moving ahead with developing their substantial reserves of shale gas.“There is no doubt that in the 2018-20 period there are going to be more options for buyers in Europe,” says Massimo di Odoardo of Wood Mackenzie.Europe’s push for energy independence has forced Russian companies such as Gazprom and Rosneft, led by Putin ally Igor Sechin, pictured, to look for new markets and shore up their relationships elsewhereSee belowSome policy makers hope renewables, which are expanding rapidly in some EU countries, might one day replace gas. The Ukraine crisis has even led to a partial rehabilitation of coal: it may be a polluting fossil fuel, but unlike gas the big exporters are in friendly, stable countries such as the US.But phasing out imports of Russian gas will not be easy – or cheap – as Europe’s experience with LNG shows.There are 20 operational LNG regasification plants in the EU, with a combined import capacity of about 198 bcm of gas per year. A further 30 bcm/y are under construction.But Europe’s terminals are conspicuously underused. Imports of LNG have fallen sharply, partly because of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, which prompted Japan to switch to gas-fired generation and diverted LNG cargoes from Europe.Last year, Europe’s net imports of LNG were about 48 bcm, the lowest since 2004 and nearly half the 2011 peak of 90 bcm, according to the UK’s BG Group.Increasing supplies will mean more LNG for Europe: Mr di Odoardo says 150 bcm of LNG production capacity is being built globally “and we don’t believe there’s enough demand in Asia for all of it”.However, it will not be cheap. Securing more LNG will require Europe, which spends about $11 per million British thermal units for gas, to pay closer to the Asian import price of about $15 per mBtu.“The question is: are European customers prepared to pay Japanese prices for LNG?” says one Brussels-based European gas industry official.The stand-off with Moscow over Ukraine could hardly have come at a better time for Europe’s troubled renewable energy industry, writes Pilita Clark in London.Energy security has always been a big selling point for wind farms and solar plants, along with a desire to tackle climate change.Continue readingSome commentators say the US could ride to Europe’s rescue. But it will be more than a year before the first US LNG export terminal is built. And the assumption is that most US exports will flow to Asia.A more palatable solution could be for Europe to produce more of its own gas. But efforts to exploit European shale gas have not been encouraging. Many countries are ambivalent about fracking: France and Bulgaria have banned it.In Poland, considered one of the more promising locations, flow-rates from about 60 exploration wells have been considerably below expectations. Big regulatory uncertainties remain and some players, such as ExxonMobil, Marathon Oil and Talisman Energy, have retreated. “The next 12 months could be make-or-break for Polish shale,” says Eric Oudenot of Boston Consulting Group’s energy practice.In Britain, despite excitement about the country’s shale potential, only one well has been fracked in the past five years. “Even if exploration results are positive, it will require drilling hundreds of wells per year, which raises issues about public acceptance,” says Howard Rogers, director of gas research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Either way, he says, UK shale is “unlikely to make much of an impact this side of 2020”.Arguably a more urgent task is to improve energy security by unifying the EU market – in particular, linking up the countries of eastern Europe. These suffered acutely when Moscow shut off supplies in 2009 during a price dispute with Ukraine.One response has been to build cross-border interconnectors, allowing these nations to transport gas from north to south (Soviet-era pipelines largely run east-to-west), and so tap more sources of non-Russian gas, such as LNG from Polish and Lithuanian import terminals due to open this year.“Poland’s transmission system is being changed in a radical way . . . our resistance to all types of crises radically increases,” Malgorzata Szymanska, director of the oil and gas department of Poland’s economy ministry, said at a recent conference. This month, German gas will be delivered to Poland through a new connector and last week the leaders of Hungary and Slovakia inaugurated their connector.As European buyers look around the world for new sources of liquefied natural gas, the most promising prospects lie in the US, writes Ed Crooks.Continue readingIf Europe is serious about reducing its dependence on Russian gas, it will have to take radical measures. Bernstein’s Mr Clint lists some: switching from gas to diesel power, closing gas-intensive industries such as oil refining, reducing gas consumption in heating and adding more coal-fired generation – which would inevitably increase carbon emissions.Added to that, Europe is contractually obliged to continue taking delivery of Russian gas. Bernstein makes the point that Gazprom has about 120 bcm of take-or-pay contracts – with companies such as ENI, Edison and RWE – that require Europe to continue paying about $50bn for Russian gas. Many of these stretch way beyond 2020.“We continue to believe Gazprom’s most profitable market is safe,” Mr Clint concludes.Additional reporting by Jan CienskiRussian energy groups look for new marketsRussian energy companies have moved to shore up relationships with non-European suppliers in recent weeks as the continent seeks to reduce its reliance in Moscow, writes Jack Farchy.Gazprom held talks with Kuwait and Egypt about expanding supplies of liquefied natural gas and next month hopes to sign a large long-term supply deal with China. Igor Sechin president of Rosneft and a powerful ally of Vladimir Putin, went on a whirlwind tour of customers and counterparties in Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and India.Emerging markets: News and comment from more than 40 emerging economiesRonald Smith, oil and gas analyst at Citigroup in Moscow, said the current crisis was “turning Russian eyes east”.None would disagree, however, that if Europe were successful in navigating away from Russian energy, the impact on Russia would be significant.While Europe is dependent on Russian oil, gas and coal supplies, the dependence is mutual: Europe accounts for half of Gazprom’s gas revenues, according to the company, and 71 per cent of Russia’s crude oil exports, according to the International Energy Agency.But few Russian groups are especially concerned about the short- or medium-term effects of Europe’s renewed push to reduce energy dependence on Moscow.“Gazprom has heard it all before,” said Jonathan Stern, director of gas research at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies. “For the past 20 years Europe has been trying to diversify away from Russian gas and failed.”In the longer term, Russian companies are just as actively trying to diversify their own customer base as European politicians are trying to diversify supplies.“Recent developments may accelerate the process of export diversification by Russian oil and gas companies and strengthen collaboration with Asian partners as a long-term trend,” analysts at Gazprombank said in a recent note.In a recent draft energy strategy for the next 20 years, Russia’s energy ministry outlined plans to double oil sales and quintuple gas sales to Asia by 2035. “The most import task is a rapid entry into the Asia Pacific market,” it said.Russian energy groups have begun this push. A growing share of oil, largely from Rosneft, is flowing directly to China by pipeline. Lukoil last week started commercial production at its enormous West Qurna field in Iraq – much of whose production is likely to be sold in Asian markets, analysts say. And Novatek, together with CNPC of China, is building an LNG terminal that will help shift gas exports towards Asia.Alexei Pushkov, head of the foreign relations committee in the Duma, summed up the Russian view on Europe’s plans last week. Any reduction in imports from Russia thanks to Europe’s diversification strategy “is not a prospect for the next few years,” he said. “And by that time I think Russia will find alternative gas export markets, especially in an environment of strong Asian demand for gas.”“It seems to me that Russian gas will continue to have a consumer in the European market.”
39;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2013-12-29T17:29:12Z;Activist hedge funds launch fight for right to pay bonuses;;"Activist hedge funds are fighting for the right to pay bonuses to directors that they place on corporate boards.This comes as 33 US companies have amended their bylaws to disqualify any directors that receive payment from outsiders, in the hope of deterring attacks by activist investors such as Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman and Daniel Loeb.The bans have raised the ire not just of activists but of institutional shareholders, many of whom are sceptical about the motives of the activists but who want to retain the right to choose directors for themselves.Prominent activists vow they will not back down, and are canvassing support among shareholders and their advisers.Mr Icahn dismissed concerns that directors paid by activist shareholders would have incentives to act in their own interests rather than those of the company as a whole.“Why is it all right for a company to give directors free access to planes and hundreds of thousands in board fees and all kinds of perks, yet if I find a Nobel prizewinner who is going to really help a company it is not all right for me as a holder of a lot of stock to give him a share in my profits?” he said.Existing board directors are just as likely to act against shareholder interests, Mr Icahn added, for example by opposing a takeover of the company.“If you give a director hundreds of thousands in board fees a meeting and all kinds of perks, he doesn’t have a lot of incentive to see that come to an end.”Lawyers who defend companies against activist attacks have been pushing the idea of a payments ban this year, and companies including Halliburton, McGraw Hill Financial, Marathon Oil and Wynn Resorts have already amended their bylaws, according to the corporate governance advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services.But another activist fund, Jana Partners, argues that existing board directors have often built up substantial shareholdings and stock options, so activists’ nominees would only be compensated in line with other directors.When Jana nominated directors to the board of fertiliser company Agrium earlier this year, it proposed paying them bonuses based on the company’s performance over the coming years. Elliott Management proposed similar payments to its nominees to the board of Hess, the energy company. Both plans proved controversial: Jana’s nominees lost; Elliott withdrew the scheme.“Our only real constituency is shareholders,” said Charles Penner, partner at Jana. “If we can convince them that we have a structure that works, then we can get there.”In November, the organisation advised voting against the re-election of board members at Provident Financial. The California bank had adopted a version of the payment ban that would even have prevented activists from paying a one-off fee to nominees for agreeing to stand for election, currently a widespread practice.Chris Cernich, director of proxy fight research at ISS, said: “Whether investors are for or against Hess-like compensation, they are unified they want to be able to decide for themselves.”"
40;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2013-11-25T16:16:34Z;Rules snag Poland’s shale gas ambitions;Process hampered by a sluggish government approach;"Poland has been pilloried for its overwhelming reliance on polluting coal and is still overwhelmingly dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies, so the possibility that the country could be sitting on its own vast stores of shale gas set off an initial frenzy of excitement.However, the process of creating a viable shale gas industry has turned into a years-long slog, as it has been held up[ by the government’s sluggish approach to regulation and taxation which threatens to hobble the sector before it gets moving.After years of work, a new mining law was recently presented to cabinet for approval – in two versions. The treasury ministry and the environment ministry failed to come up with a single proposal, with the former favouring an approach that would maximise government revenues and the latter wanting to see the gas industry expand as quickly as possible.“We really need to drill more and the reason it is not happening is because of regulations,” said Stanislaw Rychlicki, head of the oil engineering department at Krakow’s mining university, during a recent Warsaw conference on the issue.Some early explorers such as ExxonMobil, Marathon Oil and Talisman Energy have withdrawn from prospecting for shale in Poland as optimism has faded.“The biggest uncertainty is over the shape of the law,” says Jacek Wroblewski, development director of BNK Polska, the Polish subsidiary of the US energy company.Approval to drill a test well takes about a year, and until recently if a company wanted to drill deeper than 1,000m, it needed to scramble through still more regulatory hoops. That was changed to 5,000m this June.The final taxation scheme is also unclear, although the finance ministry has said that tax take should not come to more than 40 per cent of profits, and that taxes will only be imposed after 2020.Finally, there are deep conflicts within the government over the role of a proposed national operator, dubbed NOKE, which is supposed to be a participant in all concessions. The treasury and environment ministries are at loggerheads over who should control the company.Private industry is also dismayed at the NOKE proposal and at the red tape that entangles the sector. There are also questions over whether exploration companies will easily get commercial concessions for any gas they find.“This is absolutely crazy,” says an energy company executive who asks that his name not be used. “If they would just let us get on with drilling, then at least we’d be able to find out how much shale gas Poland really has.”So far exploration efforts have been disappointing. Just over 50 test wells have been drilled, and only a handful of them have been hydraulic fractured – the process in which water mixed with sand and chemicals is pumped at high pressure underground to break apart rock formations and release the gas locked within.“This is simply a drop in the ocean of what we need to do,” complains Prof Rychlicki. He estimates that Poland will need to drill about 300 test wells – each costing $10m-$15m – before the country will have a proper grasp of how much shale gas it has, and whether it can be extracted in commercial quantities.The US Energy Information Administration set off Poland’s shale frenzy in 2011, when it estimated that the country might have reserves of 5.3tn cubic metres, the largest in Europe. Recent estimates by the Polish geological institute have been more conservative, suggesting shale gas reserves may be in range of 346bn to 768bn cubic metres. Poland uses 16bn cubic metres of gas a year.Poland’s geology is different from that of the US and Canada, and the impact of the North American shale revolution could still affect European gas prices, casting further doubt on the commercial viability of Poland’s shale.Adding still more complications are sharp divisions in the EU over fracking. France has banned the hunt for shale on environmental grounds – worries that Polish officials say are spurious – while Germany has a moratorium and the European Parliament is toughening up shale regulations.“Our arms are too short to deal with this alone,” admits Piotr Wozniak, deputy minister of the environment and Poland’s point man on shale. Warsaw hopes it will gain a significant ally in London, as the UK embarks on its own hunt for shale gas.There is also growing pressure to get some commercial production under way before 2019, when Poland reopens talks with Russia’s Gazprom on another long-term gas supply contract. Having a nascent shale gas industry of its own would strengthen Warsaw’s negotiating hand.Poland now pays some of the highest prices in the EU for the Russian gas, which provides about two-thirds of its annual supply.The government seems to have realised that its foot-dragging is harming the chances of Poland developing a viable shale gas industry. Marcin Korolec, the environment minister, was fired in a recent cabinet reshuffle for not moving fast enough on shale.""This is linked to speeding up work on extracting shale gas,"" said Donald Tusk, Poland's prime minister, when announcing the change, while Maciej Grabowski, Mr Korolec's replacement, promised that getting new shale gas regulations in place would be his ""priority""."
41;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2013-08-28T14:02:09Z;Oil market: multiple worries;Libya may be bigger threat to oil price than Syria;"With the threat of air strikes hanging over Syria and turmoil raging across the Middle East, oil is up and stocks are down. That is a predictable and rational reaction to uncertainty. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is 15 per cent higher over three months, with a sharp rise in the past few days. The world is captivated by both the horrors in Syria and the paralysis in Egypt. Yet the country the oil market really ought to worry about is Libya.Syria always has been and always will be a marginal player in the oil market. Before the civil war, it produced about 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day; that may have fallen to about 70,000 b/d now. Nor is it a significant transit point. A western military strike there would undoubtedly have a financial impact – Société Générale estimates that it could push the oil price up to $125 from about $117 on Wednesday. But that ought to be shortlived, unless there is widespread contagion across the region, which is unlikely.More troubling is Libya, which produced almost 2 per cent of the world’s total oil and gas output last year. Earlier this year, Libya was boasting that it was almost back to its prewar production level of about 1.6m b/d (of which 1.3m b/d is exported). But strikes and protests have cut its daily oil production to an average of just 500,000 b/d this month. The chaos that has gripped the country since the ousting of Muammer Gaddafi in 2011 now threatens to curtail production indefinitely.That is bad news for Eni, for sure. The recovery of Libyan production lies behind the Italian group’s outperformance in recent months. Repsol and Marathon Oil also have stakes in fields there. Any prolonged breakdown of security will be a negative, though so far there has been little stock market reaction.Investors can worry about Syria by all means, but beware more trouble out of Libya.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

The block has proved and probable reserves of 533m barrels, according to Sinopec. The deal is still subject to approval by Chinese and Angolan governments.Marathon outlined a $3bn asset disposal target in 2011 to free up its balance sheet and fund further exploration and development projects."
43;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2013-05-08T17:01:03Z;Blow to Poland’s shale ambitions as Talisman and Marathon pull out;;Poland’s hopes of weaning itself off Russian natural gas suffered another blow on Wednesday when two foreign energy companies – Canada’s Talisman and Marathon of the US – said they were pulling out of the hunt for shale gas in the country.Paul Warwick, executive vice president of Talisman, said in a statement that the company was going to hand its share of its Polish concessions to its partner San Leon Energy, and focus on the Americas and Asia. “Although encouraged by the preliminary results of our drilling program, we need to focus on what is important to our shareholders,” he said. The company had drilled three test wells in Poland.Marathon was less forthcoming, relegating the news of its departure to a terse few words deep in a quarterly results statement:After an extensive evaluation of the Company’s exploration activities in Poland and unsuccessful attempts to find commercial levels of hydrocarbons, Marathon Oil has elected to conclude operations in the country.The moves follow last year’s announcement by ExxonMobil that it too was leaving Poland.Energy majors Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Italy’s Eni are still present in Poland.Poland has enormous potential reserves of shale gas, a gas that is trapped in rock formations deep underground and has to be liberated by pumping high pressure water to fracture the rock, a process known as hydraulic fracturing or fracking.The US Energy Information Administration estimated in 2011 that Poland had possible reserves of 5.3tn cubic metres, the biggest in Europe, which set off dreams of its becoming another Norway. More recent estimates by the Polish Geological Institute have been more conservative, saying the country may have 346bn to 768bn cubic metres of shale gas.Polish shale prospects attracted a large number of foreign oil and gas companies with the technological knowledge and financial backing to undertake the very expensive exploration process.The government also saw a chance to diversify away from Russia, which supplies about two thirds of the 14bn cubic metres of gas Poland uses every year.But finding the gas and turning it into a commercial venture has proved to be much more difficult than expected, in large measure because of red tape, proposed production taxes and a complex planned regulatory scheme.“Above ground risks such as regulation, licenses and taxation are very high indeed,” said Grzegorz Pytel, an energy expert with the Sobieski Insititute, a Polish think tank. “In practical terms, the shale gas industry does not yet exist in Poland.”The country has issued about 115 exploration licenses but companies have drilled only about 45 test wells. Of those, only four have been horizontally fracked, which would give some idea of the level of gas flow.With private industry on the back foot, the government has been putting more emphasis on shale exploration by state controlled companies like PKN Orlen, a refiner, and PGNiG, the former gas monopoly.In a sign of the importance the government is placing on the project, shale prospecting is being financed by state controlled companies like copper miner KGHM, which have no expertise in the energy sector.“In time Polish resources could be attractive but at the moment regulatory arrangements make it impossible to explore on a low-risk basis,” said Pytel.Related reading:
44;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2013-03-20T18:18:33Z;Anadarko finds ‘potentially giant’ oilfield;;Anadarko Petroleum, the US independent oil company, has discovered a “potentially giant” field in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico, one of the largest ever discovered in the region.The Shenandoah 2 appraisal well, begun in September last year, has yielded a field that could hold 500m or more barrels of oil, and may open up a new area of the gulf for oil production.The well goes 26,500 feet below the seabed in 5,800 feet of water, and the field will require a multibillion-dollar investment in production facilities. The first oil is unlikely to flow from it until late in the decade at the earliest.However, the success of Shenandoah is another sign of the resource potential of the Lower Tertiary level of rocks deep below the seabed of the Gulf of Mexico, raising hopes that it will remain an important oil producing region for many years to come.Anadarko owns 30 per cent of the well, and is the operator. ConocoPhillips also has 30 per cent and Cobalt International Energy has 20 per cent, while Marathon Oil and Venari Resources, a recent exploration start-up backed by Warburg Pincus, each have 10 per cent.Bob Daniels, Anadarko’s senior vice-president for deepwater and international exploration, highlighted evidence that the Shenandoah field had “reservoir rock and fluid properties of much higher quality than previously encountered by industry in Lower Tertiary discoveries”, meaning that the oil would be easier to extract.Brian Reinsborough, Venari’s chief executive and president, told the Financial Times that he expected Shenandoah to be “very prolific”, and “entirely different” from other deep Lower Tertiary discoveries.He added that, even after the cost of putting new production facilities in place, “we believe the finding and development costs will be very attractive, because of the volumes we have found”.Participating in a discovery of this size is a coup for Venari, which was founded less than a year ago with $1.125bn in capital, and was one of the first new entrants to the gulf after the government’s drilling moratorium following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.The Coronado well a few miles away from Shenandoah, drilled by Chevron with Conoco, Anadarko and Venari as junior partners, has also shown “very positive indications”, according to Conoco. Chevron has not yet made any formal statement on it, saying only that it expected to report results by August, but it seems likely to bring that forward.Mr Daniels said the Shenandoah Basin, where the wells have been drilled, “has the potential to become one of the most prolific new areas in the deep water Gulf of Mexico”.The success at Shenandoah is more good news for Anadarko, which has scored high-profile successes recently with large gas discoveries off the coast of Mozambique.Anadarko was a junior partner in BP’s disaster-hit Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, but continued to explore actively in the region after the moratorium was lifted in 2010. It expects to drill six to eight wells there this year.Shares in Anadarko rose 3.7 per cent to $86.39 in midday trading in New York.

46;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2012-10-19T16:58:38Z;From Africa’s frontier to Tokyo’s skyline;My recent investments include an African agriculture group and a Japanese landlord;I’ve spent much of the summer sitting on the sidelines, with about a fifth of my portfolios in cash. Apart from the odd punt on market volatility, my main concern has been to see if the global economy can avoid a nasty slowdown. I’ve kept my dabbling in adventurous “special opportunities” to the absolute minimum.But two new purchases have broken that long spell of relative inactivity. The first is an Aim-traded company called Agriterra (AFTA). If you’ve heard of this company at all, it’s most likely to be because its management team includes Phil Edmonds, the former England cricketer-turned mining entrepreneur. Agriterra is a play on the African agricultural sector and the big idea is that the old Africa hands on the board make sure your money is put to good use on the ground. Current business interests include grains processing and beef products in Mozambique and cocoa trading in Sierra Leone.This is frontier stuff, of course, but Agriterra has become a great deal less risky after its recent decision to sell its legacy oil asset (it was known as White Nile in a previous incarnation) to Marathon Oil for $50m (around £30m) plus an additional later payment of $17m. That deal prompted a share price crash from a recent high of around 5.5p to 3.4p – the point at which I bought in.Why did the market react so badly? Possibly because a lot of investors who were attracted to the whole east African oil theme headed for the exits. But the timing of this share price collapse seems rather peculiar to me, mainly because it’s obvious to anyone who’s actually visited Agriterra’s core businesses (especially in Mozambique) that next year – 2013 – will be an important milestone for the company, with a big uptick in output from its various beef operations.If all goes to plan, Agriterra should achieve its ambition to become “a significant pan-African producer and processor”. Obviously a lot can go wrong in the meantime, but this uncertainty does seem to be more than in the share price. By my back-of-an-envelope calculations, the book value of Agriterra’s assets at the end of November 2011 was about $30m and that was before a placing in December raised another $15m of cash.I think the Japan Residential Investment Company fund will be a good sideways bet on Japan. I have no idea whether 2013 will be the year that Japanese shares finally find their feet after a woeful couple of decades. But I make three simple observations.The first is that young Japanese will probably continue to want to live in decent quality accommodation in prime metropolitan areas and JRIC looks to be in a sweet spot if that bit of the market does tick up again. Maybe the Japanese government will even engineer an economic upturn and find a way of sorting out its fiscal mess. And while you’re waiting for either or both those things to materialise, you get something quite unusual by Japanese standards – a decent dividend.Let’s say the company’s trading assets are worth $40m (£25m). We also need to add in the £30m cash payment from Marathon, plus there’s an additional payment of just over £10m due in the next few years for those energy assets. Add that lot together and you get about £65m, compared to a market value of £35m. Some of that cash will of course be invested, hopefully profitably, in building up the business, but the shares nevertheless look too cheap to me.My other recent purchase has been a more modest investment in a little-known fund called the Japan Residential Investment Company (ticker JRIC), at 60.5p.As the name suggests, this London-listed closed-end fund invests in prime flats in major urban areas such as Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, with a firm bias towards young professionals. The fund is fully invested, with 2,200 units renting out at an average £718 per month, and a 95 per cent occupancy rate overall. The loan-to-value ratio is about 45 per cent and major shareholders include well-respected houses such as Ruffer and MAM.JRIC hasn’t had an easy ride over the last few years. More than 20 years after its bubble burst, the Japanese residential property market is still in the doldrums. Capital values ticked up a bit between 2005 and 2008, but after the global financial crisis they fell away again and in recent years rental yields have also weakened (though at a slower rate in 2011).The good news is that rental construction starts have ground to a near 30-year low, which has led some commentators to suggest that the Japanese property may be close to finding its bottom – echoing recent US property market trends.At current prices, JRIC equates to a yield of about 6 per cent. And there’s a bit of wiggle room in the shape of a discount to net asset value of just under 20 per cent. If that gap persists, then it becomes more likely that a continuation vote will put you out of our misery. On the downside, there is a wide bid-offer spread of between 6 and 8 per cent.adventurous@ft.com
47;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2012-10-08T19:50:20Z;Marathon/BP – bargain purchase;Downstream has trounced the upstream guys;No one likes to be upstream without a paddle. But investors are learning to love being downstream. Marathon Petroleum’s purchase on Monday of the Texas City refining complex from BP offers some sharp evidence. The buyer was part of Marathon Oil, until it split its upstream and downstream operations into separate companies in 2011. That experiment worked – the combined market capitalisation of the new companies is more than $40bn, twice what the parent was worth when it split. Downstream has also trounced the upstream guys this year – its shares are up 75 per cent against zero for upstream.That is at least partly explained by the fact that the split has left Marathon Petroleum free to expand in a refining sector that upstream has never much liked. In fact, the refining business is flourishing (relatively) in the US, where margins are more robust than in Europe because of the big domestic market and a concentration on high-value products such as jet fuel.Marathon is paying $1.8bn for the Texas City plant and inventory. That is a big discount to what BP received when it sold its Carson City refining complex in California to Tesoro in August. That involved a smaller plant (266,000 barrels a day of refining capacity compared with 475,000 at Texas City) but it fetched a similar price. That may reflect the tragic recent history of Texas City – an explosion in 2005 that killed 15 people. BP has had this sale on its to-do list for a while.The purchase looks a bargain for Marathon given that BP has spent $1bn turning Texas City into one of the most modern refineries in the US. Marathon already has a plant in Texas City refining 80,000 b/d, so BP’s plant will give it more heft. The company forecasts that it can wring pre-tax earnings synergies of $440m from the plant up to 2017. Given Marathon’s record, that looks eminently achievable.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
48;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2012-10-08T17:47:01Z;BP sells Texas City refinery for $2.5bn;;BP is to sell its Texas City refinery and related assets to Marathon Petroleum Corp for $2.5bn, a price that disappointed analysts but brought the company within striking distance of a $38bn target for asset disposals to cover the costs of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.The deal closes a painful chapter in BP’s history. The plant, in Texas, was the site of an explosion in March 2005 that killed 15 people.The Financial Times reported last month that BP was in talks with Marathon to sell the refinery, the third largest in the US.BP said the sale price of $2.5bn included $600m in cash and $1.2bn for inventories. The deal also contained a so-called “earn-out” provision, under which Marathon could pay an additional $700m over six years, subject to certain conditions.Marathon will also acquire Texas City’s associated natural gas liquids pipelines and four marketing terminals in the US southeast. BP will also assign Marathon contracts for gasoline sales to about 1,200 retail sites in four southern US states.The news sent shares in Marathon to a record high of $60.04 in New York on Monday.Peter Hutton of RBC Capital Markets called the price BP had secured “disappointing”, especially when compared to a deal in August to sell its Carson refinery in California to Tesoro for $2.5bn. On the basis of that transaction, he had expected Texas City to fetch $2.3bn, excluding inventory or pipeline rights.“But at the end of the day, the difference between what they got and the top of the range of our estimates for what it’s worth is just 5p a share,” he added.He said BP had tried to manage investors’ expectations downwards at its second-quarter results, when it wrote down the value of its US refining assets.A person close to BP said the price was “decent” considering the plant’s “troubled history” and the fact that for several years it was not profitable.The deal brings the total value of divestments BP has agreed since the beginning of 2010 to more than $35bn. It is targeting a total of $38bn by the end of 2013.Marathon Petroleum was formed last year when Marathon Oil split its upstream and downstream segments into two separate companies. It is now the fifth-largest refiner in the US, with six plants. It already has one 80,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Texas City.BP acquired Texas City when it merged with Amoco in 1998. The refinery can process 475,000 barrels a day and employees 2,150 BP staff.The 2005 blast at the plant occurred when a unit used to distil gasoline and boost its octane content was overfilled, releasing flammable liquid that then exploded.In 2007, BP pleaded guilty to a felony charge of failing to have adequate maintenance procedures and paid a $50m fine.The company invested more than $1bn in upgrades to Texas City. But the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the US federal overseer of workplace safety, still hit the group with an $87m fine in 2009. Much of it was for its failure to fix safety hazards similar to those that caused the 2005 explosion.In August 2010, BP settled with OSHA, paying it $50.6m and promising to spend $500m on safety improvements.In a statement, Texas City’s manager Keith Casey said the refinery had been transformed in the past few years through a “resolute focus on safe, compliant and reliable operations” and had in recent months returned to profitability. “It does not, however, fit with the long-term strategic direction of BP’s global refining portfolio,” he said.Gary Heminger, Marathon Petroleum’s chief executive, said Texas City “complement[s] our current geographic footprint and align[s] well with our strategic initiative of growing in existing and contiguous markets to enhance our portfolio”.
49;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2012-09-18T21:03:32Z;BP in talks to sell Texas City refinery;;BP has held talks to sell its Texas City refinery to Marathon Petroleum, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest stage of a big asset disposal plan to cover the costs of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.While it is unclear if a deal will be reached, one person familiar with the matter said BP and Marathon had been in talks for months. A sale could raise up to $2.5bn, a second person said.The sell-off would close a contentious chapter in BP’s history. Texas City, the third largest refinery in the US, was the site of an explosion in March 2005 that killed 15 people.A deal would bring BP a lot closer to its target of $38bn in disposals by the end of 2013. The company, which is facing a trial in the US for gross negligence over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, has raised $32bn from asset sales since the disaster.BP has been in talks with other parties on Texas City: as recently as July, Valero, the US refiner, said it had “looked” at the plant. BP and Marathon declined to comment.Refining in the industrialised world has been hit by over­capacity and the economic slowdown, which has weakened demand for petrol, and several big oil groups have sold off downstream assets.BP announced in February last year that it was selling Texas City, which can process 475,000 barrels of oil a day, as well as its Carson refinery in California – in effect halving its US refining capacity. The company sold Carson last month to Tesoro for $2.5bn. In July, BP said it was in “advanced discussions” on Texas City and was on track to announce its sale by the end of the year.Marathon Petroleum was formed last year when Marathon Oil split its upstream and downstream segments into two separate companies. It is now the fifth largest refiner in the US, with six plants. It already has one 80,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Texas City.The blast at BP’s plant occurred when a unit used to distil gasoline and boost its octane content was overfilled, releasing flammable liquid that then exploded.In 2007, BP pleaded guilty to a felony charge of failing to have adequate maintenance procedures. It paid a fine of $50m – the largest assessed against a company to date for violating the US Clean Air Act.BP invested more than $1bn in upgrades to Texas City. But the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the US federal overseer of workplace safety. still hit the group with an $87m fine in 2009. Much of it was for its failure to fix safety hazards similar to those that caused the 2005 explosion.In August 2010, BP settled with OSHA, paying it $50.6m and promising to spend $500m on safety improvements.Marathon Petroleum shares, which fell 2.9 per cent on Tuesday, rose 3.2 per cent to $30.31 in after-hours trading.Additional reporting by David Gelles
50;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2012-09-05T18:19:07Z;Shell to build oil sands CO2 capture plant;;Royal Dutch Shell is to build one of the world’s largest carbon capture and storage facilities in Alberta, Canada, in an effort to cut the greenhouse gas emissions from its business mining the country’s oil sands.But pressure groups said Shell was guilty of “greenwashing”, or environmental spin, to win acceptance for the controversial expansion of its oil sands operations and pointed to the government subsidies Shell was receiving for the project.Shell said on Wednesday it would go ahead with plans for the Quest carbon capture and storage project as part of its Athabasca Oil Sands joint venture with Chevron and Marathon Oil.The group has been mining bitumen deposits in Alberta since 2003. Oil is recovered from the clay and sand by adding warm water, which means oil sands processing is energy-intensive and leads to greater carbon dioxide emissions than conventional oil production.When it opens in 2015 the Quest CCS plant will capture 1m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, or 35 per cent of the emissions from Shell’s Scotford upgrader, which processes the bitumen from the Athabasca operations. The gas will be liquefied and piped 2km underground to be stored in a porous rock formation called the Basal Cambrian Sands.Graham van’t Hoff, chairman of Shell UK, said Quest would “move [Athabasca oil sands] on the way” to being in line with the average carbon emissions from Shell’s operations.“We do have an interest to improve the CO2 performance of oil sands,” said Mr van’t Hoff, who said the Quest project would showcase CCS technology on a commercial scale that could be applied to coal and gas-fired power plants globally.Shell has not disclosed the budget for Quest, but in 2009 the Canadian government estimated the construction costs to be C$1.35bn. Alberta’s government is providing C$745m while the federal government is contributing C$120m. Shell and its partners will cover the rest.As an extra incentive for companies to invest in CCS for its oil sands industry Alberta is doubling the carbon offset credits available, so that for every tonne of carbon dioxide captured, companies will be awarded two tonnes worth of credits. These can then be sold to other companies wanting to offset their carbon emissions.Keith Stewart, climate and energy campaign co-ordinator at Greenpeace Canada, said the extra offset credits “will actually allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase”.“This is C$1.35bn that could have gone into renewable energy,” said Mr Stewart, who added that there remained concerns about whether the carbon dioxide could be stored underground without leaking.Mr van’t Hoff at Shell said the carbon price was currently too low to make CCS commercially viable, “and this is why these early projects need government funding”.
51;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2012-08-13T18:30:40Z;Total faces ultimatum on Kurdistan deal;;Total of France has become the latest oil company to have its interests in Iraq threatened by the country’s federal government unless it agrees to unravel deals struck with the self-governing Kurdistan region.According to local media reports, Total has been told it will be required to sell its minority stake in the Halfaya oilfield unless it agrees to cancel a deal announced at the end of July to acquire stakes in licences controlled by the Kurdistan Regional Government to the north.The deal struck a fortnight ago with US company Marathon Oil entails the French state-backed energy group acquiring a 35 per cent stake in two blocks to the north of the Kurdistan capital of Erbil and becoming operator of one licence.Neither Total nor Iraq’s oil ministry were available to comment on reports that Hussain al-Shahristani, Iraq’s deputy prime minister for energy, had presented Total with an ultimatum to unravel the deal or give up its interests in fields controlled by the federal government.Total holds an 18.75 per cent stake in a consortium led by PetroChina in the Halfaya field, which is situated to the south-east of Baghdad close to the country’s border with Iran. Petronas of Malaysia is also part of the consortium that holds a 20-year licence.Total’s move into Iraq’s Kurdistan region in the face of opposition from Baghdad came days after Iraq’s federal oil ministry banned Chevron, the US’s second-biggest oil company by revenues, from any further involvement in bidding for more licences under its effective control.
52;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2012-07-31T18:55:59Z;Total in Kurdistan deal with Marathon;;Total has become the latest oil major to risk the wrath of Iraq’s federal government by striking a deal to acquire assets in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region of northern Iraq.The deal struck with US company Marathon Oil entails the French state-backed energy group acquiring a 35 per cent stake in two blocks to the north of the Kurdistan capital of Erbil and becoming operator of one licence.The transaction, agreed with the Kurdistan regional government – which retains a 20 per cent interest in both licences – would reduce Marathon’s stakes in the fields from 80 per cent to 45 per cent. The terms of the sale were not disclosed.The move comes a week after Iraq’s federal oil ministry banned Chevron, the US’s second-biggest oil company, from any further involvement in bidding for more licences under its control.The ban follows Chevron’s announcement two weeks ago that it was acquiring 80 per cent stakes and operational control of two blocks in Iraq’s Kurdish region from Reliance of India.Chevron’s move into the region came eight months after ExxonMobil revealed it had become the first of the “supermajor” oil companies to sign contracts with the Kurdistan regional government.Last week Iraq’s oil ministry said that Chevron’s investment in the Kurdistan region of Iraq was “illegal and illegitimate” as it announced its ban.Total’s decision to deal directly with Erbil challenges assumptions that Baghdad can hold the line against the growing list of exploration companies willing to deal direct with Kurdistan despite the threat of exclusion from the rest of the country.There was a poor response by western oil companies to the latest tender of licences to develop blocks in Iraq’s oil-rich southern region. This further convinced some observers that more oil majors may break ranks and deal direct with Erbil.Total on Tuesday said the deal “confirms its commitment to contribute to the development of the oil industry in Iraq” where is was “looking for new opportunities”.Last week Norway’s state-backed Statoil declined to comment on whether it was also considering acquiring assets in Kurdistan.Annell Bay, Marathon’s vice-president of global exploration, said: “We are pleased to have Total join …Marathon Oil in exploring these high-impact exploration opportunities in the Kurdistan region of Iraq’s world-class hydrocarbon province.”Marathon remains operator of the Harir block and exploration operator of the Safen block in which Total is investing.
53;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2012-01-22T19:04:27Z;Monti aims to restore Libya relations;;Silvio Berlusconi courted Libya and Muammer Gaddafi by returning a stolen headless statue of Venus four year ago. Not to be outdone, Mario Monti has followed in his predecessor’s footsteps by returning the marble head of a Roman emperor’s daughter.Relations between Libya and Italy, its most important commercial partner, seem to have been restored by the new Italian prime minister’s weekend visit to Tripoli. Each side is anxious to move on from the close personal ties developed by Italy’s former leader and the former dictator overthrown and killed last October.However, it remained unclear what would happen to the “friendship treaty”, signed by Mr Berlusconi and Mr Gaddafi in 2008, by which Italy pledged to pay $5bn during 25 years in reparations for colonial-era atrocities.“We left it to one side,” Abdel Rahim al-Kib, Libya’s prime minister, said on Saturday after signing a declaration with Mr Monti, who emphasised the importance Italy attaches to north Africa by making Libya his first foreign visit outside Europe since he took office in November.An important bellwether in the relationship is Eni, Italy’s state-controlled oil and gas company which is the largest producer in Libya and Africa as a whole.“We have been in Africa for 60 years – and in dozens of revolutions we never had changes in our oil contracts,” Paolo Scaroni, chief executive of Eni, told the Financial Times on his return from Tripoli.Eni’s combined oil and gas output in Libya is almost back to pre-war levels of 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, after faster-than-expected recoveries by damaged installations, and relations with Libya’s National Oil Company are good. Libyan gas supply to Italy by means of the Greenstream pipeline across the Mediterranean resumed late last year.But Mr Scaroni recognised that Eni’s efforts to remain dominant in Libya were being challenged by a series of competitors gearing up for new licensing rounds that are expected once Libya forms a fresh government at elections in June for a national assembly that has the task of drafting a new constitution.“Everybody is here – the whole list of the world’s oil companies,” Mr Scaroni said, listing “minor” rivals from Russia and China as well as European oil majors who were already present in Libya, as well as late arrivals from the US. France’s Total and Spain’s Repsol YPF are Eni’s closest competitors in terms of current output, while BP of the UK has not yet started the offshore exploration that was interrupted by fallout from its oil-well disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and then Libya’s civil war last year.Eni and the Libyan government are still at work on an agreement that would see Eni spend $380m on social development projects expected to focus on postwar reconstruction. Mr Scaroni expects Tripoli during the next few weeks to finalise its priorities, emphasising that Eni will deliver projects, not cash.The sum of $380m for social and infrastructure projects represents the total of two agreements signed by Eni with Mr Gaddafi’s former regime in 2006 and 2010 that were not implemented, according to Mr Scaroni.Other international oil companies with large operations in Libya are, however, far from reaching their pre-war production levels. Repsol YPF forecast output of about 170,000 barrels a day this quarter from fields that it operates, compared with a pre-war level of 340,000 b/d. Total of France and OMV of Austria are pumping about 60 per cent of their pre-war level.Oil production levels are even lower for US-companies such as ConocoPhillips, Hess and Marathon, which only resumed operations in Libya this month after lengthy repairs to the El Sider oil export terminal.The International Energy Agency, the western countries’ oil watchdog, said Libya pumped 800,000 b/d last month, fewer than the 1m b/d claimed by Libyan authorities, and half the 1.6m b/d level before the war began last February.Additional reporting by Javier Blas in London

ExxonMobil was the latest, and the biggest, to dip a toe in the water.It has been the Kurdistan regional government’s genius to sell itself as the last frontier in oil exploration and as virgin territory receptive to private enterprise, holding out development contracts with terms far more favourable than those Baghdad offers for Iraq’s huge southern fields.Few seem to understand, or care, what Kurdistan’s strategy is, and appear content to be part of the game if it generates huge profits. Yet, that strategy, and its success or failure, will determine how much oil and gas will be exported and how much money stands to be made.The Kurdish government has long seen its attempt to attract international oil companies as a strategic imperative, building up from small wildcatters such as Norway’s DNO via bigger companies such as Houston-based Marathon Oil to supermajors such as ExxonMobil.It has made every effort to diversify the countries of provenance, signing contracts with outfits from the US, UK, France, Germany, China and others to bring international recognition and legitimacy to itself – and perhaps also to secure the region’s protection, should the need arise, or support for an eventual bid for statehood.Underlying this strategy is Kurdish leaders’ drive to maximise the territory they control and the autonomous powers they exercise within it.Hence their expansive interpretation of an Iraqi constitution they were instrumental in drafting, and their unrelenting struggle to incorporate “disputed territories” they claim were part of a historic – albeit undefined and undelineated – Kurdistan.Several factors will probably constrain the Kurdish leadership in its attempt to free the region from the chains binding it to Iraq, a profoundly unhappy relationship of duelling nationalisms.One is precisely those disputed territories. When Kurdish leaders say they hold reserves of 45bn barrels of oil and upward of 100,000bn cubic feet of gas, they neglect to mention that most of these reserves lie outside the Kurdistan region in areas whose status is yet to be determined – through a process that has become increasingly obscure – and whose riches constitute a potential casus belli for both Baghdad and Erbil.When ExxonMobil entered the disputed-territories fray in October, by signing exploration blocks across the Green Line – the Kurdistan region’s constitutional boundary – it further increased the area’s strategic importance.A second constraint is the unresolved relationship with the rest of Iraq.Negotiations have dragged on for years over draft federal hydrocarbon legislation that would define Erbil’s powers, especially in signing contracts, as well as its right to export the region’s oil and gas through the national pipeline network.The two sides have been far apart on an issue that goes to the very heart of their federal arrangement. Baghdad is accusing Erbil of seeking to tear up the country, and has incurred the reciprocal Kurdish charge that Iraq’s rulers are unreconstructed Arab nationalists using outmoded systems of governance.A third constraint is the fact that Kurdistan is landlocked and therefore must depend on its neighbours for access to world markets. The most likely candidate, Turkey, has indicated that, while it is eager to serve as the principal export channel for oil and gas, the Kurdish government will have to co-ordinate its sales through Iraq’s state marketing board. This throws the Kurds back on to Baghdad and its centralising tendencies.A final constraint is the eventual ceiling on Iraqi oil exports. For now, Baghdad is content to have Kurdish exports contribute to national revenues. However, if and when Iraq succeeds in producing the volumes currently bandied about – even at the estimates’ lower end – its neighbours are bound to weigh in and, through Opec or otherwise, seek to limit Iraqi exports in order to keep control over world prices and protect their own status as producers.Once that limit is reached in the next few years, and if Iraq’s southern fields can satisfy demand by themselves, would Baghdad still consider giving a share to those pesky Kurds?Baghdad and Erbil would be well served by a fundamental deal to settle these concerns, but their conflict would not be the first in which ethno-national interests have been allowed to trump sound economic and commercial sense.Joost Hiltermann is the deputy programme director, Middle East and north Africa for the International Crisis Group, a non-government conflict resolution organisation
56;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-12-06T00:01:07Z;Demergers: Split decisions;A stand-out trend in M&A this year has been the number of ­businesses looking to split the overall company, writes Anousha Sakoui;One of the stand-out trends in the M&A market this year has been a surge in the number of businesses looking to split the overall company.By the summer, divestitures had risen to a record share of global mergers and acquisitions activity so far this year, accounting for about half of global dealmaking, according to Dealogic data. In the US, such activity was up more than 40 per cent on the first half of 2010.As companies come under pressure to generate return to shareholders in a flatlining economic environment, particularly if they are sitting on big cash piles, the options for some have been simply to break themselves up.The resources sector has produced prime candidates for demergers. One of the first to highlight the emerging trend was Marathon Oil, the fourth-biggest integrated US oil and gas company, which announced in January plans to split into two by separating its refinery and pipeline operations from its exploration and production business. By doing so it replaced a company valued by the market at $23bn with two companies worth a combined $36bn. Analysts said the company had difficulty standing out, being too small to consider against other large integrated groups. Investors warmly received the move with a share price rise.ConocoPhillips also decided in principle to split in two in July. It announced plans to divide its refining business and exploration and production assets into separate corporations.Jim Mulva, the chief executive who is set to retire when the formal separation takes place next year, said at the time that the rationale was to unlock shareholder value in an intensely competitive industry. In theory, demergers allow each distinct business to focus exclusively on its own priorities and investment ambitions, and should thus create greater returns for shareholders. The move has raised questions about the integrated model of oil companies and suggestions about whether other majors should follow the move.“The ability for many majors to trade around their downstream businesses to create profits are significant,” says KPMG’s Anthony Lobo. “You may continue to see some majors sell unprofitable downstream businesses.”In particular, analysts have focused on BP. JPMorgan has been calling for a split of the group since 2006, some analysts estimating that it could add tens of billions to its value. Other names in the sector have also been suggested as candidates for demerger. Analysts at Evolution Securities, for example, have said a break-up of Eni, the Italian oil group, would make sense.However, some sector specialists are more sceptical that the trend will become widespread. “I don’t think there is a one-size-fits-all answer to this,” says Jon Clark of Ernst & Young. “The integrated model has benefits but not to all and not in every market.We will see strategic positioning and capital allocation continue to be important topics for the majors and are likely to see further downstream divestments.”
57;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-11-22T21:14:20Z;Exxon’s Kurd contracts questioned;;Iraq stepped up the pressure on ExxonMobil over the US company’s surprise decision to sign exploration contracts with the country’s semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan, with the government’s highest energy official declaring they are in breach of the law.Hussain al-Sharistani, Iraq’s deputy prime minister responsible for energy, revealed that Exxon had written to the government about its recent decision. The prime minister’s office and the ministry of oil had written back, spelling out that “contracts will not be recognised unless they are approved by the Iraqi government”.“In this particular case there is a breach of laws and the Iraqi government is considering its actions,” he said at an industry conference in London.Exxon’s decision last month to sign contracts with the Kurdistan Regional Government to explore for oil and gas in six regions has sparked a furious backlash in Baghdad which has always insisted these agreements are illegal.Mr Sharistani said “the position of the US government has been that they were unaware of [the agreement] and if they had been asked, they would have obliged [Exxon] to get approval of the Iraqi government”.People familiar with Exxon’s move told the Financial Times that the company only informed the US government it had signed the contracts after the event.The KRG has signed more than 40 production sharing agreements in recent years, mostly with small independents but more recently also with larger American independents such as Hess and Marathon Oil. Until now, the supermajor oil groups had stopped short of agreeing contracts, fearful of losing ones previously agreed in the south of the country with the federal government.Under a 2009 contract Exxon is leading a consortium developing one of Iraq’s largest oilfields outside Basra in the south, the large West Qurna field. Royal Dutch Shell, which is a partner with Exxon on the West Qurna field and had been negotiating in parallel with the US group to explore in Kurdistan, recently pulled out of the talks amid fears it could jeopardise its investments in the south. Baghdad last week cleared the final hurdle for a $17bn natural gas contract with Shell that had been delayed for several months after it was approved by the council of ministries.With its deal Exxon is wading into a long-running dispute about the validity of the KRG’s contracts which are more lucrative production sharing agreements rather than service ones. A long-awaited hydrocarbon law, which would enable the KRG to increase its exports, has still not been passed. The imminent withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, scheduled by the end of next month, has also increased concerns in some quarters that ethnic concerns could again threaten stability.Mr Sharistani said the government would not open talks with companies that might replace Exxon in the development of the West Qurna field until it had decided on its next move. He said his comments about the legality of the contracts were limited to the oil and gas exploration and production sector only, adding that the federal government encouraged “all companies to invest in all of Iraq” in other industries.Looking ahead at the Opec meeting next month, Mr Sharistani said Iraq did not see the need for a production cut but that there was general concern over the outlook for demand in light of the eurozone crisis.“So far there is no impact on demand for oil. If there is going to be stagnation or decreasing demand, Opec will have to deal with that and adjust its production accordingly,” he said.
58;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-11-18T10:54:50Z;Trip report: The future of oil in Kurdistan;The arrival of Exxon signals a step up for the region. Javier Blas considers its outlook;"I have spent the past few days touring the oil-rich semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq, visiting oilfields and interviewing its officials and foreign executives. It is boom time for Kurdistan, which optimists hope could soon produce more oil than some members of Opec. As I am leaving, Kurdistan is celebrating the arrival of ExxonMobil, the first of the so-called supermajors to enter the territory to explore for oil.But the future will not be a simple trajectory.Exploration success. The oil and gas map of Kurdistan five years ago was largely blank. Today, dozens of oilfields dot it as companies discover hydrocarbons in commercial quantities in eight of every ten wells they drill. But drilling is not as easy as it appeared to be a few years ago, due to the complex geology of the region, and budgets are overrunning by more than a third in some cases.Promises, but a tough reality. The Kurdistan Regional Government expects production to reach 1m barrels a day – more than double the output of Ecuador, the smallest member of the Opec oil cartel – by 2015, up from less than 200,000 b/d at present.Yet future production depends on a political agreement between the KRG and the federal government in Baghdad to approve the long-awaited Iraqi petroleum law, which has been delayed since 2007. While an interim agreement allows for limited exports, which could run at 175,000 b/d next year, companies will be reluctant to invest heavily to lift output towards the 1m b/d target until a political agreement allows the passage of the petroleum law. The KRG and Baghdad say that the legal text will be done by the end of 2012, but cynical oil executives in Erbil note that both sides have repeated the same message for the past five years.The arrival of Big Oil: Five years ago only a few small companies ventured into the region, but the nametags at a recent oil and gas conference in Erbil read like a Who’s Who of the industry. The pioneers, including the Oslo-listed DNO that is privately owned by Genel Enerji of Turkey, and London-listed Gulf Keystone are still there, but new entrants are arriving, including large groups such as Hess and Marathon of the US, Repsol YPF of Spain, and OMV of Austria. Exxon has become the first supermajor to sign a contract to explore the region. Oil executives, diplomats and regional officials say other supermajors could soon join the world’s largest oil company.The impact of the arrival of Exxon is unclear. Optimistic oil executives say it could force Baghdad to accept the KRG’s demands to develop its own industry, but others say that could sour relationships between Kurdistan and the federal government, delaying indefinitely the approval of the petroleum law. The arrival of another supermajor – Chevron of the US, Total of France and Eni of Italy are the names frequently mentioned – could give the KRG the upper hand, however.The time for M&A. Most of the territory open for exploration has already been snapped up, so new entrants have just two routes: a so-called farm-in agreement, whereby a company buys a stake in a field or exploratory area in exchange for financing, or buying existing companies. The KRG, which by necessity backed small companies at the very beginning, would now prefer to see a consolidation in the sector that leaves fewer and bigger players.After the arrival of Exxon, the market is valuing the current players at much higher multiples, so expect multibillion dollar deals. Oil executives in Erbil talk in particular about two deals: Gulf Keystone, which could be bought by a supermajor seeking a quick entry; and a potential merger of DNO and Genel Enerji.Turkey is the new friend. Five years ago, Ankara branded some of the most senior KRG officials as terrorists. Today, Turkish diplomats see Iraqi Kurdistan as a source of energy to power the country’s rapid economic growth. Ankara wants to buy natural gas from Kurdistan for power generation. Moreover, Turkey wants to consolidate Ceyhan as the oil port of the eastern Mediterranean. The port is already the end of the Iraq-Turkey Pipeline and the Baku-Tiblisi-Ceyhan pipeline. Ankara would like to see another oil pipeline – most likely to low-quality Kurdish heavy oil – reaching the port and, potentially, a natural gas pipeline from Kurdistan feeding an LNG plant. Ankara and Erbil even dream that the Iraqi Kurdistan could supply natural gas to the Nabucco pipeline.The Kurdish boom towns. Erbil, the political capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, is entering an oil boom. The city of 1m people, which still lacks a good hospital, has seen the opening of its first luxury hotel – and another three are under construction. Oil executives fly in and out with airlines offering new routes each month. But while money is pouring in, the region has yet to develop services to benefit from it, importing everything from equipment to food. Costs are rising fast too. Housing prices are rocketing and salaries in the oil industry have doubled in the past five years. And with more than 40 companies elbowing for space in Erbil and the region, retaining competent staff is a problem. Local political commentators are already warning that the region – like others in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East – could see the blessing of oil turning into a curse."
59;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-11-10T21:30:46Z;Exxon signs Kurd exploration contracts;;ExxonMobil has become the first of the “supermajor” oil companies to venture into Kurdistan, in a controversial move that will be seen as a huge vote of confidence in the semi-autonomous region of Iraq but could spark a backlash in Baghdad.Exxon, the largest international oil company, signed contracts with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) last month to explore for oil and gas in six blocks in the region, according to an adviser to the KRG.“The KRG has for the last few months been in discussions with a number of major oil companies. This resulted in the recent signing by ExxonMobil of contracts to explore in six blocks,” Michael Howard, an adviser to the KRG, told the Financial Times.Iraq’s central government has been informed of the agreements, said another person familiar with the situation. ExxonMobil declined to comment.Independent oil and gas companies, including US players Marathon Oil and Hess, have flocked to Kurdistan in recent years, attracted by its relatively untapped hydrocarbon wealth – the region is estimated to hold 45bn barrels of oil and between 100,000bn-200,000bn cubic feet of gas. Tony Hayward, the former chief executive of BP, recently emerged at the helm of Genel Energy, a Kurdistan-focused player.Until now, however, the world’s supermajors such as Exxon, BP and Royal Dutch Shell, have held back from signing contracts for fear of antagonising Baghdad, which has said it believes the contracts are illegitimate.ExxonMobil’s surprise decision could prompt calls from some political factions for the company to lose its position in Iraq. The company led the first US consortium to re-enter Iraq’s oil industry in more than 30 years in 2009 by agreeing to develop the giant West Qurna field. ExxonMobil is also building a multibillion-dollar water injection system that will be used by other foreign oil companies in diferent oil projects in southern Iraq. Oil companies inject water in the reservoirs to increase pressure and production rates.However, people aware of the agreements said Exxon’s decision to agree contracts with the KRG could prove to be a catalyst for the region. The decision to invest comes just weeks before an end-of- December deadline for the US to withdraw its troops from Iraq.Expectations have been rising that a long-awaited hydrocarbons law – which would involve the sharing of revenues – could be finalised by year’s end . Iraq’s prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, and the KRG’s prime minister, Barham Salih, met in Baghdad last month and agreed to either amend a 2007 hydrocarbons law as agreed by all political factions or adopt the 2007 law as is, officials said at the time.Exports from Kurdistan, which had been stymied amid the disagreement, have begun to flow, albeit slowly. At the moment, Kurdistan exports an average of 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day through Iraq’s state oil marketing board. Under a landmark deal negotiated with Baghdad in February, Kurdistan currently receives half of all revenue from the oil it exports. The deal allows producing companies such as Genel Energy, China’s Sinopec and Norway’s DNO, to recoup their investment costs.

Resources trapped in rocks and previously not accessible have been unlocked by advances in drilling. This summer, KKR almost trebled its investment in Hilcorp Resources, a shale gas venture, when the company was sold to Marathon Oil for $3.5bn after just one year.Samson, founded in 1971, is active in some of the leading areas for these new resources, including the Bakken formation in North Dakota and the Marcellus in Pennsylvania.

Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
62;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-10-07T15:31:56Z;ConocoPhillips picks post-split chiefs;;ConocoPhillips, the third-biggest US oil company, has chosen leaders for the two energy companies the company will split into next year with the retirement of chief executive Jim Mulva.On Friday, ConocoPhillips said Ryan Lance will become chairman and chief executive officer of ConocoPhillips, the upstream company, focusing on exploration and production. He is now senior vice-president of Exploration and Production, International.Greg Garland will become chairman and chief executive of the downstream company, focused on refining and marketing. Mr Garland is now senior vice-president of Exploration and Production, Americas.Mr Mulva’s decision to split the upstream and downstream portfolios followed a career spent growing the company through acquisitions that turned ConocoPhillips into one of the world’s five largest oil and gas companies.But by early 2009, the US economic downtown and drastic changes in the global oil and gas industry had exposed the flaws in this strategy. ConocoPhillips disclosed a net loss of $31.8bn in the last quarter of 2008 after a $34bn writedown, together with 1,300 job losses.Competition for hydrocarbon reserves had become intense – with maturing fields, the rise of resource nationalism and tougher competition from national oil companies – making it harder for ConocoPhillips to keep up with its much bigger peers.Mr Mulva thought that the divisions could better compete as separate entities. He set a goal of $17bn in disposals by 2012. And then he decided to spilt the two businesses – a decision Marathon Oil had just made.ConocoPhillips’ new appointments will become effective at the completion of split in the second quarter of 2012. Until then, both men will continue in current roles while directing transition plans and appointing their new executive management teams.
63;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-09-30T16:52:52Z;Scouring the data for quality indications;How I go about picking “quality” stocks;What constitutes a quality stock? In last week’s column, I began trying to define the criteria for picking shares in mega-cap companies with strong business franchises. As you’d expect, there are a great many definitions of “quality”, some involving attributes that might equally be ascribed to a “defensive” company, others to companies with valuable “strategic assets”, such as large oil and gas reserves. “Value” investors, meanwhile, might see quality more in terms of companies paying a sustainable dividend yield.As last week’s headline – Quality in the eye of the beholder – surmised, any definition is intensely personal. It is easy to pick a list of companies with a loosely defined “great business franchise”: such a list would probably contain Microsoft, Google, ExxonMobil, BG Group, AstraZeneca and Vodafone. However, I prefer to start with a quantitative screening of the market, and then add a series of personal overlays. These overlays are essentially tests of whether a company can defend its business franchise in an era of low-growth rates and intense price competition.To do this, I use a piece of software called Sharescope, which allows you to sift fundamental data on both UK and US stocks – but you can run a similar exercise using web-based services such as the FT’s stock screener at www.markets.ft.com/screener/customScreen.aspA quick update on Golden Prospect, the precious metals fund I mentioned a few weeks back. As part of its fundraising, it is offering new subscription shares. These are priced at 150p and can be converted into ordinary shares every quarter from May 2012 to May 2014.A few institutions are wary of subscription shares, thinking they could dilute profits for existing investors. But they could be especially appealing to outside investors looking for a medium-term hedge. In effect, you’re buying an option on gold – if spot prices shoot up past $2,500 I’d expect profit margins at the gold miners to soar, producing an uplift in their share prices.These subscription shares will be geared to this increase – so, in effect, you could look on them as a bet on really bad things happening in the global economy. Of course, if gold prices fall back, the subscription shares could expire worthless, but that’s the nature of insurance.My quantitative screen is relatively simple. I’m trying to find a large-cap stock in the UK and the US, with a decent dividend, controllable debts, a substantial profit margin, and lots of cash inflows. So these are the fundamentals measures that I screen for – and note that I deliberately exclude any banks or financial institutions.● Market capitalisation > £2bn● Dividend cover > 1.5● Historical dividend yield > 4 per cent● Net gearing < 150 per cent● Operating margin > 5 per cent (unless it is a utility company)● Cash flow per share: positive (unless it is a utility company)Where more than two companies from the same sector are identified, I will only take the two with the best figures for yields, dividend cover and net gearing.This “screen” will probably throw up a couple of dozen “big-name” candidates, which I will then whittle down to a shorter list by carrying out a qualitative investigation of the business franchise. By this I mean finding out whether a company has a clearly discernible “moat” of competitive advantage, which should deter low-margin competitors. To do this, the simplest approach is to look at past profit margins to check the trend, then search press commentary on the company, and then list the strengths and weaknesses of its main competitors.In this process, I tend to favour companies with substantial strategic assets, such as oil reserves – that’s why I’m currently a bull on the large integrated oil majors. I also believe that utilities have an innate attraction for long-term investors, as their businesses are heavily regulated and built around the notion of returning cash to shareholders through dividends.When I recently carried out this combined quantitative/qualitative screening process, I ended up with the following 14 stocks (although I’d be tempted to have only one North American telecoms utility – either BCE or AT&T – and I’m not entirely convinced about Microchip Technology’s inherent competitive advantage).My shortlist contains lots of companies that I don’t think you’d find surprising.BAE Systems is having a rough time at the moment due to declining orders, but it still possesses some fantastic technology and products. Drug companies are usually popular among fund managers right now, and both AstraZeneca and US group Eli Lilly make it on to my list. Tobacco stocks have long been popular with income fund managers such as Neil Woodford at Invesco Perpetual, and Vodafone offers strong yields and international diversification. All of these companies are in some way protected by that “moat” of competitive advantage. Then, meeting my strategic assets criterion, there are oil majors in the shape of Royal Dutch Shell and American outfit Marathon Oil. Completing the list are a smattering of utility companies including SSE (in which I already hold shares), US outfit Entergy, and Centrica (probably the favourite utility of the institutional investor).My list of “quality stocks” is BAE Systems, Marathon Oil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly & Co, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco Group, Scottish and Southern Energy, Entergy Corp, Centrica, Microchip Technology, AT&T, BCE, Vodafone Group.adventurous@ft.com
64;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-09-29T21:21:02Z;Splits and spinoffs of US groups on the rise;;While M&A activity has waned as the year progressed, another corporate strategy has been gathering steam.Splits, spinoffs and demergers have won favour among big US companies– including Kraft Foods, McGraw-Hill and ConocoPhillips – that are seeking to improve their valuation and refocus their business as the economic outlook dims.Most of the separations announced this year are yet to be priced so they are not reflected in the statistics, but two of the top 10 deals included in the figures for the year to September are companies getting smaller. Cargill distributed its holding in Mosaic, the potash company, to shareholders, while Marathon Oil span off its refinery operations.For M&A bankers, however, the rewards from such transactions may be scant compensation for the downturn in plain-vanilla dealmaking.Much of the fees in spinoffs accrue not to deal advisers but to the financiers who determine the capital structure and likely valuation of each resulting entity. One senior banker estimates that advisory fees on a spinoff can be less than a third of a typical sell-side advisory assignment, with far more variability between transactions.But, argue advisers, any diminution in this year’s fee pool should be balanced against the prospective business generated by such transactions.Splits, such as the three-way division of ITT and Tyco, the industrial companies, create multiple new clients for the banks, with the resulting entities widely expected to take part in consolidation or become targets themselves.“After a spin, these newly independent companies are able to revisit their own growth strategies and value-creation opportunities,” notes one banker. “They are often able to pursue them more aggressively than they could in their previous combined form.”
65;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-09-20T08:36:53Z;GKP raises $200m to fund Kurdistan exploration;;Gulf Keystone Petroleum, the Aim-quoted oil explorer, has raised $200m through a share placement to appraise the amount of oil in its concessions in Kurdistan, northern Iraq.On Tuesday, the company said it had raised the capital by placing 91.1m new shares – representing 10.6 per cent of the company’s enlarged issued share capital – at 140p each, a discount of 18 per cent to last Friday’s close of 170p. GKP said it needed the funds in order “to concentrate fully on the task of proving up the resource base across the Shaikan, Sheikh Adi and Ber Bahr blocks”.GKP estimates its Kurdistan assets could contain 12bn barrels of oil in total.The placing was done by the company’s in-house broker, Mirabaud Securities, and comes less than a week after Todd Kozel, GKP’s chairman and chief executive, said the company remained well funded to continue exploration work across its oilfields.In a statement, Mr Kozel said GKP aimed to move up to the main list in London. “[Our] forward strategy is about successfully proving the full potential of our assets in Kurdistan and becoming one of the top E&P [exploration and production] players in the FTSE 250 index.”The placement also means GKP, which ended the six months to June with net cash of $137m (£87m), will proceed with a preliminary engineering design to potentially build a pipeline capable of carrying 440,000 barrels a day from the company’s Shaikan field to Iraq’s Kirkuk-Ceyhan export pipeline.“[We want to] increase production from the world-class Shaikan discovery to 20,000 b/d in 2012 and potentially up to 40,000 b/d thereafter, and to bring Shaikan crude to the international markets via our own pipeline,” said Mr Kozel.In addition to the latest funds GKP is believed to be looking for about $300m-$350m by selling its 20 per cent stake in the Akri-Bijeel block, which is majority owned by partner MOL Hungarian Oil & Gas, also in Kurdistan.This month GKP said it expected further progress to be made between the semi-autonomous government of the Kurdistan region and Iraq’s central government aimed at agreeing a formula for revenue sharing on exports. A final agreement would remove the political uncertainty facing operators in the area.Rising hopes of a resolution of the dispute over rights to Iraq’s oil wealth have helped continue to attract a number of other operators to the Kurdish region over the past year including Repsol, Hess Corp and Marathon Oil. Vallares, the oil investment vehicle backed by former BP chief executive Tony Hayward and financier Nat Rothschild, is the latest to enter through a planned merger with Turkey’s Genel Energy.Angus McPhail, an oil analyst at Investec, said: “I think it’s positive. Gulf Keystone will have enough cash now to be fully funded to develop its asset in the Shaikan field.“Tony Hayward described the north-west corner of Kurdistan as being ‘the sweet spot’ of the region, and that’s exactly where Gulf Keystone is. I have lowered my target price from 208p to 191p to reflect the dilution.”Shares in GKP dropped 11½p, or 7 per cent, to 151p in early afternoon trading in London.Additional reporting by Mark Wembridge
66;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-09-19T19:16:43Z;Lost in the sands;Effort to revive Libya’s oil industry will have global consequences;"The first thing Jamid Ahmad did on returning to the Zelten oilfield was to check on the well known as C-1. The 27-year-old mechanic last saw it in February, when he and fellow workers fled the National Oil Company-owned desert facility 450km south-west of Benghazi in the early days of uprising against Colonel Muammer Gaddafi.Following several months during which the abandoned field was controlled by troops loyal to the dictator, Mr Ahmad found the well partially covered in sand but otherwise apparently intact. “This is not just about oil,” he says, his relief evident as he checks that the valves remain as firmly closed as he left them. “This is about the history of Libya.”The C-1 well commands a special place in Libya’s oil industry. It was the country’s first well to pump oil in commercial quantities when production started in September 1961, with output of 20,000 barrels a day. Fifty years later, almost to the day, a pressure gauge at the top of the well reads little more than zero. But the apparent lack of damage suggests Zelten should be able to restart production soon.The story is different elsewhere. Nearby fields as well as Libya’s main export terminals on the southern Mediterranean shores – all visited by the Financial Times this month – showed visible signs of damage, likely to take months to fix. Even in Zelten, the accommodation complex lies ransacked and electricity remains off, hampering the return of workers.Mr Ahmad himself, having checked his room and found that the Gaddafi army took the few valuables he left behind, went home again. His return is crucial not just for the north Africa nation, for which oil revenues are the only significant source of income. They are also significant for the global economy, as higher Libyan production would push oil prices down; and for an energy industry always in search of fresh crude reserves.The revolution has delivered a big setback for the country’s oil industry. It will take months, if not years, to recover to pre-war levels. But in the medium term, the end of the Gaddafi regime also provides an opportunity. Libya has for years punched below its potential, hampered by lack of investment as its leader diverted funds for other causes and his personal use; sanctions preventing the return of US companies; and an exodus of engineers to other countries in the region. But executives and officials believe the country, which boasts Africa’s largest reserves, could produce much more oil in the next two decades if the new ruling class pursues the right policies. In 1969, the year Gaddafi gained power, Libya produced nearly as much as Saudi Arabia – 3.1m b/d and 3.3m b/d, respectively – a clear sign of its potential.The Libyan revolution has rewritten the who’s who of its oil industry. For years Shokri Ghanem, the Gaddafi-era prime minister who became head of the National Oil Company, controlled all the sector’s levers. But since his defection in May, and the rebels’ victory in Tripoli in August, new figures have taken charge.The most prominent is Ali Tarhouni, the finance, economy and oil minister in waiting. The former economics professor, returning from a long exile, has little experience in the energy industry and insiders say he is likely to relinquish his nominal control to Abdel Rahman bin Yezza in a reshuffle. Ahmed Omar Shakmak – based in the eastern city of Benghazi, previously the rebels’ stronghold – is deputy oil minister and the senior official receiving most visiting industry executives. Two weeks ago, it was Italy’s Eni; last week, Repsol YPF of Spain.Nuri Berruien, newly-elected chairman of the National Oil Company, is the most senior official in charge of producing, refining and exporting the black stuff. The 65-year-old petroleum engineer was about to retire, just before the start of the revolution six months ago, from a senior position at the Arab Gulf Oil Company (Agoco), an NOC subsidiary, but is now busier than ever trying to restart Libya’s oil industry. He, too, is based in Benghazi, although NOC headquarters were in Tripoli before the revolution.Under Ahmed Majbri, the newly- appointed chairman (previously employed in the company’s finance department), Agoco has already started production at Sarir and Messla. Both of the country’s easternmost oilfields fell under rebel control in the early days of the revolution.As a member of the ruling National Transitional Council’s oversight committees for finance, economy and oil, Mustafa el-Huni is another official crucial to the oil industry. Although there are four others on the committee, he is seen to be in charge of oil affairs. He was vice-chairman of the National Oil Company in the 1980s, and observers say he could play a central role in shaping Libya’s long-term energy policy. He has already spoken in favour of splitting the NOC into two or three companies and devoting more attention to the development of the natural gas industry.Libyan oil is far more important for the global economy and the oil industry than appears at first glance. Before the uprising began, it supplied about 1.6m b/d – a mere two per cent of global output, roughly the same as Italy’s consumption, according to the International Energy Agency, the western countries’ oil watchdog. But the headline figure is deceptive. Libya produces a particularly high-quality crude, sought after by western refiners for its low sulphur content, which helps meet strict new environmental rules for petrol and diesel. Precise figures are hard to come by, but industry executives estimate that the country is one of the leading producers of low-sulphur oil, accounting for roughly 10-15 per cent of global output. Moreover, Libya’s proximity to Europe reduces transport costs.As Libyan production dried up, refiners raced to find high-quality alternatives, driving up prices. Brent, which is a global benchmark, surged to a two-year high of $127.02 a barrel in early April. That, in turn, has contributed to higher inflation, which has pushed monetary authorities, including the European Central Bank, to raise interest rates.The disruption to supply caused by the war forced an extraordinary response from Saudi Arabia, which raised its production to nearly 10m b/d, the highest in 30 years. However, Saudi crude is medium-quality oil so, while the kingdom was able to cover the volume lost, it was unable to bridge the quality gap. As the market for high-quality oil continued to tighten, driving up prices, the IEA ordered the release of members’ strategic reserves – only the third time it has done so.Coupled with a slowdown in global oil demand growth, and the effect of the IEA’s mandated release of strategic stocks, the anticipated return of Libya to the oil market is exerting downward pressure on prices. Brent has fallen to $110 a barrel. But hopes could be getting ahead of the reality on the ground. The country is producing only about 160,000 b/d from its easternmost fields, Sarir and Messla, of which only about 100,000 b/d would be exported – less than one-tenth of prewar levels.However, Nuri Berruien, the new chairman of the National Oil Company, says flows could reach the critical 1m b/d level in about six months. And, he adds, “in 15 months we can reach the prewar level of 1.6m b/d”.The pace of the industry’s reconstruction is crucial to the global oil market and, by extension, the global economy. Some of the leading companies rely heavily on Libya – among them, Eni of Italy, Repsol of Spain, Total of France, OMV of Austria, Wintershall of Germany, and US-based Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Hess and Marathon. Eni and Repsol, the largest investors in the country, have already sent senior executives to Benghazi, the eastern stronghold of the former rebels, to discuss their return.Yet some of their number say security fears threaten a speedy return. “Safety is paramount to the big international companies and it would take time for them to feel the country is OK,” says Anders Nilsson, Benghazi-based head of Condrill, a Swedish drilling company. Today, while there is a consensus that bringing Libya back on tap will be tough, interviews in Benghazi reveal disagreement among the new oil establishment emerging from the rebel ranks, executives and diplomats about how long that process will take.The most immediate challenge is not war damage but looting. When Gaddafi loyalists fled some of the largest oilfields and terminals, they took all they could: cars, trucks, power generators, pumps and other equipment. Local gangs – and rebels in some cases – took whatever remained. Besides requiring considerable new investment, this has created a further problem: logistics. Oil workers need food and sleeping quarters in often remote desert facilities. They have neither.Then there is the damage that is not immediately visible. Officials may be relieved to see light or no surface damage in fields such as Zelten; but they worry about possible, as yet undetected, problems underground. Oil wells need constant maintenance and, after six months of stoppage, facilities hundreds of meters below the sands, could have suffered lasting damage. “Electrical submersible pumps that sit at the bottom of wells deep underground must be lifted to the surface and cleaned regularly, which is especially important in Libyan wells, given the waxier nature of the crude there,” says Ed Morse of Citigroup. In the worst case scenario, companies would have to redrill the wells, says Yousif Al Gheriani, head of the 17th February Committee for oil and gas, which groups workers in eastern Libya.Another problem is the oil reservoirs themselves, above all in the most mature fields of the Sirte basin, near Col Gaddafi’s home town – still the scene of violent conflict – which had been pumping since the 1960s. To force the crude oil out of the reservoirs, engineers maintain pressure by injecting them with water or natural gas. After six months of stoppage, the first task for the arriving crews will not be to start production but to re-establish pressure.But Libya’s output is almost worthless if it cannot be exported to the global market. And officials are discovering that some of their ports have fared worse than the oilfields. Libya has six main terminals, of which at least two – Es Sider and Marsa el Brega – are heavily damaged.All these factors could slow Libya’s return to the international market. Given time, the country has the potential to rebuild the industry and exceed former production levels. But years of US-imposed sanctions, plus Col Gaddafi’s refusal to invest in the NOC, means it pumps less than African nations with a smaller geological endowment. Officials say the NOC’s old target of increasing production to 2m b/d by about 2015 is no longer on the table.Industry executives say Libya is not as big a prize as Iraq. There, oil companies – from New York-listed ExxonMobil to Chinese state-owned enterprises – have fought hard to win contracts to develop the industry and boost production from about 2.8m b/d to as much as 6m b/d by 2020. But they acknowledge that the African country has the potential to as much as double its production in the next two decades. Ross Cassidy of the Wood Mackenzie consultancy says today’s leadership “may take Libya into a new era where its natural resources are used more effectively for the benefit of the broader population”, seeking investments to achieve its full production potential of about 3m b/d. For that, it would need to open up fully to international companies with the financial and technical expertise to recover more from mature oilfields.The big prize could lie, however, in another hydrocarbon: natural gas. Libya has been slow in developing its gas industry, particularly when compared with neighbouring Algeria. In 1971, it became the second country – after Algeria – to export supercooled liquefied natural gas using tankers. But the development of the industry has been slow – again partly because of US sanctions, but also because of Col Gaddafi’s lack of interest. Exports, nonetheless, have grown significantly in the last few years, since the opening of the Greenstream underwater pipeline to Italy. Still, Libya exported just 349bn cubic feet of natural gas in 2010; the figure for Algeria was more than 2,000bn cu ft. “Gas was fully ignored during the Gaddafi’s years,” says Mustafa el-Huni, the National Transitional Council member in charge of energy affairs. That will now change, he says. Again, international expertise will be required to build – and finance – the costly plants to export the product.However, much of the future of Libya’s hydrocarbon industry will depend on people such as Mr Ahmad. Looking out over the desert at Zelten, opening his arms as if to embrace the dozens of oil wells scattered across a vast landscape of rolling dunes, he says: “Look at this. Gaddafi used to own it. This is now ours. We will work hard for it.”"
67;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-09-14T20:52:32Z;Gulf Keystone to fund pipeline via block sale;;Gulf Keystone Petroleum, the oil explorer focused on the Kurdistan region of Iraq, is planning to sell a minority stake in one of its exploration blocks as it pursues feasibility plans to build an export pipeline through Turkey.Todd Kozel, chairman and chief executive of the Aim-traded company, said it remained well funded to continue exploration work across its Shaikan, Sheikh Adi and Ber Bahr fields in northern Iraq. He added that it could expect institutional backing for investment in a pipeline allowing large-scale oil exports to western markets.The company, which ended the six months to June with net cash of $137m (£87m), is examining plans for a pipeline capable of carrying 440,000 barrels a day north from its Shaikan field to the Kirkuk-Ceyhan export pipeline.Mr Kozel declined to put a price on the amount he hoped to raise from its 20 per cent stake in the Akri-Bijeel block, which is majority owned by partner MOL Hungarian Oil & Gas. However, it is believed to be looking for about $300m-$350m.He added that he expected further progress to be made between the semi-autonomous government of the Kurdistan region and Iraq’s central government aimed at agreeing a formula for revenue sharing on exports. A final agreement would remove the political uncertainty facing operators in the area.Rising hopes of a resolution of the dispute over rights to Iraq’s oil wealth have helped continue to attract a number of other operators to the Kurdish region over the past year including Repsol, Hess Corp and Marathon Oil. Vallares, the oil investment vehicle backed by former BP chief executive Tony Hayward and financier Nat Rothschild, is the latest to enter through a planned merger with Turkey’s Genel Energy.A resumption of oil exports from the Kurdistan region of Iraq in February, alongside the agreement of a payment mechanism to foreign oil producers, helped buoy Gulf Keystone’s share price earlier this year. The company said it continued to contest vigorously claims made by Excalibur Ventures, a US-based energy and infrastructure company, which last December filed a court claim against it for nearly a third of its oil assets in Kurdistan.Evolution, the broker, welcomed signs of progress at the company in developing its assets. “Progress has been swift and numbers look very encouraging,” it said. “But the recent rapid rise in the share price suggests much has already been priced in.”The shares, up 37 per cent over the past year, closed down 2¼p at 179¼p, valuing its equity at £1.37bn.
68;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-09-05T16:07:53Z;Colossal task ahead for Libya’s new oil chief;;Six months ago Nuri Berruien was anticipating his retirement from one of the subsidiaries of Libya’s National Oil Company. But the start of the civil-war put paid to his plans.Now the 65-year old petroleum engineer is busier than ever as the newly appointed chairman of the state-owned NOC.“I have a national duty,” he says at the company’s small offices in Benghazi – for months the rebels’ stronghold. Its Tripoli headquarters are not yet considered safe. “The oil industry before the revolution was operated under the worst bureaucratic and corrupted regime.”Mr Berruien’s task is colossal. Before the war, Libya pumped 1.6m barrels a day of high quality crude oil, sought after by European refiners because of its low sulphur content. Now output has fallen to zero.The fall of Muammer Gaddafi’s regime after 42 years could see Libya producing 100,000-300,000 b/d in the next couple of months, from fields in the east – under rebel control since the start of the civil war – and offshore fields in the Mediterranean. But ramping up output to pre-crisis levels will take more than a year under the most optimistic scenario, Mr Berruien acknowledges.The first task for Mr Berruien and his team is to improve security enough to get thousands of workers, scattered across Libya, back to their jobs in remote areas of the country’s oil-rich desert. Even today, after the fall of Tripoli, skirmishes continue in oil areas in the west, and some oilfields are mined.The workers’ return will also be hampered by extensive looting at desert compounds. Vehicles, for example, have been taken away by gangs or used by Col Gaddafi’s army.“We have started to clear the mines. But it will take time,” says Mr Berruien.Lars Nylin, head of Countermine, a company that specialises in landmines removal and is already in Benghazi, says it could take up to 18 months to clear mines and booby traps laid by Col Gaddafi’s forces around the country’s oil infrastructure.However, Mr Berruien says local staff are willing to live for a while in the desert in precarious tent camps until construction companies can rebuild their compounds and supplies – from air conditioners to television sets – arrive.When workers return, they will need to check more than 2,000 oil wells, some deep in the Sahara desert more than 1,000km from the coastline. Even if the wells appear intact, six months of inactivity could have damaged them. “We know that some of the wells will come back [into production] and others will be dead,” Mr Berruien says.He is particularly worried about the wells with submerged pumps, used in the most mature fields such as those of the Sirte basin, which accounts for two-thirds of the country’s production. “We know many pumps will fail,” he says. In those cases, NOC will have to drill new wells, which will mean waiting until spare parts arrive and, most likely, will require the help of foreign contractors yet to return to Libya.“The next step is to build up production, but that will require foreign oil companies’ support,” he says, referring to previous joint ventures between NOC and companies including Eni of Italy, Repsol of Spain, Total of France, OMV of Austria, Wintershall of Germany, and US-based Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Amereda Hess and Marathon.But simply rehabilitating the oilfields would not put Libya back into the global oil market. Pipelines and oil export terminals are another – and bigger – problem. Col Gaddafi’s forces mined a key pipeline hub connecting some of the country’s biggest oilfields with the terminals of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, the most important. And the oil terminals themselves have suffered, particularly their state-of-the-art control rooms. Mr Berruien says he is confident most of the damage can be repaired, however.Overcoming all the obstacles would return Libya to its prewar level of 1.6m b/d in about 15 months or so.But the big prize lies ahead. Mr Berruien firmly believes that the country, which holds Africa’s largest oil reserves, will be able to find new oilfields and boost its production above that level over the next five years.
69;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Full Libyan oil output could be years away;;Libya could return to the global oil market within weeks after the rebels appeared to be on the brink of victory, but the full resumption of output is months, if not years, away.Libya produced about 1.6m barrels a day of oil before the start of the civil war, but the six-month conflict has reduced the flow to just 50,000 b/d, according to industry estimates.Consultants and industry executives believe the fall of the 41-year-old regime of Muammer Gaddafi could see Libya producing 300,000 b/d during the next three months from fields in the east, which have been under rebel control since the start of the civil war, and the remote south-west desert. But ramping up output to pre-crisis levels would take years under the most benign scenario.“I’m sceptical that Libya will return to its pre-war output until 2013 or well beyond,” says Ben Cahill, an expert on Libya at oil consultants PFC Energy in Washington, echoing a widely held industry’s view.Wood Mackenzie, the oil consultancy, agrees, saying in a report issued last week it would take about 36 months for the country’s crude oil output to recover to pre-crisis levels.The experience in previous oil disruptions, from Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution to Venezuela following the opposition-backed oil strike of 2002-03, indicates that production takes a considerable time to return to normal levels. In Iraq, although the oil infrastructure emerged largely intact from the US-led invasion in 2003, output only returned to its pre-war level in 2008 as the end of the hostilities saw political chaos, widespread looting and attacks on the infrastructure.“Even if Tripoli can be secured by rebel forces, as the second Iraq war demonstrated, how effectively the peace can be policed will be vital to a rapid restart in production,” says Lawrence Eagles, head of oil research at JPMorgan and a former senior official at the International Energy Agency.Executives and consultants fear that divisions among the rebels could lead to similar problems in Libya. Even if the country avoids the political and security pitfalls, geology would be an obstacle in the key Sirte basin, which accounts for about two-thirds of Libya’s oil output. The fields there are mature and, as a result, are likely to require extensive repairs to restore production.Moreover, some oil export terminals, including Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, in the centre of the country, and Melitah, in the west, have been damaged. Oil companies say their vehicles have disappeared from compounds, while high prices for base metals such as copper are encouraging looting by local gangs. Thus, the most likely scenario is a progressive ramp up in output.Shokri Ghanem, the former Libyan oil minister who defected three months ago, said the country cannot start pumping right away due to damage and looting, but could produce up to 400,000 b/d in three to four months. “But to go back to the level they used to produce it may take two years,” he told Platts, the industry publication.But with oil prices above $100 a barrel, the financial incentives to resume full production are so great that the new government, and foreign oil companies, will work extremely hard to accelerate output.The east of the country would be the first to start producing again through the Benghazi-based Arab Arabian Gulf Oil Company. Agoco broke links with the Gaddafi-controlled National Oil Company months ago and could, eventually, pump 440,000 b/d from oil fields in the east including Sarir, Libya’s largest.Agoco briefly exported some oil earlier in the war, but was forced to stop after Gaddafi forces attacked the fields. Since then, the rebel national transitional council has been forming a protection force to allow for repairs. Agoco believes the repairs could be completed in two or three weeks, and using a 500km long pipeline that cuts across the desert of eastern Libya it could restart production soon.The outlook for other areas is more uncertain as oil companies have yet to assess damage to their facilities. Foreign executives have offered upbeat forecasts, saying they could restart production before the end of the year. Among the most bullish is Repsol YPF of Spain, the second-largest foreign oil company in Libya by production, and Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF of Germany. Miguel Martínez, chief operating officer at Repsol, told analysts last month the company could be pumping within four weeks of the end of the war from its operated fields that produce 350,000 b/d.Eni of Italy could also restore production from the offshore fields relatively quickly too. The area, known as the Pelagian basin, is 100km north of Tripoli in the Mediterranean.The prospects for the central Sirte basin, which has been controlled by Col Gaddafi, is far more sombre. The Gaddafi-loyal National Oil Company has controlled there two important subsidiaries, its wholly owned Sirte Oil, and Waha Oil, a joint venture with American oil companies ConocoPhillips, Marathon and Hess. Industry consultants say the area has sustained damage, requiring extensive repairs.
70;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-08-03T21:19:02Z;US equities turn positive;;US equities managed to steer clear of an eighth-straight decline, as a late-session rally in technology shares powered the end of the streak.The IT sector led all S&P 500 groups, adding 1.2 per cent. The move was primarily driven by sharp gains by MasterCard and Visa, the payment processing networks.Shares in MasterCard jumped 8.5 per cent to $323.90, after touching a record high of $325. Its arch-rival Visa added 4.7 per cent to $87.48.MasterCard reported earnings of $4.76 a share, well above estimates of $4.23 a share. It said payments on its debit card network surged as consumers used more cash and less credit to make purchases.Tech groups that cater to businesses also saw gains. Juniper Networks, which sells computer networking software, added 3.7 per cent to $23.59. F5 Networks rose 3.5 per cent to $93.35.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index added 0.9 per cent to 2,693.07, leading the big indices.Strong earnings have been greeted with scepticism by many traders because of reduced labour costs. A survey by Challenger & Gray on Wednesday showed a 59.4 per cent jump in lay-offs this July versus last year, while May showed only a 5.3 per cent rise.But that has actually given a lift to technology groups, the best-performing sector in the past month.The broader S&P 500 index added 0.5 per cent to 1,260.34. It rebounded all the way from 1,238, its low on the day, and also a new low for the year. Its closing level is still below its 200-day moving average, but above the 1,250 level that bordered its overall uptrend since March 2009.Technical analysts said it remained to be seen whether these gains were a bear market correction or the resumption of a bull market trend.“We broke the lows of June, we broke lows of March. You don’t get moves like that without the occasional bear market correction,” said Walter Zimmerman, strategist at United-Icap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had the poorest showing, adding just 0.3 per cent to 11,896.44. Selling of large-cap industrial groups suggested “long-term investors were betting on a slowdown”, said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet.The Dow’s steepest decliner was Caterpillar, the manufacturer of heavy equipment. It fell 0.9 per cent to $96.28. Chevron, the global exploration and production group, slipped 0.7 per cent to $102.76.Energy shares were the worst-performing sector, falling 0.6 per cent. Marathon Oil, a refinery group, paced fallers, dropping 5.1 per cent to $27.63.It was downgraded by analysts at Credit Suisse from “outperform” to “neutral”. They pointed to second-quarter earnings of 96 cents that missed forecasts of $1.02, and macro uncertainty. The price of crude oil fell sharply in the US and abroad, with WTI and Brent both seeing drops of 2 per cent on Wednesday.“We believe investors will probably wait for a record of execution … and that looks some way off in these markets,” Credit Suisse said in a note.Positive corporate news provided additional lift. Quanta Services, which provides construction services to power plants, jumped 10 per cent to $18.85 after it raised its full-year revenue forecast to as much as $4.6bn from $4.4bn, citing a strong pipeline of projects likely to be completed as regulatory gridlock ends.Insurance and risk management groups XL Group and Marsh & McLennan also jumped, both citing second-quarter profit boosts that topped analysts’ forecasts. XL shares rose 8.7 per cent to $21.77, while Marsh added 3.4 per cent to $29.45.Media group Time Warnerfell 1.3 per cent to $33.57 after it reported earnings of 60 cents per share. That topped estimates but advertising revenues grew by less than forecast, according to an analyst at Citigroup. “Revenues …were above our estimate,” said Citigroup, “but most of the beat came from films”.Comcast, the cable TV provider, added 0.2 per cent to $22.77. Its earnings similarly topped estimates, at 42 cents a share versus the 40 cents forecast.The maker of Sam Adams beer, Boston Beer, dropped 2.3 per cent to $86.65. It reported a big jump in profit in the second quarter, but lowered its full-year outlook, citing rising input costs. It said it would attempt to pass on price increases to consumers later this year.
71;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-07-18T18:31:26Z;Integrated oil groups;Separating upstream and downstream operations is the way forward;"Break me up before you go-go. Jim Mulva’s parting shot as chairman and chief executive of ConocoPhillips was to proclaim the end of the era of the integrated oil company. Conoco is splitting into its downstream and upstream divisions, in the name of creating shareholder value. Investors have not rushed to join any putative trend: the sector share price reaction has been muted. But the pressure to improve lacklustre shareholder returns could yet change that.The integrated model used to have a huge advantage: it guaranteed access to resources. That is no longer the case. It now has a pressing disadvantage: it has conceded integrated companies’ stock market premium to nimbler pure-play upstream operators. Marathon was the first integrated group to address this: its split has replaced one company valued by the market at $23bn with two companies worth a combined $36bn.It is hard to see a ruthlessly streamlined and integrated behemoth such as ExxonMobil imitating this strategy. Other groups, however, should be learning lessons; European integrated oil groups in particular. UBS estimates that they trade at an average 19 per cent discount to net asset value.Some of these companies are accidents of history. Italy’s Eni controls oil services group Saipem as well as gas and power distribution. That model would not be created today. Meanwhile, BP’s effort to close its post-Macondo 30 per cent discount to NAV is not working: its total return this year is a measly 3 per cent.The integrated model has the status of a creation myth for many oil executives. That sells their investors short. Marathon set the ball rolling by completely separating upstream and downstream. Conoco is big enough to make a big difference. A sector long on cash and short on ideas needs to be bold enough to embrace and follow their lead.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
72;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-07-14T19:57:52Z;ConocoPhillips;Supermajor transforms itself into a big fish in a small pond;If at first you don’t succeed, try something else. ConocoPhillips had reformed its old ways, eschewing growth to focus on balance sheet repair and shareholder returns and delivering the highest cash yield (dividends plus buy-backs) of any big western energy company. Even so, it has had the worst total return of US supermajors, year to date.Except for the results, it was hard to fault Conoco’s strategy, but it has now ditched that for the shareholder-friendly move du jour – splitting itself into upstream and downstream businesses, just as smaller rivals Marathon and Murphy Oil did recently to loud stock market applause. Conoco is the first supermajor to attempt this but the initial reaction, a nearly 8 per cent rally, means it may not be the last.So it is converting itself from a small fish in a big pond – certainly the puniest company worthy of the moniker “supermajor” at just a quarter of the value of ExxonMobil and half of Chevron – to the opposite in its new categories. It will be the second largest independent US refiner after Valero and easily the largest pure play exploration and production outfit.Simply applying the average multiples of enterprise value to revenue of its leading peers in each category, 0.24 and 4.3 times, respectively, suggests a tantalising composite market value of around $200bn for Conoco, an 85 per cent premium to today’s price. That is too optimistic, but it highlights the discount accorded to Big Oil.Whether or not the sum of the parts really is greater than the whole, this is what the market believes and perception is reality. But shareholders in other supermajors should recognise that the “big” in Big Oil is still a virtue, even if integration is not. Even more than in the heyday of the Seven Sisters era, upstream projects are capital-intensive and risky.Those pushing for more supermajor splits should not expect a similar pay-off either, as Conoco was the most integrated of the integrateds, and too cheap to boot. Less is more, but not much more.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
73;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;ConocoPhillips unveils break-up plan;;ConocoPhillips, America’s third largest integrated oil company, will hive off its refining assets to focus exclusively on exploration and production.ConocoPhillips announced on Thursday that it will split into two publicly traded entities, spinning off its refining and marketing business by the first half of next year.ConocoPhillips shares rose 7.5 per cent after the announcement. Shares in Marathon Oil have also surged since it announced a similar plan two weeks ago.This marks the second attempt by Jim Mulva, chief executive, to restructure the company, following an earlier acquisition spree. ConocoPhillips is the smallest of the six oil majors.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mulva argued that the company’s refining operations were a drag on the upstream division, especially in the face of increased competition from state-owned oil giants. “[The split] is a result of more and more competition,” he said. “The opportunities to continue to grow as we have in the last ten years have changed dramatically [for the worse].”“The downstream business is really struggling as an industry and the model is all about taking out costs and finding efficiencies,” said Jim DeNaut, Nomura’s head of investment banking for the Americas. “That is very different from the …growth that is going on in the upstream part of the business.”The restructuring will transform ConocoPhillips into a “super independent”, with what Barclays Capital estimates will be more than twice the proved reserves of Occidental Petroleum and Apache, its new peers.The spun-off refining operations will be slightly smaller than Valero Energy’s, making it the US’s second biggest independent refiner.“The cost of upgrading refineries and the potential environmental liabilities …can become a significant drain on capital that could otherwise go to growing the upstream business,” said Michael Hill, Nomura’s global co-head of natural resources.The formal separation of ConocoPhillips is expected to take place in the first half of next year, after which Mr Mulva will retire.Under the terms of the present plan, no shareholder vote would be needed for the separation to proceed. Instead, it would be subject to regulatory approvals and a final decision from the board.ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, has a global portfolio of exploration and refining assets, including a joint venture in the North Sea’s Britannia oilfield.
74;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-07-05T21:00:41Z;Wall St flat after strong rally;;Shares in Southern Union jumped as the bidding war for the pipeline operator escalated while the wider markets remained relatively flat as investors paused for breath following the strongest rally for two years last week.Shares in Southern Union were up 4.3 per cent to $42.10 after Energy Transfer Equity agreed to take over the Texas-based group in an $8.9bn deal – significantly more than the $7.9bn that it had agreed on last month.The higher offer follows a bid two weeks ago by Williams, another natural gas group, designed to break up the already agreed deal.Shares in Williams were down 0.2 per cent to $30.68 while ETE added 0.6 per cent to $44.93.Elsewhere in the energy sector, Zion Oil & Gas tumbled 17.6 per cent to $4.86 after the oil-and-gas exploration company said on Friday that there was little chance a well in northern Israel contained commercially viable hydrocarbons.But overall, the sector was up 0.5 per cent, one of the few to gain in a generally caution session, helped by a rise in the oil prices. Marathon Oil was up 3.4 per cent to $34.06 while Peabody Energy added 2.2 per cent to $60.69.But this failed to prevent the S&P 500 edging lower, losing 0.1 per cent to 1,337.88 as investors worried about which direction the markets would now turn after the 5.6 per cent jump in the S&P last week – the best week of gains in the index for two years.The index is now just 1.9 per cent away from a three- year high and is well above its 100-day moving average.Financial stocks were some of the worst hit by these nerves, also hurt by news that Portugal’s credit rating had been cut to “junk” and that Citigroup had cut its price target on a number of regional banks.Morgan Stanley was down 2.6 per cent to $23.15 while Comerica, a regional lender, lost 3 per cent to $34.32. The S&P financial index was down 0.8 per cent, paring some of the 5.9 per cent gains seen last week. The KBW banking index fell 1.2 per cent.The industrial sector was the next worst performing in the session, not helped by news that factory orders had risen by less than expected in May.Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters, led the losses, falling 5 per cent to $22.74 while Cummins declined 1.6 per cent to $105.69.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, paring some of the 6.4 per cent gains last week.But most of the remaining sectors on the S&P saw little movement and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,569.34. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent to 2,825.77.This pause follows the best weekly gains in two years on both these indices last week.The upswing came as the indices bounced up off their 200-day moving average and investors cheered a perceived improvement in the Greece situation.The markets were also looking ahead to the earnings season, which starts next week and is expected to be relatively strong.Analysts are expecting a healthy 11.9 per cent rise in earnings from the previous year for S&P 500 companies, according to data complied by Bloomberg. This would mark the seventh straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the index.But despite an assumption that second-quarter earnings would be healthy, there is some concern that guidances for the full year will be lowered due to the “soft patch” in the US economy over the past two months.Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, argued that the S&P 500 will reach a ceiling at 1,350 before running back down to 1,250 again in the coming months, thanks partly to lower guidances.But he goes on to argue that there will be a late rally towards the end of the year, which will see the S&P finish between 1,370 and 1,400. “In the end, the market wants to go up,” he reassured.In other company news Ameron surged 28.3 per cent to $85.05 after National Oilwell Varco said it would buy the fibreglass pipe manufacturer in a deal valued at $772m. National Oilwell Varco was up 2.2 per cent to $80.02.Netflix led the gains on the S&P 500, jumping 8.1 per cent to $289.63 after saying that it was expanding its video streaming service to 43 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.Immucor, the biotechnology company, added 30.2 per cent to $26.99 after agreeing to be bought by private equity group TPG Capital for a fully diluted equity value of $1.97bn.Baidu, the US-listed Chinese search engine, was up 1.8 per cent to $145.87 on news that it will team up with Microsoft to create an English-language search.

The S&P financial index added 1.1 per cent while the KBW banking index climbed 1.4 per cent.The sector was helped by news that banking capital requirements agreed over the weekend were less punitive than some had feared.These gains helped the S&P 500 up 0.9 per cent to 1,280.09, with the index finding support just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses, and traders are using the 200-day average as an excuse to get back in,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound on Wall Street was broad based, with all 10 big S&P indices gaining ground.But technology stocks saw the strongest gains, rebounding from the 1.8 per cent losses in the previous session.The S&P technology index, which had suffered a 10.7 per cent correction since its last cyclical high in February, was up 1.4 per cent.Microsoft was one of the best performing stocks in the sector, rising 3.7 per cent to $25.20 in the biggest one-day move upwards in more than nine months. On Tuesday, the technology group is launching a new cloud version of Microsoft Office.Elsewhere, Amazon was up 4.5 per cent to $201.25 while Adobe Systems added 3.1 per cent to $30.89.The material sector was the worst performing in the session as commodity prices softened. Allegheny Technologies fell 1.5 per cent to $59.11 and the S&P material index was up 0.2 per cent.Sentiment in the session was not helped by weak data on consumer spending, but these technical factors meant the news was largely shrugged off by the markets. Still, data from the commerce department showed that consumer spending had remained largely unchanged in May, which was the first time in nearly a year that spending had not gone up. The figure was also below the 0.1 per cent rise that had been expected by economists.The data are just one in a long line of weak economic numbers released in the past few months which have left the S&P 500 6.1 per cent lower since the start of May.“With the economic indicators weakening and the concerns about the European periphery rising, markets are once again questioning the strength of the economic recovery,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs.Even so, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 12,043.56 in the session, reclaiming its 150-day moving average lost last week.The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3 per cent to 2,688.28, bouncing off its own 200-day moving average level hit on Friday.The Nasdaq and the Dow indices are on their way towards 5.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent losses this month, respectively. The S&P 500 is looking at a 4.8 per cent fall in the worst month on the index since June 2010.In corporate news, ReneSola lost ground after announcing that its chief financial officer was resigning.

76;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-05-18T20:48:33Z;Energy and materials lift Wall Street;;Strong earnings from Dell buoyed related technology stocks and helped lift sentiment on Wall Street, pulling the wider markets into positive territory for the first time in three sessions.Dell was up 5.4 per cent to $16.75, making the stock one of the best performing on the S&P 500, after the company reported a 177 per cent rise in first-quarter profits.The better than expected jump in earnings came thanks to growth in sales to large businesses, which outweighed the weakness in sales to retail customers.Dell raised its earnings and revenue outlook for the year, in contrast to Hewlett-Packard, which lowered its forecast in the previous session as the weakness in consumer markets ate away at earnings.Shares in HP were down 9.7 per cent this week after falling another 1.1 per cent on Wednesday to $36.49.The results from Dell boosted related stocks in the computer hardware sector. NetApp, a provider of data storage, was up 2.5 per cent to $53.61, while Western Digital added 1.4 per cent to $36.82.Apple, the second most valuable company in the world by market capitalisation, gained 1.1 per cent to $339.87.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent to 1,340.68, its best day of trading in nearly a month. The index was helped higher by energy and materials stocks, which benefited from a rise in commodity prices.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, gained 3.8 per cent to $48.62, helping the S&P materials index up 2.1 per cent. Marathon Oil, the energy group, added 3 per cent to $51.53 as the wider S&P energy index put on 2 per cent.The gains helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 0.7 per cent to 12,560.18 and the Nasdaq Composite put on 1.1 per cent to 2,815.The markets saw little reaction to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting in April which yielded no major surprises.The markets have been in a correctional phase since the beginning of the month, with the S&P 500 falling 1.7 per cent in the past few weeks. Sentiment has been weighed down by commodity price swings, European debt woes and worries about the end of QE2.The concerns have led to a classic “risk off” trade, with investors rotating away from cyclical stocks and into more defensive sectors.The S&P healthcare and utility sectors are up 3.2 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively this month while the energy and materials sectors are down 7.4 per cent and 5 per cent.The utility sector saw the day’s worst losses as the broader markets ticked up, prompting commentators to suggest this defensive rotation was coming to an end.“The defensive names have been overbought in the past few weeks and the riskier names have been oversold,” said Quincy Krosby, strategist for Prudential Financial.The retail sector was in focus after mixed results.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen fashion retailer, were up 3.4 per cent to $75.69 after the company reported a bigger than expected swing in first-quarter profits as margins and international sales improved.The stock is up more than 30 per cent so far this year.Target, the discount retailer, reported a 2.7 per cent rise in first-quarter profit thanks to better than expected results in its credit card businessBut the stock was 1.6 per cent lower to $49.96 as investors worried about the softer sales at its stores.Shares in Staples were hit by a strong reaction to the office-supply company’s first-quarter earnings.The stock was down 15.4 per cent to $16.63 after the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results and lowered its full-year earnings forecast by 15 cents a share to $1.35-$1.45.Staples posted a profit of 28 cents a share or $198.2m, short of the 32 cents expected.The S&P retail sector was down 0.3 per cent.Shares in Analog Devices were up 5.9 per cent to $42.60 after the chipmaker reported a 45 per cent jump in second-quarter earnings and lifted its forecasts for the current quarter above expectations. The company raised its dividend.John Deere, the top manufacturer of farm equipment by revenue, reported healthy earnings and raised its full-year outlook due to growing demand for tractors from farmers benefiting from the commodity boom. But investors were hoping for more, and the stock was down 0.5 per cent to $86.50.
77;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-05-10T21:38:49Z;Pertamina and Cnooc at loggerheads;Groups terminate plan after disagreement over terms;Indonesia’s national oil company has run into problems over a possible joint bid for ExxonMobil’s $3.5bn stake in an Angolan oil project after a dispute with Cnooc, the Chinese state-run oil company.The Indonesian and Chinese companies terminated their plans following a dispute over the terms of the renewal of separate oil concessions at West Madura in Indonesia, said people familiar with the matter.Indonesia’s Pertamina originally approached Cnooc to team up to acquire the Exxon stake, either to make a joint bid or to agree that whoever won would bring in the other. “The two matters are …interlinked,” said one regulator familiar with the matter.Pertamina, which lacks the deep-sea exploration expertise needed for the Angolan project, is looking for another partner to help it finance a purchase of the Exxon stake, according to three people familiar with the situation.Exxon has been anxious to sell its stake as part of its more general withdrawal from partnerships with BP. The block in question is in deep water off the coast of Angola. BP controls 26.7 per cent of the block while Angola’s state oil company has 20 per cent. Several other firms including Marathon Oil of the US control smaller sectors.Three people familiar with the matter said the Pertamina board had not approved what was likely to be a hugely expensive bid by the Indonesian group for the whole block in Angola. “It is more than they can chew,” added one of them.A Cnooc spokesman said he was not familiar with the matter. Exxon and BP declined to comment.The dispute between Pertamina and Cnooc surfaced after their joint arrangement came up for renewal a few weeks ago. In mid-April both parties agreed that the terms of the original deal would be extended, giving Cnooc about 25 per cent in the venture.But a few weeks later, these people say that Pertamina declared it would take a far larger stake of 80 per cent and trim Cnooc’s back to 10 per cent. In reply, last week Cnooc told Migas it would withdraw.Foreign investors have long been frustrated by their inability to come to terms with corporate Indonesia, which last year attracted $17bn in direct foreign investment primarily as a result of its abundant natural resources. Kuwait Petroleum, for example, signed a preliminary agreement for an $8bn refinery with Pertamina.However, many international firms have been frustrated in dealing with the Indonesians on energy projects. There have been major disagreements over the formula for recovering the costs of project development and the use of Indonesian vessels to carry precious energy cargoes.Last year, for example, Mitsubishi Corp and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation threatened to withdraw from the Donggi-Senoro LNG project after the government decided that a large part of the output would go to the domestic market.Additional reporting by Toni O’Loughlin and Jamil Anderlini
78;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-05-10T20:49:00Z;US stocks edge higher as global worries ease;;Microsoft lost ground after the software group confirmed that it was buying Skype for $8.5bn while US stocks continued to trend higher following the strong non-farm payrolls report.Shares in the world’s second-largest technology company by market capitalisation were down 0.6 per cent to $25.67 after announcing the deal with Skype.The acquisition is one of the largest by Microsoft and illustrates how the company is attempting to boost its online operations.The last substantial deal was the purchase of Aquantive, an online advertising company, in 2007 for more than $6bn.The move brings the value of worldwide tech-related mergers and acquisitions to $85.5bn, the strongest start to the year for tech M&A since 2000 according to Thomson Reuters.Ebay, the online auction site that still owns 30 per cent of Skype, was up 2.5 per cent to $33.93 in expectation of a windfall.Ebay shares were helped by the fact that the value put on Skype by the acquisition represents a large premium to what Wall Street had been expecting from its planned initial public offering.The news comes as a host of other internet companies like LinkedIn, Facebook, Groupon and Twitter are looking for initial public offerings at potentially lofty valuations.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent to 1,357.16, with solid economic data showing that US wholesalers had stockpiled goods in March as sales rose strongly helping to lift sentiment on Wall Street.But the wider markets were also bouncing back from losses last week after a string of disappointing economic data called into question the strength of the US economic recovery and sent the S&P 500 down 1.7 per cent.This malaise was largely banished on Friday, however, after a bumper official non-farm payroll figure turned sentiment around, leading to three solid days of gains on the S&P 500.“The jobs data on Friday was off the charts and that good news has been working its way into stock prices this week,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 12,760.59 while the Nasdaq Composite added 1 per cent to 2,871.89.The gains on Tuesday were broad based but industrial stocks saw some of the strongest improvements as healthy trade data from China pointed to robust global economic growth.United Parcel Service, one of the world’s largest package delivery companies, was up 0.9 per cent to $74.37 while General Electric added 1.2 per cent to $20.30.The S&P industrial sector was up 0.8 per cent.Energy stocks were the worst performing, weighed by falling oil prices after it was announced late on Monday that margins on US oil contracts would be raised by 25 per cent.The oil price recovered as the session continued but investors remained cautious. Hess Corp declined 0.4 per cent to $79.67 while ExxonMobil lost 0.4 per cent to $70.31.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in Dean Food rose 11.5 per cent to $12.24 after the dairy and meat purveyor beat expectations with its first-quarter results and raised its earnings forecast.The company lifted its forecast to 67-75 cents a share from its earlier view of 55-65 cents.It also estimated second-quarter earnings of 15-20 cents, ahead of the 13 cents expected by analysts.But in absolute terms, the food group’s first-quarter profit fell 41 per cent as margins slid, however.The stock is still down more than 30 per cent since the start of 2010.JA Solar Holdings was up 6.2 per cent to $6.48 after reporting a better than expected quarterly profit, although the solar company also said its second-quarter sales would be slowed by a cut in renewable energy subsidies in Italy.Wendy’s-Arby’s rose 4.2 per cent to $5.02 after the fast food group reported strong same-store sales growth in the US.Investors were impressed in spite of the company reporting a loss of $1.4m in the quarter compared with a profit of $3.4m a year earlier as well as lowering its full-year earnings forecast.Sotheby’s, the auction house, lost 6.1 per cent to $43.71 after reporting slimmer-than-expected first-quarter profit.The auctioneer did report an increase in the number of works sold over $1m but competitive pressures to win the consignments resulted in lower commission margins.

Shares in Hertz were down 1 per cent to $16.68 while Avis gained 0.3 per cent to $18.47.In other deal action, Alkermes said it would merge with a drug technology unit of Elan, the Irish drugmaker, in a cash and stock deal valued at $960m. Shares in Alkermes rose 5 per cent to $15.19.This assorted deal activity helped encourage sentiment across Wall Street, but the biggest gains came from the energy and material sectors as commodity prices rebounded.In the energy sector, Baker Hughes rose 3.4 per cent to $71.65 while Marathon Oil added 5.3 per cent to $52.19. The S&P energy index was up 1.6 per cent, paring some of the 7 per cent losses seen on the index last week.The S&P material sector was up 1.6 per cent, with US Steel adding 2.3 per cent to $46.67 and Newmont Mining rising 1.8 per cent to $54.69.This follows sharp losses for both of these sectors in the middle of last week as commodity prices fell sharply. On Thursday, oil prices fell more than $10 a barrel in the biggest one-day correction since the financial crisis, while other commodities such as silver and copper also lost ground.The gains in the session left the S&P 500 index up 0.5 per cent to 1,346.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 12,684.83 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,843.25.The positive impact on Wall Street was limited by concerns over peripheral eurozone finances after Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s credit rating again. It comes as European officials acknowledged that Greece’s €110bn ($157bn) rescue package a year ago was insufficient and further help would be needed.On Friday the US markets were sent lower after rumours that Greece was in talks to exit the single currency. “Lingering sovereign debt concerns” could cause “additional volatility as the week progresses”, said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The downgrade news worried the financial sector, and the S&P financial index lost 0.2 per cent – the worst performing sector on Wall Street.Bank of America was down 1.1 per cent to $12.18 while Fifth Third Bancorp lost 1.5 per cent to $12.80.Elsewhere in the sector, Citigroup fell 2.3 per cent to $44.16 after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split. The move reduced the number of outstanding shares of Citigroup’s common stock from about 29bn to 2.9bn.Citigroup is the most actively traded stock in the US and the move helped bring about a relatively low-volume session.Elsewhere on Wall Street, homebuilding stocks were weighed down by worrying data showing that in the last few months US house prices suffered their largest drop in over two yearsAccording to figures from Zillow.com, the real estate website, home values fell 3 per cent in the first three months of 2011 from the previous quarter, and 1.1 per cent in March from the previous month. Prices have fallen for 57 consecutive months, according to Zillow.The news, a further sign that the US housing market is a long way from recovery, left shares in Lennar down 1.4 per cent to $18.28. Elsewhere in the homebuilding sector, DR Hortonwas 1 per cent lower at $11.81 while PulteGroupfell 2.1 per cent to $7.79.The S&P homebuilders index was down 1.5 per cent. The sector is 80 per cent lower than its pre-crisis peak.In other news, McDonald’s advanced 0.8 per cent to $79.31 after reporting that its same-store sales had risen 6 per cent in April, the biggest monthly increase since October.Tyson Foods was down 5.9 per cent to $17.77 after the world’s largest meat producer reported flat second-quarter earnings, as higher feed costs offset improving demand and higher meat prices.
80;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-04-27T18:42:34Z;US traders use river transport to profit from oil glut;;"Barges laden with crude are set to make their way to the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico in the latest sign of how price anomalies have reconfigured energy markets.Petro Source Terminals, a storage tank operator, plans to start filling vessels with crude oil at the river port of Catoosa, Oklahoma, to sell to refiners in Louisiana, hundreds of miles downstream.The company is hiring barges because the price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the US oil benchmark, has been weighed down by record 40m-barrel stocks at its delivery point in Cushing, Oklahoma.On Wednesday, the price of Louisiana sweet crude was $127 per barrel, while Nymex June WTI futures were $111.90, having dropped 31 cents.Profit awaits traders who can sell WTI-linked oil in more expensive markets, but moving it out of landlocked Cushing is difficult. This week two companies, Enterprise Products Partners and Energy Transfer Partners, said they would build a pipeline to move 400,000 barrels per day from Cushing to Houston to provide an outlet for the “stranded” barrels. The project would not begin service until late 2012.Petro Source, which is privately owned, sees barges as a short-term alternative. Rex Gilbreath, partner, said the company would gather oil by truck or train and load it on to barges at Catoosa, 60 miles from Cushing. Oil cost $4 per barrel to move to St James, Louisiana, he said.“This is something that is going to work for 14 months, 24 months, six months,” Mr Gilbreath said. “We do things while the market is right. I’m not planning on retiring on
this deal.”Other traders are bypassing Cushing to bring oil to the coast, where crude has traded more in line with soaring global oil prices.Musket, an oil trading and distribution company, is loading crude on to trains in Oklahoma for sale in Louisiana “because of the depressed market in Cushing and the strong market in the Gulf Coast”, said managing director JP Fjeld Hansen.Marathon, a US oil company, is buying Canadian crude from a pipeline alongside the Mississippi and sailing it south to a Louisiana refinery.“We’re taking a steady diet of crude through our proprietary barge system down to our Garyville refinery,” Gary Heminger, executive vice-president, told analysts last month. “Who would have ever thought that we would be moving western Canadian all the way down to Louisiana?”"
81;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-03-31T18:01:46Z;Energy prices risk derailing equity advance;Direction of commodities will set S&P tone;Sitting on your hands may not win plaudits among the bold and the brave, but it has proved a winning formula for US stock market investors this year.A sharp jump in oil prices has propelled energy companies to a second successive quarter of impressive gains, making them the best performing sector in the S&P 500.Since the start of the year, and thanks in large part to the turmoil in the Middle East that has sent crude to its highest level since 2008, energy stocks including Chevron, ExxonMobil and Marathon Oil have been among the market’s biggest gainers in the first three months of the year. The sector has risen 17 per cent, eclipsing other industries to lead the S&P 5.6 per cent higher.The problem for equity investors is that energy’s sustained run, after a rally of 21 per cent in the past three months of 2010, is just the plus side to an oil supply shock – Libya – that threatens to cast a shadow over the market. Higher fuel costs are predicted to erode profit margins for many other companies and sap consumer spending.Indeed, Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, warns that higher energy costs are now “the biggest factor weighing on margin expansion”.One of the most important drivers for equities, therefore, in the second quarter will be whether commodity prices pull back. Stocks exposed to discretionary spending could benefit if the bull run in energy and raw materials runs out of steam.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management says breathing space may be at hand. A slower pace of growth in the world’s emerging markets should translate into a retreat for commodity prices.“Commodities are peaking here and we should get some relief,” he says. If that is accompanied by better jobs numbers – the latest US non-farm payrolls are due today – then stocks have room to rally more broadly, says Mr Paulsen.Other strategists, though, are less confident about the wider market’s prospects. Despite a recent run of robust economic data and solid corporate earnings, the prospect of an end to the Federal Reserve’s second round of “quantitative easing” – its huge bond-buying programme to stimulate recovery – could cap further gains.And, as oil prices have climbed back towards the record high set three years ago of almost $150 a barrel, some economists have begun lowering their growth expectations for the US economy in the first half of the year.“Equities face considerable headwinds in the second quarter,” says Kate Moore, senior global equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “The market may have got ahead of itself. Rising oil prices, higher interest rates and downward revisions to economic data will weigh on the equity market.”The signs of diminishing confidence in the rally, which at its peak took the S&P to more than double its March 2009 nadir, is already evident in non-energy stocks that did well last year.Materials, for example is up just 3.6 per cent this year after a gain of 18.5 per cent in the fourth quarter. While industrials have done well again, they lag their rise of 11.2 per cent in the last three months of 2010. Technology’s 3.5 per cent gain in the first quarter is less than half its 10 per cent rally the previous three months.“Sectors that led the rally since last August are now lagging as investors worry about the ability of companies to increase their earnings,” says Ms Moore.One closely watched barometer will be the Dow Jones Transports Average, seen as a bellwether. This week, it climbed to a 52-week high, boosted by the performance of railways, which are seen as benefiting from more demand as fuel costs hurt truckers.Yet, having risen more than 140 per cent since March 2009, the Dow Jones Transports has slowed to a gain of 3.3 per cent since the end of December.Mr Ablin says: “A loss of momentum among this type of sector will be a prime indicator that the squeeze is ready to force the broad market lower.”Already, the first quarter has seen a marked reversal for airlines, which are highly sensitive to higher energy costs. The Bloomberg airline index has fallen 7 per centThe share prices for the big two delivery companies, FedEx, up 0.8 per cent for the quarter, and UPS, up 2.7 per cent, could also be useful leading indicators.But, for all the uncertainty over the effects of higher oil prices, equities are still seen by many as a better bet than bonds this year. Ms Moore expects oil prices to peak in the second quarter. A retreat in equities would represent a buying opportunity for those who have added heavily to their bond holdings in the past two years. “We still see equities as outperforming bonds in 2011,” she says.US consumers are not feeling particularly buoyant at the moment and that is potentially bad news for companies banking on a sustained recovery. his week, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge for March plunged to a three-month low. Consumers sharply lowered their expectations for future business activity, employment prospects and income growth. Meanwhile rising prices for food and energy pushed expectations for inflation over the next year to the highest level since October of 2008.
82;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-03-21T20:55:01Z;Wall St rises as fears over Japan ease;;The telecommunications sector was shaken by news that AT&T will buy T-Mobile USA, while elsewhere on Wall Street sentiment improved as concerns over Japan’s nuclear crisis eased.AT&T announced on Sunday that it was buying T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom for $39bn in a deal that will create the largest wireless carrier in the US. Shares in AT&T were up 1.2 per cent to $28.26.The news sent Sprint Nextel, the No 3 US carrier, tumbling 13.6 per cent to $4.36. Sprint was itself in talks with Deutsche Telekom to merge with T-Mobile, and this surprise deal with AT&T pulled the rug out from underneath it.The telecoms sector as a whole had a mixed reaction to the news. Verizon Communications, the second-largest US telecoms group by revenues, was up 1.7 per cent to $36.46 but Qwest Communications International fell 3.4 per cent to $6.69. Overall, The S&P telecommunications index was down 0.2 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 closed up 1.5 per cent to 1,298.38, aided by news over the weekend that engineers had managed to cool down some of the reactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5 per cent to 12,036.53, up 3.6 per cent in the last three sessions, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.8 per cent to 2,692.09. The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, was down 15.2 per cent in the session, although it is still up 25.7 since its mid-February lows before the turmoil began in north Africa and the Middle East.The improving situation in Japan lifted some insurance stocks as worries eased somewhat over the extent of their liabilities. Hartford Financial Services Group was up 3.9 per cent to $26.49 while American International Group added 6 per cent to $37.03.The gains for AIG came despite an announcement that its bill for the damage caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami will be at least $700m.The KBW property casualty index was up 1.6 per cent, paring some of the 2 per cent losses last week.Semiconductor stocks also rose as fears over supply constraints resulting from the Japan disaster receded. “Our most recent checks suggest the supply worst-case scenario likely has been averted,” wrote analysts at Citigroup.Applied Materials was up 2.5 per cent to $15.21 while Cirrus Logic added 4.9 per cent to $20.95.Qualcomm, the world’s largest producer of mobile-phone chips, rose 3.7 per cent to $53.63, also helped by news that Sterne Agee & Leach had raised its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “buy”.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index was up 1.8 per cent, bouncing back from the 2 per cent loss seen last week.The industrial sector rallied from its 1.7 per cent loss last week as Japanese tensions eased. General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, added 2.4 per cent to $19.72 while 3M put on 2.2 per cent to $90.95.The previous week saw heavy volatility on fears of a nuclear catastrophe in Japan. In the first three days, the S&P 500 lost 3.2 per cent and the Vix volatility index spiked up 46.4 per cent. The markets then rallied somewhat on Thursday and Friday to close only 1.9 per cent lower over the week.Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial said that markets had been trying to get “back to normal” on Friday but were constrained as traders worried about potential bad news over the weekend.“When nothing major happened in Japan over the weekend, the upward momentum was able to take over and lift equities on Monday,” said Mr Warren.Energy stocks benefited from an oil price jump in the session following the bombing of Libya over the weekend and warnings from Muammer Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, of a “long, drawn-out war”.Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, was up 4.4 per cent to $89.72 while Marathon Oil added 4.4 per cent to $51.84. The wider markets appeared unperturbed by the rise in energy prices.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Tiffany & Co was up 5.1 per cent to $60.22 after reporting fourth-quarter profits up 29 per cent, beating market expectations.The jewellery group, which gets 18 per cent of its revenue from Japan, fell 9.3 per cent last week following the disaster.
83;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
84;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-03-20T22:22:53Z;Oil companies fear nationalisation in Libya;;Western oil companies operating in Libya have privately warned that their operations in the country may be nationalised if Colonel Muammer Gaddafi’s regime prevails.Executives, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the rapidly moving situation, believe their companies could be targeted, especially if their home countries are taking part in air strikes against Mr Gaddafi. Allied forces from France, the UK and the US on Saturday unleashed a series of strikes against military targets in Libya.“It is certainly a concern. There are good reserves there,” said one executive at a western oil company with operations in Libya. “We have lost some of our production [because all operations have stopped] but our bigger concern is what will happen to the exploratory work as that gives you a future rather than the immediate impact,” he added.Most of the world’s large international oil companies have producing assets in Libya, including Spain’s Repsol, France’s Total, and Italy’s Eni, which is the largest single investor there. Germany’s Winstershall – a unit of BASF – and OMV of Austria are also present.The country is the world’s 12th largest oil exporter, and the escalating violence there has triggered a jump in prices to nearly $120 a barrel. More than half of Libya’s oil was exported to Italy, Germany and France last year.“International oil companies will find themselves in a precarious position in Libya going forwards, with both the government side and the opposition now pressuring IOCs [international oil companies],” Samuel Ciszuk, senior Middle East energy analyst at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note. “Libya’s regime has a history of treating IOCs as extensions of their home governments, which ultimately risks damaging European and US-based companies”.Shokri Ghanem, the chairman of the Libya’s state-run National Oil Corporation, warned on Saturday that western companies, which have repatriated their staff due to the crisis, should send their employees back to work or risk seeing new oil and gas concessions awarded directly to rivals from China, India and Brazil. The three countries have all stayed neutral throughout the conflict and abstained from Thursday’s United Nations Security Council resolution 1973.Mr Ghanem said Libya had no intention of breaking its existing commitments with foreign oil companies already operating in the country but warned that “we do hope they in turn will honour their agreements with us”.“If they do not then we are forced to talk to others,” he added. Libyan production has fallen 75 per cent to 400,000 barrels a day since the withdrawal of employees by western companies and “could reach a halt”, he warned.The UN has widened its economic sanctions against the regime of Mr Gaddafi, including for the first time the oil sector. In addition to the no-fly zone and threat of air strikes, UN resolution 1973 also stipulates freezing the assets of the National Oil Corporation.While Libya’s state-owned National Oil Company controls the majority of the country’s oil production, international oil companies are key for sustaining output through joint ventures. The National Oil Company is also in full control of at least two of its subsidiaries, its wholly owned Sirte Oil, a joint venture with US-based Occidental Petroleum, and Waha Oil, a joint venture with American oil companies ConocoPhillips, Marathon and Hess.

The S&P aerospace and defence sector was up 1.6 per cent.The S&P 500 index was up 0.9 per cent at 1,321.82 as the oil price fell on news that key oil producing nations were boosting their production to make up for lost supply out of Libya.The S&P 500 is still down 1.6 per cent since its mid-February highs on fears that elevated oil prices caused by the troubles in North Africa and the Middle East could damage the domestic economic recovery.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 per cent to 12,214.46 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.7 per cent to 2,765.77.Some strategists argued that this rally for US equities would be short-lived as turmoil in the oil markets looked set to continue.“While we might have a day or two of stable or falling oil prices, the situation in North Africa and the Middle East is far from over,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “Oil prices are likely to climb higher, which in turn will put further short term pressure of equities.”Financial and industrial stocks were some of the chief beneficiaries of the upturn in risk appetite in the session.General Electric added 1.2 per cent to $20.62 while 3M put on 1.5 per cent to $93.75. The S&P industrial index was up 1.5 per cent.Financial stocks saw even sharper gains with the S&P sub-index adding 2.2 per cent. PNC Financial Services gained 4.4 per cent to $63.37 while Zions Bancorporation rose 2.9 per cent to $23.14.Bank of America added 4.7 per cent to $14.69, helped by comments from Brian Moynihan, chief executive, at the bank’s first investor day conference since 2007.Mr Moynihan said he believed the bank had the ability to earn between $35bn and $40bn a year in pre-tax earnings when the business normalises, a figure significantly higher than any earnings reported in the past 15 years.The bank lost $1.3bn in 2010 and earned $4.4bn pre-tax in 2008 and 2009. In 2007, it earned $20.9bn, in 2006 $32bn and in 2005 $24.5bn.Mr Moynihan also said that the bank had no intentions of making any more acquisitions and instead would focus on returning “every dollar” in capital to shareholders through regular dividends, share buy-backs and special cash dividends.Only the energy sector lost ground in the session due to the lower oil prices.Marathon Oil was down 2.4 per cent to $50.18 while Conocophillips, another oil company, was down 1.1 per cent to $78.32. The S&P energy sector lost 0.6 per cent, although it is still up 13 per cent over the year.In corporate news, shares in Urban Outfitters lost ground after the retailer reported fourth-quarter sales and profit that fell short of expectations.The company reported earnings per share of 45 cents, falling short of the 52 cents expected on Wall Street. Its shares tumbled 16.7 per cent to $31.66.Analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note: “[Urban Outfitters is] a great long-term growth story but we are still more guarded on the near-term, given uncompelling valuation . . . risks of higher sourcing costs, and potential difficulty navigating through fashion shifts.”Elsewhere in the retail sector, Casey’s General Stores fell 7 per cent to $37.71 after reporting third-quarter earnings of 37 cents a share, falling short of the 49 cents a share expected by Wall Street.McDonald’s reported that same-store sales had risen by 3.9 per cent worldwide in February. This was ahead of expectations but its shares were down 1 per cent to $75.55 after like-for-like sales growth in US fell short of forecasts.

But the wider markets endured another day of losses due to the ever-growing turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.Howard Schultz, Starbucks CEO, said he expected the coffee chain to make “a number of acquisitions” as part of its expansion into the single-cup, home-brewing market.“We are building and investing in resources and people to build a significant consumer products business that over time will rival the size and scale of our retail company,” Mr Schultz told the Wall Street Journal.Morgan Stanley also upgraded the coffee chain to “overweight” from “equal weight” with a $40 price target, saying it was optimistic about the company’s plans to enter the “rapidly growing $3bn global single-serve coffee market”. Shares in Starbucks were up 1.5 per cent to $33.60, one of the biggest gains on the S&P 500.Elsewhere in the sector, McDonald’s was up 0.3 per cent to $76.29. The S&P restaurant and bar index was up 0.4 per cent, one of the few sectors to rise in the session.The S&P 500 closed down 0.8 per cent to 1,310.13, adding to the 0.7 per cent loss in the previous session, as Libya lurched further towards civil war, causing oil and gold prices to spike higher for another day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 per cent to 12,090.03 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4 per cent to 2,745.63 in the sessionThe S&P 500 index is now off 2.5 per cent from its mid-February high on fears that sustained high oil prices will hamper economic growth. “The recent surge in oil prices poses a threat to the US expansion,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley in a report.These fears over the economic recovery hit the materials sector particularly hard. Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest copper miner by market capitalisation, was down 3 per cent to $50.14 while Cliff Natural Resources was down 3.4 per cent to $95.77. The S&P materials index was 1.8 per cent lower, the worst performing sector in the session.Industrial stocks also saw sharp losses for the same reasons. Boeing, the aerospace and defence company, was 1.3 per cent lower to $70.88 while Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, fell 2.9 per cent to $93.82. The S&P industrial index was down 0.8 per cent.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was up 8.1 per cent. The index is now up 31.4 per cent since its mid-February lows before the markets began reacting strongly to the global political tensions.Semiconductor stocks were some of the worse performing after Wells Fargo cut its view of the sector to “market weight” from “overweight” for the first time in more than two yearsThis left the Philadelphia Semiconductor index down 3.1 per cent as Micron Technology fell 5.2 per cent to $11.03 and Nvidia lost 1.4 per cent to $20.47.The technology sector was down 1.2 per cent despite deal activity elsewhere in the sector. Western Digital, the hard drive maker, announced a deal to buy Japanese rival Hitachi’s hard disk drive business for $4.3bn in cash and stock. The news sent shares in Western Digital up 16.2 per cent to $34.87.Accuray, the medical equipment maker, said it would buy TomoTherapy, a radiation treatment company for about $277m, or $4.80 a share in cash and stock. TomoTherapy was up 24.5 per cent to $4.57 while Accuray fell 10.1 per cent to $9.Shares in OCZ Technology Group were up 15.4 per cent to $9.12 after the company announced that it expected to report record fourth-quarter revenue. The company said it expected revenue of approximately $64m, an increase of nearly 100 per cent from the $32.4m reported in last year.Ciena, a maker of network equipment for phone companies, fell 9.8 per cent to $25.98 after reporting first-quarter results and forecasting that second-quarter revenue would come in below estimates.On Sunday, it was two years since the recession lows for the stock market. Since March 6 2009, when the S&P reached an intraday low of 666.79, the market has almost doubled.Since then, financials have added 169 per cent, consumer discretionary stocks are up 148 and industrials have added 143 per cent. One of the biggest gainers has been Netflix, which has gained 452 per cent to $207.40.

The company also lowered its revenue guidance for the current year by $2bn. The stock slumped 10.1 per cent to $43.36.The earnings news weighed on the sector. EMC, the world’s largest data-storage company by revenue, was down 1.2 per cent to $26.27 and the S&P technology index lost 1.6 per cent.That helped drag the S&P 500 down 0.9 per cent to 1,303.46 by mid-session on Wall Street.In the previous session the index lost 2.1 per cent on the geopolitical tensions and escalating violence in Libya, the sharpest one-day fall on the index in six months. The second consecutive day of losses has prompted commentators to ask whether this is the beginning of the widely prophesised pull-back in the US markets.“This situation has some similarities with the eurozone crisis nearly a year ago which led to a temporary correction in the markets,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. “But upwards momentum in the economy looks a lot stronger now than a year ago,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.8 per cent lower at 12,118.45 and the Nasdaq was down 1.7 per cent to 2,710.82. The S&P 500 is still up 2.6 per cent this year. Energy stocks saw some of the few gains in the session as oil prices surpassed $110 a barrel for the first time since before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Industry executives’ estimated that at least half of Libya’s oil production has been shut down due to the violence.Marathon Oil, a leading US oil and gas company, was up 4.2 per cent to $49.69 while Chevron added 3.3 per cent to $103.58. The S&P energy index rose 2.2 per cent to a 2½-year high.Elsewhere in the sector Cabot Oil & Gas was up 12 per cent to $44.59 after the natural gas producer reported strong fourth-quarter results. Range Resources, the oil and gas exploration and production company, rose 8.6 per cent to $52.82.Sentiment in the energy sector was also aided by more deal activity. Enterprise Products Partners, an oil and gas energy partnership, made an offer to acquire Duncan Energy Partners for about $2.41bn.Duncan Energy was up 24.1 per cent to $40.40 on the news while Enterprise Products was down 0.6 per cent to $43.42.This week, Holly and Frontier Oil announced a merger that will create a $7bn oil refining company while BHP Billiton agreed to buy Chesapeake Energy’s shale gas business for $4.7bn.The global energy and power sector has seen the strongest start to the year in terms of mergers and acquisitions activity on record, according Thompson Reuters data.The value of energy and power mergers and acquisitions now totals $93.7bn, a 40 per cent increase over this time last year. Half of this activity has been in the US.Looking at economic data, investors were given some small cause for celebration as data showed that the number of existing home sales rose unexpectedly in January. Home sales were up 2.7 per cent from the previous month, according to the National Association of Realtors, slightly ahead of estimates.But data in the previous session showed that house prices had continued to fall in December, limiting investor optimism about the troubled US housing market.Lowe’s saw losses after the home improvement retailer projected flat comparable store sales and slightly decreasing margins.The company also reported that fourth-quarter profits had jumped thanks to greater demand for house renovation projects, which helped to limit the losses on the stock. The shares were still down 2 per cent to $25.46, however.The results come the day after larger rival Home Depot reported strong quarterly results and raised its profit forecast for the year.Netflix continued to lose ground after news earlier this week that Amazon.com was launching a rival video streaming service. Shares were down 4.8 per cent to $211.02. Amazon slid 3.2 per cent to $174.73.
88;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-02-22T22:34:13Z;BP rejig could embrace a demerger;;Bob Dudley is setting a cracking pace at BP. On Tuesday the company announced plans to sell mature UK assets, including the venerable Wytch Farm oilfield, valued at more than $1bn. The move complements the push into developing markets signalled by Monday’s $7.2bn Indian natural gas deal and a tie-in with Rosneft of Russia announced last month.Lesser men than the American chief executive might find the plate-spinning act too demanding. BP, lest we forget, is still engaged in a $40bn clean-up and compensation operation triggered by the Macondo oil spill. At the same time, it is evacuating staff from Libya, where the reign of comedy uniform wearer Muammer Gaddafi is coming to a full stop.The shares remain depressed by Macondo and doubts over the price for participating in Indian gas exploration. Here, the belief that no one ever extracted a bargain from the Ambanis figures alongside numeric assessments of value.Yet such qualms are accompanied by warm and fuzzy feelings in the City towards the cuddly Mr Dudley. This reflects relief at the closure he has brought to the political row over Macondo and a belief that he is refocusing BP credibly on its old métier of exploration.The impending challenge is lopsidedness: the new BP will increasingly prospect in Brics nations and refine in the developed world. Building a downstream business fed by newly-acquired reserves will be difficult. National oil companies will often nab that role. A radical solution favoured by some shareholders is for BP to emulate Marathon Oil of the US and demerge its refining wing. Then investors could hold shares in the company’s divided selves proportionate to their appetites for growth or yield.But the Mississippian should be in no rush to contemplate such a split. He has done enough, just for now. Further big transactions would suggest that the recently anointed chief executive was going too fast, too soon.Pension fund trustees in the mood for self-flagellation should read a report on investment management fees from consultants LCP. This calculates that charges have risen by one-third over 10 years without stimulating better performance.One reason is that investing the UK’s £1,200bn in occupational pension assets has become more complicated as funds seek to mirror liabilities more closely. But the blame is also borne by investment advisers, before whom investment managers genuflect in return for mandates. Since the early nineties, they have lured wide-eyed trustees into multi-manager arrangements with the promise of better returns. The fact that these require more beauty parades, and thus more advisory fees, is presented as a piffling detail.Scheme investors now also include such modern marvels as “funds of hedge funds”, for which clients pay through the nose and every other available orifice. A £1bn fund could cut annual fees from £3.9m to £1.5m by simplifying investment arrangements, LCP concludes.That would reduce fees to investment advisers. But Lombard’s sympathy for the breed has been low since one intoned that “advisers advise, clients decide” when asked who carried the can for duff performance. In other words, they aspire to power without responsibility, the prerogative of courtesans and journalists.Fans of tiger parenting will be inspired by Rupert Murdoch’s £415m purchase of Shine, his daughter Elisabeth’s TV production company. That will bring her on to the board of News Corp alongside her brother James, and back into contention to lead the whole business.If you have kids yourself, you should pin the news story to the kitchen notice board. Just to motivate them.Suppose, for argument’s sake, that you have a son, Josh. You have put him in charge of washing your car (equivalent to running News Corp EMEA for a Murdoch). He does an adequate job, for a seven-year-old. But is there fire in his belly?His sister (10) made cup cakes, took them to school and sold them at a profit on her own initiative. In fact, you are considering bringing Olivia’s snack production enterprise under the wing of your forthcoming yard sale. The deal simply screams synergies.Josh better shape up. He needs to bring more to the party than a sketchily washed Audi and a puddle on the garage floor. You have yet to decide which of your kids will get the grandfather clock when you are too old to go on winding it – and them – up. Some parallel there with Murdoch senior, perhaps?
89;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Oil groups draw up plans for swift Libya exit;;The oil sector in Libya was descending into chaos on Monday as the revolt against Muammer Gaddafi called into question the industry’s rush to the oil-rich north African country over the past few years.International companies including BP, Royal Dutch Shell and BASF said they were either cutting production or pulling out staff, while analysts said companies could face long-term problems whether the regime survived or fell.Other companies said their operations were normal for the time being, but oil executives privately said they were implementing emergency plans to withdraw all staff and shut down output.The petroleum sector is a crucial political and economic backdrop to the struggle against Colonel Gaddafi’s 41-year rule. It accounts for almost all Libya’s export earnings and is the main emblem of the leader’s partial detente with the west. John Hamilton, co-author of a report last year entitled Libya’s Energy Future, said: “This is the only show in town. Without the oil companies, they really have nothing.”After the arrival of some European companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, oil companies have flocked more recently to Libya’s 1.7m-barrel-a-day industry – making it the world’s 12th-largest oil exporter – since international sanctions against operating there were lifted in 2004. They did so with the blessing of western politicians such as Tony Blair, former British prime minister, who was present as BP signed a $900m exploration agreement with Libya in 2007.The industry in Libya is now a veritable UN of oil, with companies represented including Brazil’s Petrobras, Gazprom of Russia and a clutch of US businesses, such as ConocoPhillips, Amerada Hess and Marathon. European companies, such as Eni of Italy, Repsol YPF of Spain and Total of France, which arrived ahead of the lifting of sanctions in 2004, are leaders in the country.Despite the promise of Libya’s proximity to European export markets, the industry has not been able to repeat the bonanza of oil discoveries of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The last round of exploration had not returned the promised boom in new discoveries, leaving some companies disappointed. Oil companies have also complained about the increasingly erratic behaviour of Libya’s national oil company – a partner in joint ventures with foreign oil groups – and higher taxes. Executives also complain about a rise in bureaucracy.Now those commercial failures have been exacerbated by worries over the protests – and, in particular, a violent response that Human Rights Watch claims has killed more than 200 people.While Libya’s main oil exploration and production areas are either offshore or in parts of the country away from the main protests in the east, these could yet spread or affect supply lines.Were the regime to fall, analysts say the companies could face uncertainty over the security of contracts, because – unlike in neighbouring energy producers Algeria and Tunisia – Libya’s governance is so personalised in the leader that many state institutions are fragile and would struggle to function independently.Even if the regime reasserts its authority, any reprisals would trigger even more international condemnation of it and those who worked with it.As Claire Spencer, head of the Middle East and north Africa programme at Chatham House, the London-based foreign policy institute, put it: “Even if Gaddafi stays in place now, this is not going to be the last we hear of civil unrest. And if he is forced to retreat, who is going to run the place?”Additional reporting by Ed Crook in New York and Sheila McNulty in Houston
90;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-02-15T22:16:15Z;Weak economic data weigh on Wall Street;;NYSE Euronext lost ground after unveiling formal plans to merge with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange, while the wider markets fell away from 30-month highs on disappointing economic data.Shares in NYSE were down 3.4 per cent to $38.12 after it emerged that the German exchange will own 60 per cent of the new company and have the majority of directors on the board. NYSE is still up 14 per cent since merger talks were announced, however.The wider markets were lower following data from the Commerce Department showing that US retail sales had risen by their slowest pace since last June . Sales were up only 0.3 per cent in January against the 0.6 per cent forecast by economists.The S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,328.01, the biggest one-day fall in a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 12,226.64 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,804.35.In the previous session, the S&P 500 index crept to within two points of 1,333.58, which is the point where the index will have doubled since its March 2009 low.The S&P has risen more than 23 per cent in the last six months. Given this strong run, many commentators have been forecasting a short-term fall for the few weeks. “The markets are poised for a sell-off, it just needs a trigger,” said Dick Del Bello, senior partner at Conifer Group.Energy stocks saw the sharpest losses as oil prices softened. ExxonMobil was 2.3 per cent lower at $82.97 while Marathon Oil was down 2 per cent at $48.07. The S&P energy index lost 1.1 per cent. ExxonMobil lost ground in spite of reporting that it had added 3.5bn barrels of oil equivalent to its proved reserves last year.There was also an element of profit-taking in the sector following a run that has seen energy stocks put on 45 per cent since the start of September.Elsewhere in the sector, an Ecuadorian court ordered Chevron to pay up to $8.6bn in damages for environmental damage dating back 40 years but the markets seemed largely unruffled by the news. Chevron was only 0.6 per cent lower at $96.34.The wider markets were also weighed down by news that homebuilder sentiment had remained unchanged at its low levels in February, according to the housing market index from the National Association of Homebuilders.“Unfortunately for builders, there is a massive supply overhang of existing homes, which will present brutal competition to the new home market in the foreseeable future,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.In more positive economic news, data from the Bank of New York’s Empire State Manufacturing Survey showed that manufacturing activity had expanded in February.Also, the Empire State’s business conditions index rose to 15.43, which was ahead of the 11.92 reading last month and the 15 expected by economists.FedEx cut its earnings forecast for the third quarter of 2011 by at least 22 per cent, blaming the move on bad weather and volatile fuel prices that have increased expenses and reduced revenues. But this failed to drag down its shares, as the forecast was largely expected. FedEx rose 2.1 per cent to $95.98.The delivery company now expects adjusted earnings to be between 70-90 cents per share for the three months to the end of February, down from previous forecasts of between 95 cents and $1.15.A series of ratings downgrades hurt individual stocks. JDS Uniphase, a maker of optical communications, fell 10.2 per cent to $25.05 after Sanford C Bernstein & Co cut its rating on the stock to “market perform” from “outperform”.Netflix was down 2.7 per cent to $240.79 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the video rental and streaming company to “equal weight” from “overweight”.Qwest Communications International was down 3 per cent to $7.20 after the company reported a fourth-quarter loss caused by a series of one-time charges.Dell, the PC maker, was up 0.2 per cent to $13.92 in anticipation of its quarterly results. After the closing bell, earnings came in at 53 cents a share ahead of estimates of 37 cent per share.Sirius XM Radio, the satellite radio company, was down 7.9 per cent to $1.69 after reporting a fourth-quarter loss, although the number of subscribers grew. Sirius reported a fourth-quarter loss of $81.4m from a profit of $11.9m in the same period a year earlier.
91;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-02-02T22:03:31Z;Mixed earnings weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street slipped slightly after a mixed batch of earnings reports, but indices stayed close to the 28-month highs reached in the previous session.Whirlpool, the world’s largest appliance maker, reported that its fourth-quarter earnings had missed forecasts, sending shares down 2.1 per cent to $83.60. The company re-ported earnings of $171m or $2.19 a share, falling short of consensus forecasts of $2.26 a share as the high costs of items such as paint and steel ate at margins.Hershey, the confectionery company, also admitted it was struggling with margins given the rising cost of cocoa and sugar, but still managed to deliver fourth-quarter earnings in line with expectations. Shares were up 3.1 per cent to $48.61.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.3 per cent to 1,304.03, keeping above the psychologically significant 1,300 level.The Dow Jones Industrial Average maintained the 12,000 mark, keeping flat at 12,041.97. The Dow closed above 12,000 on Tuesday for the first time since June 2008. The Nasdaq Composite was also flat at 2,750.16.“The markets are taking a little bit of a breather right now as investors try to work out whether there is more to go in this rally. There seems to be equal sentiment on both sides about whether we are due a correction or the bull run will continue,” said Christian Magoon of Magoon Capital, an independent consultancy on exchange traded funds.Investor sentiment was lifted by healthy figures from the ADP employment survey, which estimated that private non-farm payroll employment will have risen by 187,000 in January, ahead of the 140,000 forecast by economists.This prompted some optimism that the non-farm payrolls report to come out on Friday will be strong, but traders were reluctant to become too overjoyed as there is not always a direct correlation between the two figures. ADP also lowered its December figure to 247,000 new jobs from a previous estimate of 297,000.The financial sector saw the worst losses in the session. The S&P financials index was down 0.9 per cent to 223.50 led by Genworth Financial, a mortgage guarantor and life insurer, which fell 8.5 per cent to $12.76 after posting a loss in the fourth-quarter. Michael Frazier, chief executive, said that the results were not acceptable.Elsewhere, Marathon Oil, the fourth-largest US oil and gas group, reported fourth-quarter earnings up 99 per cent due to higher oil prices. While the results beat analysts’ expectations, the markets have come to expect impressive results after bumper earnings from other oil giants such as ExxonMobil, and so the stock fell 1.5 per cent to $46.89. Also in the sector Cameron International, which makes oil-and-gas pressure-control equipment, gained 4.5 per cent to $56.08 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings up 69 per cent.Solar stocks also rose after MEMC Electronic Materials, a silicon maker, gave a strong 2011 sales forecast. The stock jumped 15.4 per cent to $13.42 while First Solar, which makes photovoltaic panels, was up 5.3 per cent to $164.40.Meanwhile, shares in Electronic Arts rose 15.8 per cent to $18.09 after the company unexpectedly announced a $600m share buy-back. EA, the second-largest video game publisher, also reported earnings figures showing a 39 per cent growth in digital revenues in its third quarter, suggesting that its digital strategy was paying off.Elsewhere in the entertainment industry, Time Warner, the media group, reported fourth-quarter profits up 22 per cent and gave a forecast for double-digit earnings growth in 2011. The company, which owns television networks such as HBO, also announced an 11 per cent increase in the company’s dividend and a $5m share repurchasing plan sending the stock up 8.6 per cent to $35.10.NaviSite, a cloud computing company, soared 32.2 per cent to $5.46 on news it was going to be bought by Time Warner Cable for $230m, or $5.50 a share. Time Warner Cable was up 0.9 per cent to $69.33.Mattel, the world’s biggest toymaker, was up 0.9 per cent to $24.37 after reporting improved sales and boosting its dividend.In the pharmaceutical sector, Chelsea Therapeutics International was down 18.5 per cent to $5.04 after the biotechnology company said it was changing the goal for a late-stage study of its hypotension drug after a disappointing interim study.
92;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-01-26T17:23:58Z;Oil majors;Big Oil is drowning in cash. It’s time to do something radical with it;"Another year, another gusher of cash from Big Oil. ConocoPhillips set the tone on Wednesday, reporting a near trebling of earnings for 2010, to $11.4bn, with ExxonMobil, Shell and others still to come. The integrated oil majors sail serenely on, as supertankers tend to do. Yet BP’s calamity in the Gulf of Mexico, a rising regulatory burden, stubbornly high costs, and relatively poor shareholder returns suggest the sector could do with a dose of innovative thinking.Returns for investors in oil and gas companies have been consistent but hardly stellar, given near $100 a barrel oil. Of the largest, only Shell has clawed back to the sector’s May 2008 share price high. ExxonMobil is 16 per cent off that peak, and BP is 24 per cent below. Integrated oil companies trade between 7 and 14 times current earnings; for pure exploration and production and oil services groups the multiples go up to 20.The sector is actually ticking the right boxes in pursuit of returns for shareholders. Cash generation is impressive, dividend yields are comfortably covered and the pace of disposals picked up markedly in 2010. Oil and gas companies sold about $40bn of assets, to independent E&P operators or national oil companies. That trend will continue: ConocoPhillips is selling some of its North American assets and Eni has indicated it wants to sell its stake in Portugal’s Galp. As Credit Suisse notes, such moves achieve current market values on often under-appreciated assets.Yet it all smacks more of portfolio management than of restructuring. If Big Oil wants to boost returns, it should pursue Marathon’s option of separating upstream from downstream. Deutsche Bank estimates that European oil companies, for example, trade at a 30 per cent discount to their sum of-the parts valuations. How about some radical ideas this reporting season to accompany those rivers of cash?E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
93;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-01-24T22:57:56Z;Breaking up is not a sign of failure;Demergers may seem mundane but carry less risk;"Three characteristics unite modern conglomerates: they abhor the conglomerate label; they rarely acknowledge the need to change shape until they decide to do so; and they never admit that external pressure prompted their break-up.ITT used to be one reason conglomerates were shy of the title. During the 1970s, Harold Geneen built a company with 2,000 business units, from Sheraton to Wonder Bread. He preferred to call ITT a “unified-management, multi-product company”. But in his 1984 book Managing, he wrote: “I would like to think that the public has come to appreciate that a conglomerate, per se, is not an offence in nature.”Fat chance. Geneen, for all his skills, added to suspicion about conglomerates. It hardly helped that his ITT was accused of bribery, complicity with the CIA (in undermining Salvador Allende, president of Chile) and lack of accountability. His successor, Rand Araskog broke ITT up in 1995, conceding later that he should have done it 10 years before, when corporate raiders first attacked the multi-product mammoth.Now, ITT is again splitting itself three ways, to investors’ delight. Demergers are in vogue: Marathon Oil, Fortune Brands and Fiat have all spun parts of themselves off, or plan to. British “multi-industry company” Smiths Group is under pressure to sell businesses. General Electric is concentrating on its industrial operations.But although focus is in and sprawl is out, the conglomerate still has its time and its place. In fast-growth countries, that time is now. As Tarun Khanna and Krishna Palepu point out in their 2010 book Winning in Emerging Markets, where institutional voids exist – as in, say, India – conglomerates, often family-controlled, can fill the vacuum. They move capital and people internally instead of relying on scant or non-existent external financial or human resources.In developed markets like the US, United Technologies, Danaher – and even GE – continue to champion diversification.Large private equity funds look like conglomerates, though an unfortunate appetite for leverage has temporarily obscured their main virtue: an ability to manage diverse operations more directly – and with fewer distractions – than listed company shareholders can.So the question is not how soon the model will disappear – it won’t. The question is how to manage a conglomerate and, equally important, how to decide when its time is up.On the public markets, this question lies behind fund managers’ assertions that they could assemble a portfolio of single-sector companies, each well run, instead of owning a conglomerate that trades at a discount to the sum of its parts.Steve Loranger, chief executive of the modern ITT, faced an easier decision than his predecessors: US government budget cuts made it obvious the group’s defence equipment business was holding back the shares. But few emperors time their empire’s break-up well. Most have to feel activist shareholders’ hot breath on their necks before they yield. Even Mr Loranger had faced investor threats to shake up the board.Still, it is human nature for leaders to want to emulate corporate titans, feted for managing vast corporate dominions. Andrew Campbell of the Ashridge Strategic Management Centre likens bosses’ resistance to communist leaders’ stubbornness as the Soviet bloc disintegrated.Ed Breen, who led Tyco into a three-way break-up in 2007 and still runs the industrial arm, told me: “You’ve got to take your ego out of the conversation and ask: what’s best for the business?” Instead, some leaders can turn from masters of management to masters of self-justification, publicly hailing the benefits of breadth and scale right until the moment they convert to the cult of focus and specialisation.It makes more sense to keep the structure under constant scrutiny. Compared with the glory of a big merger, selling once-core operations or splitting the business up seems humdrum. But such deals are no admission of failure. Research shows demergers cost less, carry fewer risks, and eventually create greater value than disruptive takeovers. Conglomerate management is just ordinary company management, writ huge. Expansion, by judicious acquisition or organic growth, is a fine goal. But only executives who show over time they are adding to owners’ wealth, not getting in the way, deserve market laurels. If that means more disposals and demergers and fewer self-destructive bids and self-aggrandising autobiographies, I’ll be the first to applaud.andrew.hill@ft.com"
94;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-01-14T21:42:35Z;US stocks lifted by gains in financials;;Strong results from JPMorgan Chase– the first of the leading US banks to report its fourth-quarter earnings – dragged up the rest of the financial sector as investors hoped that other results would be as equally positive.JPMorgan reported net income of $1.12 a share, a 48 per cent increase on the same quarter last year and in excess of analysts’ forecasts of $1 a share.The news lifted the stock near a nine-month high, gaining 1 per cent to $44.91.The strong results follow on from comments in the week from Jamie Dimon, chief executive, where he said he wanted to raise the company dividend in the second quarter of this year. The stock has added 4.4 per cent over the week.The S&P financials index added 1.7 per cent to 225.42.Morgan Stanley was up 2.4 per cent to $28.98 while Wells Fargorose 2.7 per cent to $32.75.These strong gains helped to lift the wider markets. The S&P 500 index closed up 0.7 per cent to 1,293.24, a fresh two-and-a-half-year high and a rise of 1.7 per cent over the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 11,787.38, up 1 per cent on the week. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,755.30, rising 1.9 per cent over the five days.But gains were pared on Friday after the Chinese government decided to raise the reserve requirements for its banks in a further sign that Beijing was attempting to cool down its economy.This weighed heavily on commodity stocks. Consol Energy, the coal and natural gas producer, fell 4.3 per cent to $51.74 while Massey Energy, another coal producer, was down 3.6 per cent to $55.38.Investors largely shrugged off news that December retail sales had increased by only 0.6 per cent in December, falling short of the forecast 0.8 per cent rise.The S&P retail index closed 0.7 per cent higher to 507.34. Some commentators argued that the results were better than they looked.“This holiday season, the calendar conspired to boost November sales at the expense of December,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR. “Indeed, the three-month annualised rates of change in the various aggregated sales categories shows that Q4 was a strong one for consumer spending,” he said.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, reported record fourth-quarter earnings of 59 cents a share, beating analysts’ forecasts of 53 cents a share.Paul Otellini, Intel president and CEO, said that 2010 had been the best year in Intel’s history.The technology group also gave an upbeat forecast for the year, predicting revenues of about $11.5bn for the first quarter compared with analyst expectations of $10.7bn.Shares in Intel suffered on the news, falling 1 per cent to $21.08, but the stock was still up 2 per cent over the week, suggesting investors had been pricing in the strong results.The week on Wall Street was dominated by M&A, demergers, the start of the earnings results season and concerns over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.Monday morning started with a raft of acquisitions being announced. DuPont, the chemical company, said it was buying Denmark’s Danisco while Duke Energy agreed to buy Progress Energy in a bid that would be likely to create the largest power utility company in the US.These acquisitions were part of the $34bn worth of deals announced globally on Sunday and Monday and $83bn worth of deals this year in the busiest start for mergers and acquisitions activity in a decade.The moves on Wall Street largely failed to excite investors, however.DuPont was up 0.1 per cent on the week to $49.80 while Duke Energy was up 0.7 per cent to $17.92 after initially falling on the acquisition news. Progress Energy was flat at $44.73.There were also a spate of demergers on Wall Street with both ITT, the manufacturing company, and Marathon Oil spinning off aspects of their operations.ITT was up 12.8 to $59.30 over the week while Marathon Oil rose 10.3 per cent to $42.59.The week also saw a strong start to the earnings results season. Alcoa kicked off the season with fourth-quarter forecast-beating results but it still fell 2.8 per cent to $15.97 over the week. This was added to by good results from JPMorgan and Intel on Friday.The sovereign debt crisis in Europe also moved markets, initially weighing on sentiment on Monday.But successful debt auctions on Tuesday and Wednesday by Portugal and Spain, respectively, allayed some of the market’s concerns, helping the S&P post gains for the week.
95;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-01-13T21:55:05Z;Jobless claims weigh on US equities;;"Marathon Oil, the fourth- largest US oil and gas company, jumped to two-year highs after announcing a demerger, but this failed to lift the wider markets which fell because of an unexpected rise in new jobless claims.Marathon Oil saw the strongest gains on the S&P index, rising 6 per cent
to $42.98 after announcing plans to spin off its refining and sales operations into separate companies.The new company, Marathon Petroleum, will focus on refining, marketing and pipeline transportation while Marathon Oil will focus on exploration and production.Marathon Oil considered a demerger in July 2008, at the peak of the crude oil market, but did not go through with the move following a crash in oil prices during the financial crisis.Crude oil prices have recently rebounded to near $100 a barrel.This move continues the recent trend of demergers on Wall Street.In the previous session, manufacturing company ITT announced it was splitting into three separate groups, sending the shares up 16.5 per cent. ITT was off 3.3 per cent to $59.45.The jump in Marathon’s shares failed to lift the sector, however. The S&P oil and gas index fell 0.3 per cent to 580.65.The wider US markets also lost ground after news that the number of first-time unemployment claims had jumped to their highest levels since October.Figures from the US Department of Labor showed that initial jobless claims had risen by 35,000 to 445,000 in the first week of the new year, above consensus estimates of 410,000.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,283.76, pulling away from the two-and-a-half year high reached in the previous session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 11,731.90, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.1 per cent to 2,735.29.Losses were pared somewhat, however, by news that continuing claims for jobless benefits had fallen by more than had been expected. The number of people receiving long-term unemployment benefits had fallen by 248,000 to 3.88m, its lowest point since 2008.Sentiment was also helped by news of a successful auction of Spanish debt, which helped to calm investors’ fears over eurozone debt.The most significant loser on the S&P was Merck,
the German pharmaceutical group, after it discontinued one of its clinical studies for an anticlotting drug and trimmed another study of about a quarter of the patients. It lost 6.6 per cent to $34.69 on the news.These sharp losses weighed on the S&P healthcare index, which fell
0.5 per cent to 371.88.American Assets Trust, a real-estate investment trust which buys and develops retail and office properties, made strong gains after launching an initial public offering.Shares in the company traded up by 3.7 per cent to $21.25, surpassing estimates of between $19 and $21 per share.The IPO was the first of the year in the US and the biggest for a real-estate investment trust since Starwood Property Trust raised $932m in August 2009.“American Assets Trust’s IPO provides a sound launch for the Reit IPO market,” said Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers.AmericanCapital Agency, another real-estate investment trust, fell 1.3 per cent to $28.64 after saying that it planned to sell at least 18m shares in a public stock sale, the second such offering since December.A raft of news emerged in the technology sector,
moving individual stocks.Apple, one of the largest companies in the US, rose to an all-time high after UBS raised its price target on the stock to $415 from $365. The company was up 0.4 per cent to $345.68.TTM Technologies, the printed circuit board maker, rose to a four-and-a-half-year high, increasing
21.3 per cent to $17.74 after raising its fourth-quarter earnings outlook.Technology traders were waiting for fourth-quarter results from Intel, which were due to be released after the markets closed.According to a survey
of analysts by FactSet Research, the company was expected to report earnings of 53 cents a share. Intel lost 0.6 per cent to $21.29 in anticipation of the results.All this left technology stocks slightly up in the session, with the S&P
technology index rising 0.1 per cent to 459.68.Gains on the index were pared, however, by losses for Microsoft, which fell
1.3 per cent to $28.19."
96;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2011-01-13T18:38:59Z;Marathon splits off refineries from exploration;;"Marathon Oil, the fourth-biggest integrated US oil and gas company, is to split into two by separating its refinery and pipeline operations from its exploration and production business.The move, which sent Marathon’s share price up $3.31, more than 8 per cent, to $43.84, joins a flurry of demergers of US groups including one announced by industrial conglomerate ITT this week. Marathon Petroleum – a newly-created company – will be the fifth-biggest refiner in the US; while Marathon Oil will focus solely on global exploration and production, with growth leveraged to crude oil production.David Pursell, head of Macro Research at Tudor Pickering Holt, the energy investment and merchant banking firm, said that as an integrated group, Marathon has had difficulty standing out.It is too small for investors to consider it a rival to other integrated groups, such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell. The split will allow each company to act in the best interest of its business segment, better attract talent and allow for more specific comparisons against competitors.Marathon’s exploration and production business can now be compared against companies such as EnCana and EOG Resources. Its refining business can be measured against pure refiners, such as Valero.“The market clearly likes the announcement,’’ Mr Pursell said.“This is a vote of confidence for other companies with similar assets to follow.’’Investors have supported other splits, including that by EnCana in 2009 and Questar in 2010. There has been talk of BP and ConocoPhillips demerging but analysts say the effort is more difficult and offers less value for companies of their scale.Marathon’s decision to split follows a long period of consideration that ended two years ago with a decision to remain integrated amid the financial crisis. “The substantial improvement in the global business and financial environments over the past two years has created the conditions under which we believe it is now appropriate to move forward with the formation of two strong independent energy companies,’’ said Clarence Cazalot Jr, Marathon president and chief executive.Marathon’s market value at Wednesday’s closing price was about $28.8bn. The company plans to distribute one share of Marathon Petroleum for every two shares of Marathon Oil. Marathon Oil will pay an initial divided of 15 cents per quarter, based on about 710m shares outstanding, and Marathon Petroleum will pay 20 cents per quarter, based on about 355m shares outstanding.The spin-off is expected to be tax-free and effective from June 30.Moody’s Investors Service placed Marathon’s Baa1 senior unsecured bond rating under review for possible downgrade, noting that the split would reduce scale and eliminate benefits of integration. Morgan Stanley is acting as financial adviser, Baker Botts as legal adviser and Bingham McCutchen as tax adviser."

The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher ending the day at 2,370.75, losing 0.4 per cent over the week.Before the opening bell, investors were cheered when manufacturing in China rose more than expected in September.But the sentiment was short-lived. Figures showed that US manufacturing had expanded at the lowest pace for 10 months. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index fell to 54.4 from 56.3 in August in line with expectations but the details disappointed.Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said: “The spread between new orders and inventories has finally moved into negative territory (which means the inventory index is higher than orders), suggesting that production should slow somewhat over the next few months as an increasing portion of new orders can be met by drawing down existing inventories.”In a busy day for economic data, other releases were mixed.Among the positive numbers, US consumers were shown to have been spending slightly more than forecast, car sales rose and construction spending had unexpectedly risen. The final reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment was also a little better than expected.But prices barely rose in August, showing that inflation remains subdued,Materials and energy benefited from hopes of rising Chinese demand for metals and oil.The energy sector led the risers, up 1.3 per cent, with Hess Corp adding 3 per cent to $60.92 and Marathon Oil Corp gaining 2.2 per cent to $33.81.The materials sector advanced 1.2 per cent, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold adding 4.4 per cent to $89.13 and iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources rising 4.2 per cent to $66.58.But the effect of the Chinese data on industrials was muted by a couple of ratings downgrades so the S&P 500 industrials index was up only 0.1 per cent.Caterpillar fell 0.6 per cent to $78.22 after its rating was cut from “buy” to “neutral” by analysts at Bank of America. They view the shares, which have risen 15.4 per cent in the past month, as having the strong earnings expected in the next year priced in.Deere & Co also suffered after analysts at JPMorgan Chase reduced it from “overweight” to “neutral”, saying higher pension and research and development costs could weigh on earnings. Wells Fargo also cut its rating on the farm equipment maker. The shares fell 1.7 per cent to $68.57.Elsewhere, HP declined 3.1 per cent to $40.77 after the company named its new chief executive. After the closing bell on Thursday, the technology company announced it was appointing Leo Apotheker, the former chief executive of software maker SAP, to the top job.The choice surprised analysts because Mr Apotheker spent only a year as SAP’s sole chief executive and they had not expected an appointment from outside the US.Also in technology, Google edged lower by a fraction to $525.62 after David Drummond, its chief legal officer, said the search engine operator was increasing staff and trying to win new advertisers in China, in spite of its clash with the authorities over censorship.
98;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2010-08-24T21:24:07Z;Oil groups have little to show from Libya;;BP has a lot riding on its controversial exploration programme off the coast of Libya.The UK oil group, whose reputation is under fire over its Gulf of Mexico oil spill, is preparing to drill a first deep-water well in the Gulf of Sirte in the autumn in what will be one of its biggest-ever exploration commitments, in an offshore area that is the size of Belgium.The company is not alone in targeting the North African country. Most of the world’s oil majors have quietly been tapping into its promise in recent years.ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips are all present. The biggest single oil producer is the Waha Oil Company, a joint venture between National Oil Corporation and Conoco-Phillips, Hess and Marathon, according to African Energy, an industry publication.Recent exploration efforts have, however, proved disappointing and have dented the optimism that accompanied the return of international oil companies to Libya after the final lifting of sanctions in 2004.“We are coming up to the end of a five-year period where there has not been a lot of notable exploration success to point to,” said Ross Cassidy, Libya analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the oil consultancy. “Results have been poor when you compare with what was expected and hoped for.”Big oil companies piled into Libya, competing for blocks in four licensing rounds held between 2005 and 2007, lured by the promise of an under-explored country that has the largest proven oil reserves in Africa. So far they have little to show for their huge investments in recent years. Offshore, only Hess reported finding hydrocarbons that can be developed commercially, in its Arous el Bahr well.ExxonMobil has drilled two offshore exploration wells near Libya but with little luck. It has no production in the country and the two wells found no hydrocarbons.“Both wells have provided important technical data about the basins, and we will use the information to plan our remaining evaluation program with the Libyan National Oil Corporation,” ExxonMobil said.Rival Chevron drilled one exploration well in Libya in 2009 on a block acquired during the country’s first exploration licence round in 2005. It, too, did not encounter any hydrocarbons. It relinquished its Block 177 exploration licence in 2009. Chevron said it maintains a representative office in Tripoli and continues to monitor investment opportunities in North Africa, including in Libya.Royal Dutch Shell is assisting in the rejuvenation of a 39-year-old liquefied natural gas plant and exploring for gas onshore. The company is also still working through its drilling commitments in the exploration phase and has so far drilled two wells in the Sirte basin, and has two further wells under way. However, it has so far not announced any discoveries.Eni, the Italian group and the largest foreign operator in North Africa, is not involved in any offshore drilling activity in Libyan waters, but has two offshore fields that have been in production without incident since the 1970s, in waters of less than 200 metres. The company has invested some $50bn in Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt in the past 10 years. The area is 35 per cent of Eni’s total production.Companies that still have deep-water drilling plans include Russia’s Gazprom, Petrobras of Brazil and Pertamina of Indonesia.BP plans to drill at least five offshore wells. The company’s operations are under intense scrutiny after the US spill, not least because its first Libyan well is 200 metres deeper than the Macondo well, which ruptured on April 20, killing 11 workers. At the same time, US senators are continuing to investigate links between the company’s lobbying of the UK government for a prisoner-transfer agreement with Libya and the Scottish government’s 2009 release of Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, the Libyan man convicted of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988. Nevertheless, industry analysts believe the programmes of BP and Shell are very significant for those companies and for Libya.“This is a fantastically important exploration for Libya,” said John Hamilton, the author of a study on Libya’s energy future for African Energy. “If it works out it will open a whole new future for Libya as a hydrocarbons producer on Europe’s doorstep.”Mr Cassidy added: “It is too early to say that exploration potential in Libya has been downgraded.“Most still believe there is huge potential. The next phase of drilling may live up to expectations.”Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty in Houston and Giulia Segreti in Rome
99;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2010-04-16T21:27:39Z;E Guinea ejected from industry clean-up body;;A pioneering initiative aimed at cleaning up the oil and mining industries has ejected Equatorial Guinea from its ranks following a board meeting seen as a test of its credibility.The board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a voluntary coalition of companies, governments, donors and civil society groups, had been under pressure from activists as it weighed whether to grant extensions to 17 states that had missed a deadline to have audits of their industries independently verified.Launched in 2002, the initiative is designed to curb the corrosive effects of mining and oil extraction on poor countries where mineral riches are often found.Peter Eigen, the initiative’s chairman, told the Financial Times that the board at its meeting in Berlin “applied the rules vigorously” but that Equatorial Guinea “got a fair hearing”.Under the initiative’s rules, countries may only be granted extensions under “exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances”.“We found that we had no such circumstances in Equatorial Guinea,” Mr Eigen said.Activists had accused Equatorial Guinea of seeking an extension despite showing “no political will” to co-operate in the process. The decision to de-list the country will come as a blow to the West African oil producer, where US oil groups including Marathon and ExxonMobil are the leading operators.After being embroiled in a series of corruption scandals, the government of Teodoro Obiang Nguema, the long-reigning dictator, has spent millions of dollars on Washington lobby groups in an effort to burnish its image abroad.One of the companies representing the government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The EITI has emerged as a boon for countries seeking to attract investment. Liberia – along with Azerbaijan, one of only two nations to reach full compliance under the initiative – has made much of its status as it seeks to rebuild its war-ravaged economy.The remaining 16 countries were granted extensions, mostly until September.A request for temporary suspension by São Tomé e Príncipe – a tiny Gulf of Guinea island nation that has yet to start pumping oil – was not granted and it, too, was de-listed.Some activists said the initiative had done just enough to ward off accusations that it was being too lenient.However, one person familiar with the situation said civil society groups had questioned whether some countries – among them Peru, Sierra Leone, the Republic of Congo and its vast neighbour the Democratic Republic of Congo – merited the extensions they were granted.“EITI needs to explain why it expelled some countries that failed to show commitment but extended the candidacies of others whose commitment was also questionable,” said Arvind Ganesan, director of the business and human rights programme at Human Rights Watch, the rights group. The board is expected to publish its minutes once they have been approved by its members.“[The initiative] has scraped through the credibility test but it seriously needs to raise its game,” said Diarmid O’Sullivan, head of the oil and transparency campaign at Global Witness, a London-based campaign group, and a non-voting member of the EITI board.
100;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2010-04-12T16:09:35Z;Oil and mines sleaze clean-up faces big test;;A pioneering effort to counter the corrosive effects of oil production and mining in poor countries faces a crunch test of its credibility this week.The board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative will weigh what action to take against 17 countries that have applied for membership but which missed last month’s deadline to have their audits of payments from mining and oil companies independently verified.Peter Eigen, the EITI chairman, told the Financial Times that many candidate countries had made prog­ress in documenting industry payments and should not be given unduly harsh penalties. However, others were at risk of “excommunication”.Activists are warning that the voluntary scheme, unveiled by Tony Blair, the UK prime minister, in 2002, risks undermining itself if it fails to adhere to rules stating that extensions may be granted only under “exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances”.Equatorial Guinea, the petroleum-rich west African state, will be under particular scrutiny. The family of Teodoro Obiang Nguema, the long-time dictator, has amassed fabulous wealth and the government has shown “no political will” to produce an authenticated audit, one activist said.US oil groups including Marathon and ExxonMobil are the leading operators there. Others expected to struggle to secure extensions include the Democratic Republic of Congo, where plundered resources have fuelled one of Africa’s worst conflicts.By contrast, Liberia, where so-called blood diamonds funded a brutal regional war, has become one of only two countries to be declared “compliant” with the initiative’s transparency standards. The other is Azerbaijan.Investors are keen for the initiative to succeed because of increasing legislative and shareholder pressure not to engage in graft. The initiative’s detractors point to the absence from the scheme of powers such as Angola or China, whose vast appetite for commodities fuelled a recent boom.But even EITI critics acknowledge it has spurred greater openness in a notoriously opaque industry.“It is very important that the world recognises that we are going through this process and we are all learning,” Mr Eigen said.The EITI board has always acted by consensus in the past but the question of extensions could force a vote when it meets in Berlin on Thursday and Friday.That could expose divisions on a board that contains multinationals, including oil groups Chevron of the US and France’s Total and gold giant Newmont, as well as civil society campaigners, candidate governments and donors.“This is crunch time,” said one person familiar with the matter.“If the board cannot show that the rules are being upheld, then EITI’s credibility will nosedive.”
101;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2010-04-11T21:49:58Z;Total chief still keen on UAE despite setbacks;;"Total, the French oil company, is looking to invest in the United Arab Emirates’ nuclear industry despite having been part of a consortium that lost the $20.4bn contract to build the country’s reactors.The loss to a Korean consortium, led by Korea Electric Power Corp and initially seen as the underdog, was widely acknowledged as a major upset. It has prompted the leader of the French group, Areva, to rethink its strategy, including considering offering older, cheaper reactors.Christophe de Margerie, Total’s chief executive, said in an interview that he was fully aware of the controversy Total’s potential investment could cause in France. “If Abu Dhabi wants a partner, we can be that partner. But if it were to be considered anti-Areva, we’d have to think about it,” he told the Financial Times.He added that Total had to be careful not to appear “anti-Areva”.He believed the Koreans won, not because they offered the superior product, but because their reactors were cheaper and quicker to build.“Our adventure is as an investor,” he said. “It is clear that we are a company interested in managing big projects, being in charge of operations. Areva is not our cup of tea because they are a manufacturer.”Mr de Margerie unleashed a firestorm of speculation in France that Total was about to buy Areva when he revealed in 2007 that he was considering moving Total into the nuclear arena.His exact nuclear plans remain unclear, causing concern – especially in France – about how such a big and rich new entrant, run by a man not known for his predictability, would fit in.Mr de Margerie acknowledged Total needed to tread carefully. “We cannot start having enemies; we are newcomers.”Total is perhaps the boldest western oil company when it comes to moving into countries with inclement investment climates. Among the most controversial are Burma and Sudan.In Sudan, Total is on the cusp of finding a new Middle Eastern partner to replace Marathon, the US company that was driven out in 2008 by US sanctions and investors angered by the company’s presence in a land wracked by genocide.Mr de Margerie said the political situation between northern and southern Sudan was still too unclear to begin seriously exploring for oil.But he dangled a carrot to the Sudanese, saying a pipeline could be built to eventually export oil from southern Sudan to Uganda, where Total is considering a large field development deal – and then to the coast.He said that investing in an environmentally sustainable way was “a must,” but warned that such responsibility came with additional cost that would eventually be passed on to the consumer. “Can it be changing the strategy of companies? No. It just means that to develop those oil and gas resources, we need to pay more. It is one of the reasons to think that the price of oil . . . can only go upwards,” he said.But there is at least one area in which Mr de Margerie was quick to quash any recent market buzz.With regards to Total’s US oil exploration partner Cobalt International Energy, he said: “The intent has been definitely not to buy them. We have proved not very good at finding oil in the Gulf of Mexico. It is better we have them alone and they operate independently.”"
102;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2009-11-05T19:42:22Z;Coup de theatre;;It would be a struggle to fit so many stereotypes into one pantomime. There was the crafty Arab, the swashbuckling old Etonian, a supporting cast of unscrupulous English toffs and a chorus of South African guns for hire. The drama would have been incomplete without a ruthless African: Equatorial Guinea’s dictator for 30 years, Teodore Obiang Nguema.Simon Mann, the old Etonian mercenary, walked free this week after a spell in one of Africa’s nastiest prisons. He was sent there after being convicted in an Equatorial Guinean court of plotting in 2004 to oust Mr Obiang. Hopefully his will be the last attempt by foreign mercenaries to impose their will on African soil.Mr Mann’s release, following a presidential pardon, should also remove what at times has been a useful prop for Mr Obiang. For five years, the distraction of what came to be known in the British press as the “Wonga coup” has obscured a sorrier tale unfolding in the Gulf of Guinea: one of inequity, repression and western hypocrisy.Western governments and NGOs are quick to criticise China’s willingness to do business in Africa regardless of the rights record of host regimes. Fewer though draw attention to the ugly complicity of western companies and governments in propping up the likes of Mr Obiang.US multinationals such as ExxonMobil, Amerada Hess and Marathon Oil pump around 380,000 bpd of crude from Equatorial Guinea’s waters. Oil has placed the country’s economy among the fastest growing in the world.Yet the regime has squandered billions. Equatorial Guinea, with a population of barely more than 500,000, remains one of the most unequal societies on earth. Its human rights record is one of the continent’s worst. Among abuses listed by the US State Department, are: unlawful killings by security forces, government-sanctioned kidnappings, systematic torture, judicial corruption and all manner of restrictions on civil liberties.In western accounts of the attempted coup, Mr Obiang’s portrayal conformed to type. The government now wants to burnish a new image, which must be one reason for the superficially magnanimous decision to release Mr Mann and co-conspirators.The failed Wonga coup made headlines thanks to its cast. But there is at least one plot to oust Mr Obiang every year. Rich as it may be in oil, the US and other allies of Equatorial Guinea have little to gain long term in overlooking the regime’s abuses.
103;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2009-11-03T23:08:41Z;Burning ambition;;"On a leafy street in Almaty, a few hundred miles from Kazakhstan’s border with China, the elegant mansion of China National Petroleum Corporation is kept under close guard. Behind its closed shutters, Chinese oilmen have plotted a strategy to win a huge portfolio of Kazakh energy assets to feed their country’s need for oil.China began discreetly buying Kazakh oilfields 10 years ago and now has more energy projects on the go in the central Asian nation than any other country. While the west’s biggest oil groups agonise over the risks of undertaking expensive infrastructure developments in obscure locations, Beijing has boldly built a 3,000km pipeline to lock Kazakhstan’s oilfields into its orbit.It is moves such as these that have prompted fears of a clash between the west and China over oil. Both John McCain and Barack Obama used the threat during last year’s presidential campaign to call for greater energy independence. Sombre oil executives fear they will never be able to compete with the deep pockets of China’s government-backed companies and will be driven out of the few last available new oil patches.The predicament seems even more dire in light of warnings from authorities including the International Energy Agency, the rich countries’ energy watchdog, that the world is heading towards another oil crunch by the middle of the coming decade.At a conference last month, Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of France’s Total, challenged other oil executives to disprove his theory that the world would never be able to produce more than 100m barrels of oil a day – 20 per cent more than today – because so many of its remaining reserves lay in countries unwilling or unable to let international oil companies tap them.In some areas, particularly central Asia, China’s ambitions are yielding results and Beijing is outmanoeuvring both Russia and western Europe. But for further-flung oil deposits, a new willingness by China to forge partnerships with international oil companies suggests the western oil executives’ worst fears have not become a reality.Beijing’s readiness to invest in pipelines to bring central Asian oil and gas to its doorstep has given it an edge in the race for the remote region’s resources. It has also challenged Russia’s control over export routes out of the area – spurring Moscow to activate stalled plans to build pipelines to China.China will be able to take up to 20 per cent of the former Soviet republic’s exports by the end of this year when a pipeline, already pumping oil from central Kazakhstan to the Chinese frontier, is linked with fields near the Caspian Sea. Chinese-controlled oil output from Kazakhstan already runs at nearly 300,000 b/d, more than one-quarter of China’s total foreign production.Strengthening its hold on the region’s oil, China gave Kazakhstan a $10bn (£6.1bn, €6.8bn) loan this year repayable via future supplies and equity in a Kazakh oil producer. Beijing’s sovereign wealth fund recently bought 11 per cent of London-listed KazMunaiGas Exploration and Production, which is majority owned by Kazakhstan’s state oil company.Sudan is another country in which Beijing has had successes in terms of production. China produces about 225,000 b/d in the north-east African nation.But political strife is threatening its investment. Much of the oil China controls there is pumped from fields in the south to refineries in the north. Southern Sudan is expected to vote for independence from the Khartoum regime in a referendum in 2011, or fight for it before then – risking supply disruptions and the cut-off of its route for shipments.In the rest of Africa, however, China has a far smaller presence than the western groups that shun Sudan. Its companies are making only gradual progress as politics and the power of the established companies get in its way.In fact, in much of the world, rather than becoming the dominant force, Cnooc, CNPC and Sinopec, Beijing’s three main state oil companies, are learning that deep pockets, cheap labour and a willingness to look the other way are not enough to overcome the handicap of entering the oil race a century after it began.In spite of its willingness to make agreements with rogue regimes such as those of Burma, Iran, Sudan and Guinea, China satisfies just 14 per cent of its needs through its overseas production, according to Wood Mackenzie, an industry consultancy.“The Chinese national oil companies’ international equity production, even if it were all shipped back to China, will be only a fraction of its needs,” says Claire Wong-Low at PFC Energy, another consultancy. Although she expects their activities abroad to increase further, “political obstacles in many regions will grow as countries view them as a threat
to domestic jobs and resources”.The scope of China’s ambitions and the willingness of its companies to go head to head with established energy groups such as Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil are evident in Cnooc’s proposal to buy 6bn barrels of Nigeria’s oil reserves.The oil being discussed represents one in every six barrels of Nigerian reserves and much of it is in soon-to-expire contracts that belong to the western oil majors. It emerged just weeks later that the company was ready to compete with ExxonMobil, the west’s biggest energy group, to gain control of almost a quarter of Ghana’s Jubilee field, Africa’s largest offshore oil field.But that is all still in the realm of ambition. Both Nigeria and Ghana have sought to play down the likelihood that Cnooc would achieve what it wanted.For its part, Sinopec in March launched the biggest Chinese oil takeover of the year when it spent $7.6bn to buy Addax, a company headquartered in Switzerland that has operations in Nigeria, Gabon and the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. But Sinopec paid dearly. Baghdad, which is at odds with Kurdistan over how to share oil riches, retaliated by tossing Sinopec out of the consortium that last month won the right to develop the Zubair field.In Nigeria, politics also threatens Chinese deals. The Lagos government is reconsidering the deals that Chinese groups struck with the previous regime. Those deals gave Asian companies the right of first refusal on oil projects in return for their promising to develop infrastructure, such as the Kaduna refinery, a railway from Lagos to Kano and a hydroelectric complex at Mambilla.Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria’s oil minister, says the new government is investigating whether the projects signed under the oil-for-infrastructure deal were still in the best interests of the country, especially after several companies failed to deliver on their promises. “It is up to discussion. We are looking at some projects to see whether we need to substitute other infrastructure projects that suit us better,” he addsIn Angola, China has gained a bigger presence than in much of the rest of Africa. Chinese banks have lent the war-ravaged country as much as $15bn at low rates with long repayment times and Chinese financial and technical help has kick-started 120 projects in the past five years, according to estimates by Chatham House, the UK-based think-tank. China’s own statistics suggest 50,000 of its nationals worked on bilateral infrastructure projects in Angola last year.Since 2007, China has been importing more Angolan oil – 18 per cent of its needs – than any other country. Its companies have gained stakes in exploration and production projects led there by western companies. But even Angola has become more demanding, seeking to move away from loans backed by oil and insisting that foreign investors use more local labour and equipment.Angus McCoss, exploration director at Tullow, a UK-listed oil company with large operations in Ghana and Uganda, has observed the maturation of Chinese companies working in remote African areas. “It has been no secret that some of the early projects the Chinese have been involved in in Africa have not gone down well because they didn’t use a lot of local labour,” he says. “I think they have realised their mistakes. They have learnt very quickly from them.”At Total, Mr de Margerie believes the Chinese companies’ experiences have made them more open to partnering with western oil companies, saying: “They have discovered that it is not so easy. They have spent more than they needed to spend.” He adds: “When it is close to China, they might remain aggressive and want to go it alone. But in other areas they will be more pragmatic.”Perhaps the clearest pointer to a constructive way forward is that of BP and CNPC in Iraq. On Tuesday, the two became the first team to win the right to develop Iraq’s oil fields, more than 30 years after the country nationalised its industry. They will work on Iraq’s giant Rumaila field, bringing its production to 3m b/d from barely 1m b/d today.BP will provide technological expertise and the knowhow that comes from having discovered the field in 1952 and having studied it from afar for the past few years. CNPC will keep down costs on the $10bn-$20bn project. The Chinese will do this by providing “rigs, valves, pipes, pots and pans”, as Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive, put it recently.Providing basic industry hardware in a partnership that will add 2m b/d of supply to world markets and provide badly needed revenue for Iraq may be a far cry from a clash of civilisations. Nevertheless, China’s ambition and its advances abroad are a reminder that Beijing is deadly serious about its own rise from poverty. Regardless, of how benignly it proceeds, China will demand more additional oil in the coming decades than any other country in the world.Additional reporting by Isabel Gorst, Tom Burgis and Geoff Dyer"
104;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2009-07-19T18:46:12Z;Chinese companies agree oil field stake;;"CNOOC and Sinopec have agreed to buy a 20 per cent stake in a subsea oil field off Angola for $1.3bn from Marathon of the US, as China continues to pursue its sometimes chequered efforts to buy up overseas energy and mining assets.The Chinese energy companies said that they would form a 50-50 venture to buy the stake in an area known as block 32, which has already yielded 12 discoveries. Marathon will retain a 10 per cent working interest in the block. Chinese companies have been quietly buying up sources of commodities that will be needed to fuel the country’s economic growth. Sinopec recently moved into the booming oil frontier of Iraqi Kurdistan by agreeing a C$8.3bn (US$7.2bn) takeover of Addax Petroleum, an independent oil company based in Canada. Earlier this month, China Investment Corporation, the country’s $200bn sovereign wealth fund, agreed to pay C$1.74bn for a 17.2 per cent stake in Teck Resources, a Canadian zinc and copper miner.However, the country’s pursuit of resources was dealt a blow when Rio Tinto, the Anglo-Australian mining company, rejected Chinalco’s $19.5bn bid for part of the company.That deal, which ultimately foundered for market reasons, also faced economic, political and shareholder opposition, reflecting fears over the consequences of giving China direct access to big supplies of natural resources.Concern has risen over Chinese attempts to gain greater power over natural resources since Beijing has detained four employees of Rio, including one Australian citizen, in connection with global iron ore contract pricing negotiations.The deal in Angola, already a big supplier of crude to China, prices the African assets more cheaply than Marathon had originally hoped. Marathon had tried to sell the stake for up to $2bn, people close to the deal said at the time. Other partners in block 32 – Total of France with a 30 per cent stake; Sonangol, the Angola state-owned company, with 20 per cent; ExxonMobil with 15 per cent and Galp of Portugal with 5 per cent – have rights of first refusal over the sale. Any of those companies could buy the 20 per cent stake at the price being offered by the Chinese."

106;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2009-05-24T18:35:38Z;Into Africa;;Before the oil came, Equatorial Guinea’s phone book boasted only a few pages. Subscribers were listed by their first names. Cars were a novelty and the tallest buildings in Malabo, the island capital, were gracefully ageing villas dating back to Spanish colonial rule. The airport consisted of a tin shack.Today, a new city is rising on the doorstep of the old. Immaculate tower blocks march past a six-lane highway stretching into the jungle. Smart blue lamp-posts line the pavements. The facade of a bank glows gold in the tropical sun. There are no people yet, but soon “Malabo Two” will be open for business.Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the president who seized power 30 years ago, is spending billions of petrodollars on a construction bonanza aimed at turning his tiny country into a Dubai-style economic hub for the Gulf of Guinea, one of the world’s fastest-growing oil and gas frontiers.Such a feat would be a big turnround for a government that has a reputation as one of Africa’s most flagrant kleptocracies, dominated by a ruling clan that has used arbitrary arrests, beatings and torture to stifle dissent.The outcome will have implications not just for Equatorial Guinea’s 700,000 people, many of whom live in pastel-painted slums without power or running water, but also for a vanguard of European energy companies banking on the country to supply a commodity they desperately need: natural gas.Russia’s invasion of Georgia and its willingness to turn off gas supplies to Ukraine have struck fear into European Union governments dependent on Moscow for a quarter of the bloc’s consumption. As their own gas fields begin to decline, European companies are venturing into increasingly risky territory to diversify their supplies.Equatorial Guinea is a perfect example. In the past few months, Eon, the giant German utility, and Union Fenosa of Spain have signed agreements to back the government’s plan to convert Bioko, the main island and home of the capital, into a significant gas export hub. Equatorial Guinea wants to exploit its own modest deposits and tap vast resources in neighbouring Nigeria, whose 182,000bn cu ft of proven gas reserves are the seventh largest in the world.The experience of US companies that led the development of the oil industry suggests the Europeans will have to tread warily. A Senate investigation into Equatorial Guinea’s dealings with a Washington bank shone a spotlight on payments by oil companies to government officials. Global Witness, the anti-corruption watchdog, has highlighted damaging evidence of high-rolling lifestyles enjoyed by certain members of Mr Obiang’s family. In November, a UN investigator accused the police of systematic use of torture.Such reports alone might be enough to rattle European executives, even without coup plots reminiscent of The Dogs of War, a thriller that Frederick Forsyth, the British writer, set in a fictional version of Equatorial Guinea. Security fears have imbued the government with a sense of paranoia as thick as the mist shrouding the volcano brooding over Malabo.Simon Mann, the former UK special forces officer and an old Etonian, is serving a 34-year sentence in the city for his part in a failed attempt to seize power in 2004. The escapade involved a shadowy cast of financiers, mercenaries and members of the British upper class who believed using force to grab the energy reserves of such a minute country was a viable proposition.As European companies embrace Mr Obiang and his powerful family, they can only hope the rise of Malabo Two is the harbinger of a more benign form of rule that will make it easier to keep their consciences – and reputations – clean. Not everyone is convinced.“These companies are taking a huge reputational risk by coming to Equatorial Guinea,” said Tutu Alicante, executive-director of Equatorial Guinea Justice, a US-based group campaigning for better governance. “The newcomers must make their engagement conditional on greater transparency.”The only former Spanish colony in Sub-Saharan Africa, Equatorial Guinea once counted its wealth in cocoa pods. Following huge offshore finds in the early 1990s, it rapidly evolved into the region’s largest oil exporter after Nigeria and Angola. The economy – on paper at least – recorded some of the fastest growth in the world.Equatorial Guinea already exports up to 3.7m tonnes of liquefied natural gas (gas supercooled for shipping) from a facility opened by Houston-based Marathon Oil in 2007. The government wants to at least double or triple the amount by raising domestic production and striking agreements to export gas from fields in Nigeria and Cameroon.After years of favouring US companies, Mr Obiang (right) has turned to the Europeans to realise this vision, confident they will guarantee a market.Eon has taken a 25 per cent stake in a new “3-G” consortium set up by Sonagas, the state gas company, to build the necessary infrastructure. Galp Energia of Portugal and Gasol, listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market, are also involved. Gas Natural of Spain, which recently upped its stake in Union Fenosa to 95 per cent, is another participant.Uncertainties abound. Nigeria and Cameroon have proved reluctant to augment Equatorial Guinea’s modest gas reserves, estimated to be at least 4,400bn cu ft by the Oil and Gas Journal. Speedboat-riding gunmen operating out of Nigeria’s delta region attacked the presidential palace in Malabo in February, proving that the country’s energy facilities are well within reach of militants who have visited havoc on Nigeria’s oil industry. At Equatorial Guinea’s first gas conference in March, an armoured car – its turret pointed out to sea – guarded the Sofitel where delegates slept. Dietrich Gerstein, Eon’s chief executive officer of LNG, nevertheless told the gathering that Equatorial Guinea was a “cornerstone” of the company’s plans to secure long-term supply.Seated next to him, Gabriel Obiang Lima, the vice-minister of mines, industry and energy – one of the president’s sons – played down allegations of human rights abuses. “I think many times the information that is published about Equatorial Guinea is not founded,” he said. “I don’t want to point out the individuals who are in charge of doing this.”However, a glance at recent history shows how deep the roots of the authoritarian system run. After colonial rule under General Francisco Franco, the Spanish dictator, ended in 1968, the country plunged into one of the most miserable – if little known – episodes of modern African history.Life under Francisco Macías Nguema, who took over as president, was as terrifying as it was bizarre. Calling himself the “The Great Sorcerer”, on several documented occasions he ordered the executions of all his mistresses’ former lovers. Catholic priests were forced to recite: “There is no God other than Macías.” Being a journalist was a capital offence. As his administration collapsed, Macías built up a huge collection of human skulls and declaimed lengthy monologues to colleagues he had murdered. Before Mr Obiang staged a coup in 1979 and had him killed, a third of the population is estimated to have died or fled.“As a colony, and under Macías, we had some of the worst dictators in the world,” says Alfredo Okenve of the CEID network, one of the country’s few civil society organisations. “Whatever changes is progress, but the progress has been very slow.”Allegations of graft have proliferated during the oil era. The US Senate investigation into the handling of Equatorial Guinea’s deposits in Riggs Bank in Washington said in 2004 that oil companies may have contributed to corruption by making payments to officials with minimal disclosure. The sums included more than $4m for training students abroad, most of them children or relatives of government figures. The companies argued they had little choice but to do business with the government of the day.Not all investors concurred. In 2005, the Swedish national pension fund said it would not invest in ExxonMobil, Amerada Hess or Marathon because of reported cases of corruption in Equatorial Guinea. Reports abounded of mansions in Malibu and Maryland purchased by Mr Obiang or his circle. The president has always denied any impropriety, saying he personally supervised state accounts to prevent theft.The government points to its vision for transforming Bioko into a gas and maritime centre as evidence it is putting its income to good use. In spite of the drop in oil prices, Chinese labourers dressed in blue overalls and hard hats packed in the back of trucks rumble daily towards construction sites in Malabo Two. The port echoes with the clanking of cranes working on a $4.5bn (€3.2bn, £2.8bn) deepwater project designed to serve the whole Gulf of Guinea. Strolling on the new quay as a freighter unloads cement, Alberto Ndong Obiang Lima, director of ports and another of the president’s sons, says the planned transport hub will generate income even when the oil runs out. “Many people, especially foreigners, say Equatorial Guinea is becoming the Dubai of Central Africa,” he says. “I think it’s true – look at the investments and construction.”Mr Obiang’s familial style of rule certainly gives Equatorial Guinea the feel of an African emirate. Effective opposition is virtually non-existent: in the last elections in 2002 the president won more than 97 per cent of the vote. Little wealth has trickled down. In spite of an average gross domestic product of more than $31,000 a head, almost 80 per cent of people live in poverty. The International Monetary Fund warned in March that spending plans would not meet social needs, a reminder that prestige projects have not always helped Africa’s poor.Perhaps the most critical test will be whether Mr Obiang will tolerate more openness. He has in the past described oil revenues as a “state secret” but has since authorised the government to apply to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a global programme that would subject public accounts to much greater scrutiny.Francisca Tatchouop Belobe, a vice-minister who is co-ordinating the bid for EITI membership, says Equatorial Guinea’s slow progress is a result of a shortage of capacity rather than a lack of political will. “When talking about the country that apparently has so many secrets, you realise we have nothing to hide,” she says.Equatorial Guinea has less than a year before its March deadline to qualify. Success would allow European newcomers to breathe more easily. Should Mr Obiang’s government fail, then they could start facing the kinds of awkward questions that have dogged their American rivals.
107;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2009-03-27T16:28:57Z;Eon leads Europe dash for West African gas;;Eon, the German gas giant, is leading a foray by European energy companies into Equatorial Guinea, challenging established US rivals in the race to secure sources of supply from West Africa.Europeans largely stood aside as ExxonMobil and other US companies spent the past decade working with one of Africa’s most authoritarian governments to transform the country into a major exporter of oil and liquefied natural gas.Fears over declining output from EU gas fields and the risks of overdependence on Russian supplies have, however, pushed European companies to take on dominant US players in the energy-rich Gulf of Guinea.Eon, Union Fenosa of Spain and Portugal’s Galp Energia appear to have leapfrogged US competitors by securing a deal to help Equatorial Guinea develop a masterplan that could shape the development of its gas reserves for decades to come.The companies have also agreed to work with Sonagas, the state gas company, to build a network of pipelines and processing facilities the government hopes will transform the tiny island of Bioko into a gas export hub for West Africa.In return, the companies seek long-term gas supplies from the former Spanish colony, where Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the president, seized power in a coup 30 years ago.“To balance our supply portfolio in the long run we need to integrate new supply sources,” Dietrich Gerstein, Eon’s chief executive officer for LNG, this week told a conference in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea’s capital.Had conference delegates been in Malabo on February 17, they could have watched from their hotel as gunmen in speed boats attacked the presidential palace before fleeing, pursued by an army helicopter gunship.The raid, by Nigerian militants, was a reminder of the potential for instability in sub-Saharan Africa’s third biggest oil exporter, which last year jailed Simon Mann, a former UK special forces officer, for his part in a failed coup plot in 2004.Gabriel Obiang Lima, the vice-minister of mines, industry and energy, who is also one of the president’s sons, told the conference that European companies would guarantee a market for the country’s gas. “The most difficult thing is to find the consumer,” he said.He said criticism of Equatorial Guinea’s human rights record, including a damning UN report in November, was unjustified. “There are individuals who are ensuring that the image of the country is negative all the time,” he added.Eon will hold a 25 per cent stake in a planned “3G” consortium in which Union Fenosa and Galp Energia will each hold 5 per cent. Sonagas will own 50 per cent. The government will retain the remaining 15 per cent, with the option of selling it.The government says the consortium may consider building an LNG export terminal alongside its sole existing plant, built by Houston-based Marathon Oil, once it has assessed the scale of gas reserves. Marathon’s terminal has a nameplate capacity of 3.7m tonnes a year.Analysts say there are still question marks over the size of the country’s resources and whether it will be able to source enough gas from Nigeria and Cameroon to make its plans viable.However the prospect of European companies leading the next phase of Equatorial Guinea’s gas industry development has already raised hackles among established US companies.Executives at Marathon, which shipped the country’s first LNG exports in May 2007, believe they are best placed to lead any expansion. ExxonMobil might also find itself being obliged to sell the gas it flares from its Zafiro deepwater field into the planned gas gathering system under a pricing framework devised by the consortium.
108;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2008-10-30T20:06:02Z;ExxonMobil to cut costs despite record profit;;ExxonMobil, the biggest western oil company, is pushing to drive costs down to take advantage of falling materials prices, to reverse rampant cost inflation in the global energy industry.Exxon set out its plan as it reported the world’s biggest corporate profit, but a fall in oil and gas production.Shortages of staff, equipment and materials have sent oil companies’ costs soaring in recent years.Rising oil prices over past months have delivered ever-higher profits, but if the recent fall in the price of oil is sustained, profits will fall sharply. US crude was $64 per barrel on Thursday, less than half its July peak of more than $147. Exxon shares dropped in spite of the earnings performance, falling more than 2% due to the slipping price of crude.However, prices for raw materials used in the oil industry such as steel, copper and cement have also been falling sharply, and Exxon intends to benefit from that by driving down costs.David Rosenthal, vice-president of investor relations, said it was unclear how quickly costs would start to fall, but added: “We are actively driving the lag out of that process …We are working hard to ensure that the lower costs we are seeing in some of those goods and services does result in lower costs for these projects.”The pressure on costs, which has also been highlighted by Tony Hayward, the chief executive of BP, could spell trouble for oil services companies, which have benefited greatly from the industry’s upturn, but whose share prices have generally been falling recently.Mr Rosenthal’s comments came as Exxon reported underlying net income up 42 per cent at $13.38bn for the third quarter: the highest quarterly profit ever from a listed company.As with BP and Royal Dutch Shell, the profit was ahead of analysts’ expectations. However, Exxon’s oil and gas production was down 8 per cent on last year, although stripping out the effects of production-sharing contracts, the summer’s hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, and higher than usual maintenance downtime, the decline was only 2 per cent.Exxon predicted that production would rise next year, as its four new liquefied natural gas facilities in Qatar came on stream.In a statement, Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive, said: “Despite the continuing uncertainty in world financial markets, ExxonMobil has maintained a strong financial position.”Exxon has about $37bn in cash on its balance sheet, giving it great potential firepower for acquisitions in what is expected to be a period of consolidation.Mr Tillerson said capital and exploration expenditures this year were expected to be about $25bn, in line with previous guidance, and the company said it had made no change to its plans to spend $25bn-$30bn a year in the next five years.Marathon Oil, a US independent, plans to cut next year’s capital spending by 15 per cent “as a prudent approach to the current business environment”.
109;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2008-10-30T14:21:51Z;Offshore oil and gas: Weathering a sea change in conditions;;When Marathon Oil was shooting a video to celebrate 25 years of production at the Brae Alpha platform 155 miles north-east of Aberdeen, the metal plaque on the helicopter deck commemorating its inauguration was polished to a shine. Six months later, it is a deep, dull red-brown, tarnished by the merciless punishment of the North Sea weather.The plaque is a vivid illustration of the hardships faced by the personnel and equipment working in Scotland’s offshore industry.In defiance of the elements, the sector has thrived, making the UK one of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers at the peak of its production around the turn of the decade.Now, however, the industry faces many more threats than just the elements. To the existing challenges of ageing infrastructure, a depleted resource base, and high costs have been added a plunging oil price, which has sent Brent crude down below $60 per barrel from a peak of more than $145 in July, and the credit crunch, which threatens to cut off the supply of financing to the smaller North Sea companies that need capital to fund their investment.Mike Tholen, economics director at Oil & Gas UK, the industry association, says “a lot of people are thinking hard” about the effect the crisis will have.“If the worst is over in six months or so, then it is more likely to slow down than stall the industry,” he says. “If it is a lot longer than six months, then the effects may be a lot more.”The North Sea has a limitless need for investment. Ageing infrastructure such as the Brae Alpha platform needs continual refurbishment and renewal, and the smaller and more difficult pockets of oil that are now the typical discoveries often need more ingenuity to find and to make economically viable.If the gas believed to be present in the area west of the Shetland Islands is to be developed, opening up what may be the last significant reserves in British waters, there will have to be heavy investment in pipelines and other infrastructure to deliver it to market.With investment in the UK offshore industry predicted to fall in 2008 for a second successive year, and the turbulent outlook casting a shadow over next year’s prospects as well, the likelihood that this prospect will receive the spending it needs is diminishing.The industry argues that failing to make the investment needed to recover the North Sea’s remaining resources would be a missed opportunity. The UK’s Department for Business has estimated that production in 2010 is likely to be about 2.4m barrels of oil equivalent per day – well short of its target set at the end of the last decade of 3m boe/d. However, the government also estimates that although about 37bn boe have been extracted from the UK sector of the North Sea, there are still 15bn-20bn left to be produced.Mike Wagstaff, chief executive of Venture Production, one of the smaller companies that has been building a business in the North Sea, says the region clearly does not have the excitement that it did 20 or 30 years ago, but is still a “very significant oil and gas province”, with the great advantage of a much more business-friendly environment than many other geologically richer countries.To make the best of the North Sea, he says, companies need to be smarter about exploiting the reserves that remain. “As a company, you need to apply innovative and cost-effective techniques to get the oil out,” he says. “In a mature basin technology gets more and more important.”For example, Venture claims an unlikely achievement in producing oil from one of the smallest fields ever developed as a stand-alone project in the North Sea. The Chestnut field is the first in the region to use a circular FPSO (floating production, storage and offloading) system. This is a floating structure that can pump the oil straight into a tanker that is more stable in rough seas than the standard long, thin vessel.That sort of innovation has meant that north-east Scotland has also become a world-class centre for oil and gas services.The subsea engineering industry, centred around “surf city” at Westhill near Aberdeen, exports its services around the world, earning half of its revenues from outside the UK and taking a near-40 per cent share of a $25bn global market.However, Mr Wagstaff warns that the service industry is as strong as it is only because oil and gas production remains robust.“The service sector exists because Scotland is a good place to do business, because it has good transport links and infrastructure, and because it has an active offshore industry,” he says. “If it wasn’t active, then those guys would relocate to Stavanger, or Houston, or Rio, or Singapore.”…………………………………………Renewable energy: tide begins to turn but ambitions are still powering ahead of realityScotland’s renewable energy industry has been an object lesson in frustration and thwarted potential. The nation’s wind, waves and tides are its other great natural resource alongside its oil and gas, and unlike the hydrocarbons they are not running out. But the progress of attempts to exploit those resources has been disappointingly slow, bedevilled by political and commercial difficulties.There are signs that the political log-jam may be starting to break. But Scotland still has a long way to go to realise its ambition of becoming the “Saudi Arabia of wind”: not least in solving the problem of the long distances between the best locations for producing electricity, and the biggest markets for energy, which are mostly in England.Renewable electricity – almost all of it wind and hydro power, which represent about 1,550MW (megawatts) and 1,380MW of installed capacity respectively – can now power 60 per cent of Scotland’s homes.The Scottish government has set a target of deriving 31 per cent of the country’s electricity from renewables by 2011, and 50 per cent by 2020. Scottish Renewables, the industry association, argues that it could be possible for Scotland to go much further and become an exporter of renewable electricity, ultimately supplying 75 per cent of the UK’s electricity.The UK’s highly demanding commitment to the European Union to derive 15 per cent of its energy – implying about a third of its electricity – from renewable sources by 2020 will require a disproportionate contribution from Scotland.But while the growth in renewable energy – mostly in the form of onshore wind farms – has been impressive, it will need to be very much greater to realise those ambitions.Offshore wind, the great hope for the future, is still in its infancy. There are just two turbines operating in Scottish waters, with a full capacity of a mere 10MW. Eon, the German energy group, is building the 60-turbine Robin Rigg wind farm in the Solway Firth, but that is the only project close to coming on stream.Onshore wind has gone much further, but projects have often faced long delays in the planning system.David Socha, principal energy consultant at Logica in Edinburgh, says: “It currently takes several years and much public hand-wringing to approve or decline applications. This leads to lack of appetite to develop, an inability to plan – and therefore finance – front-line projects, as well as an inability to deliver the supporting infrastructure that would encourage growth in this sector.”In October 780MW of onshore wind capacity was under construction, and 2,215MW had received approval in principle, but a further 3,914MW was still in planning or in appeal, and 2,614MW had been refused or withdrawn.Under the Scottish National Party government in Edinburgh, building on reforms put in place by the previous Labour administration, the position has improved. The pace of approvals has accelerated, with 14 renewables projects getting the green light since the SNP took over in May 2007. Jim Mather, the energy minister, recently promised: “There is much more to come.”As concerns about the planning system are eased, however, a new problem is rising in salience: grid connections. For wind power – and perhaps in future wave and tidal power – in remote areas of Scotland, the issue is particularly pressing.National Grid, which runs Britain’s electricity networks, estimates there is 9,000MW of proposed renewable energy capacity waiting for grid connections in Scotland, some of which is not scheduled to be connected up until the end of the next decade.Jason Ormiston, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, wants a “predict and provide” approach to extending and strengthening the electricity network. “With roads, the government predicts what the demand will be and invests in the road network. Why can’t we take the same approach to the grid?” he says.
110;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2008-10-22T21:59:19Z;Size is critical issue at Marathon;;"EnCana’s decision last week not to split itself in two has turned the energy sector’s focus on Marathon Oil, which said in July that it would also consider a split.There are growing signs that investors and lenders favour such a move less than they did before the credit crisis intensified.The smaller size of Marathon’s exploration and production and refining operations, if separated, could make it tougher for each business to finance itself.This is particularly the case for the refining operations, which have substantial capital requirements and could require a multi-billion dollar working capital facility.“This is not really an environment where you want to be going to your banks to ask them to step up with a big working capital facility,” one banker said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re having trouble putting that together.”Another banker said: “They probably won’t get the kind of attention they would want and deserve in this environment, because people are focused on putting out fires” in the financing markets.If Marathon cannot secure the necessary financing, or say it is highly confident it could do so, a separation in the near term could prove untenable.Marathon will also have to convince investors it will be worth more in pieces than combined.This is at a time when the markets are valuing large, less leveraged companies more highly than smaller entities with more leverage, according to research from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.“We’re in an environment where bigger is better, there’s no doubt about that,” one energy banker said. “That’s primarily for balance sheet and credit reasons, but also because investors are less inclined to pay very high growth multiples for companies that have just one or two [oil and gas] basins.”Marathon’s decision to announce it was considering a split could make it more vulnerable to takeover, bankers agreed. The company’s sagging share price has also turned it into a more easily digestible bite for the world’s largest oil companies.But while the credit crunch could make a split by Marathon difficult, it might help protect it from poachers by making an unsolicited takeover tough to finance.Marathon’s refining business has long served as a “poison pill” to deter suitors which do not want more exposure to the volatile refining sector, and sources expected that would continue to be the case unless the company split.If a split occurs, Marathon’s more desirable upstream oil and gas business may have
limited time to prove its mettle as a standalone operation if it wants to stay independent.But at the same time, while Devon Energy and Anadarko Petroleum, two similar businesses, have been long rumoured as potential takeover targets for ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, those deals have not yet occurred.Marathon said it would decide this quarter whether to execute the split.When that decision is made, credit market conditions might also dictate whether it would execute a straight spin-off of the refining business or pursue another structure to execute the plan."
111;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2008-10-03T00:50:51Z;Treasury rules out North Sea incentives;;"The oil and gas industry has been rebuffed by the Treasury over its call for stronger incentives to invest in the North Sea, sparking warnings that Britain risks leaving badly needed resources in the ground.Investment in the North Sea is likely to have fallen in 2008 for a second successive year, in spite of the steep rise in oil prices. The number of wells drilled to develop fields is on course to be about the same as last year, which was 15 per cent fewer than in 2006.Gordon Brown met industry leaders in Aberdeen in May, as prices soared, to discuss ways to boost Britain’s oil and gas supplies.However, when Oil & Gas UK, the industry association, met Treasury officials in July, it was made clear that there would be no new large-scale incentive for North Sea investment.O&G UK had called for a 25 per cent increase in the value of capital investment that could be written off against tax, but this was rejected on the grounds that it would be too generous to projects that would have gone ahead anyway.The industry argues that the tax regime, which was twice made more onerous by Mr Brown when he was chancellor, needs to be reformed to ensure that the remaining 25bn barrels of oil and gas that the government believes are in the UK’s sector of the North Sea can be developed.Without that investment, it warns, output will decline more quickly and total production will be much lower.O&G UK says companies need to be incentivised to invest in three things: technology for squeezing more out of fields, known as enhanced oil recovery; developments of small and technically challenging pockets of oil and gas that are the typical North Sea discoveries these days; and infrastructure such as pipelines to open up the relatively undeveloped area of deeper water out into the Atlantic, west of the Shetland Islands.Exploitation of that area is threatened by disagreements between the government and some of the companies over the scale of development that is needed.Mike Tholen of O&G UK said that although the industry’s plan had been rejected, he was “optimistic” that the government would see the merits of his case, perhaps even in time for the pre-Budget report, expected in early November, even though no further meetings are planned.“When you see investment not soaring as the oil price has risen, then you know you need to do everything you can to keep things moving in the right direction,” he said.Individual companies have been talking to the Treasury about possible more limited tax breaks.Alan McCrae of Ernst & Young, the accountants, urged the Treasury to make more effort to look for tax breaks that could be “win-win” for government and industry, stimulating investment and raising tax revenues."
112;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2008-08-21T23:43:54Z;Sinopec hovers as ONGC nears Imperial deal;;Imperial Energy, the London-listed oil company operating in Russia, is close to agreeing a takeover deal with India’s Oil and Natural Gas Company.One of the big state-controlled Russian energy companies, either Gazprom or Rosneft, is also likely to be involved in any deal.Such a deal, which would value Imperial at about $2.8bn,could still be disrupted by a rival bid from Sinopec of China.Reports in India on Thursday suggested that state-controlled ONGC had been given government approval to make a bid and had made an indicative offer at £12.90 a share.Insiders suggested that a bid could be announced before Imperial’s results, scheduled for release next week. But they warned that talks were continuing and there was no certainty that an offer would be made.Imperial declined to comment. Its shares closed up 5 per cent at £12.08, still well short of the likely level of an ONGC bid. They have risen almost 60 per cent in the past six weeks.The London company announced last month it had received an approach that could lead to a bid. Imperial later confirmed that the possible offer was at £12.90: roughly the level at which Peter Levine, chairman, sold some of his shares to institutions this year.At the end of July, Sinopec, one of China’s biggest oil companies, also made an approach to Imperial and is still in talks.Korea National Oil Corporation, the state-controlled South Korean company, has also expressed an interest.Imperial’s attraction is that it is a route into Russia, which has some of the world’s biggest petroleum reserves but which has become increasingly hostile to foreign companies.However, it has been a bumpy ride for investors: shares were hit by problems with the Russian authorities over Imperial’s licences, although those problems appear now to have been resolved.The interest shown by ONGC and Sinopec is evidence of the assertive international expansion sought by many oil companies from emerging economies.ONGC has not yet managed to complete any acquisitions but has been seen as the favourite to secure Imperial because of the good relations between Russia and India.Chinese companies have faced problems in Russia, with China Oilfield Services Ltd being blocked from taking control of a small services unit of TNK-BP, the Anglo-Russian joint venture.The involvement of a big Russian company in the deal may smooth out that problem for Sinopec. Rosneft, the state-controlled oil company, is a partner of Sinopec and ONGC in projects at Sakhalin island off the far east coast of Russia.ONGC and Sinopec are also among the companies vying for a $2bn stake in an oil field off the cost of Angola being sold by Marathon of the US.Imperial is advised by ABN and Merrill Lynch.
113;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Halve Marathon;;Clearly, at least one Wall Street bank has treated the directors of Marathon Oil to a presentation of the “EnCana case study”. When the Canadian energy group announced plans in May to split itself into separate gas and oil businesses, its shares leapt by 7 per cent. Now Marathon is considering splitting its exploration and production (E&P) business from its downstream refining and marketing (R&M) operations.The mere fact that Marathon is considering such a move lifted its flagging stock price by almost 8 per cent on Thursday – handy, given its announcement on the same day of second-quarter profits that missed expectations by a wide margin. The problem is in the downstream business. US consumption of refined products has dropped 4 per cent in a year. Crude oil, however, which is refiners’ main raw material, is still very expensive. The result? First half profit in Marathon’s R&M business has collapsed from $1.6bn in 2007 to just $83m this year.Despite Marathon’s sizeable upstream business, investors are treating it more like a refiner. Prior to Thursday, its stock had dropped by 30 per cent since the start of the year, compared with a broadly flat E&P sector. The hope is that, if Marathon splits itself, investors will ascribe a clearer – read “higher” – valuation to its constituent parts. Sanford Bernstein puts a sum-of-the-parts value on Marathon equivalent to $57 per share, 14.5 per cent above the current price.Marathon’s E&P business, with its exposure to deepwater projects, liquefied natural gas and oil sands, reads like an especially tempting menu for any larger competitor. Splitting the two businesses, therefore, is worth thinking over, even if only to smoke out a potential acquirer. Investors are proving ever harder to please: ExxonMobil’s stock fell on Thursday in spite of reporting the world’s biggest quarterly profit ever. Expect more oil companies to consider, very publicly, a break-up.Post and read comments on this Lex
114;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2008-07-01T23:08:22Z;Providence predicts success for Irish oil;;Tony O’Reilly Jr believes Providence Resources has the right model at the right time to dodge the jinx that has plagued the oil and gas industry in Ireland.“Ireland’s time as a serious oil and gas play has come – just look at the global players who are participating,” says an ebullient Mr O’Reilly, chief executive of Providence, the oil exploration business founded by his business magnate father, Sir Anthony O’Reilly.“Technology, price, date and geopolitics all say that now is the time,” he adds.In common with oil explorers round the world, high oil and gas prices are making Irish oil and gas assets once considered uncommercial to develop – “stranded” in the industry jargon – appear worthy of investment.Providence’s push to develop business in Irish waters, echoing moves by the likes of ExxonMobil and Shell, is risky. But the company appears to have the faith of investors, who have sent the shares up 44 per cent in the past year. There have been plaudits from analysts for having built up a portfolio of producing fields in the US and UK to provide cash flow for exploration and appraisal work off the Irish coast.Aim and Dublin-listed Providence has its roots in Atlantic Resources, formed by Sir Anthony in 1981. Back then, Atlantic identified a list of geologically promising prospects but low oil prices and a lack of infrastructure off Ireland meant that these were not followed up.When prices crashed at the end of the 1990s, the company was put on a care and maintenance basis until 2002 when, with oil prices on the rise, Providence was revived. Sir Anthony, best known as owner of Ireland’s Independent News & Media and former chief executive of HJ Heinz, the US food company, still holds a 41 per cent stake.Investor interest in Providence has grown over the past year. Its market capitalisation has risen more than 60 per cent to stand at about €260m. Will Dymott at house broker Cenkos says Providence is increasingly in the orbit of institutional investors rather than the Irish retail market. It raised €26m through a placing last year that brought in 10 UK institutions. Then Australian investment bank Macquarie agreed a $250m loan facility and took the fee in the form of shares.Providence’s foundation for its exploratory push offshore Ireland has been strengthened by its recent $67.5m (£33.9m) acquisition of Triangle Oil and Gas in the US, which at a stroke provided almost 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Cenkos sees production from the Triangle assets rising to as much as 4,000 boe/d in 2010, underpinning exploration and appraisal spending.Focusing on Ireland has some unfortunate precedents. “Oil found in Dublin Bay” was a perennial apocryphal story in the 1980s.There have been successes, such as Marathon Oil’s Kinsale Head development, which has quietly and profitably delivered gas into Ireland since 1978.But disappointments have been more common. Ramco, the oil group that made its name in central Asia, gave up on the Seven Heads gas development and sold out to Marathon.Shell’s involvement in Ireland has also been troubled. The Corrib field off the coast of Mayo is forecast one day to supply 60 per cent of Ireland’s gas demand and is due onstream next year and should be highly profitable. “A real barn burner”, says Niall Trimble, managing director of the Energy Contract Company consultancy.But the project is running several years late after Shell and partners were forced to alter the onshore pipeline route due to local protests, a high-profile security presence, jailing of opponents of the project and arson claims.Providence’s Irish assets fall into two categories. First, there is the Celtic Sea where the task is to remove the risk from known resources, proving them to have the volume, quality and accessibility that justify investment. Second, there is exploration acreage in the vast expanses off the west coast of Ireland, where the cost of work is high, the chances of success much lower but the potential rewards enormous.Providence will drill two appraisal wells in the Celtic Sea in August. These wells on the Hook Head and Dunmore fields are part of the risk removing process. Wells drilled there by Providence last year found hydrocarbons so the risks are mitigated. Nonetheless, Providence’s €43m (£34m) exposure to drilling costs is huge.In three of its four west coast licences Providence has brought in ExxonMobil as a majority partner. Industry analysts share Mr O’Reilly’s optimism that Exxon may sanction the drilling of a well shortly, although the US company will not confirm this.On the fourth licence area, Marathon made a discovery named Spanish Point in 1981. That has been reassigned to Providence, which hopes to farm out part of its stake, bringing in a partner to share the costs and potential profits, and get further drilling under way in 2009.Other big oil groups are also contributing to the hubbub. Andrew Slessor and Andrew Harwood, oil analysts at Wood Mackenzie, say that with four wells planned by Italy’s Eni, Norway’s Statoil and Shell the west coast of Ireland is seeing more activity than for years. “But,” they caution, “that is four wells over a vast area with a very low success rate.”
115;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2008-06-17T20:54:52Z;Goldman chills Wall Street with warnings;;New York stocks fell on Tuesday as Goldman Sachs both soothed and spooked markets, with second-quarter results that handily beat expectations while its analysts argued that continuing losses and writedowns may force US banks to raise $65bn of extra capital.Goldman said profits fell 11 per cent to $2.09bn, but that was well ahead of consensus estimates as gains in commodities and prime brokerage offset losses elsewhere.The results had little impact on the broader financial sector, however. It slipped 2.9 per cent after a number of analysts, including some at Goldman, wrote downbeat notes on investment banks and cut their targets for regional banks.Analysts at Strategas Research said: “We find it difficult to envision how the majors will be able to put the earnings machine back together in the near-term and therefore it is not time to wade back into the investment banks.”The latest batch of data on housing, industrial production and inflation also weighed on sentiment.Housing starts fell 3.3 per cent to a 975,000 annual rate in May, knocking the S&P 500 homebuilding index down 1.4 per cent.New figures on industrial production also made for sober reading. Large industrials such as Boeingfell back after the Federal Reserve said production slipped 0.2 per cent in May.Meanwhile, the Producer Price Index, a key inflation measure,jumped by a higher-than-expected 1.4 per cent in May due to surging energy prices, although core inflation moderated as forecast.Financial markets have suffered in recent weeks as rising inflation has stirred fears that the Fed will start raising interest rates.However, some remain optimistic on the outlook for monetary policy and equities. David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: “We continue to expect that in an environment of increased uncertainty, US equities will outperform. The hawkish noises from the Fed seem to us much more an exercise in expectations management than a warning of an imminent tightening.”The S&P 500 closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,350.93, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent lower at 12,160.30. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,457.73.Financials were in focus again on Tuesday after the Goldman results. Of the leading brokerages, Goldman has stood up best to the credit crunch. So far this year its share price has lost about 16 per cent of its value compared with a 29.3 per cent loss for the S&P 500 investment banking index.Goldman shares fell 1.5 per cent to $179.44 on Tuesday while its peers for the most part dropped back. Bank of America lost 3.6 per cent to $29.24 and Lehman dropped 7.6 per cent to $25.14.Zions Bancorp was the biggest sector faller, tumbling 8.6 per cent to $33.97,. The Salt Lake City-based lender was pummelled after it said further increases in bad loans were “likely”.In the consumer discretionary sector, data showing a small increase in weekly chain store sales initially boosted retailers. Analysts attributed the gains to demand for hot weather merchandise, Father’s Day shopping and federal tax rebates.Gap shares rose 0.3 per cent to $18, while Coach added 0.1 per cent to $33.37. But disappointing results from Best Buy and poor appliance sales data for May, which hit Whirlpool, helped drag the sector down 1.3 per cent. Best Buy fell 5.3 per cent to $43.46 and Whirlpool dropped 3.5 per cent to $66.03.Homebuilders and industrials also came under pressure. Lennar dropped 4 per cent to $15.28 and KB Home lost 3.5 per cent to $18.34, while United Technologies gave up 0.7 per cent to $68.41 and Boeing fell 0.9 per cent to $74.38.Commodity-related stocks were among the few gainers. Energy rose 1.7 per cent as refiners bounced back and bid speculation pushed shares in Marathon Oil3.1 per cent higher to $53.07. Materials added 0.2 per cent, led by Monsanto, which gained 5 per cent to $142.69.The healthcare sector initially made ground after Elan said its experimental Alzheimer’s drug helped some patients. Elan shares added 10.7 per cent to $30, while Wyeth, Elan’s US partner, rose 4.8 per cent to $45.16.But losses for healthcare providers swamped those gains. Humana dropped 3.3 per cent to $44.87.

Energy companies rem­ained a weak spot, however, as corporate earnings disappointed.The S&P 500 closed up 1.7 per cent at 1,378.47 having initially fallen 1.6 per cent. The index fell 6.1 per cent in January, its worst start in 18 years.The S&P homebuilder index enjoyed a particularly strong bounce on Thursday, rising 11.6 per cent as investors cheered Pulte Homes‘ improved liquidity position. Its shares jumped more than 20 per cent to $16.32.The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared more than more than 450 points from its session low to close up 1.7 per cent at 12,650.36. The Nasdaq Composite also gained 1.7 per cent to 2,389.86.“[The rebound] is primarily due to MBIA. There’s a lot of short covering, especially in the homebuilders,” said Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets.Stocks hit the skids in early trading after a sharp spike in weekly claims for un­employment benefit, which jumped 69,000 to 375,000, the highest level since October 2005, unsettled investor. Economists had expected about 320,000.Although these numbers are often volatile and may have been affected by the timing of a public holiday, the uptick will renew concerns that Friday’s employment report may not be as strong as hoped. Morgan Stanley cut its payrolls forecast to 90,000 from 110,000, still significantly more than than December’s 18,000.The bond insurance sector once again dominated market chatter as MBIA reported a $2.3bn fourth-quarter loss after writing down $3.5bn of credit derivatives. But the shares rallied 11 per cent to $15.50 after its chief executive said the company was best positioned to avoid a rating downgrade. Ambac Financial, a rival, climbed 6.8 per cent to $11.59.If bond insurance losses can be contained and earnings visibility increases, many analysts think the beaten-down S&P financial sector, up 2.7 per cent on Thursday, could become an attractive investment.Mastercard, rose 11.2 per cent to $210.09 on Thursday after fourth quarter earnings jumped nearly seven-fold. Meanwhile Bank of America rose 4.7 per cent to $44.18 after a hedge fund said it was seeking to block its takeover of Countrywide Financial, the mortgage lender.Investors also bought battered consumer stocks, spurring a 4.4 per cent jump on the S&P retail index. A Deutsche Bank analyst upgraded the broadline retail sector to “neutral” from “cautious” and said said “the worst will soon be behind us”. Bear Stearns upgraded Nordstrom’s sharesprompting a gain of 5.4 per cent to $38.85.But mixed earnings and the slowdown in consumer spending underscored the riskiness of calling a bottom in the retail stocks. Personal spending rose 0.2 per cent in December, its slowest pace in six months/Procter & Gamble, up 0.7 per cent at $65.56, increased fiscal second-quarter earnings 14 per cent and the company raised its full-year outlook.Burger King, up 2.9 per cent at $46.51, also beat estimates as second-quarter profit jumped 29 per cent. Mattel rose 10.9 per cent to $21.01 after beating quarterly profit forecasts.In contrast, Starbucks’ cautious outlook for 2008 unnerved investors. The shares fell 1.6 per cent to $18.91.After the close Google‘s fourth quarter profit missed expectations causing the shares, which closed up 2.9 per cent at $564.30, to slump 8.1 per cent.Adobe Systems fell 2.8 per cent to $34.93 yesterday after Jefferies & Co. downgraded it from “buy” to “underperform”.In energy, Cameron International dropped 6.9 per cent to $40.10 after the oil services company gavea weaker-than-expected earnings guidance. Marathon Oil’s fourth-quarter earnings fell 38 per cent as refining margins weakened and its shares shed 7.3 per cent to $47.21.
117;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2007-10-11T20:36:40Z;Backlash against carbon capture plan;;Several energy groups led by Centrica are preparing to challenge a government plan for subsidising low-emission power generation, accusing ministers of poor consultation and potentially wasting taxpayers’ money.John Hutton, the business and enterprise secretary, announced on Tuesday that the government would subsidise only one “carbon capture and storage” power plant, to be chosen through a competition among energy suppliers.However, he drew fierce criticism from sections of the industry and the carbon markets by stipulating that the support would be awarded only to companies using “post-combustion” carbon capture techniques at a coal-fired plant. The result is that many companies’ plans have been suddenly made ineligible.The method requires carbon dioxide to be separated from the flue gas produced when fossil fuels are burnt to generate electricity. A chemical solvent is used to take out the carbon dioxide, by a well-established industrial process.An alternative method, rejected by the government, is to capture carbon dioxide pre-combustion, using technology called integrated gasification combined cycle.This requires the fuel to be combined with oxygen, air or steam, to produce a gas consisting mainly of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.A reaction between carbon monoxide and steam then produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide, which is separated off.Mr Hutton said coal had been chosen as the fuel with which to demonstrate the project because it was abundant but dirty.A spokesman said the technology was the most easily retrofitted to existing power stations, particularly in developing countries such as China.He added that the US and Norway were working on different technologies, so it made sense for the UK to choose its own route.But Ian Temperton, managing directory of the advisory unit at Climate Change Capital, an independent investment bank specialising in climate issues, said the government had made a mistake in picking a technology winner.“We think that the government’s decision to back only a post-combustion carbon and capture power plant is wrong. The government is basically telling power companies that they can keep building conventional high- emitting coal plant and that the taxpayer will bail them out.”Energy companies whose carbon capture projects are now not eligible for subsidies were on Thursday preparing to mount a challenge to the government’s decision.Centrica, owner of British Gas, is leading the formation of an industry group to oppose the policy, which is expected to include Shell, Marathon Oil, ConocoPhilips, BP, Scottish and Southern Energy, and Richard Budge’s Powerfuel group, as well as Climate Change Capital and Greenpeace.Nick Luff, Centrica finance director, was last night due to raise the issue with Mr Hutton at a dinner, and top executives of the energy companies are planning to meet over the weekend to discuss what form the challenge will take.Centrica accuses the government of not consulting energy companies properly before making its decision and says that funding post-combustion projects is not the best use of taxpayers’ money.“Excluding pre-combustion capture technology in favour of post-combustion capture technology means bypassing a cheaper method for capturing carbon that will have more international application in favour of a technology largely used to retrofit existing coal plant,” said Jake Ulrich, managing director of Centrica Energy.Centrica was planning to put forward its £1bn pre-combustion capture project on Teesside, but said that without government funding there was “a question mark over the economics of this project”.Scottish and Southern Energy, Powerfuel and Eon have all been working on pre-combustion carbon capture projects that now look in doubt. Scottish and Southern said it would encourage the government to review its decision “to ensure that the scope of the competition allows the maximum possible participation”.
118;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2007-09-18T22:07:43Z;Big oil’s waiting game over Iraq’s reserves;;"In Iraq, oil companies face a dilemma. They can wait for the central government in Baghdad to agree a new oil law that will give them a legal framework in which they can operate, and for the security situation to become manageable.Or they can press ahead and sign agreements with the Kurdistan Regional Government, the authority in the autonomous north of Iraq, at the risk of souring relations with Baghdad and shutting themselves out of deals in the rest of the country.It is a decision that has so far divided the smaller operators from the majors.In Iraqi Kurdistan, the companies that are active include DNO – which has produced the first oil from a new source in Iraq since the invasion of 2003 – Addax, Dana Gas, Sterling Energy and Western Oil Sands, which is spinning off
its activities in the region as part of its takeover by Marathon.Most recently, they have been joined by Hunt Oil, a privately held US independent, which this month signed a deal to explore in Kurdistan.The majors, on the other hand, have been conspicuous by their absence, aware that Iraq’s central government does not recognise the legality of agreements signed with the KRG.Hussain al-Shahristani, Iraq’s oil minister, said recently about Hunt Oil’s deal: “All these contracts have to be approved by the Federal Authority before they are legal . . . This was not presented for approval; it has no standing.’’Only 3 per cent of Iraq’s vast reserves of oil and gas are in Kurdistan, and while the minnows of the oil world might be able to make a good business out of 3 per cent of Iraq’s reserves, the big fish want access to the remaining 97 per cent.That is why the majors that are interested in Iraq, including Total and Chevron – which plan to collaborate in the country – and Royal Dutch Shell, are all working with the government in Baghdad.While they wait for contracts to be offered, the majors are building relationships, training engineers and carrying out technical studies for free, in preparation for the day when they might be able to operate.The question is how long their patience will last. The level of violence is still unacceptably high, and the oil law is stuck in parliament. If anything, the prospect of agreement appears to be receding as tensions between the parties grow.If the political situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate, there may come a time when the majors decide it is better to have 3 per cent of a large amount than 97 per cent of nothing.Last week, the US commercial officer in Iraq said Hunt Oil was “smart” for becoming the first US oil company to sign a high-
profile exploration and production deal in Iraq, even though the deal was with the KRG.He was careful, however, not to suggest that other US oil companies should follow the Hunt model, saying: “I can’t recommend that as a US government official.”DNO said last month it had rejected an offer of $700m from an unnamed international oil company for its Kurdistan assets. The identity of the bidder remains unknown, but the offer is a sign that at least one major has given up on the strategy of getting close to the Baghdad government.Mr al-Shahristani, the oil minister, suggested recently that some contracts could be offered before the oil law is signed. But even if there are deals on the table, concerns
about security will be a powerful deterrent to potential partners.It looks as though the majors will have to keep waiting for Iraq for some time to come."
119;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2007-08-02T00:01:32Z;Marathon settles price manipulation case;;A unit of Marathon Oil on Wednesday settled with federal regulators in a case alleging that the fourth-largest US oil company attempted to manipulate the price of crude oil.The case, brought by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is the first time the futures regulator has brought an action involving alleged manipulation of crude oil prices since 1979.It is a sign of the CFTC’s concern that oil prices, this week at record highs, may be vulnerable to manipulation by oil companies using their market power to influence the prices set by specialist energy indices that are relied upon by oil shippers and traders as pricing benchmarks.Some lawmakers in the US Congress have also in recent weeks sounded alarm over apparent gaps in the way some energy derivatives are regulated that could make manipulation easier.The Marathon case involves an alleged attempt to take advantage of a 30-minute window of physical crude trading that takes place after the close of futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.The window is where deals are done bilaterally between traders in physical crude after the close of trading in Nymex’s flagship West Texas Intermediate crude futures contract.It has become a significant part of the markets because it is used to calculate a pricing index published by Platts, an energy publisher, that is in turn widely relied upon by crude oil shippers and oil companies to set prices.Kathleen Tanzy, a Platts spokeswoman, said: ”Platts has rigorous guidelines for the data accepted for Platts’ price assessments. These guidelines are designed to protect the integrity of our indices.”Indices such as Platts are not subject to any regulation. Their publishers argue that they should not be regulated because they are subject to the same constitutional protections as news media and other information providers.However the CFTC is concerned that trading in the Platts window, particularly in the final minutes before it closes, could be manipulated by large oil companies as a way of affecting the outcome of the price of WTI.Gregory Mocek, the CFTC’s head of enforcement, told the Financial Times: ”Irrespective of the flavour of commodity, all traders who attempt to manipulate indexes should be cautious. Although indexes may be unregulated, we will aggressively use our authority to find illegal conduct.”In an order, the CFTC found that on November 26 2003, a trader at Marathon Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of Marathon Oil, “attempted to manipulate a price of WTI by attempting to influence downward the Platts market assessment [index] for spot cash WTI”.Marathon was at the time a net purchaser of crude oil in the market because its own production was not high enough to meet demand from its customers. It was relying on purchases of foreign crude oil shipped into the US, prices for which routinely are priced off the Platts index.Marathon owns about six per cent of the total crude oil refining capacity in the US, according to the CFTC.The CFTC claimed Marathon had “knowingly offered to sell spot cash WTI through the prevailing bid at a price level calculated to influence downward the Platts WTI assessment”. The outcome would have been to lower the price Marathon would pay for incoming shipments of crude.Mr Mocek said: “West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices have an enormous impact on the daily lives of American citizens. As the guardian of the nation’s commodity markets, this case is yet another signal to the markets that we hold all companies accountable for their trading activities.”Marathon agreed to pay a civil penalty to settle the CFTC’s findings. “Without admitting or denying the CFTC’s findings, MPC agreed to pay $1m to settle the matter,” the company said in a statement. “Marathon’s decision to settle was based on a number of factors, including the desire to avoid the expense and distraction of protracted litigation.”The case is the first that the CFTC has pursued in court involving allegations of manipulation in the “Platts window.”Mr Mocek hinted that further action could be possible, saying the CFTC was ”looking at a number of other companies that trade in the Platts window”.The CFTC’s action comes amid a flurry of enforcement cases brought in recent weeks by the regulator at a time of heightened concern in Washington that energy prices are vulnerable to manipulation.Last week, four such cases emerged from the CFTC and the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, which regulates inter-state oil, natural gas and electricity transmission.Both agencies charged hedge fund Amaranth and Energy Transfer Partners, a large Texas-based operator of natural gas pipelines, with attempting to manipulate physical natural gas markets.A congressional report co-authored last month by senators Carl Levin and Norm Coleman claimed that millions of consumers were hit with abnormally high gas prices as a result of “excessive speculation” in natural gas contracts last year by hedge fund Amaranth.A lawyer for Amaranth has said there is no evidence that Amaranth tried to manipulate the markets.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 13,136.14, a new record close.The major talking point among investors was Dow Jones, which soared to its highest level in four years after News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, launched a hostile $60-a-share bid for the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. Late on Tuesday, the Bancroft family, who control Dow Jones via a dual shareholder structure, rejected the proposal.Dow Jones gained 54.7 per cent to close at $56.20, down from a high of $57.88 earlier in the day. On Monday, volume in call options, mainly priced at $45 a share, soared by almost seven times.While News Corp slid 4.2 per cent to $22.99, shares in the New York Times jumped 5 per cent to $24.58, the Washington Post rose 2.9 per cent to $765.30 and Gannett rose 2 per cent to $58.17. Shares in Pearson, the publisher of the Financial Times rose 5.6 per cent to $18.01, the highest level in five years.As the first-quarter earnings season continued on Tuesday, analysts said better- than-expected results aug­ured well for the overall market. Recent weakness in the dollar was also playing a crucial part in boosting the appeal of internationally focused companies.“There have been some stellar results from Wall Street but also strong results from companies with foreign operations” [boosted by] “strong growth in the global economy . . . lower tax rates and a weaker dollar,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “The US market looks to be enjoying respectable earnings growth, sustained by robust global growth and the prospect of falling interest rates, caused by soft onshore growth.”While the weaker dollar has helped boost large-cap stocks, analysts said currency bears were watching for any shift in the attitude of foreign investors. While the S&P is up 4.8 per cent this year in dollar terms, the rise is only 1.55 per cent for euro-based investors.“There is a danger that we reach a tipping point with foreign investors if the dollar continues to decline,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “If the dollar goes significantly lower, it could become precarious for stocks.”In earnings news on Tuesday, Liz Claiborne reported a 65 per cent plunge in first-quarter net profit and said that 2007 earnings would fall well below analysts’ expectations. The clothing retailer fell 17.3 per cent to $37.Procter & Gamble reported a 13.6 per cent rise in quarterly profit and raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast. Its shares fell 2.2 per cent to $62.96, after a rise of 2.25 per cent on Monday.Archer Daniels Midland said its fiscal third-quarter earnings increased 4 per cent and shares in the largest US ethanol producer fell 5.4 per cent to $36.60 as results missed analysts’ expectations.Avon Products came calling with a near-tripling in fiscal third-quarter earnings from the same period last year. Its shares rose 2.8 per cent to $40.93.Another company reporting a near-threefold rise in first-quarter profit was Qwest Communications, whose results were boosted by lower costs and higher take-up of bundled services – such as telephone, television, high-speed internet and wireless services – by customers. Shares in Qwest rose by 2.6 per cent to $9.11.Shares in Centex rose 3.8 per cent to $46.46 after the homebuilder said fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell 49 per cent, owing to a drop in home sales in what the company called one of the most difficult markets in 25 years.Masco said its first-quarter earnings fell 30 per cent as the slump in housing soured demand for home improvements.Shares jumped 9.5 per cent to $29.80 as the results were better than forecast.Marathon Oil reported a decline in first-quarter earnings to $717m from a year-ago profit of $784m, but the result was above expect­ations. Its shares fell 0.3 per cent to $101.27, down from a high of $103.02 earlier in the day.
121;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2007-02-18T22:08:23Z;Oil industry ready to gamble on alternative energy;;Miles from the nearest port, pipeline or airstrip, dense black oil emerges from a small stream near Bemolanga, in central Madagascar. Few people – even those in the energy industry – connect the Indian Ocean island with crude oil, but that will change in the next 15 years as the hunt for unconventional resources intensifies.Extracting and refining unconventional oil and natural gas, such as the goo emerging in Madagascar, uses large amounts of energy. Nevertheless, from 2020 such extraction will be critical to the world’s economic health.By that time, most of the globe’s easily accessible oilfields will be in decline. Production growth will keep up with demand only if fields such as Madagascar Oil’s Bemolanga are tapped.Wood Mackenzie, the consultant, estimates the world holds such vast amounts of difficult-to-extract oil and gas that it undermines the argument the planet is running out of hydrocarbons.But not all of Wood Mackenzie’s findings are so comforting. Its calculations show the transition to unconventional oil is coming more quickly than many had expected. Whether the shift will be smooth is far from certain.Companies face massive challenges in extracting such hydrocarbons. In the case of Madagascar, the hurdles that have yet to be overcome include the remoteness of the fields, quickly-eroding ground that makes road construction difficult, and the environmental implications.Oil prices would have to remain at about $60 a barrel to make a decent profit on the investment.Analysts at Sanford Bernstein, the financial services group, say ExxonMobil, Marathon and Chevron of the US, and Europe’s Royal Dutch Shell and BG are making the bet. More than 30 per cent of their production will come from unconventional oil and gas by 2020.International oil executives in China say they are being approached to import more heavy oil into the country while simultaneously exploring ways to extract the sizeable unconventional oil and gas resources within China’s borders.Extracting extra heavy oil profitably is possible, as illustrated by the Alberta oil sand rush, but turning the tar-like substance into liquid uses a lot of natural gas and industry is worried that it will run out before the heavy oil does.Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s president, has seized control of the Orinoco tar belt projects, making their future far less certain. But heavy and extra heavy oil are not the only unconventional global resources.Shale oil and gas hydrates account for most of the world’s unconventional reserves and require significant technological breakthroughs before they can be exploited. As in Madagascar, the remoteness and environmental sensitivity of many reserves pose problems.But judging from Madagascar’s hotel lobbies, where frontier oil cowboys are being replaced by big-energy executives, the industry believes it is up to the challenge.

The S&P 500 has returned 7 per cent, while the Nasdaq remains a laggard, gaining 2.4 per cent.Heavy machinery makers made strong gains on the week.

Releases included revised gross domestic product figures, consumer confidence and consumer spending figures, and minutes from the Federal Reserve’s August meeting showing that Fed members believed inflation would slowly decline. Markets responded nervously, trading in and out of negative territory on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.But there was an unambiguous reaction to Friday’s jobs report, which showed payrolls rising fractionally more than expected in August, prompting a rally.“I don’t know what’s not to like [about the week’s data],” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.“There are some pretty good employment and spending numbers. It’s about as solid as you’re going to get.”Crude oil sold off during the week, at one point dipping to a 10-week low of $68.45, as fear premiums were unwound when traders realised that tropical storm Ernesto would hit Florida and not oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.The crude slump was felt acutely by energy stocks, which made up seven of the week’s 10 worst performing stocks in the S&P 500.Refiners were hard hit, and the S&P Oil and Gas Refining and Marketing index fell 7.1 per cent, its worst week since February.Marathon Oil sank 7.7 per cent to $84.99 and Sunoco lost 6.1 per cent to $72.60.Semiconductors, on the other hand, made broad advances.PMC Sierra gained 9.6 per cent to $6.72, and LSI Logic rose 7.4 per cent to $8.01.

Volume is not explosive, and it isn’t an extraordinary move across key sectors,” he said.Consumer stocks gained as investors bet lower oil prices would buoy consumer spending, while robust August sales figures from Wal-Mart fuelled fresh hopes of resilience in the consumer sector.Toymaker Mattel rose 4.6 per cent to $18.73, and casino operator Las Vegas Sands jumped 4.6 per cent to $69.30.Airlines were also boosted by the fall in oil prices.

Durable goods orders in the month also fell more than forecast, adding to gloom over prospects for economic growth.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said the market had made the switch from welcoming poor economic news – because it lessened the chance of rate hikes – to fearing such news because it heralded a slowdown.“We’ve gotten to the inflexion point where bad news is back to being bad news,” he said.The home sales fall was felt acutely by home improvement retailer Lowe’s, which tumbled after it reported second-quarter profits that fell short of expectations, and lowered its full-year sales guidance.

133;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
134;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2006-05-23T20:43:36Z;Wall Street slides in late trading;;Wall Street turned sharply lower in the last hour on Tuesday erasing gains made earlier in the day. A rise in the price of oil and metals had given momentum to energy and mining stocks, while homebuilders also climbed.“Very simply, the recovery was extremely unimpressive,” said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Associates “It was based on low volume, and was uninspiring. There was no clear signal today that the market had found a bottom.”“It’s got bear market written all over it,” said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak.Stronger demand for oil sent crude prices rising. Marathon, an oil producer, added 2.4 per cent to $74.17. Valero, an oil refiner, rose 2.8 per cent to $58.69, more than making up for Monday’s losses, which were caused by a refinery fire.Metals also rode a rally, and on Nymex, copper trading had to be suspended for 15 minutes as prices leapt by more than 5 per cent.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent, or 26.98 points, to 11,098.35.Heinz climbed 5 per cent to $42.98 after an activist shareholder group led by Nelson Peltz called on the food group to cut costs and increase share buy-backs in a plan that could double the share price.

The three have fallen by between 27 and 36 per cent since mid-January on fears that rising rates would hurt the construction sector.Sun Microsystems was less robust, falling 5.5 per cent to $4.29 after investors were told the company was ready to “re-size” by cutting costs and shedding jobs.Adobe Systems lost 3 per cent to $29.02 as it insisted that a tool for creating PDF files in Microsoft’s next version of Office would not hurt sales.

135;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2006-05-17T23:12:26Z;Morgan Stanley shifts energy investment team;;Morgan Stanley on Wednesday moved to strengthen its energy investment banking team, moving one of its top bankers to Houston from New York and hiring two more amid a dealmaking boom brought on by high commodity prices.In an internal memorandum obtained by the Financial Times, Morgan Stanley said that Thomas Langford, who last year advised Unocal on the takeover battle between China’s CNOOC and Chevron of the US, would relocate from New York to Houston to become head of investment banking for the southwest region.In addition, Mr Langford, who last year worked on the $35bn merger of ConocoPhillips with Burlington Resources, and this week advised on Marathon Oil’s sale of its Russian assets to Lukoil, will keep the title of co-head of energy investment banking.In a separate memo, Morgan Stanley revealed that it had hired Peter Bowden, a former corporate lawyer at Andrew Kurth, and Ryan Moss, a UBS banker, to join its global energy group based in Houston.Mr Langford’s move and the two additions reflect an attempt by Morgan Stanley to bolster its commitment to energy banking at a time when high commodity prices are leading to a string of initial public offerings in the industry.In addition, there have been a number of large corporate takeovers, although that activity has been limited by buyers’ unwillingness to pay high valuations for companies.“The decision to relocate one of our most senior energy investment bankers to Houston demonstrates our commitment to our regional client base,” the internal memo said.In his new role, Mr Langford will be taking over from Michael Dee, who will remain at Morgan Stanley with different responsibilities.After losing a number of senior dealmakers, including Joseph Perella and Paulo Pereira, in the wake of last year’s executive turmoil, Morgan Stanley has recently announced a number of high-profile hires to help fill the gap.These include Christopher Carter, a former senior investment banking executive at Credit Suisse, who will be based in London, and Robert Kindler, the former global head of mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase, who will be based in New York.As adviser to Unocal last year, Mr Langford had to help the company’s board make the difficult decision between sticking with a lower takeover offer from Chevron and embracing a higher bid from CNOOC.In the end, Unocal continued to support Chevron’s bid, which was revised only slightly higher during the takeover battle on the grounds that it was less risky from a regulatory perspective.The prospect of a state-owned Chinese company taking control of a large US oil group elicited strong political opposition from many US politicians, even though most of Unocal’s assets were in Asia.
136;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2006-03-24T21:56:14Z;Rates prospects give stocks impetus;;The prospect of US interest rates peaking sooner than expected provided stocks on Wall Street with a boost on Friday.A government report showing that sales of new homes in February recorded their biggest drop in nine years helped equities rally as investors reasoned that the Federal Reserve might take a less hawkish view on interest rates.The news came at the end of a mixed week on Wall Street in which stocks failed to extend their recent bull run as any advances in the main indices were pegged back by ongoing rate concerns.This was in spite of continuing good news on the corporate earnings front, with profits from both Nike, up 0.6 per cent to $85.96, and Morgan Stanley, 2 per cent higher at $61.47, beating analysts’ expectations.Better-than-forecast quarterly profits and guidance sent shares in contract electronics maker Jabil Circuit up 12.5 per cent to a five-year high of $42.72.“The market wants to put interest rates on the back burner,” said Marc Pado, US market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “On days when we can avoid looking at them, the market forges ahead.”It was hard for investors to avoid the subject during a week in which Ben Bernanke gave his first big speech as Fed chairman and seemed to quell hopes for a quick halt to the current US rate-tightening cycle.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 11,279.97, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 1,302.96 while the Nasdaq put in the best performance of the three main indices, rising 0.6 per cent to 2,312.82, helped by a sparkling performance from internet search company Google.Over the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent and the S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent.Investors had their eyes on energy stocks, which rose and fell in response to falling and rising crude prices.The Amex oil index ended the week 0.6 per cent lower, although Marathon Oil rose 1.2 per cent to $77.30 and ConocoPhillips added 0.7 per cent to $61.76 after being upgraded by Prudential Equity Group.General Motors rose 7.2 per cent to $22.65 as the ailing carmaker announced cost-saving deals with the United Auto Workers union and carparts supplier Delphi, and sold a majority stake in its property-finance arm, GMAC Commercial Holding, in a deal valued at $9bn.Shares in Wal-Mart gained 3.2 per cent to $48.19, hitting their highest level this year amid reports that the retailer was set to announce a significant expansion of its Chinese operations.Bristol Myers Squibb advanced after the company settled a patent dispute with a Canadian drugmaker over its Plavix blood-thinning treatment.The deal prompted a flurry of broker upgrades and helped the stock climb 11.3 per cent to $25.52.Technology stocks hit a rough patch this week after Microsoft announced late on Tuesday that the finished consumer version of its Vista operating system would not be available until next year. Although the latest hold-up represents only a small setback after two years of delays, the move dealt a potentially damaging blow to sales of PC makers during the crucial holiday shopping season.Microsoft ended the week 1.8 per cent lower at $27.01 while shares in computer makers Gateway and Hewlett-Packard fell 1.7 per cent to $2.38 and 2.9 per cent to $33.17 respectively.Dell, which said on Tuesday it expected sales growth to outpace the wider market as a result of expansion in Asia, bucked the falling trend. Its shares rose 3.4 per cent to $30.06 on the week.Google shares also made progress, rallying 7.7 per cent to $365.80 after Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, said it would add the internet search group to its benchmark S&P 500 index.Demand for Google surged as fund managers whose strategies rely on tracking the benchmark index rushed to add the stock to their portfolios.Elsewhere in the sector, Yahoo gained 5.7 per cent to $31.77 after UBS upgraded the stock on valuation grounds.Lucent Technology rose 5.5 per cent to $3.06 on the week after the telecommunications equipment maker confirmed that it was in merger talks with Alcatel, of France.

Energy producers moved higher after Prudential Equity Group upgraded Marathon Oil and ConocoPhillips as part of a review of the sector.Marathon climbed 1.1 per cent to $77.11 and Conoco rose 1.1 per cent to $61.12.Internet portal Yahoo was among the few rising stocks in the technology sector. Its shares jumped 3.5 per cent to $31.83 after UBS upgraded it from “neutral” to “buy” on valuation grounds.Adobe Systems, the computer software maker, slid 0.8 per cent to $36.33 after it warned that sales this quarter would be between $640m to $670m, short of the market expectations.PC makers were still under pressure after Microsoft’s decision on Tuesday to delay the launch of its new operating system. Microsoft, which lost more than 2 per cent on Wednesday, shed 1.1 per cent to $26.85.

Analysts said that without the one-off costs, the company had beaten expectations.Better than expected quarterly profit and earnings guidance sent shares in Jabil Circuit, a contract electronics maker, to a five-year high of $42.75, up 11.8 per cent.General Motors, which sold a majority stake in its financing arm GMAC Commerical Holding in a deal valued at $9bn, ended a choppy session almost unchanged at $22.00.

After racking up three consecutive days of gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its advance yesterday, rising 0.2 per cent to close at 11,279.65.The S&P 500, which broke through the 1,300 mark on Wednesday for the first time since May 2001, edged up another 0.2 per cent to 1,307.25 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to settle at 2,306.48.This took the weekly gain for the Dow to 1.8 per cent, for the S&P to 2 per cent and for the Nasdaq to 2 per cent.The week produced record quarterly figures from Wall Street’s top investment banks, which defied expectations that their trading businesses would suffer as US short-term interest rates increased.Goldman Sachs set the bar for its peers on Tuesday as it delivered first-quarter net profits 50 per cent ahead of analyst forecasts.The stellar performance was followed by Lehman Brothers, which unveiled a 24 per cent jump in quarterly earnings and Bear Stearns, which reported a
34 per cent earnings increase on the back of strong performances in trading, derivatives, investment banking and wealth management.Brad Hintz, analyst at Bernstein Research, said he expected merchant banking “to remain an exceptional business in 2006”.Goldman Sachs ended the week 6.2 per cent higher at $150.36, while Lehman and Bear Stearns inched up 0.5 per cent to $142.80 and 0.5 per cent to $132.87 respectively, having seen their gains pared by profit-taking.Investment banks were not the only ones doing brisk business. Charles Schwab shot up 11 per cent to $18.13 after the discount broker issued a bullish first-quarter forecast, saying client trade was up 52 per cent last month, compared with the same period a year before.Railroad stocks also chugged ahead after Union Pacific, the largest US rail operator, raised first-quarter profit guidance by 20 per cent, and CSX, the third-
biggest, was upgraded by analysts at UBS.Separately, Merrill Lynch raised its price estimates on Union and four other rail companies, saying railroads had benefited from increased shipping of commodities such as coal.The Dow Jones transportation index gained 2.2 per cent for the week. The S&P railroads index jumped 6.2 per cent, led by Union, up 6.2 per cent to $91.07 and CSX, up 7.6 per cent to $59.46.Energy stocks had a lacklustre start to the week, thanks to data which revealed rising crude inventory levels in the US. However, that news was overshadowed by mounting tensions in Iraq.The announcement by the US military of the start of “Operation Swarmer” – the largest aerial bombing campaign since the 2003 invasion – saw traders rush to cover short positions.Heavyweight oil stocks felt the benefit of heightened worries over the sustainability of crude supplies, with ExxonMobil climbing 3.2 per cent to $61.05, Chevron up 5.7 per cent to $57.18 and Marathon Oil putting on
9.9 per cent to $76.36.The upswing in crude prices weighed on chipmakers. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, which tumbled 3.2 per cent on Thursday, ended the week with a loss of 1.2 per cent. Advanced Micro Devices led the way with a 7.3 per cent fall to $33.95 as investors exited the sector to jump on the energy bandwagon.Merrill Lynch said it believed investors were factoring in the reality that there was little additional volume growth upside or margin leverage left in the semiconductor sector.North Fork Bancorp climbed 14.8 per cent to $29.10 after credit card issuer Capital One Financial said it had agreed to buy the company in a $14.6bn cash-and-shares deal. Calyon Securities said the deal came as a surprise, but it was a good acquisition at a reasonable price. Shares in Capital One fell 8.9 per cent to $81.90.General Motors, which tumbled nearly 5 per cent yesterday after announcing 2005 losses were $2bn deeper than previously thought, ended the week 2.4 per cent lower at $21.13."
139;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2006-02-15T21:46:38Z;Wall St higher as Bernanke upbeat on economy;;Wall Street moved higher on Wednesday as investors mulled over Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s first congressional testimony and weighed risks of higher interest rates and continued economic expansion.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3 per cent higher at 11,058.97, the S&P 500 added 0.4 per cent to 1,280, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,276.43.Merrill Lynch moved higher after it said it had agreed to merge its investment management division with BlackRock to form a company with about $1,000bn in assets under management.Shares in Merrill added 0.2 per cent to $75.30 while BlackRock, the name under which the new company will trade, rose 3.6 per cent to $151.25.Merrill recommended other financial stocks to investors, with upgrades to Bank of New York and Bear Stearns.Bank of New York was an attractive target because of its processing and banking businesses, Merrill said. The stock was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” and gained 1.1 per cent to $33.86.Bear Stearns rose 1.6 per cent to $131.61 after Merrill raised its rating from “neutral” to “buy”. The broker said potential earnings’ growth was not reflected fully in Bear Stearns’ share price.Applied Materials, the world’s largest chip equipment maker, gained 1 per cent to $20.46 in advance of the release of its results after the close.Michael O’Brien at Bear Stearns said: “We want to remind investors that we expect the company to easily beat all guidance, and expect further share price appreciation as investors increasingly realise that the cycle has sustainability.”Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing retailer, reported a 58 per cent rise in fourth quarter profit, but the shares fell 2.1 per cent to $67.33 after the company warned full-year earnings expectations were unlikely to be met.Myers Industries, the plastics manufacturer, said currency effects hit fourth-quarter net profit, but shares leapt 7.1 per cent to $15.42 after it said it might sell non-core assets.Legg Mason Capital Management revealed in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had built up a 25 per cent stake in Eastman Kodak, making it the photographic company’s biggest shareholder. Shares in Kodak gained 6.6 per cent to $26.54.Helping lift the Dow, was a 2 per cent rise to $71.60 for Caterpillar after Canada’s Finning International, the world’s biggest dealer of Caterpillar-brand equipment, reported quarterly net income jumped 80 per cent.And Merck rose 1.8 per cent to $35.29 after it said regulators had accepted its application for review of its experimental oral diabetes treatment.Although weekly US data showed stockpiles growing, some oil stocks staged a rally, with Marathon Oil adding 1.5 per cent to $67.53 and Valero Energy gaining 1.6 per cent to $50.57.
140;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2006-01-30T22:00:36Z;Wall Street ends mixed despite Exxon gains;;"Record quarterly earnings at ExxonMobil drove shares in the oil giant higher on Monday but gains in the wider market were limited by investors’ reluctance to take on new positions ahead of the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Tuesday.“It’s a wait and see day,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “People are waiting for clues from the Fed on the future direction of interest rate hikes.”After struggling to make headway throughout much of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.1 per cent at 10,899.92, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 per cent at 1,285.20. The Nasdaq Composite also gained 0.1 per cent to 2,306.78.Oil and energy stocks were among the session’s best performers, with ExxonMobil rising 3 per cent to $63.11 after it reported a 23 per cent jump in fourth-quarter underlying profit. High oil and gas prices helped push the Dow component’s fourth-quarter net income to $10.71bn, or $1.71 a share, from $8.42bn, or $1.30 a share, earned a year ago.The results lifted shares in other energy stocks. Halliburton, whose price target was raised by analysts at UBS and Citigroup, rose 2.5 per cent to $80.86 while Marathon Oil gained 2 per cent to $76.55. Overall, the Amex oil index rose 2.3 per cent.By contrast, pharmaceutical stocks sank, with Schering-Plough, the maker of Claritin and Clarinex allergy drugs, dropping 2.5 per cent to $19.57 after it reported lower-than-expected quarterly profits.Eastman Kodak and Tyson Foods, the meat processor, also fell after reporting
disappointing fourth-quarter figures.Kodak, which is undergoing a costly and painful transition towards digital technology, lost 2.4 per cent to $25.75 while Tyson Foods, hurt by weak pork and beef sales, plunged 7.2 per cent to $14.27.However, investors were more forgiving with toymaker Mattel, which reported a slight profit decline. However the performance was still better than expected. This, combined with plans for a $250m share buyback, helped shares in the Barbie doll maker climb 6.9 per cent to $15.80.In other earning news, Wal-Mart, which had a lacklustre fourth-quarter, said it was expecting January sales to rise 4.7 per cent, better than the 3-4 per cent increase previously forecast. Its shares moved up 1.2 per cent to $46.41.On the deals front, Fairmont Hotels & Resortsrose after Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia agreed to buy the Canadian luxury hotelier for $3.9bn or $45 a share, thwarting a rival bid from corporate raider Carl Icahn. Shares in Fairmont gained 1 per cent to $44.27.Elsewhere, talk that Apple Computer might be coming out with a new line of iBook laptops as early as April helped drive the stock 4.1 per cent higher to $75."
141;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2006-01-06T10:31:48Z;BP and Libya in talks over gas project;;BP has entered into negotiations with Libya over a multi-billion dollar natural gas exploration and development deal, as the former pariah state opens up more aggressively to international oil investment.Industry insiders say the BP negotiations are at an early stage and involve a liquefied natural gas project that could supply the North American or European markets. BP confirmed it was in talks with Libya but declined to discuss details.“We are continuing to look for opportunities in Libya and when we have a substantive agreement we hope to be able to announce it,” the company said.Libya’s oil and gas sector was opened up for wider foreign investment after the crisis caused by the 1988 Lockerbie bombing was resolved and UN sanctions lifted. US businesses were also allowed to return to Libya in 2004, after the country agreed to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme.The BP negotiations follow a similar deal struck with Libya by Royal Dutch Shell, the Anglo-Dutch group, in May last year. Shell is exploring for gas in the Sirte Basin, where BP held assets before they were nationalised in the 1970s. Under its deal, Shell will also revamp a liquefaction plant in Libya and sell the LNG in the US and Europe.US companies have also been returning to the Libyan market, where they held oil production concessions that had to be surrendered to Libya in 1986 following a US bombing campaign. Conoco-Phillips, Marathon Oil and Amerada Hess last month agreed to pay Libya $1.8bn to reclaim assets in the Oasis Group following months of difficult negotiations.Last month, ExxonMobil signed an agreement with Libya to begin exploring offshore for oil and gas and will shortly begin to gather seismic data in the Cyrenaica Basin. The largest publicly-traded oil company opened an office in Tripoli for the first time in more than two decades. Analysts said any deal with Libya would be positive for BP, which is looking to further expand its LNG business. However, any deal could take many months to come to fruition and the Libyan authorities are understood to be driving a hard bargain.“From a BP perspective, Libya would provide additional supply to their portfolio and could go into some combination of the US, UK, Spain and possibly even Italy in the future,” said Frank Harris, LNG analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the consultants. BP is proposing to build two new terminals to receive LNG in the US and already has capacity at a terminal at Cove Point, Maryland. However, Mr Harris cautioned that BP and other companies exploring in Libya would have to find large enough gas deposits to feed an LNG plant.
142;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2005-11-30T21:35:15Z;Autos and banks drag Wall Street lower;;Wall Street was knocked off its feet on Wednesday after sharp losses in the auto and financial sectors dragged the indices into the red.Shares in the auto industry tumbled ahead of the sector’s November sales reports, due on Thursday. General Motors, led the fall, dropping 4.8 per cent to $21.90, followed by Ford Motor, the second largest carmaker in the US, down 4.7 per cent to $8.13. Analysts are expecting sharp sales declines for the two companies, despite heavy discounting and lower petrol prices. Both companies have been losing market share to their Asian rivals in recent years.In the wider market, news that the US gross domestic product grew at a revised 4.3 per cent annual rate in the July-to-September period, the fastest pace since the first three months of 2004, only fanned fears of inflationThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.8 per cent, or 82.29 points, at 10,805.87. The broader S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent, or 8 points, at 1,249.48. The Nasdaq Composite index was flat at 2,232.82.The slide followed Tuesday’s retreat, which came after a series of positive economic data fuelled concerns that the Fed would continue to raise interest rates.Banks and financials were the biggest drag on the S&P 500.The two sector fell as investors paused to lock in on recent gains.American Express led the fallers, dropping 1.4 per cent to $51.42 followed by Bank of America down 0.8 per cent at $45.89 and Fannie Mae, down 2.8 per cent at $48.05.“A lot of these stocks are in a situation where they have been saturated by buyers,” said Christopher Johnson, director quantative analysis at Schaeffer’s investment research.“And at the moment, investors feel more comfortable cashing in on short term gains rather than buy and hold their stocks. The mentality of the market is that a bird on one hand is much better than two in the bush.”On the Nasdaq, Yahoo was a talking point after UBS became the second broker to downgrade the internet search engine, citing valuation concerns.UBS said the stock was near its five-year high, and the company would need to execute some important initiatives before the broker could increase estimates.But there were still buyers. Shares in Yahoo fell by as much as 2.5 per cent in early trading before rebounding to trade up 0.1 per cent at $40.23.Rival Google also fell in morning trading on concern that the stock, which has soared 40 per cent in 2 months, may be overpriced. However, the stock bounced back to close up 0.3 per cent at $404.91 after a 4.7 per cent drop on Tuesday.BlackBerry maker Research In Motion was dealt another legal setback in a key patent infringement case on Wednesday, raising pressure to settle or face a possible shutdown of its U.S. mobile e-mail service. Shares fell 5.8 per cent to $61.13.Tivo, up 3.8 per cent to $5.36, recovered somewhat after its shares slumped by nearly 10 per cent in the previous session.The energy sector heavyweight Exxon-Mobil edged up 0.4 per cent to $58.54. Chevron Texaco added 0.2 per cent to $57.50. Marathon Oil was the leading gainer in the sector, rising 1.3 per cent to $59.39.Tiffany, the jewellery retailer, also struggled, dropping 3.2 per cent to $40.79 after third quarter sales fell short of expectations.Companies whose earnings are tied to the state of the economy, such as Caterpillar and Honeywell, advanced. The former moved up 0.7 per cent to $57.51 while the latter gained 0.8 per cent to $57.51.
143;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2005-09-19T20:21:56Z;Wall Street lower despite energy gains;;Oil shares on Wall Street were boosted on Monday by another rise in crude prices and news that Norway’s Norsk Hydro plans to takeover Spinnaker Exploration for $2.5bn in cash.Shares in the Houston-based Spinnaker Exploration shares swelled 31.5 per cent to $64.12 by the close on Monday.Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach & Co, described the premium as “hefty” and said more deals could follow, with the sector ripe for consolidation.The jump was part of a broader advance for energy stocks that saw Amerada Hess put on 4.3 per cent to $139.31 after JP Morgan’s Jennifer Rowland upgraded the stock and raised the sector’s earnings target.Marathon Oil rose 1.8 per cent to $69.19, while ConocoPhillips added 1.6 per cent to $70.24. ExxonMobil, the largest publicly traded oil company in the world, was up 1.4 per cent to $64.63 and became the fourth company in the S&P 500 index to reach a market capitalisation of more than $400bn. The energy sector now makes up 10 per cent of the S&P 500, for the first time since 1994.Energy stocks were fired up by a rally in crude futures amid concerns about another hurricane hitting the production capacity in the Gulf of Mexico. In late trading, prices for West Texas Intermediate for October delivery rose more than $4 to $67.39 a barrel as Tropical Storm Rita gathered strength and headed for the Gulf.Airline stocks fell amid concerns about the effects of high fuel prices on an industry plagued by cost pressures. The Amex airline index lost 3.4 per cent as AirTran, the low-cost carrier, gave up 5.7 per cent to $10.43. Continental Airlines was 6.3 per cent off at $10.98.Among other stocks in the news, Nike rose 6.4 per cent to $83.45 after its third-quarter profits beat expectations. Strong sales led to a 32 per cent jump in profits in the quarter for the athletic equipment maker.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.8 per cent lower at 10,555.80, while the broader S&P 500 index was 0.6 per cent lower at 1,231.13. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.7 per cent to 2,145.21.However, Art Hogan, chief US analyst at Jefferies, also attributed some of the fall to Friday’s 0.8 per cent rise in the Dow off the back of the expiration of September futures and options contracts. He argued that at least half such moves are typically retraced in the following session.Investors also were awaiting the outcome of a keenly watched meeting on Tuesday of the monetary policy body of the US Federal Reserve. The US central bank is widely expected to raise benchmark interest rates by a quarter point to 3.75 per cent.Mr Cardillo believed most market participants were still expecting a quarter-point hike, and argued that the market had now priced in the likelihood of the Fed holding rates at 3.5 per cent.
144;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2005-07-28T20:11:41Z;ExxonMobil production volumes disappoint;;"ExxonMobil on Thursday reported record second-quarter earnings, but analysts said even the full-throttle refining and marketing environment failed to obscure disappointing oil and gas production volumes.The world's biggest publicly listed oil and gas company reported net income of $7.6bn, up 32 per cent from a year ago.However, the consensus forecast had been for earnings per share of $1.24 per share. Excluding a $200m charge for a lawsuit provision, the company earned $1.23 a share. Exxon's shares slipped slightly to $59.49.""Oil and gas production volumes and earnings were disappointing in the quarter, but this was offset by a now-familiar bonanza in the refining and marketing division, particularly in the US,"" said Mark Flannery of Credit Suisse First Boston. ""Chemicals were also weaker than expected.""Exploration and production earnings were $4.9bn, up $1.1bn from the second quarter of 2004, as strong crude and natural gas prices were only partly offset by lower production.However, on an oil-equivalent basis, production fell 4.3 per cent from the year-earlier period. Excluding divestment and entitlement effects, production shrank 2 per cent. Exxon noted that none of this was a surprise: ""Our mature fields continue to perform as expected, and for those fields we operate, maintenance has been as anticipated.""Nonetheless, Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank said: ""The market will not like these volumes."" But Exxon's refining and marketing division yielded strong numbers, tracking ConocoPhillips, which reported on Wednesday, and set the stage for strong refining numbers from Chevron today.Those earnings were $2.2bn, up $714m because of better worldwide refining conditions and throughput. US refineries, in particular, have been running at or near capacity, to meet increasing demand.Although Exxon's chemicals division earned $814m, up $207m, that result was on improved margins offset by lower volumes.With revenue up 25 per cent to $88.6bn, Exxon continued its aggressive buyback programme, purchasing 64m shares for $3.7bn.""More production volume questions for Exxon - and for other big oils - as a big downstream quarter has not masked another disappointing number in oil and gas volumes. Fans of huge share buybacks will cheer today's announcement,"" said Mr Flannery. ""Those looking for progress on production growth will be less happy.""Meanwhile, Marathon, the fourth-largest oil and gas company in the US, beat Wall Street estimates, reporting earnings per share of $2.16, compared with the consensus forecast of $1.57. Net income was $673m, up 91 per cent from the year-earlier quarter, and revenue rose 28 per cent to $16.1bn."
145;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2005-05-19T20:25:08Z;Wall St extends advance amid energy strength;;Stocks meandered for much of the day before closing higher on Thursday to extend Wall Street’s recent winning streak. Energy stocks notched the best performance, rising 1.9 per cent as investors hunted for bargains after the sector’s recent pullback.By the close, the S&P 500 edged up 5.52 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 1,191.08 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 11.93 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 2,042.58. The Dow Jones rose 28.74 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 10,493.19. The modest rise marked the fourth successive day of gains for the Dow and the S&P, and the fifth-straight winning session for the Nasdaq.“We’ve gone through this manic depressive sentiment thing not only this year but last year, too. We’re in a wave where we’re getting manic again,” said James Paulsen at Wells Capital Management.Mr Paulsen said that, every 90-120 days, the market hit a new high in a bull-market cycle that began 2½ years ago. And since earnings continue to beat expectations, “every time we hit the new cycle high, the market is at a lower price to earnings multiple”.Shares of Netflix, the online DVD-rental company, surged 13.4 per cent to $17.58 after Wal-Mart said it would shut its competing business and direct customers to Netflix. Wal-Mart shares slipped 0.2 per cent to $47.49Titan rose 7.6 per cent to $21.55 on reports that the military-equipment maker was in talks about a potential takeover by L-3 Communications. L-3 shares slipped 0.8 per cent on the news.Motorola, the mobile phone maker, rose 2.4 per cent to $17.31 after it announced plans for a $4bn stock buyback.Kerr McGee, the oil and gas explorer, fell 5.6 per cent to $70.25 after it agreed to buy back almost 47m shares at $85 each. Elsewhere, energy stocks rose as investors moved back into the sector, which has sold off amid the retreat in crude prices. Exxon Mobil rose 2.2 per cent to $54.83, Transocean gained 1.3 per cent to $45.60 and Marathon Oil added 2 per cent to $46.71.Even some bearish market watchers do not expect the sky to fall, for the next few weeks at least. “I’m long,” said Fred Hickey of the High-Tech Strategist newsletter, adding that he bought long calls on IBM, Dell and other technology stocks on April 20 “when things got oversold”.Mr Hickey said the market would rally once people realised “the world wouldn’t end” on jitters about hedge funds making bad bets on collateralised debt obligations. Mr Hickey is not wavering in his long-term bearish convictions. “As soon as we have the first drop in oil, [the bulls] began to claim that we’re back to 1995 and the goldilocks economy. We still have an economy and market fed by asset inflation with debt- and liquidity-driven gains. When the real-estate bubble blows, it will end.”
146;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2005-05-12T20:20:25Z;Wall St lower as falling oil hits energy sector;;US stocks fell on Thursday after energy companies were hit by the falling price of oil, which dropped back below the $49 a barrel mark. Investors were also grappling with disappointing results from Wal-Mart and a report showing a bigger-than-expected gain in sales across the retail sector last month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 per cent to 10,189.04, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent to 1,159.27, and the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.4 per cent to 1,159.27.The price of a barrel of crude oil fell $1.91 in New York, dragging shares in the energy sector down with it. Exxon Mobil, the biggest US oil producer, fell 4.3 per cent to $54.82. Marathon Oil, a rival, fell 5.1 per cent to $46.02. National Oilwell Varco, the bigggest US maker of oilfield equipment, fell 5.5 per cent to $41.63.An official report said that retail sales rose 1.4 per cent last month. The gain was twice what most economists had expected, but the country’s biggest retailer failed to get a boost from the news.Wal-Mart shares fell 2 per cent to $47.65 after the retailer said second-quarter results would probably miss forecasts. The company also reported lower-than-expected first-quarter profits. Wal-Mart said unusually cold spring weather and high oil prices were partly to blame for tepid sales.Target, Wal-Mart’s chief US rival, rose 1.2 per cent after it reported higher earnings. The Minnesota-based group reported earnings of 55 cents a share, slightly ahead of estimates.An undertow of economic uncertainty continued on Thursday after data showing a shrinking trade deficit pushed the leading indices modestly higher on Wednesday.Jitters over the potential impacts on hedge funds of last week’s unexpected moves in the share and bond prices of General Motors and Ford, the struggling US automakers, led stocks to fall sharply on Tuesday. On Thursday, a report showed that the number of people filing for initial unemployment benefits rose last week.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, said the lack of direction in the stock market was surprising given the generally upbeat tone of economic and corporate news this earnings season. “This is still a market that is looking for what can go wrong rather than what’s going to go right,” he said.Walt Disney, the entertainment group, rose 0.3 per cent to $26.75 after it reported profits up 30 per cent for the quarter, driven by strong DVD sales.Shares in UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, edged 1 per cent to $1.00 a day after the company reported a $1.1bn quarterly loss. A court earlier this week ruled that the government should assume billions of dollars worth of pensions liabilities from the struggling commercial carrier. United said the move was necessary to avert bankruptcy.FedEx, the express shipper, slipped 2.6 per cent after it reaffirmed its second-quarter guidance. The company said that it expected earnings of between $1.40 and $1.50 a share.Ford Motor, the second-biggest US carmaker, fell 3 per cent to $9.35 after it suspended sales of unsecured short-term loans. Losses sharpened after Moody’s, the ratings agency, cut the company’s debt ratings to just above junk. General Motors, Ford’s bigger rival, fell 1.2 per cent to $30.62.Shares in US airlines were mixed. Delta Air Lines rose 1.1 per cent while AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 0.8 per cent. Investors were keeping a close eye on developments at United, the bankrupt US carrier. A court earlier this week relieved United’s parent, UAL, of billions of dollars in pension obligations.
147;MRO;Marathon Oil Corp;2004-09-28T20:39:40Z;Wall Street shrugs off $50 crude oil;;"Wall Street on Tuesday displayed its short attention span as stocks rallied undeterred by a crude oil price around $50 per barrel, with traders focused on higher earnings guidance from an industrial equipment maker and the prospect of rising profits from metals and mining companies.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9 per cent at 10,077.40 while the S&P 500 index was 0.6 per cent higher at 1,110.06. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.5 per cent to 1,869.87.William Livesey, senior technical analyst at Cybertrader, said some market indicators had been nearing levels that signalled stocks were oversold and suggested the potential for a rebound. However, he cautioned that one afternoon's action does not make a reliable rally: ""I want to see more upside action before I get excited.""Crude futures closed within a whisker of $50 per barrel amid fears about supply disruptions. While economists point out that oil, in real terms, is far from the highs of the 1970s and early 1980s, equity investors have worried that high energy prices will squeeze corporate profitability and cast a pall on the stock market.However, investors chose to use rising oil prices as a rallying cry to buy oil stocks. The American Stock Exchange oil producers index added 1.6 per cent, paced by a 3 per cent rise to $43.37 in Unocal, alongside Amerada Hess, which added 3.3 per cent to $89.21.
