0;CSX;CSX Corp;2019-07-22T12:44:34Z;US jobs growth bypasses railway workers;Once reliable source of blue-collar employment cuts back as wider labour market booms;US employment growth has bypassed the railroad industry, a provider of good wages for blue-collar workers across the country.Headcount at the largest US freight railroads was down 4 per cent on year to 141,000 in June, a lower number than in the financial crisis, government data show. The sum is set to fall further this year as managers streamline operations under pressure from investors.Last week Union Pacific Railroad, the largest listed US railroad, said it intended to cut payrolls by 10 per cent in 2019 as it reported a record second-quarter profit of $1.6bn.At CSX, whose web of tracks lies east of the Mississippi river, employee counts were down 5 per cent on the year in June after a 14 per cent reduction last year. Executives seek another 2.5 per cent reduction between now and 2020.The Norfolk Southern Railway, which reports results this week, has outlined plans to eliminate more than 500 positions this year.The prolonged cuts stand in contrast to robust hiring in the US labour market, where non-farm payrolls rose by 224,000 in June.Railroad jobs are becoming more scarce as managers try to boost profit margins, in some cases to placate activist shareholders. Most operators have in the past two years embraced principles known as “precision scheduled railroading,” which entail rigid timetables, longer trains, thousands of idled locomotives and less labour.Driving trains, maintaining right-of-way and dispatching cars are largely unionised jobs that do not require a university degree. The average employee at a large freight railroad earned $87,100 in wages and $38,300 of fringe benefits in 2017, according to the Association of American Railroads.The slackening rail employment picture has drawn scrutiny from Congress. A House transport subcommittee last month conducted a hearing on the state of the workforce. Lawmakers questioned the consequences of lower staffing.“While worker productivity has never been better and Class 1 railroads have enjoyed multibillion-dollar profits for many years, employment levels are headed in the other direction with thousands of rail employees furloughed,” Dennis Pierce, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union, told the subcommittee.Precision railroading was evangelised by Hunter Harrison, a renowned manager who introduced it first on Canadian railways. After he was hired in March 2017 from Canadian Pacific Railway to run CSX, he swiftly began transforming the 21,000-mile network.An acolyte continued to execute his vision after Harrison died in December 2017. Last week the Jacksonville, Florida-based company reported an operating ratio — operating costs as a percentage of revenue — of 57.4 per cent, its best for any second quarter.CSX’s headcount was 21,541 in June, down by almost 10,000 since 2014.“The whole objective [of precision railroading] is to remove all of the unnecessary touches and handling and steps throughout the process of moving freight. And as you remove those steps, it means that you require fewer people to do it,” CSX said.Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and Kansas City Southern — the other big listed US railroads — have since taken precision methods aboard. An S&P index of the four most valuable railroad stocks has risen 56 per cent since Harrison’s arrival at CSX, more than double the increase of the broader US stock market.In its latest quarter, Union Pacific said it had curtailed operations at two rail yards in Illinois and one in Texas and stored 2,150 locomotives.“We’ve taken a lot of work out of the network, and it’s being reflected now on our manpower,” said Lance Fritz, Union Pacific chief executive.One outlier is BNSF, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Headcount has hovered near 42,000 over the past few years at the railroad, which competes with Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern in the central and western US.BNSF’s former executive chairman, Matthew Rose, questioned the merits of precision railroading before he retired this year. Mr Buffett has more recently sounded open to the concept.“If we think we can serve our customers well and get more efficient in the process, we will adopt whatever we observe,” Mr Buffett told the company’s annual meeting in May.In a blow to efforts to preserve jobs, a regulator in May scrapped a proposal to require a minimum number of crew members on each train. Labour unions had sought at least two, but the Federal Railroad Administration found no evidence multiple workers made trains safer.Further, the agency said any requirement would “unnecessarily impede the future of rail innovation and automation.”
1;CSX;CSX Corp;2019-07-17T18:42:31Z;US rail freight declines signal economic weakness;CSX shares fall sharply after chief executive calls economic backdrop ‘puzzling’;Signs of a decelerating US economy are showing up on the nation’s railways, as the carriers of bulk goods from coal to steel report falling freight volumes.An index of the biggest US railway stocks fell more than 7 per cent on Wednesday after a gloomy business prognosis from CSX, whose 21,000-mile network runs east of the Mississippi river.The company predicted a 1-2 per cent decline in revenue this year, abandoning a previous forecast for growth, as its boss outlined a “slow, lazy, malaise-type drift down”.“The present economic backdrop is one of the most puzzling I have experienced in my career,” said Jim Foote, CSX chief executive, during a call to discuss second-quarter results.His comments came amid mounting uncertainty about the direction of the US economy. Despite strong domestic employment, growth is expected to slow this year. The lengthening trade war with China has added to businesses’ anxiety.In the year to early July, US rail traffic has declined by 3.2 per cent compared with the same period last year, according to the Association of American Railroads.The Cass Shipments Index, a measure of North American freight volumes moved by trains and trucks, has declined seven months in a row including a 5.3 per cent drop in June, “signalling an economic contraction”, the index provider said.Investors were due to receive further news on rail revenues on Thursday, when Union Pacific, the largest publicly owned US railway, reports results. The Omaha, Nebraska, company’s volumes are down by 3 per cent in the year to date.At CSX, quarterly revenue fell by 11 per cent in its intermodal business, which carries shipping containers by rail. It blamed most of the decline on planned closures of routes used for the service.Revenue declined 6 per cent in shipping metals and equipment such as sheet steel. US Steel last month said it would idle two blast furnaces in Indiana and Michigan.The Trump administration imposed steel tariffs last year on importers that boosted domestic production but a subsequent surge in inventories meant that CSX metals volumes “will get a little bit softer, unfortunately”, Mr Foote said.CSX was also caught up in the fallout from an explosion last month at the largest oil refinery on the US east coast. The refinery owner, Philadelphia Energy Solutions, decided to close and try to sell the refinery, removing about 1 per cent of CSX’s volumes.CSX shares traded 10.8 per cent lower on Wednesday at $70.96.Mr Foote said that volumes had got off to a shaky start in 2019 when the US government shut down in a stand-off over President Donald Trump’s demand for funds to build a border wall.“And now we’re talking about another government shutdown, maybe as early September or October. And so as I said, unfortunately, in this day and age, I’m obligated, we’re obligated to update guidance with the change,” Mr Foote said of the revenue warning.CSX reported revenue of $3.06bn in the second quarter, a 1 per cent fall from the same period a year before. Net income also fell 1 per cent to $870m, while earnings per share rose by 7 per cent to $1.01, 10 cents below analysts’ expectations.
2;CSX;CSX Corp;2019-04-18T17:26:09Z;Railroad stocks set record highs as price increases boost earnings;;Shares in US railroads are trading near all-time highs after a trio of America’s largest train operators steamrollered earnings forecasts this week, backed by higher shipping rates.Union Pacific, CSX and Kansas City Southern cheered investors with first-quarter results that benefited from price hikes and cost efficiencies, which offset the financial impact of disruptive winter storms and record Midwest flooding that caused billions of dollars in damage in the region.Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific kept the rally train moving on Thursday, revealing net income grew 6 per cent year-over-year to $1.39bn as rate increases helped the company overcome weaker volume. On an adjusted basis, earnings of $1.93 a share topped analysts’ average estimate by four cents, even as revenue of $5.4bn, down from $5.5bn, fell short.The company’s stock surged 4.5 per cent to $176.90 in intraday trade, higher than its previous closing high of $171.33 set on February 19.The Dow Jones US Railroads Index, up 2.6 per cent on Thursday, was also trading at an all-time high.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Transportation Average — a closely watched index seen as a gauge of the US economy — was tracking toward its highest close in more than 6 months with a gain of 1.7 per cent to 11,007.09.CFRA analyst Jim Corridore, who raised his price targets for all three companies this week, said CSX and Kansas City Southern have improved profitability with a shift to scheduled railroading — when trains depart at a set time as opposed to waiting for a certain number of cars.“CSX’s shift to scheduled railroading has driven declines in headcount, fuel costs and most other cost categories, and these benefits are likely to continue through 2019,” he wrote to clients.Mr Corridore remained concerned about carload declines at Union Pacific, saying it would likely lag behind other railroads on its operating ratio while it rolls out an improvement plan. The company’s operating ratio, a key industry measure of profitability, improved 1 percentage point to 63.6 per cent last quarter. CSX’s operating ratio was a first-quarter record for the group at 59.5 per cent. A lower number indicates stronger profitability.CSX booked revenue growth of 5 per cent in the March quarter on “broad-based pricing gains” and increased shipping volume in merchandise. Its net earnings expanded by 20 per cent.First-quarter revenues at Kansas City Southern rose 6 per cent amid strong gains in chemicals and petroleum shipments, while net earnings, which fell 29 per cent, were knocked by restructuring charges. Excluding one-time costs, adjusted earnings per share rose 18 per cent.Kansas City Southern shares jumped 1.5 per cent to $124.71, about 1 per cent from its closing high and setting a pace to wrap trading at its best level since November 2014. CSX ticked fractionally lower during the session after setting a record high on Wednesday.Not to be left out, Norfolk Southern, which will report first-quarter results next week, rose 1.2 per cent and eyed a fresh record high on its peers’ upbeat views.
3;CSX;CSX Corp;2018-10-25T16:30:28Z;US railroads employ ‘precision’ principles to boost profit;Approach pioneered by the late Hunter Harrison is spreading;North American railroad executives facing pressure to boost results are embracing the principles of Hunter Harrison, an industry legend who died in December last year. The sector’s quarterly earnings season, which continued on Thursday with results from Union Pacific, revealed the extent to which Harrison’s “precision scheduled railroading” strategy has spread.Under Harrison’s trademark approach, railroads work to improve profitability by running longer trains, increasing car velocities, using fixed timetables and maximising the use of assets. The veteran executive successfully used the strategy at the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railways before he was recruited last year to run CSX, the largest rail company in the eastern US. His successor, James Foote, has held fast to his vision and CSX doubled net income in the third quarter. CSX’s eastern rival Norfolk Southern disclosed Wednesday it would adopt precision railroading, meaning a majority of large North American freight rail companies has now embraced it. Union Pacific, one of the two biggest western US rail groups, launched its own precision plan on October 1 and said on Thursday that it had already cut 627 locomotives, about 8 per cent of its fleet.“There has been some speculation of what we’re doing as a ‘light version’ of PSR,” Thomas Lischer, Union Pacific’s executive vice-president of operations, told analysts on an earnings call Thursday. “I can assure you that is not the case.”Union Pacific, which has struggled with service problems this year, said it would phase in the changes starting with a route between Wisconsin and Texas.Introducing precision railroading has often upset labour and shippers. As trains run more efficiently, workers are made redundant. At CSX, average headcount fell 8 per cent even as volume rose 4 per cent year on year in the third quarter. In Harrison’s early months at CSX, service disruptions led to a government inquiry as shippers complained that their chemicals, grain and other bulk goods were not delivered. Performance has since bounced back, with train velocity up 28 per cent year on year in the third quarter. Some customers still report problems, said Jay Roman, president of Escalation Consultants, which advises shippers on transport matters. Citing the CSX ordeal, the Surface Transportation Board regulatory body has asked Union Pacific to hold weekly calls with its staff. “We trust that UP will work in a transparent manner to avoid similar disruptions to our nation’s rail system,” STB officials wrote. The strong US economy has been good for rail companies, which have suffered in recent years as coal volumes declined because coal-fired power plants were being retired. North American rail volume in 2018 to date is up 3.4 per cent from last year, according to the Association of American Railroads. But investors have demanded more as the precision approach paid off on the Canadian lines and at CSX. Norfolk Southern’s operating ratio — operating costs as a percentage of revenue — was 65.4 per cent in the third quarter, well above CSX’s 58.7 per cent. Union Pacific on Thursday reported third-quarter net income of $1.6bn, up 33 per cent on year, but its operating ratio was frozen at 61.7 per cent. “The analysts are asking them: ‘Why aren’t you adopting the same systems as CSX, because they seem to be doing it very successfully?’” said Daniel Sherman, analyst at Edward Jones.James Squires, Norfolk Southern chief executive, said on a conference call that his company would implement precision railroading principles “where they lead to a better result for customers and shareholders.” Its shares rose 2.1 per cent to $160.19 on Wednesday, buoyed by record quarterly earnings of $702m. “Certainly, we are looking to change the way we operate. That's necessary. The network has evolved over the years,” Mr Squires said.CSX shareholders paid Harrison $84m up front to leave his job at Canadian Pacific in a bet that his management skills were one of a kind. Mr Foote worked under Harrison at Canadian National and was familiar with the precision model. “Whether UP and NS can do it without someone like Harrison is an open question,” said Howard Green, the author of Railroader, a biography of Harrison. “Harrison was the passion. He was the bullheaded, relentless, uncompromising preacher. He created disciples, and enemies, wherever he went.”
4;CSX;CSX Corp;2018-07-17T20:47:48Z;CSX chugs higher after earnings beat;;CSX reported earnings that chugged past market expectations in its second fiscal quarter as the freight railroad operator’s multiyear turnround efforts continue to bear fruit.The third-largest US railway company reported revenue of $3.1bn in the three months ended June 30, a 6 per cent increase from a year ago, and about $100m better than the median in a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.Net income was $877m, or $1.01 a share, up 72 per cent from a year ago when an $81m restructuring charge weighed on the bottom line. The result sailed past forecasts of $748.9m, or 86 cents a share.The market was impressed, with investors pushing the stock 3.4 per cent higher in after-hours trading. Shares closed at a record $67.28 in early June, but were down a bit more than 4 per cent since then at the close of regular trading on Tuesday.Three months ago, the Jacksonville, Florida-based company managed to report record first-quarter earnings despite trying to regroup from the sudden death last December of Hunter Harrison, its then chief executive and railway industry veteran.Mr Harrison joined the company in March 2017 and implemented a turnround plan to improve operating performance.CSX managed to reduce expenses by 8 per cent from a year ago to $1.82bn, but the previous year’s costs had been propped up by a $115m restructuring charge. While labour costs were shrunk by 11 per cent, CSX experienced a 36 per cent jump in fuel costs from a year ago to $270m.James Foote, chief executive officer, said in a statement today: “I could not be more proud of our hardworking CSX employees for achieving these record-setting results”, adding that he expected continued improvement in the company’s safety, service and financial performance.“While we remain in the early stages of the transformation I am more confident this exceptional team can deliver on our long-term outlook,” he said.
5;CSX;CSX Corp;2018-04-18T15:13:55Z;CSX shares chug their way to record high;;CSX shares went full steam ahead, hitting a record high on Wednesday after the railroad operator’s cost cutting efforts helped it post upbeat quarterly results.CSX shares jumped as much as 7.3 per cent to a record high of $60.70. The upbeat results come as the company continues to carry forward the turnround plan implemented by veteran rail executive Hunter Harrison, who died just months after joining the company.Harrison was brought on to CSX in March last year to improve operating performance by implementing his trademark “precision scheduled railroading” approach, but he went on medical leave before passing away in December.Harrison’s push to close slanted “hump” yards — where long trains are broken into individual cards before being sorted — cut headcount and move traffic with fewer locomotives backfired last year. He apologised for the service lapses but insisted the company was on the right track.CSX has continued to push through his plans under new chief executive James Foote. That helped lower operating expenses 8 per cent in the first quarter from a year ago, after adjusting for last year’s restructuring costs.“Early on in the new CEO’s tenure the company is showing the ability to operate efficiently as a smaller railroad with fewer employees and assets,” said Jason Seidl, an analyst at Cowen.CSX shares are now up 9 per cent year to date.
6;CSX;CSX Corp;2018-04-17T20:43:32Z;CSX earnings jump with turnround efforts on track under new CEO;;CSX delivered record first-quarter earnings during the first three months of 2018, as the freight railroad operator’s turnround efforts did not seem to be deterred by the unexpected death of chief executive Hunter Harrison in December.CSX shares rose 4.3 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the Jacksonville, Florida-based railroad reported net earnings of $698m, or 78 cents a share, for the first quarter of 2018, up from $362m, or 39 cents, during the same period last year. Compared to its 1Q 2017 results, adjusted to exclude restructuring charges, that represented a 53 per cent increase in earnings, CSX said.The results come as CSX, the third-largest US railway company, regroups from the sudden death of Harrison, the widely heralded railroad veteran who was brought on board to help improve its operations. His successor, James Foote, said in a statement:“CSX employees did a great job of running the railroad and executing the scheduled railroading model during challenging weather conditions. We’re more confident in our ability to deliver safe, reliable, best-in-class service for our customers and enhanced value for our shareholders.”Sales were relatively flat year-over-year at $2.88bn, while expenses dropped 13 per cent from the same period a year earlier, the company said.Analysts had been looking for earnings of $574m, or 65 cents a shares, on sales of $2.78bn, according to Factset.CSX shares, which gained 53.1 per cent in 2017, are up 2.8 per cent year to date.
7;CSX;CSX Corp;2018-01-16T22:07:41Z;CSX profit boosted by $3.6bn gain from tax reform;;US tax reforms provided a $3.6bn boost to CSX’s profit during the fourth quarter. However, results from the freight rail operator underscore the challenges it faces as it looks to push ahead with its turnaround efforts following the unexpected death of chief executive Hunter Harrison in December.Net income came in at $4.1bn for the three months to end of December as CSX reaped the benefits of lower corporate tax rates. Excluding this and other one-off charges, net income was $573m, or 64 cents a share, ahead of the $510m, or 56 cents a share, the market was expecting.The profit beat came despite revenue clocking a 6 per cent year-on-year drop to $2.86bn. Analysts had penciled in a smaller decline to $2.88bn. Revenue across all its divisions fell during the quarter, with the top line performance hurt by lower shipment volumes of commodities it hauls, such as vehicles and chemicals.Operating ratio, or operating costs as a percentage of revenue, improved by nearly 7 percentage points to 60.9 per cent.CSX, the country’s third-largest railway company, hired Mr Harrison last March to make the 190-year-old network lean and efficient. Shareholders then agreed in June to pay Mr Harrison an extra $84m under the threat he would otherwise resign.While the turnround plan was well-received by shareholders, its execution triggered service disruptions and ran afoul of regulators and customers. The situation has been further complicated by Mr Harrison’s abrupt death late last year, with some wondering whether the company’s board has been slow to to disclose Harrison’s health problems.“CSX’s performance continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter, building upon the scheduled railroading model that was instituted by Hunter Harrison” said new chief executive James Foote. “I’m excited about the progress we are making and am confident we have the right team in place to achieve our goal of becoming the best railroad in North America.”
8;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-12-22T18:27:34Z;CSX elevates interim chief to permanent CEO after Harrison’s death;;US railroad operator CSX has made it official: Jim Foote will be its new chief executive, after the sudden death of industry veteran Hunter Harrison earlier this month.Mr Foote, the company’s previous chief operating officer, had been named interim chief executive on December 14, the same day the company unexpectedly announced that Mr Harrison would be taking medical leave, which sent its shares tumbling. Mr Harrison — who joined CSX earlier this year after being poached from Canadian Pacific Railway by activist hedge fund Mantle Ridge — died a few days later.Mr Harrison came with a hefty price tag — he got $84m in compensation for awards forfeited in his departure from CP, as part of an estimated $300m four-year package. But he was widely respected and viewed as a giant in the industry, known for his “precision scheduled railroading” strategy to boost trains’ operations.Mr Foote said in a statement on Friday:I worked alongside Hunter for over a decade and his pioneering approach to railroading unlocked significant efficiencies and value, and we remain focused on delivering on this vision for CSX, our customers and our shareholders. The execution of Precision Scheduled Railroading is well underway, with the most critical components of the implementation completed and beginning to generate measurable operating improvement.
9;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-12-17T17:17:14Z;CSX chief executive Hunter Harrison’s death a ‘major loss’;Challenge passes to Jim Foote to undertake overhaul of largest US railway operator;The death of Hunter Harrison, chief executive of CSX and a widely respected veteran of the US railway industry, after abruptly taking a medical leave of absence last week, has been described by the company’s chairman as a “major loss”.Mr Harrison, who was 73, died due to “unexpectedly severe complications” from a recent illness contracted at a training camp held for middle managers last week, according to an email sent to CSX employees by its new acting chief executive, Jim Foote.“We are immensely grateful for the opportunity to have worked with the railroad legend,” Mr Foote wrote. “Those of us who were fortunate enough to interact with Hunter daily had the opportunity to see first-hand his passion for the business, the depths of his railroad knowledge, and his desire to see this great company become even greater.”Edward Kelly, CSX’s chairman, said in a statement on Saturday that CSX had “suffered a major loss”, but that the board was confident that Mr Foote and his management team would be able to continue and build on the changes implemented by Mr Harrison.CSX is the largest railroad operator in the eastern US, and Mr Harrison had been poached from Canadian Pacific Railway by activist hedge fund Mantle Ridge earlier this year, snagging $84m up front to compensate him for awards forfeited by his departure as part of an estimated $300m four-year package.Anthony Hatch, an independent railroad analyst, said that it was “an understatement to say he was a giant of the industry”, describing Mr Harrison as a “two or perhaps three-time hall of fame railroader and the industry’s all-time de facto change agent”.The septuagenarian had long faced questions about his health after appearing in public using an oxygen tank to help his breathing. Mr Harrison had refused the CSX board’s request for an independent doctor’s examination or review of his medical records before he was hired.The company’s shares tumbled on Friday when the medical leave was first announced, falling 7.6 per cent to $52.93, wiping almost $4bn from the company’s market value. The stock had jumped more than 23 per cent in January when Mr Harrison left Canadian Pacific and looked set for CSX.Barclays analysts, writing before the news of Mr Harrison’s death was released, said they had faith in Mr Foote’s “momentum, ability and resources to continue the transformation at CSX” but cautioned that investors were likely to be guarded until the impact on the company’s operations became clearer.“Without Mr Harrison in an active role, we expect the market to take a much more cautious approach on CSX shares, likely to capitalise improvement only once demonstrated in company results,” they had written in a note on Friday.Edward Hamberger, the president of the Association of American Railroads, said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened” by Mr Harrison’s passing.“He was an icon who left an indelible mark on North American railroading. On behalf of the entire rail industry, I would like to extend the sincerest condolences to Hunter’s family during this difficult time,” he said.
10;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-12-17T05:01:31Z;CSX chief Harrison dies months into railroad’s turnround effort;Veteran executive had been hired earlier this year to boost its profits to transform freight railway operator;Hunter Harrison, chief executive of CSX, has died, the US freight railway operator said on Saturday, just a few days after the veteran rail executive, hired earlier this year, had taken a medical leave of absence.Harrison, 73, died “due to unexpectedly severe complications from a recent illness”, the company said in a statement, adding that he would be succeeded temporarily by acting chief executive Jim Foote.“We are immensely grateful for the opportunity to have worked with the railroad legend,” Mr Foote said in a letter to employees of CSX, which has 34,000km of track, mostly east of the Mississippi river, adding that it would “honour his legacy by staying focused” on his business plan.Harrison, hired as chief executive in March at the urging of activist investor Paul Hilal, had been in the midst of an ambitious and sometimes controversial effort to overhaul CSX by laying off employees and streamlining operations.Seen using an oxygen tank when meeting with investors last month, he had been hired at CSX on a four-year contract with an estimated value of $300m.“The board will continue to consider in a deliberative way how best to maximise CSX’s performance over the long term,” Edward Kelly, chairman, said in a statement that described Harrison as a “larger-than-life figure.”News of Harrison’s leave, announced late on Thursday, sent CSK shares down as much as 10 per cent in Friday trading on the Nasdaq. Despite the fall, the stock is up 47 per cent this year.Harrison, who led turnrounds of two Canadian railroads, had previously taken medical leave at Canadian Pacific in 2015 after surgery and a bout of pneumonia.While the turnround plan was received well by shareholders, its execution triggered service disruptions and ran afoul of regulators and customers.The company, which on Friday brushed off questions about whether the board had been slow to disclose Harrison’s health problems, provided no further details about his cause of death.Mr Foote, who also holds the titles of chief operating officer and chief sales and marketing officer, had worked with Harrison at Canadian National Railway, but has never headed a major railroad.He has said he will follow through with the wide-ranging overhaul under way, but some investors on Friday expressed doubts about whether he could deliver on Harrison’s ambitious plan, which included closing numerous railyards where train cars are sorted, and the potential sale of some short-line rail segments.
11;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-12-15T16:10:36Z;CSX railroad chief’s medical leave sends shares tumbling;Move comes nine months after Hunter Harrison was paid $84m up front to join group;Hunter Harrison, the management whizz paid $84m up front to join the CSX railroad, has gone on medical leave nine months after his arrival as chief executive.The largest railroad in the eastern US disclosed late on Thursday that Mr Harrison has suffered “unexpected complications from a recent illness” and would be replaced on an acting basis by James Foote, chief operating officer.Mr Harrison was recruited to CSX by activist hedge fund Mantle Ridge from his job running Canadian Pacific Railway. Mantle Ridge argued that he would improve operating performance by imposing his trademark “precision scheduled railroading” approach to the business.He agreed to switch jobs on the condition that shareholders repay him the $84m he forfeited by leaving CP early — a demand they approved after hiring him in March on a four-year contract. CSX shares were down more than 7 per cent to $53 in New York on Friday, reflecting investor disquiet over the leadership news. The drop erased almost $4bn from the company’s market capitalisation.Since early in his tenure, questions have been raised about the health of Mr Harrison, a 73-year-old who has appeared in public using an oxygen tank to aid breathing. Before he was hired he refused the CSX board’s request for an independent doctor’s examination or review of his medical records.At a November 29 conference, Mr Harrison said that he was “trying to stay back a little bit” for other executives to “do their thing”.“This company's got to be ready to deal, and it is going to be ready to deal, without Hunter Harrison. And one of the steps in the succession was to bring Jim on,” Mr Harrison added. Mr Foote was hired in October, taking over the responsibilities of two senior executives, Cindy Sanborn and Fredrik Eliasson.Mr Foote told analysts on a conference call on Friday that Mr Harrison had fallen ill sometime after running a “Hunter Camp”, a training session for middle managers, last week. He declined to elaborate on the medical condition.The upheaval in the executive suite comes after a rocky start to precision railroading at CSX, which sprawls from the east coast ports to Midwestern farm states. Instead of improving performance it led to service delays, rerouted trains, complaints from customers and an inquiry from the federal railroad regulator, though the company has said it was fixing the problems.Edward Kelly, the company chairman, said: “On behalf of the board and the entire CSX family, I want to express that our thoughts are with Mr Harrison and his family.” Mr Foote, who previously worked under Mr Harrison at Canadian National Railway, said that it was “way too early for me to discuss succession plans, changes, et cetera”.But he said that process of converting CSX to the precision railroading model was well under way. “I can tell you that we're not slowing down,” he said. Anthony Hatch, an independent analyst, asked in a client note if the announcement signalled a “post-Hunter” era for CSX. “Is the plan (PSR) bigger than the man? That is the big question,” he wrote. 
12;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-12-15T15:23:06Z;CSX drops as CEO takes surprise medical leave;;Shares of US railroad operator CSX are eyeing their biggest one-day drop since 2011, after the company said that chief executive Hunter Harrison would be going on medical leave nine months into the job.The company’s shares are down 7.9 per cent shortly after the opening bell on Friday to $52.77. If the losses hold, it will be the company’s biggest one-day share drop since September 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data.Mr Harrison was recruited to CSX by Mantle Ridge from Canadian Pacific Railway, with the activist hedge fund arguing that the management whiz would boost operating performance with his trademark “precision scheduling railroad” approach.The hire didn’t come cheap. Mr Harrison insisted that shareholders repay him the $84m he forfeited by leaving CP early — and the demand was approved in March, when he was hired on a four-year contract.However, questions were raised about the health of Mr Harrison, 73. Thursday’s announcement said that he suffered from “unexpected complications from a recent illness” and would be replaced on an acting basis by James Foote, chief operating officer.
13;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-10-17T15:36:19Z;CSX chief acknowledges ‘embarrassing’ service lapses;;"The chief of the CSX railroad acknowledged “embarrassing” service lapses in the first months of his tenure as he attempts to institute new management practices, but he said the company was on the right track and rebuffed some criticism as “political.”
In his first comments to analysts since July, Hunter Harrison sounded at once contrite and defensive. CSX “went through obviously some slippage,” he said on a call discussing third-quarter results.Mr Harrison was hired in March after being recruited by an activist hedge fund to improve returns at the biggest US railroad east of the Mississippi river. Investors drove up CSX shares in anticipation of his arrival.An aggressive push to close down slanted “hump” railway sorting yards, cut headcount and move traffic with fewer locomotives backfired after its introduction in early July.Customers who depend on trains to move their bulk products complained to the US Surface Transportation Board, a federal regulator.At an STB hearing last week, customers said the problems persist. These included loaded trains waiting up to a week to be pulled, misrouted trains and “manifest” trains — built from an assortment of different rolling stock — taking long detours.In some cases, cars “seemingly get a tour of eastern half of the United States, after being combined in trains that traverse north, west and east before beginning their journey to their intended destination in the southeast, ultimately arriving late,” Randy Gordon, president of the National Grain and Feed Association, said in a statement.Mr Harrison told analysts: “Maybe I was pushing too hard.” But he said the statements given at the hearing “weren’t about CSX service. The hearings were about more political issues,” such as shippers’ longstanding desires to open up more competition between railroads.CSX reported an operating ratio, or operating costs as a percentage of revenue, of 68.1 per cent, an improvement of 0.9 percentage point from a year before but worse than in the second quarter. The company last month downgraded operating ratio and earnings guidance for the full year.In the third quarter CSX earned $459m, or $0.51 per share, up from $455 million, or $0.48 per share in the same period a year earlier and matching consensus expectations.Revenue totalled $2.7bn.CSX shares rose 0.8 per cent to $53.27 in the New York morning."
14;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-08-20T11:14:07Z;CSX chief under pressure to improve freight railway;Customers complain 21,000-mile network has worsened since Hunter Harrison took over;Bakers have to wait for flour, grain is arriving weeks late at feed mills and a chemical plant is shipping bulk liquids by truck because trains are not arriving at its rail yard.These are some of the complaints lodged by big US industrial groups against CSX, the country’s third-largest railway company, since the new chief executive installed by an activist hedge fund launched his “Precision Scheduled Railroading” strategy.Hunter Harrison arrived at CSX in March promising to make the 190-year-old network lean and efficient. Investors sent CSX shares skyward, his pay demands notwithstanding — shareholders agreed in June to pay Mr Harrison an extra $84m under the threat he would otherwise resign.But euphoria on Wall Street has been followed by anger from trade groups representing companies such as Cargill, ExxonMobil and General Motors. They say Mr Harrison has made services on CSX’s 21,000-mile network worse.A federal regulator, the Surface Transportation Board, has taken action in response. A letter to Mr Harrison earlier this month raised concerns about a “widespread degradation of rail service” and the board has asked CSX to hand over a schedule of further changes to its operating plan by Thursday. This information will be made public.Mr Harrison is respected in the industry, having previously orchestrated turnrounds at the Illinois Central, Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railways. He took action immediately after joining CSX, revamping rail yards, loading cargo on fewer trains and cutting more than 1,000 jobs.After an initial improvement, performance has worsened this summer. The average train speed was 18.4mph in the week ending August 11, nearly a fifth slower than in early June. The time railcars sit idle between trips has increased to nearly 30 hours.The service problems raise questions about Mr Harrison’s ability to implement big reforms at CSX, whose complex network of tracks running through dense metropolitan areas is different from railroads he previously managed.“Hunter Harrison is probably one of the best operating people in railroad history. He has a stellar track record,” said Larry Gross, partner at FTR Transportation Intelligence, a consultancy. “But there was a real question as to whether the CSX situation, by virtue of the route structure, was more complicated than in the past, where routes tended to be simpler and more linear.”In a letter to the STB last week, agricultural and food groups including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Grain and Feed Association detailed what they called a “precipitous” decline in service that began in June, worsened in July and “does not appear to be abating”.The groups said that feed manufacturers were waiting “several weeks” for trains to arrive and that chicken farms, short of feed, were being forced to “make emergency purchases of ingredients transported by truck to keep poultry alive”. Bakeries in Tennessee had run short of flour, sugar, tomato paste and starch. Shutdowns of CSX rail switching yards meant trains were “traversing thousands of miles out of route”, they said.A customer coalition that included the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute sent a letter to Congress saying the company had “repeatedly failed to pick up and deliver cars”, putting “rail dependent business operations throughout the US at risk of shutting down”.Moving goods such as coal, chemicals and grain is largely uneconomical in trucks and the complaints highlight the fraught relationship between bulk commodity shippers and the railways they depend on. Consolidation has left the US with two main railway companies east of the Mississippi river — CSX and Norfolk Southern — and their networks only partially overlap.Mr Harrison has urged patience, saying his changes will eventually pay off in better service. “There’s going to be a little pain and suffering,” he told analysts last month. “I don’t know, frankly, how to get there without some bumps in the road.”He was blunter in a letter to the customer coalition last week, calling its claims “grossly exaggerated” and suggesting members were capitalising on CSX’s troubles to lobby for long-sought rail competition reforms.Mr Harrison was recruited to CSX from Canadian Pacific by Mantle Ridge, a New York activist hedge fund that owns a 4.7 per cent stake of the company. Paul Hilal, Mantle Ridge’s founder, has joined the CSX board.CSX shareholders agreed the $84m payment to Mr Harrison as reimbursement for money he forfeited when he left Canadian Pacific.In an April letter to shareholders advocating the payment, Mr Hilal said that railroads run using Mr Harrison’s precision railroading model “perform far better than railroads operating under traditional models”. He added that Mr Harrison “intends to effect the same transformation at CSX”.CSX and Mr Hilal declined to comment.
15;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-07-27T00:03:37Z;US railroads: deal coal bounce;Profits from the commodity are up for now but cannot be sustained;“Coal is not a long-term issue,” Hunter Harrison, the pricey, septuagenarian chief executive of US railroad company CSX said dismissively last week. How about a short-term one, then? CSX reported last week that second-quarter revenues from hauling coal were up 27 per cent year-on-year.On Wednesday, rival Norfolk Southern delivered similar results with quarterly coal revenues up 32 per cent. Despite President Donald Trump’s effort to aggrandise the black dust, power producers and utilities are still leading the shift towards natural gas and renewables. But while those long-term preparations are being made, coal is still being burnt in the US and exported abroad for steel production. These factors are a temporary panacea for beaten-down coal miners and transporters.The sector level data matches the rally at individual companies. The US Department of Energy forecasts that US coal exports will jump by nearly a fifth in 2017 to 72m tonnes. At the same time, natural gas prices in the US have slowly moved upward this year, although they are still historically low. The Energy Department predicts that the proportion of electricity generation from coal plants will inch up from 30 per cent to 31 per cent in 2017 and stay there in 2018.But this ultimately is a sucker’s rally. Coal producers have shrunk through bankruptcies and their new slimmer balances sheets fit the modest demand that now exists (coal was once responsible for half of US power production). Coal export capacity utilisation in the US is a measly 31 per cent or below at various terminals.Mr Harrison noted that while he’s happy to participate in the current rally in coal transport he was not planning to invest in building his coal transport business knowing that in 10 or 20 years coal demand may be effectively defunct. But with that decay path neither linear nor predictable, investors have a chance to wager on the variability.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox?

16;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-07-19T17:24:32Z;Coal has no future, says US railroad boss;CSX will not buy locomotives to haul the fuel despite Trump pledge to revive industry;"One of the largest haulers of US coal says fossil fuels have no future, despite pledges to the contrary from President Donald Trump.CSX, a freight railroad company with origins in the bituminous coal seams of Appalachia, will not buy a single new locomotive to pull coal trains, chief executive Hunter Harrison told analysts on Wednesday.“Fossil fuels are dead,” Mr Harrison said. “That’s a long-term view. It’s not going to happen overnight. It’s not going to be in two or three years. But it’s going away, in my view.” His comments come as the White House aims to revive the American coal industry by rescinding environmental regulations and abandoning the Paris climate agreement. Mr Trump surrounded himself with coal miners earlier this year when he signed an executive order he said was “putting an end to the war on coal”. Fossil fuels are dead . . . It’s not going to be in two or three years. But it’s going away, in my viewYet US power generators are building more plants fuelled by cheap natural gas, displacing old coal-fired units. Falling costs for solar and wind energy have also eaten into coal’s market share. North American railroads have reshaped their asset holdings in acknowledgment that coal’s apex has passed.Lance Fritz, chief executive of the Union Pacific railroad, said in a recent interview that Mr Trump’s move to scrap Clean Power Plan regulations was unlikely to grow its coal business. “It takes away a headwind,"" he said.Nearly a fifth, or $530m, of CSX’s $2.9bn of second-quarter revenue came from coal, a 27 per cent rise from the same period a year before. In the second quarter of 2011, CSX coal revenue totalled nearly $1bn.CSX’s rise in coal volumes derived from 8.2m tonnes of exports. Deliveries of coal to US utilities declined year on year to 11m tonnes. Despite long-term trends, Mr Harrison reiterated his support for the business. “The last carload of coal that’s shipped out of this country, I want to be the carrier that ships it,” he said. Mr Harrison, a legendary railroad manager, joined CSX in March after he was recruited from his job running the Canadian Pacific railway by an activist hedge fund, Mantle Ridge. CSX shareholders last month agreed to reimburse him $84m in money he forfeited when he left CP. CSX reported net profit of $510m, or 55 cents per share, in the second quarter, up 15 per cent from $445m, or 47 cents per share, in the same period a year before. But investors drove the company’s shares down 6.1 per cent to $51.31 as they queried how quickly Mr Harrison will deliver on his promises to raise performance. “It is hard to deny that CSX's second-quarter results came in below elevated expectations,” Barclays wrote.Mr Harrison said he was not going to buy locomotives or double-track CSX’s routes to accommodate coal. “Coal is not a long-term issue,” he said."
17;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-07-18T21:10:12Z;CSX takes $122m charge for axed managers, new CEO;;CSX, the US freight railroad, has taken a $122m charge against earnings to account for paying its new chief for the costs of leaving his old job and severance for some of the 951 managers axed since the start of the year.The charge disclosed late Tuesday confirms the $84m company shareholders agreed to give Hunter Harrison to reimburse him what he forfeited when he quit the Canadian Pacific railway to run CSX. Of that sum, $29m went to Mr Harrison and $55m to Mantle Ridge, the activist hedge fund backing him.Another $22m of the charge covered costs related to CSX’s “management workforce reduction” in the second quarter, including severance payments, while $16m went to equity awards for CSX’s former chief executive and presidentMr Harrison joined CSX in March. He has pledged to to dramatically improve performance at CSX, the largest rail network railroad in the eastern US.He has since slashed the number of trains on the rails, flattened the slopes of switching yards to make them more efficient and completed the headcount reduction that began before his arrival. The moves fuelled more than $90m in efficiency gains in the quarter, the company said.CSX says its trains are moving faster and spending less time at terminals. In the second quarter ended June 30, its operating ratio — or operating costs as a share of revenue — was 67.4 per cent, down from 68.9 per cent a year before. The company said it is aiming for an operating ratio in the “mid-60s” this year.The company reported net quarterly profit of $510m, or 55 cents per share, up 15 per cent from $445m, or 47 cents per share, in the same period a year before. Analysts polled by Capital IQ saw per-share earnings of 59 cents.Excluding the charge, CSX said adjusted earnings per share was 64 cents.“We are implementing Precision Scheduled Railroading on an expedited timetable, converting switching operations, balancing the network, streamlining resources and getting more out of our assets,” Mr Harrison said in a statement, referring to the management philosophy for which he is known. “Although there still remains a lot to be done, we are confident that these initiatives will drive improved customer service, greater resource efficiency and superior shareholder value.”CSX’s revenue rose 8 per cent to $2.9bn, beating estimates, underpinned by stronger volumes and higher prices in coal shipping.Since January, when Mr Harrison announced his plans, CSX shares have risen nearly 50 per cent, compared to an 8 per cent rise in the S&P 500 stock index.

19;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-06-12T03:01:10Z;The costly myth of the indispensable CEO;Hunter Harrison and Martin Sorrell have the Midas touch and command golden salaries;I thought I had found him: a chief executive who is the exception to the rule that no leader is indispensable.His name is Hunter Harrison. Unless you are a North American trainspotter, you have probably not heard of him.On Monday, reported the Wall Street Journal, the 72-year-old Tennesseean climbed to the stage of the historic Jefferson Hotel in Richmond, Virginia, hooked himself to an oxygen machine and reassured shareholders of railroad CSX, where he is chief executive, that he was fit to work.They rewarded him with their overwhelming backing for $84m in repayment of the pay he had forfeited on leaving Canadian Pacific, another rail company, in January.Two days later, another pugnacious 72-year-old — Sir Martin Sorrell, long-serving chief executive of advertising group WPP — faced his investors. Holders of 21 per cent of shares voted against his £48m pay package, or abstained, compared with more than a third in 2016, when the overall amount up for approval was a record £70.4m.Sir Martin is visibly healthier than the oxygen-sipping Mr Harrison. As I wrote in 2015, he is the Benjamin Button of advertising, looking progressively younger as he ages. But the terms on which he is paid and his indispensability are also in question. With each year that passes, as Standard Life, the big institutional investor, pointed out at the annual meeting, “the time to address succession for the CEO shortens and the necessity to do so becomes more pressing”.Mr Harrison’s case for receiving tens of millions of dollars is arguably stronger than Sir Martin’s. He has revolutionised the performance of a number of railroads, removing one doubt that hangs over one-hit leaders: can they repeat the trick at another organisation?He wrote the book — two books, in fact — on “precision railroading”, a system to improve punctuality and efficiency. To fans, he is the Eiji Toyoda of freight rail, though his ruthless approach riles unions, workers and occasionally customers.The markets have already shown how valuable they think he is. “His entering the building changes things just by itself,” Anthony Hatch, a New York-based analyst, told me. Since Mantle Ridge, an activist hedge fund, made public its plan to install Mr Harrison at CSX, the railroad’s shares have surged nearly 50 per cent.The board grudgingly appointed him in March and left investors with the choice of backing the $84m reimbursement package or losing the wizard who had already conjured up as much as $11bn of stock price appreciation. Under the circumstances — and despite Mr Harrison’s unspecified health problems — shareholders were as likely to ditch their driver as the crew of the Cannonball Express would have been to offload Casey Jones in the middle of an ambush by bandits.Sir Martin’s situation is different. He is also a hired hand but one with the skills of an entrepreneur. He built WPP to its current size from the small wire products manufacturer in which he bought a stake in 1985.Yet, like Mr Harrison, Sir Martin has acquired an aura of indispensability that shareholders are naturally reluctant to challenge as long as WPP continues to increase revenues and profit. Meanwhile, the annual circus of protest about Sir Martin’s pay packet masks the more important question raised by Standard Life of who or what comes next.The problem with the myth of the indispensable chief executive is that the more willing shareholders are to believe it, the more they have to pay to sustain it.In 1993, a newspaper in Mr Harrison’s hometown of Memphis asked why he chose railroading as a career. “Money,” he replied. “It was the best-paying job you could find if you were lucky enough to get one.”His luck has held. Having started out oiling railcar wheels, he now commands rich pay and incentives each time he takes a new railroad job.For CSX investors, though, hiring Mr Harrison is a short-term bet. Whether it pays off depends on his being there long enough to work his turnround alchemy — and give way to a successor.The evidence is that he is already having an impact. But CSX is a complex challenge. There are few safeguards in case he fails, or, worse, departs before the job is done.Both Mr Harrison and Sir Martin have an eye on their legacies. But the real proof of whether they are suffering from Ozymandian delusions or have laid down a sound future foundation will only come after they leave.In fact, the long-term success of their companies depends on their not being indispensable. Their job is to engineer a locomotive that any competent successor can drive, and agree to hand over the controls well before there is any risk of the train hitting the buffers.andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill
20;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-06-05T15:37:22Z;CSX shareholders approve $84m payout for new CEO;;"Shareholders of CSX have agreed to spend at least $84m to repay money the freight railroad’s new chief forfeited when he left his previous job.
Hunter Harrison, a celebrated rail manager, had threatened to resign if he was not reimbursed. At the company’s annual meeting on Monday, 93 per cent of shareholders approved the payment in an advisory vote.In January, Mr Harrison quit his post as chief of the Canadian Pacific railway, walking away from about $90m in compensation in return for relief from a noncompete agreement.That allowed him to team up with Mantle Ridge, an activist hedge fund, to get installed as CSX’s next chief executive with promises of bettering performance with his trademark “precision railroading” approach.Investors have driven CSX shares up nearly 50 per cent since Mr Harrison made his plans public. The CSX board hired him in March under a four-year contract.Mantle Ridge agreed to front Mr Harrison most of his cost of leaving CP in hopes that CSX would repay them $84m plus associated tax expenses. The CSX board took no position on their reimbursement request ahead of the vote.The case for reimbursement was complicated by revelations last month that Mr Harrison, 72, sometimes puffs on oxygen to help him breathe. Before his arrival he had refused the board’s request that an independent doctor review his medical records. CSX executives have said Mr Harrison is a tireless leader of the largest railroad in the eastern US.“I’ve gotten a dose of leadership from him while he had supplemental oxygen. I’ve had a dose of leadership from him when he hasn’t had supplemental oxygen. And they were equally as blunt and equally as effective,” Frank Lonegro, chief financial officer, said in late May.At Monday’s annual meeting in a Virginia hotel, Mr Harrison was on the dais, made remarks and responded to shareholder questions, CSX said.Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory group, said CSX board’s lack of involvement in the reimbursement agreement between Mantle Ridge and Mr Harrison was “highly unusual” and could create a “troubling governance precedent”.ISS nevertheless supported the payment, warning that “failure to make the reimbursement will probably lead to Harrison’s exit and the loss of the market value that accompanied his arrival.”Mr Harrison’s reputation rests on his success turning around the Illinois Central, Canadian National and CP lines over a quarter century. Executives say he has already begun to improve the performance of CSX, with trains running faster and more likely to arrive on time.The changes have enabled CSX to move freight with less equipment.The company aims for an operating ratio, or operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, in the mid-60 per cent range this year, an improvement from 69.4 per cent last year. CP’s operating ratio declined more than 20 percentage points under Mr Harrison.An advisory vote on executive pay also passed. Mr Harrison has a base salary of $2.2m per year, an annual target bonus of $2.8m and stock option awards. Mantle Ridge estimated his total compensation, apart from the reimbursement, at $68m over four years.Shareholders elected all 13 CSX board nominees including Mr Harrison and Mantle Ridge founder Paul Hilal.Shares of CSX fell 0.2 per cent after the vote to $54.43."
21;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-04-20T21:14:31Z;CSX climbs on full-year earnings projection;Railroad group’s shares notch biggest one-day jump since January;CSX shares climbed on Thursday after the biggest railroad company in the eastern US projected a 25 per cent rise in full-year earnings per share from a year ago and delivered upbeat first-quarter results.Shares in CSX jumped 5.6 per cent to $49.56 in its biggest one-day jump since January, when it was first reported that industry veteran and former Canadian Pacific chief executive Hunter Harrison could be eyeing the top job at the company.The Florida-based company, now run by Mr Harrison, said it expected full-year earnings to rise 25 per cent from the $1.81 a share reported in 2016. CSX also said profits in the first quarter increased to $362m, or 39 cents a share, in the quarter ended in March, compared with $356m, or 37 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items such as a $173m restructuring charge, adjusted earnings of 51 cents a share were above analysts’ estimates of 44 cents.Revenue for the quarter rose 10 per cent to $2.9bn, ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $2.8bn and reflecting volume growth across most of its markets. Coal volumes increased 3 per cent from a year ago.Analysts at Barclays noted that within a month of joining CSX, Mr Harrison, known for pioneering precision railroading — a strategy that involves running trains faster and closer to schedule rather than waiting for them to fill up — had delivered “tangible change”.“Purported terminal closures, lower headcount and admittedly brighter export coal prospects drive a higher outlook for CSX,” Brandon Oglenski, an analyst at Barclays, said. “We think this is the first of many favourable results to come as the company adopts the precision railroad model and a strong operationally focused culture.”CSX was not the only railroad rallying on Thursday, however. New York-listed shares in Mr Harrison’s former company, Canadian Pacific, which runs one of North America’s largest rail networks, rose 2.6 per cent to $153.78 after it posted its first increase in quarterly revenue since 2015.Revenues rose 1 per cent from a year ago to C$1.6bn in the first quarter. Earnings a share slid to C$2.93 a share, from C$3.51 in the year-ago period but exceeded analysts’ estimates.“We turned a corner in March and are now seeing positive volumes, which makes us cautiously optimistic that the demand environment is improving,” Keith Creel, chief executive, said.A drop in natural gas prices had curbed demand for coal and weighed on the top and bottom lines of freight carriers. But a rise in gas prices and expectations of softer regulations for the coal industry under President Donald Trump were expected to help revive demand for coal.Elsewhere, shares in American Express increased 5.9 per cent to $80.02 after posting a slimmer-than-expected fall in first-quarter profits and revenues, as higher cardholder spending and interest income dulled some of the impact of the loss of its co-branding relationship with Costco. That contributed 30 points to the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average.By close of trading in New York, the Dow was up 0.9 per cent to 20,578.71, while the S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent to 2,355.84. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.9 per cent to 5,916.78.
22;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;CSX shares pop on upbeat results;;Shares in CSX chugged higher on Wednesday after the biggest railroad in the eastern US posted upbeat first quarter results — its first set of earnings under new chief executive and industry veteran Hunter Harrison.Shares in the Florida-based company climbed more than 3 per cent in extended trading after the company said profits climbed to $362m or 39 cents a share in the quarter ended in March, compared with $356m or 37 cents a share in the year ago period. Adjusting for one-time items like a $173m restructuring charge, adjusted earnings of 51 cents a share, were above analysts estimates of 44 cents.Revenue for the quarter rose 10 per cent to $2.9bn, ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $2.8bn and reflecting volume growth across most of its markets.Coal volumes increased 3 per cent from a year ago, while revenues rose 31 per cent over the same period. The rise in revenue comes after declines in coal shipments took a toll on freight railroads. Indeed, despite the fourth-quarter bump, the company’s coal business slowed from $3.7bn in 2011 to about $1.8bn last year.“As the business environment continues to improve and we implement Precision Scheduled Railroading, CSX will realize these objectives while driving volume growth and achieving a new level of financial performance,” Mr Harrison said. Mr Harrison is known for pioneering precision railroading, a strategy that involves running trains faster and closer to schedule rather than waiting for them to fill up.Mr Harrison joined CSX last month from Canadian Pacific, after CSX bowed to pressure from activist hedge fund Mantle Ridge. Mr Harrison, who had unsuccessfully pursued mergers with CSX and Norfolk Southern while he was CEO of CP, also joined the board with four others including Mantle Ridge founder Paul Hilal, giving the fund nearly 40 per cent of the seats.
23;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-03-07T02:19:18Z;CSX appoints turnround expert as new chief executive;Shareholders face Harrison demand to be paid millions of dollars for lost compensation;US railroad CSX has responded to pressure from an activist hedge fund and hired an industry turnround expert as its next chief executive, but asked shareholders to decide on his demand to be paid back tens of millions of dollars forfeited after quitting his previous job.Hunter Harrison was named in the role “effective immediately”, CSX said on Monday. He will replace Michael Ward, who had planned to retire in May. The announcement brings partial closure to a speedy campaign to install Mr Harrison by activist fund Mantle Ridge, which owns a 4.9 per cent stake in the freight carrier. Mr Harrison will also join the CSX board with four others including Mantle Ridge founder Paul Hilal, giving the fund nearly 40 per cent of the seats. However, CSX shareholders will have to vote at an annual meeting on whether to reimburse Mr Harrison for lost compensation and costs he incurred when he unexpectedly left his former job running the Canadian Pacific railway to join Mantle Ridge. The payment demand includes $84m in forfeited compensation and benefits that Mantle Ridge had agreed to temporarily cover and the assumption of a tax indemnity that could be worth tens of millions of dollars. “Mr Harrison has indicated that he will resign after the 2017 annual meeting if the reimbursement and tax indemnity are not provided by CSX, and return to Mantle Ridge to protect his reimbursements,” CSX said. The resignation threat will turn the annual meeting into a verdict on Mr Harrison’s prospects. The market value of CSX has swelled by about $12bn since his plans to seek a role at the company became public in January, as investors bet he would deliver better performance. The executive, aged 72, is well known for turning round performance at three railroads using “precision railroading”, a philosophy that involves running trains faster and closer to schedule rather than waiting for them to fill up. Mr Harrison has indicated that he will resign after the 2017 annual meeting if the reimbursement and tax indemnity are not provided by CSX …After he joined CP in 2012 its operating metrics improved dramatically. Mr Harrison explored a merger between CP and CSX in 2014. “I am proud to join the dedicated and talented railroaders at CSX,” Mr Harrison said on Monday. “Together, we will implement precision scheduled railroading — a model proven to improve safety, create better service for customers, produce a proud and winning culture for employees, and generate exceptional, lasting value for shareholders.”Mr Harrison will be awarded options to purchase 9m shares of CSX to vest over four years, with half vesting based on service and half based on the achievement of performance goals. CSX shares closed at $49.79 on Monday, up 0.6 per cent. CSX, the third-largest US railroad, operates a 21,000-mile network across the eastern half of the country. While it has been hit hard by a decline in coal shipments, it also suffers by comparison to other North American lines on measures such as train speeds and the amount of time cars stand in terminals. 
24;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-03-06T23:11:02Z;CSX names new CEO, board members in deal with activist investor;;Full steam ahead?Railroad CSX has named industry veteran Hunter Harrison as its new chief executive and appointed five new directors to its board under an agreement struck with activist investor Mantle Ridge.Mr Harrison, who walked away from a lucrative job running Canadian Pacific Railway to offer his services to CSX, had been the company board’s desired candidate to replace former chief executive and chairman Michael Ward, who announced his decision to retire on February 21 and will stay on as a consultant.But the move to put Mr Harrison at the railroad’s helm hit a rough patch amid questions about pay and governance. He, CSX and Mantle Ridge had been in talks to smooth over their differences. Those discussions also included how many board members Mantle Ridge would help select.According to a statement from CSX on Monday, Mr Harrison will receive as part of his compensation package an award of incentive options to buy 9m CSX shares at its current trading price, 8m of which will be part of an inducement award under Nasdaq listing rules. The options will vest over a period of four years, the statement said, with half based on service and the other half based on whether certain goals are achieved during that period.CSX said it will seek shareholder input on two additional proposals: the payment of the $84m in compensation and benefits that Mr Harrison walked away from when he left Canadian Pacific – which Mantle Ridge has agreed to protect “on an interim basis” – as well as the requested assumption of a related tax indemnity.Mr Harrison will resign after that meeting if those two measures are not provided by CSX, and “return to Mantle Ridge to protect his reimbursements,” the company said in a statement.The five new board members will include Mr Harrison, Mantle Ridge’s founder and chief executive Paul Hilal, Dennis Reilley, Linda Riefler and John Zillmer. The board’s current presiding director, Edward Kelly, will become the board’s chairman, while Mr Hilal will serve as vice-chair.Mr Harrison said in a statement:“I am proud to join the dedicated and talented railroaders at CSX. Together, we will implement Precision Scheduled Railroading – a model proven to improve safety, create better service for customers, produce a proud and winning culture for employees, and generate exceptional, lasting value for shareholders.”
25;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-02-27T10:43:31Z;Executive pay: Working on the railway;Even the best chief executives need to be reminded for whom they work;Quitting one job without having another one sewn up is always risky — even for acclaimed chief executives.Railway honcho Hunter Harrison rashly left his perch at Canadian Pacific Railway in January, leaving tens of millions of unvested compensation on the table.Shortly thereafter, he seemed to have secured the top slot at US operator, CSX, whose shares appreciated by nearly a third as investors looked forward to Mr Harrison’s famed “precision scheduled railroading” system boosting its stagnant profits.But Mr Harrison has not yet signed on the dotted line, and for now remains just another older white male out of work in a blue-collar industry.CSX’s current boss has announced his retirement, so Mr Harrison’s eventual appointment seems a foregone conclusion.But CSX is none too pleased at the demands of Mr Harrison and his sponsor Mantle Ridge, the activist investor turned executive search agency. CSX is asking shareholders to participate in a non-binding vote to render judgment on Mr Harrison’s hardball.CSX pegs Mr Harrison’s compensation demand at $300m, a figure he disputes.Mantle Ridge had previously said it would make good the money and tax benefits he left behind when he quit Canadian Pacific. But it is asking CSX shareholders to foot the $100m bill for the promises it has made.There is a separate disagreement over how to value the stock options Mr Harrison wants, because CSX shares rallied before his employment commenced.Finally, CSX believes Mantle Ridge is attempting to wrest control of the board through new appointments that give it effective control despite holding only 5 per cent of the shares.The fund and Mr Harrison believe they have the company over a barrel. The share price rise backs them up.In this sense, the proposed referendum is a canny countermove. If shareholders think Mr Harrison deserves such a package they can voice their approval, thus absolving the board from responsibility for such a lavish package.The issue will probably not make it to a vote. Settlement talks continue. The company is aware of the rally in its shares and wants Mr Harrison’s services. Expect each to give a little and declare joint victory.The episode is a reminder that tight labour markets put job seekers in control but also that even superstar CEOs still answer to shareholders.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
26;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-02-27T10:20:28Z;US rail operator CSX puts brakes on Hunter Harrison’s demands;Proposed hiring of former Canadian Pacific chief hits snag on compensation package;A blue diesel locomotive lumbering over a trestle in New Jersey is easily passed by trucks on an adjacent highway. It is owned by CSX, the third largest freight railroad in North America by revenue and also one of the slowest.A star manager in the North American rail industry now wants to pick up the pace at the group, which has train speeds averaging about 20mph on its 21,000-mile network.Hunter Harrison walked away from a lucrative job running Canadian Pacific Railway to offer his services to CSX last month. The question for CSX investors is if he is worth the price, including a compensation demand which it says adds up to $300m.The CSX board wants Mr Harrison to be its next chief executive, it said earlier this month.But it was not prepared to accede to what it called “extraordinary requests” from him and the activist investor backing him, Mantle Ridge. Last week, CSX extended for a second time the deadline for nominating board directors, a sign that the two sides are still negotiating.Mr Harrison, 72, is the father of “precision railroading”, a set of practices that banished orthodoxies — such as waiting for trains to fill before departure — to focus on running them on time.After he was installed at CP in 2012 by Pershing Square, the activist hedge fund led by Bill Ackman, train speeds quickened and the operating ratio, a measure of profitability, shifted from worst to second best among its peers. CP and CSX are different, however. CP runs trains across the vast open spaces of Canada, dipping into the northern US. CSX trackage twists like spaghetti though packed communities of the US east. Success in Alberta may be tougher to achieve in places such as Jersey City, New Jersey, where the slow-moving locomotive was spotted on the trestle, analysts say. “CSX, and eastern railroading, are probably the most complex freight railroading in the world,” said Anthony Hatch, analyst with ABH Consulting. CSX has also been hit hard by the loss of coal shipments as power stations burn more natural gas. Under Michael Ward, chief executive since 2003, the railroad has acknowledged that coal volumes may never return and launched the “CSX of Tomorrow,” a plan that involves bifurcating its system into primary and local networks and expanding in businesses such as large standard container shipping.Investors are betting Mr Harrison will soon be executing his own plan instead. Shares in the Jacksonville, Florida-based company have leapt more than 30 per cent since January 18, when he forfeited C$118m (US$90m) in benefits at CP to team up with Mantle Ridge, led by Paul Hilal, a former Ackman associate.Last week CSX announced Mr Ward will retire in May and said it would fire 1,000 of its 4,500 managers by next month.CP’s operating ratio was 58.6 per cent last year, down from 83.3 in 2012. By contrast, at CSX it was 69.4 per cent in 2016, 1.2 percentage points lower than in 2012.Mr Harrison, who led the Illinois Central and Canadian National railroads before joining CP, has long proclaimed his philosophy was universal. When CP last year unsuccessfully attempted to take over Norfolk Southern, another eastern US network, the company wrote: “Precision railroading is a set of non-discriminating principles that can be effectively applied to any railroad in the world.”In a letter to the CSX board, Mr Hilal said precision railroading would require “dramatic operational and cultural change”.At Mr Harrison’s CP this included the disappearance of thousands of jobs. “They harass, humiliate, badger and fire the employees. They’ve created a culture of fear at CP,” said Douglas Finnson, president of Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, a labour union.CSX, and eastern railroading, are probably the most complex freight railroading in the worldTalks between CSX and Mr Harrison and Mantle Ridge have been stuck on pay and governance.CSX has said Mr Harrison wants compensation equal to $300m, including $84m to pay for the amount Mantle Ridge promised to cover his forgone compensation at CP. Mantle Ridge disputes the amount, arguing it overstates the value of his proposed stock options.Mr Harrison, whose equity award would vest if he died, refused to allow a CSX-appointed doctor to review his medical records, the railway company said. The parties have also jousted over how many new board directors Mantle Ridge will help select.The dispute may go before shareholders at a special meeting called by CSX. But many analysts now see Mr Harrison’s arrival in Jacksonville as a fait accompli, not least because CSX’s market value has grown by about $10bn purely on speculation over his arrival.“It seems to us that shareholders have already voted for this change,” said BMO Capital Markets.
27;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-02-21T14:38:16Z;CSX chief Michael Ward to retire as activist pushes Hunter Harrison for top job;;US railroad operator CSX announced on Tuesday that its chief executive Michael Ward would retire on May 31, after 14 years at the helm, as talks with activist investor Mantle Ridge continue about installing rail veteran Hunter Harrison at the helm.The company also said that Clarence Gooden would retire as president from the company at the same time and that Fredrik Eliasson has been appointed as president effective February 15. Mr Eliasson is a 22-year veteran at the company who currently serves as chief sales and marketing officer.“Michael has helped build CSX into one of the nation’s leading transportation and logistics companies, and Clarence has similarly provided valuable leadership across CSX’s sales, marketing and operations teams,” Edward Kelly presiding director at CSX, said. “We wish both the best in their retirements.”The move comes as New York hedge fund Mantle Ridge, which has an approximate 4.9 per cent stake in the company, has been laying plans to shake up the company alongside Hunter Harrison who stepped down as chief executive at rival Canadian Pacific earlier this year.Mr Harrison is known in the industry as an advocate of “precision railroading,” or moving trains to their destinations as quickly as possible rather than waiting for them to fill. Under Mr Harrison, CP unsuccessfully pursued mergers with CSX and Norfolk Southern, the other main network in the east. He was brought to CP by Paul Hilal, Mantle Ridge’s founder, when Mr Hilal worked at Bill Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square.Mr Hilal said in a letter to CSX last week that he was looking to be the sole Mantle Ridge representative on the board. At the time he added that Mr Harrison would seek a compensation package of about $32m per year for four years if he took the helm at CSX and that the move would include a one-time cost of between $84m to $103m to release him from his non-compete agreement with CP.CSX said on Tuesday that Mr Eliasson’s appointment was part of a “an orderly transition” that its board has been considering “for more than a year”. It added:The appointment of Mr. Eliasson as President is not intended to preempt or otherwise affect any discussions CSX may continue to have with Mr. Hunter Harrison and Mantle Ridge regarding Mr. Harrison becoming the CEO at CSX.CSX shares, which have advanced more than 35 per cent this year on hopes of a shake-up, were little changed.
28;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-01-19T22:25:30Z;Tesla rallies after analyst brings forward Model 3 launch forecast;Railway stocks gain ground but all three main US indices retreat;Tesla shares rallied on Thursday after analysts at Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock, pointing to a revised timeline for the launch of the carmaker’s mass market Model 3 electric vehicle and possible benefits under Donald Trump’s administration.Shares in Tesla rose 2.3 per cent to $243.76 after Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “equalweight” and lifted his price target by 26 per cent to $305. The move welled the bullish Tesla camp on Wall Street, with eight “buy” ratings, 10 “hold” ratings and 6 “sell” ratings, according to Bloomberg data.Following discussions with management and suppliers after a visit to Tesla’s Gigafactory, Mr Jonas now expects the Model 3 electric vehicle to have a soft launch in the fourth quarter, a year earlier than his previous forecast. He also boosted his projections for fiscal 2018 Model 3 volumes to 183,000 cars, from 114,000 previously.He also cited three other reasons for the move. First, he argued that “the market is moving Tesla’s way on electric vehicles” as more carmakers adopt them as part of their core strategy. Second, he noted that technology groups like Google-parent Alphabet and Apple have pulled back their efforts in the space, reducing competitive pressure on Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company.Finally, he argued that Tesla was at “the epicentre of US high-tech manufacturing job creation” and that the company could stand to benefit under Mr Trump’s administration that has pledged to keep manufacturing jobs in America.“Elon Musk has an important line of communication to Donald Trump through his role as a strategic adviser to the president-elect,” Mr Jonas said. “While we cannot explicitly apply a monetary value to this relationship, we believe this level of co-ordination with the new administration could actually evolve into greater strategic value than with the prior administration.”Tesla’s rally came as US stocks drifted lower on Thursday amid signs that the Trump trade is waning. At the close in New York, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent to 2,263.6 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined 0.4 per cent to 19,732.4. The Nasdaq Composite had shed 0.3 per cent lower at 5,540.Railway stocks were also in focus after Hunter Harrison, Canadian Pacific chief executive, unexpectedly announced that he would step down five months earlier than planned, triggering speculation that the rail industry could be the focus of another attempt at consolidation.Shares in CSX, which operates the largest railway network east of the Mississippi, surged 23.4 per cent to $45.51 after a report said that Mr Harrison was teaming up with activist investor Paul Hilal to try and shake up management at the company.Norfolk Southern, the second-biggest rail operator in the eastern US by network size that CP also tried to take over last year, also saw its shares advance, up 4.1 per cent to $114.42, while those of Union Pacific rose 2.4 per cent to $106.24.Meanwhile, Netflix shares jumped 3.9 per cent to $138.41 after the video streaming site behind hit shows like The Crown and House of Cards said that its global subscriber growth had exceeded estimates in the fourth quarter.
29;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-01-19T19:42:28Z;CSX shares soar as rail industry veteran takes aim;Hunter Harrison quits as Canadian Pacific chief to pursue new rail opportunities;Shares of CSX, the biggest railroad in the eastern US, soared by the most on record after it emerged that an executive with a reputation for efficiency was laying plans to shake up the company.Hunter Harrison announced on Wednesday he was stepping down as chief executive of Canadian Pacific, the Calgary-based railroad he has led since 2012. Under Mr Harrison, CP unsuccessfully pursued mergers with CSX and Norfolk Southern, the other main network in the east.The Wall Street Journal later reported he was finalising an agreement to team up with Mantle Ridge, a New York hedge fund established last year by a former associate of activist investor Bill Ackman, to try to shake up CSX management. Mantle Ridge has raised more than $1bn with a five-year lock-up for a single stock position, said a person close to the firm.CSX climbed by nearly a fifth to an all-time high of $43.90 on Thursday, with Norfolk Southern up more than 4 per cent. CSX said its board and management supported the current strategy, but would “evaluate Mantle Ridge’s views” and looked forward to “discussing our core strategy” with the hedge fund. Norfolk Southern and Mantle Ridge declined to comment.Like other US freight railroads, CSX has been pummelled by declines in coal shipments as power plants burn more natural gas. Last year, the Jacksonville, Florida-based railroad’s coal revenue fell 20 per cent to $1.8bn.Mr Harrison, 72, is legendary in the railroad industry as an advocate of “precision railroading,” or moving trains to their destinations as quickly as possible rather than waiting for them to fill. He was brought to CP by Paul Hilal, Mantle Ridge’s founder, when Mr Hilal worked at Mr Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square.CP said he would forfeit C$118m (US$89m) in awards and benefits by stepping down and be replaced by Keith Creel, company president. Mr Harrison had approached CP’s board to discuss his retirement as he sought to “pursue opportunities involving other Class 1 railroads,” the biggest North American carriers, the company said, adding that “CP will have no role in Mr Harrison’s future endeavours”.Under Michael Ward, chief executive, CSX has improved performance, touting an operating ratio — or operating costs as a share of revenue — of below 70 per cent for two straight years. CP’s operating ratio was 58.6 per cent last year.David Vernon, analyst at Bernstein, said: “CSX continues to operate at an operating ratio in the high-60s, and based on Mr Harrison’s track record we think the market will dream about what could happen should the precision railroading approach and more aggressive change arrive in Jacksonville.”CSX, which originated around the coal fields of Appalachia, has a network stretching east from the Mississippi river between Montreal and Miami. CP extends from Vancouver to New York state. At CP, Mr Harrison argued the virtues of consolidation among North America’s largest railroads.Anthony Hatch of ABH Consulting, a rail analyst, said Mr Harrison’s move would not necessarily lead to further consolidation. “This is not a covert M&A attempt,” he said. He added that the company has dramatically improved operations since 2014. “Like Melville’s great white whale, CSX is not a weak fish,” Mr Hatch said.

Hunter Harrison, a 72-year-old railways executive, has absorbed this message.He resigned late on Wednesday as the chief executive of Canadian Pacific Railway after a successful five-year stint. But he is not retiring. Nervous rivals may soon wish he was.Mr Harrison was installed at the behest of Bill Ackman after a proxy fight that was one of the activist investor’s greatest financial successes.The veteran businessman is now leaving his contract early, forsaking $C118m in pay. Canadian Pacific is withholding this because their erstwhile leader is not going off to play shuffleboard in Florida. Instead, another activist investor wants him to ply his skills at a larger North American railway, CSX.Investors, who prioritise money over life experience, bid up CSX shares by a fifth, or $6bn, on news that Mr Harrison may parachute in.This wily operator had been seeking a bigger challenge for years by more demanding means. Canadian Pacific has, unsolicited, tried to force separate mergers with CSX and Norfolk Southern to build a transcontinental network.Earnings across the sector have suffered in recent years as commodity volumes shrunk, with coal a particular black spot. Weak growth has put the emphasis on cost cuts. Canadian Pacific’s 2016 operating ratio (total operating costs to sales) of 59 per cent has improved by several percentage points in recent years. CSX just reported a ratio ten points higher.*Mr Harrison now joins forces with a hedge fund formed by an acolyte of Mr Ackman keen to install him at CSX. Shareholders in the group enthuse not only at the prospect of landing Mr Harrison, but doing so without the heartburn of a risky merger.Six rival businesses, whose shares also rose on Thursday, must mull consolidation, perhaps involving CSX. The financial wellbeing of shareholders should benefit from Mr Harrison’s decision to prioritise work over relaxation.* This note has been amended to make clear Canadian Pacific’s operating ratio is not the lowest in the industryEmail the Lex team at lex@ft.com

The company reportedly rebuffed a second approach from CP last year.Shares in CSX spiked after the Wall Street Journal reported that Mr Harrison is teaming up with activist investor Paul Hilal, who left William Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management to launch his own fund last year. According to the report, the plan is to try and put Mr. Harrison in a senior management position at CSX.Mr Harrision is well familiar with Mr Ackman. He became chief executive of CP after Pershing Square ousted the previous CEO in a 2012 proxy fight.Norfolk Southern, the second-biggest rail operator in the eastern US by network size that CP also tried to take over last year for a second time, also saw its shares advanced 3.6 per cent in pre-market trading.Union Pacific shares gained 2 per cent ahead of the bell.
32;CSX;CSX Corp;2017-01-17T21:49:45Z;CSX revenues rise more than forecast;;US railroad operator CSX reported that its net profits slid while revenues climbed more than expected in the fourth quarter.The Florida-based company said its profits were $458m, or 49 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $466m or 48 cents a share in the year-ago period. CSX earnings were impacted by a debt financing charge offset by a property sale. Earnings also benefitted from an extra accounting week during the reporting period.Revenue climbed 9 per cent to $3.04bn, as coal revenues rose 23 per cent on a GAAP basis.Analysts were looking for earnings of 49 cents a share, on sales of $2.9bn.The industry continued to face headwinds last year from a strong US dollar and low global commodity prices. Despite the fourth-quarter bump, the company’s coal business has slowed from $3.7bn in 2011 to about $1.8bn last year. Coal prices dropped last year as companies increasingly turned to cheaper, more environmentally friendly alternatives like natural gas, which has hurt the coal volumes that help drive the rail industry.Shares in railway operators have benefitted from Donald Trump’s win in hopes that increased infrastructure spending could boost traffic. CSX shares, which surged more than 38 per cent last year, were down 2.8 per cent in extended trading.
33;CSX;CSX Corp;2016-12-06T04:30:47Z;Legal teams are paying their way;The impact of company lawyers is growing as they achieve measurable effects;"Chief executives and their general counsel have often struggled to put a value on what a legal team does for the business. When asked, their response is usually a laugh or a sigh, and comments such as “it’s difficult and imprecise” or “it’s downright impossible”.They can quantify budget cuts and money saved, but few have the numbers or the means to measure accurately a legal team’s contribution.At least, that used to be the case. Chief executives and general counsel of the most innovative teams who took part in this report had no trouble describing precisely where their legal departments contributed to the overall success of the business. Many also talked in depth about the data they are now collecting and analysing to measure that value.Pat Gelsinger, chief executive of VMware, the technology company, says: “While any legal department has to guarantee that risk is minimised, ours also creates value. There are metrics associated with everything they do.”It is not all about measuring costs. For example, the detailed metrics that the legal team collects on new customer contracts are used by the business to understand how well it is meeting the needs of its customers.Data showed VMware’s legal team how to simplify every step of the company’s contract drafting, negotiations and approval process. The team then replaced complex agreements with simpler language. They also reviewed and analysed terms that had been used in previous contracts and removed those where the company always made concessions, saving hours of costly and time-consuming legal negotiation.The time it takes to sign a new customer contract has halved, helping the business do deals more quickly and improving the customer experience.Drawing on the experience of her parents running their own business, and also on her time serving on active duty in the US Navy, VMware general counsel Dawn Smith tries to bring a business mindset to her role. “Unless we run ourselves as a business, are in charge of our own destiny, and can keep costs under control, then in five years someone will come and slash our budgets,” she says.A legal operations team that Ms Smith created five years ago started by improving how it allocated work, outsourcing, e-billing and its management of outside law firms. But over time, the focus has moved to developing a strategy on collecting details of workloads, outcomes, cycle times, responsiveness and other useful information from the various new technologies the company has implemented.Legal operations may not be the first place to look for eye-catching innovation, but it is arguably where the most important changes in the industry are happening. The proportion of North American companies with legal operations personnel — the staff assigned the task of managing the people, process and technology aspects of lawyers’ work — doubled to 48 per cent in 2015, according to a survey by the Association of Corporate Counsel. That figure is expected to jump again this year.Driving transformation in business and industryInnovative in-house legal teamsInnovation in unlocking and delivering valueNew products and techniquesGreat legal ideasManaging complexity and scaleSuch operational roles are likely to become even more important and influential as advances in technology affect almost every aspect of legal services.Aine Lyons, VMware’s head of legal operations, says that “although we all recognise that the nature of legal service delivery has fundamentally changed, we are still figuring out what the implications of these changes are and how to respond to them”.The legal team at publisher Hearst Corp­oration is currently training and coding a machine learning tool named Charlotte. Eventually, it will be able to create non-disclosure agreements with a few simple instructions and support the in-house team to take on complex litigation and M&A deals.These kinds of operational innovations will have far-reaching effects on the legal industry by enabling in-house departments to handle more complex work more efficiently instead of using law firms. They also free in-house lawyers to concentrate on more complex strategic work.For instance, Nasdaq’s legal and regulatory team has long invested in technology and process, and this year it tops a new ranking in the report, on driving transformation in business and industry more widely.Led by general counsel Edward Knight, Nasdaq’s legal and regulatory group not only supports the business, but is an architect of many of its successes.The team, which includes a market surveillance arm, provides consulting services to regulators and exchanges around the world.Recently, it worked with Nasdaq’s technology team to develop the proposal for its new dark pool hosting business, Ocean.Nasdaq signed Goldman Sachs as Ocean’s first client in October.Individual winner:

34;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
35;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;CSX posts upbeat earnings despite coal woes;;US railroad operator CSX reported upbeat third quarter earnings as cost cutting measures and low fuel prices helped take the sting out of a sharp drop in coal shipping volume.The Florida-based company said profits slid to $455m or 48 cents a share, compared with $507m or 52 cents a share in the year ago quarter. Sales declined 8 per cent to $2.7bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of 45 cents a share, on sales of $2.7bn.CSX said revenues declined as volumes of coal carloads fell 21 per cent and total volume slipped 8 per cent but lower costs helped prevent a steeper drop in profits.“CSX continues to drive strong cost performance and efficiency in this dynamic market environment while meeting or exceeding customer expectations,” chief executive Michael J. Ward, said.The operator, which has previously spurned takeover attempts by Canadian Pacific, has suffered as the US dollar has strengthened and demand for coal has weakened. Moreover, railroad operators have also suffered as oil cargo shipments by rail have declined and as they have lost some business to the trucking industry this year.CSX shares, which have climbed 16 per cent so far this year, rose 2.6 per cent in extended trading.
36;CSX;CSX Corp;2016-06-16T15:24:03Z;Tradepoint Atlantic seeks to shake up US ports;Company aims to become main trade hub on eastern seaboard, with good links to road and rail;It would be easy to mistake the scene at Sparrows Point, a five-square-mile waterfront site just outside Baltimore, Maryland, for a case of simple post-industrial neglect. Weeds grow around the edges of many of the quays at the port on the site, which once employed 30,000 people and was home to a steel mill. The few surviving buildings stand amid a wasteland so desolate that even the slightest wind produces conditions like a desert dust storm.But the presence in the port of the STH Athens, a dry bulk carrying ship, testifies that the site is, slowly, coming back to life. Hilco Global and Redwood Capital, two US financial investors, are gradually turning the vast facility into a port, distribution and logistics facility named Tradepoint Atlantic.The project promises to be the only sizeable entirely privately-owned port development on the US east coast. The investors believe the availability of so much space on a site linked to sea, rail and road transport can transform how goods are distributed around the US north-east. They expect their investments, together with those of customers, to reach $1bn over the next 10 years.“It’s a global trade point, where we plan to do a great number of things for different industries,” says Kerry Doyle, vice-president for finance of the new venture.Some of Tradepoint’s plans will increase competition for the nearby Port of Baltimore, owned by the public-sector Maryland Port Administration. But James White, the MPA’s executive director, welcomes the potential for the facility to attract new capital to the area and generate extra maritime traffic.“That’s darn encouraging from where I sit — that you can grow maritime trade without having to invest government dollars,” says Mr White.The question, according to Neil Davidson, analyst at Drewry Shipping Consultants, is whether shipping lines and other transport companies will be prepared to scrap their current arrangements and move to Tradepoint.“There are an awful lot of very well-established container ports on the US east coast who will be very reluctant to allow any loss of market share,” he adds.The investors have taken the site on partly because they have re-evaluated the risks and rewards of a site with such a long, complex history. Sparrows Point was operated for most of its 124 years by Bethlehem Steel, a steel producer that left the site littered with potentially harmful substances when it filed for bankruptcy in 2001. A succession of subsequent owners tried and failed to make a success of the steel mill before production finally ceased with the bankruptcy of RG Steel in 2012.There are an awful lot of very well-established container ports on the US east coast who will be very reluctant to allow any loss of market shareUntil Hilco submitted its bid in 2014, investors interested in the site were deterred by the potential costs of mounting an environmental clean-up. Hilco was consequently able to buy the site, which was sold after the Bethlehem bankruptcy for $950m, for just $72m. Redwood joined the project subsequently.Bethlehem left behind some useful assets. For example, the yard on the site’s north side is currently hosting hundreds of rail tank cars that have no work because of the oil price fall.Michael Moore, chief executive of the project, highlights how Bethlehem built more than 100 miles of rail track, connected to both Norfolk Southern and CSX, the eastern US’s two biggest railroads, as well as the site’s port facilities.The transport connections are already producing new customers. Work is under way near the rail yard on a new logistics facility for FedEx, the express parcel service, which was attracted by the site’s direct connection to the US interstate highway network. This month, Tradepoint announced a deal with Pasha Automotive Services, which handles car imports for manufacturers, to start landing vehicles for Fiat Chrysler at Tradepoint from July.We can consolidate cars here [heading everywhere] from Virginia to Newark. That’s a huge differentiatorSpace at Tradepoint is so plentiful, according to Mr Moore, that it should allow companies like Pasha to cut out calls at other ports in the north-eastern US and run their distribution from Sparrows Point.“We can consolidate cars here [heading everywhere] from Virginia to Newark,” Mr Moore says. “That’s a huge differentiator.”There remains considerable uncertainty for the project. While the investors have not disclosed how much they have put into the project so far, Mr Doyle is only now embarking on raising the business’s first outside capital. It also remains uncertain, according to Mr Davidson, how traffic patterns on the US east coast will change once the Panama Canal expands to allow larger vessels later this month.The “$64,000 question”, Mr Davidson says, is whether US east coast ports gain market share from west coast rivals.Nevertheless, Mr Doyle predicts the project will not only transform goods movements in its immediate area but also provide a model for other, similar sites in the future.“We see this as an investment thesis,” he says. “We feel this can be replicated elsewhere.”
37;CSX;CSX Corp;2016-06-06T17:29:25Z;US economy: capital punishment;Investors in capital-intensive sectors will hope US data are misleading;Last week Brent crude futures closed above $50 for the first time since November. Sighs of relief all round: how bad can the economy be when fuel prices are rising? Then came the lousy US job numbers on Friday: maybe it can be pretty bad, after all. And the jobs data are not the only sign that the commodity bounce does not reflect strong US output.Data from the Association of American Railroads reveal startlingly low demand for carload and container shipments since the beginning of the year. This can be explained, in some part, by producers’ unwillingness to ship coal and petroleum products at the low prices prevailing earlier in the year. Lower raw material costs should provide a boost to manufacturing and building, though. This does not seem to be working. The Federal Reserve reported in April that the year-on-year increase in total dollars spent for building construction and improvement is among the lowest observed since the financial crisis. The Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index is hovering near post-crisis lows, having dipped below 50 (indicating contraction) five times in the past year.The railway sector has already taken its lumps, although stocks such as CSX and Union Pacific have recovered somewhat since the beginning of the year. Not all sectors that should be sensitive to weak industrial activity have suffered, though. The ratio of prices to historic earnings in the capital goods sector has pushed out to 20, compared with a one-year average of 18.The likes of Illinois Tool Works and Stanley Black & Decker, for example — both sought-after, high-quality stocks with attractive dividends and limited commodity exposure — are up nicely over the past year. This looks odd, if US housing and industrial activity is rolling over. And the economic data are at least consistent with such a slowdown.Economies are devilishly hard to predict. Talk of “leading indicators” is misleading in most every case. Some stock prices, however, look like a poor fit with where the economy appears to be right now.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
38;CSX;CSX Corp;2016-04-12T20:21:32Z;CSX profits meet expectations as costs slide;;US railroad operator CSX reported first quarter earnings that were in line with estimates as costs slipped. But the company said it continues to expect full-year earnings to decline in 2016 as low commodity prices and strength in the US dollar weigh on its business.The Florida-based company said profits fell to $356m or 37 cents a share, compared with $442m or 45 cents a share in the year ago period. That came in line with analysts’ expectations.A 12 per cent decline in costs driven by gains in efficiency alongside a drop in fuel prices helped CSX profits meet estimates.Revenue fell 14 per cent to $2.6bn, just shy of estimates for $2.7bn.Coal volumes declined 31 per cent as strength in the US dollar and oversupply limited competitiveness for the commodity in global markets.Michael Ward, chief executive, said:While CSX delivered strong efficiency gains in the first quarter, we continue to expect full-year earnings per share to decline in 2016 as a result of ongoing coal headwinds combined with other market fundamentals.CSX shares, which have declined 31 per cent since the beginning of last year, were little changed in extended trading.
39;CSX;CSX Corp;2016-04-11T13:27:57Z;Canadian Pacific ends Norfolk Southern pursuit;Rail company accepts defeat for second time in attempt at rival takeover;Canadian Pacific, the rail company backed by Bill Ackman, the activist investor, on Monday accepted defeat for the second time in 18 months in an effort to take over a rival when it abandoned its pursuit of Norfolk Southern.CP said it was abandoning all its steps to merge with NS, the second-biggest rail operator in the eastern US by network size, including a motion at NS’s forthcoming annual meeting urging directors to consider CP’s approach.The pursuit of NS, which became public in November, followed a similar quest by CP in October 2014 to win over CSX, the biggest railroad in the eastern US. That was also abandoned.CP went on an intensive lobbying drive to attempt to force the NS board to consider seriously its offer, which offered NS shareholders $32.86 per share cash and 47 per cent of a new, merged company.NS valued the offer at $91.62 per share, or $27.3bn in total equity value, while CP insisted it was worth between $125 and $140 a share.“No further financial offers or overtures to meet with the NS board of directors are planned at this time,” CP said on Monday.The company also appeared to rule out further attempts at consolidation among the seven large railroads — known as Class Is — that dominate the rail industry in the US and Canada.CP argued in its pursuit of NS and CSX that further consolidation was vital to ease congestion on the network, which carries about 40 per cent of the two countries’ interurban freight movements.Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive, said the company had “long recognised” that consolidation was necessary for the rail industry to “meet the demands of a growing economy”.But he went on: “With no clear path to a friendly merger at this time, we will turn all of our focus and energy to serving our customers and creating long-term value for CP shareholders.”NS issued a statement trumpeting its progress on making cost savings to improve profitability — a point on which CP had criticised the company.“We thank our shareholders for their input and support throughout this process and our employees for their hard work and dedication to strengthening Norfolk Southern as a critical component of the nation’s transportation infrastructure.”Pershing Square, Mr Ackman’s fund, was until recently the biggest shareholder in CP and installed Mr Harrison — a former chief executive of Canadian National Railway — after ousting the previous CP management in a proxy battle in 2012.With no clear path to a friendly merger at this time, we will turn all of our focus and energy to serving our customers and creating long-term value for CP shareholdersCP has said a merger with either CSX or NS would allow for smoother rail movements across all of the US and Canada by eliminating large numbers of interchanges between companies around Chicago, where all Class Is’ networks meet.Mr Ackman had personally argued vigorously in favour of a merger. The deal’s abandonment marks a further setback for the activist investor following his backing of Valeant, the indebted drug company.Both NS and CSX have insisted that the Surface Transportation Board, the industry regulator, was so unlikely to approve a merger that it was not worth considering. The industry’s last significant merger took place in 1999, when NS and CSX jointly took over Conrail, the formerly-nationalised operator in the eastern US, and divided its assets between them.Mr Harrison, one of the North American rail industry’s most respected figures, has argued that he could significantly improve operations at other railroads by applying the methods he used to turn round CP and, previously, CN.NS shares were down 1.2 per cent in pre-market trading, at $80.51.
40;CSX;CSX Corp;2016-03-06T22:28:03Z;Oscar Munoz to return as United Continental chief;Chief suffered heart attack soon after taking over at US airline;United Continental chief executive Oscar Munoz, who suffered a heart attack soon after being thrust into the role, plans to return to full-time duty next week, the company said.Mr Munoz was appointed CEO in September 2015 after his predecessor resigned amid a US investigation into the US airline’s involvement with the agency that operates the New York area’s main airports. In October he suffered a heart attack, and received a heart transplant while on leave. Brett Hart, general counsel, has been serving as acting chief though United said Sunday that Mr Munoz has been participating “in all major corporate decisions”. He will resume his roles as president and chief executive on March 14, Chicago-based United said. Mr Munoz was previously chief operating officer of railroad group CSX. Already a United director, he replaced Jeff Smisek, who resigned in connection with a federal probe of transactions between United and the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, whose airports includes United’s big hub at Newark Liberty International. In the fourth quarter of 2015 United’s operating profit rose 73 per cent to $1.1bn as factors including a sharp drop in jet fuel prices offset lower passenger and cargo revenue. However, the yield — revenue earned per passenger mile — declined by 7.2 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2014, which United blamed in part on a strong dollar and less flying by energy company customers hurt by low oil prices. Under Mr Munoz, United has been trying to rectify a poor reputation for customer service, taking steps including returning free snacks to cabins and providing premium coffee. Mr Munoz said in a statement: “Since September when I became CEO, our team has been focused on our employees, improving the operation and the customer experience, and the results are starting to show.” He added that United spent $1.2bn to repurchase shares in 2015 and intends to buy back another $1.5bn in the first quarter of 2016. Since Mr Munoz’s appointment on September 8, United’s shares have risen 1 per cent to close at $58 on Friday.
41;CSX;CSX Corp;2016-03-01T23:15:38Z;CSX shares jump on Canadian bid hopes;;Shares in US railway operator CSX spiked by as much as 8 per cent following a report that rival Canadian Pacific Railway has revived its failed attempt to buy the company.CSX, which operates the largest railroad network east of the Mississippi, had rejected an earlier approach from Canadian Pacific back in October 2014. But according to the Wall Street Journal, the Canadian rail operator, which is currently in talks to try and take over Norfolk Southern, has recently made another approach for CSX, which the latter has also reportedly rebuffed.Both CSX and NS have resisted Canadian Pacific’s approach, citing regulatory concerns and potential severe service disruptions.With a market capitalisation of C$25.56bn ($19bn), Canadian Pacific is smaller than both CSX ($23.6bn) and Norfolk Southern ($22bn).A spokesman for CSX told the FT the company would not comment on merger speculation.
42;CSX;CSX Corp;2016-01-14T13:05:23Z;Commodities slide triggers ‘freight recession’ on US rails;Slowdown arrives across the western US farm belt;On the railways criss-crossing the western US farm belt, grain trains are so abundant you can’t give one away.Big agricultural commodity traders have been offering as much as $200 per covered hopper car to anyone willing to sublet their 110-car shuttle trains. “You actually have to pay someone to take your cars,” says Dan Mack, vice-president of agricultural transportation and terminals at CHS, a large US grain merchant.Spare capacity in the US freight rail system underlines the breadth of a commodities rout that just entered its sixth year. Grain trains are plentiful partly because of declines in US coal and oil production that have freed locomotives and crews hauling those commodities. The strengthening dollar has also whacked international demand for US coal and grain, curbing shipments for export.The “freight recession” — as Michael Ward, chief executive of the CSX railway, called it this week — is unsettling for investors. The Dow Jones Transportation Average has declined 10.5 per cent this year, worse than the already jarring retreat of the US stock market. People who view stocks of railways, trucking companies and airlines as a barometer for equities investment have taken notice.“The transports are definitely flashing a big red warning sign,” says Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, a broker.The soft rail freight market is a huge change from two years ago. Then, terrible winter weather and booming volumes of cargoes of shale oil and fracking sand contributed to delays. General Mills, the maker of Cheerios breakfast cereal, complained of congestion. Cargill, the world’s biggest agricultural trader, faced a rail car shortage.“Now we’re facing the opposite,” says Mr Mack. “We’ve seen the decline in demand for multiple commodities. It has opened up a tremendous amount of transportation capacity. If you’re a shipper, you went from a famine to a feast.”Individual commodity markets, often viewed in isolation, are connected through transportation economics. Shipments of US coal, the biggest commodity moved by rail, declined 12 per cent to 5.1m carloads in 2015, according to the Association of American Railroads.The decline came as coal lost out to cheap natural gas as a source of fuel at power plants. Prices for US coal fell sharply last year and miner Arch Coal sought bankruptcy protection this week.As a price slide worsens, oil output from most shale basins has gone in reverse and less crude is also rolling down the tracks. Some traders are storing excess crude in rail tank cars parked near trading hubs, a senior commodities executive says.The tumult in fossil fuels has thus fed through to grain markets. With ample capacity on the rails, shipping costs have plummeted: the per-bushel cost to carry spring wheat from North Dakota to the Pacific coast has dropped by a third in the past two years, US Department of Agriculture data show.The secondary market for shuttle trains on the Burlington North Santa Fe and Union Pacific railways, which dart between the western farm belt and grain customers, illustrates the situation.The market allows big grain traders to reassign trains they had hired to others, for a negotiated price. In early 2014, grain companies with a train to spare could command $6,000 per car above the official railway tariff, traders say. Today, to avoid hefty contract cancellation fees, they are instead paying others to use their unwanted trains.“Basically, the grain industry oversupplied themselves with cars,” says John Crabb, a shuttle train broker at Trade West in Oregon state.Falling coal and oil shipments are not the only reason for the grain train glut. US farmers have been storing billions of bushels of corn and soyabeans to avoid selling at low prices, keeping crops off the rails. The strong dollar has forced the US to cede some global grain market share to exporters such as Brazil and Ukraine, curbing trains to the coasts.CSX earlier this week reported lower volumes and outlined a “challenging” environment in 2016. Mr Ward told analysts: “You have multiple aspects working against you. The low gas prices, the low commodity prices, the strength of the dollar. All three of those together are really pushing and, in some ways, I think you can almost think of it as a freight recession.”In the year to date CSX shares are down 14 per cent, while Union Pacific has dropped 5.6 per cent.“In some sense, the transport [stocks] have become part and parcel of the commodity price story,” says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.

He suggested shareholders could either pass a motion demanding the board consider CP’s offer or propose alternative directors.“I think the annual meeting is the most likely timeframe — and the simplest one — for getting a transaction done,” Mr Ackman said.CP is offering a mix of cash and shares for NS that the target company values at $91.62 per share, valuing the company’s equity at $27.3bn. CP contends that the offer is worth between $125 and $140 a share.NS said it would “carefully consider” the revised offer, which, in addition to terms announced last week — $32.86 cash per share and 0.451 of a share in the new, merged company — would offer shareholders a “contingent value right” in the new company. The CVR would offer shareholders up to $25 a share if the new company’s shares are below $175 a share in October 2017. CP projects that the shares will be worth between $204 and $237 each, depending on whether the deal wins regulatory approval.NS said that, other than the CVR, the deal changed nothing compared with the previous offer that NS’s board unanimously rejected.NS’s shares had fallen 1.8 per cent to $89.39 by lunchtime in New York. CP’s shares rose 0.4 per cent in New York to $125.56.NS has consistently dismissed the idea of further consolidation among the seven Class I railroads in the US and Canada, saying it would be impossible to gain approval from the US’s Surface Transportation Board. A series of mergers in the 1990s left just Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe in the western US; Norfolk Southern and CSX in the eastern US; CP and Canadian National in Canada; and Kansas City Southern operating north to south.Mr Ackman portrayed the transaction as having two parts. CP would first take management control of NS, as early as May next year, and put Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive, in charge of improving NS operations. The second stage — after at least 18 months of working for regulatory approval — would involve merging the companies’ operations.Mr Ackman suggested other railroads were also warming to the idea of new mergers. He said CSX, which CP approached last year, had put itself up for sale. CSX denied having done so. He also suggested that BNSF was considering participating in mergers, although the company — like Union Pacific — has stressed it opposes new mergers."
44;CSX;CSX Corp;2015-12-08T23:08:13Z;Bill Ackman calls on Norfolk Southern to accept CP’s revised bid;Canadian group is attempting first merger between large North American railways since 1999;Bill Ackman stepped up pressure on Norfolk Southern’s board to reconsider its rejection of Canadian Pacific’s takeover proposal when the activist investor fiercely criticised the US railway’s management.Mr Ackman, whose Pershing Square fund is CP’s biggest shareholder, compared the stance of NS’s board to that of CP’s before he won a proxy fight that installed Hunter Harrison, one of North America’s most experienced rail executives, as chief executive in 2012.However, investors proved resistant to the revised terms announced on Tuesday — which NS said would provide less value than CP’s initial proposal— and the company’s shares closed down 5.7 per cent at $86.31 in New York.The revised terms reduce the cash on offer to NS shareholders to $32.86, from $46.72 in the original offer put forward last month. However, they increase the proportion NS shareholders would receive in a post-merger company to 47 per cent, from 41 per cent previously.CP said that the new offer would give NS shareholders between $125 and $140 per share at the likely close of the transaction in May 2016. However, NS dismissed the latest bid, saying it would yield only $91.62 per share, against $92.06 previously.At $91.62, the offer values NS’s equity at $27.3bn.CP proposes putting itself into a “voting trust” that would keep its management separate from that of NS during the lengthy regulatory process.On a conference call, Mr Ackman compared the objections of NS’s board to the takeover to those that CP’s management raised during the proxy fight.At the time, CP’s board said that Mr Harrison would be unable to meet targets for improving operations that he has since achieved faster than expected.“It seems familiar to me,” Mr Ackman said.Mr Ackman also questioned whether NS, which has the worst ratio of operating costs to revenues of any of the seven big Class I US and Canadian railways, would meet the targets it has set since CP’s interest became known.“They say, ‘Now we’re going to get it right’ after 20 years of failure,” Mr Ackman said.Jim Squires, NS chief executive, said the revised terms were “even more uncertain and risky” than the previous proposal. He also reiterated NS’s stance that the Surface Transportation Board, which must approve any big US railroad mergers, would strike down any deal. CP has substantial US operations, as well as running Canada’s second-biggest rail network.Most industry observers in recent years have dismissed the idea that big US and Canadian railways would be allowed to merge since the sector is already highly consolidated.NS on Monday evening released a report by two former chairs of the STB, stressing the difficulties that any deal would face in gaining approval.The last merger between Class I railroads was completed in 1999, when NS and CSX together bought Conrail and split its assets between them.
45;CSX;CSX Corp;2015-11-17T23:24:36Z;Norfolk Southern criticises ‘highly conditional’ bid from CP;US railroad says offer values it about $28.3bn, less than 10 per cent premium to trading price;Norfolk Southern on Tuesday criticised an “unsolicited, low-premium, non-binding and highly conditional” potential bid from Canadian Pacific that would value the US’s fourth-biggest railroad network at around $28.3bn.But the US railroad said it would “carefully evaluate and consider” the bid from Canada’s number two railroad, aimed at creating the first railroad able to operate all the way across the US and Canada from the Pacific to the Atlantic.NS was reacting to CP’s confirmation hours earlier that it had formally written to NS to express interest in a merger. CP had said in its statement — which followed speculation on November 9 that it was considering a bid — that its offer would offer “a sizeable premium in cash and stock for NS shareholders”. CP had not disclosed the precise price it was offering.NS said CP was offering $46.72 in cash and 0.348 CP shares for every NS share. At Tuesday’s $135.58 closing price for CP in New York, the deal would offer a combined $94.94 per share, valuing the whole company at $28.3bn. NS’s shares closed at $86.97 on Tuesday in New York. They initially surged more than 6 per cent in after-market trading on CP’s confirmation of its approach. But they later pared those gains on news of the exact proposed terms and were 3.4 per cent up at $89.90 at 7pm.NS said the price offered a premium of less than 10 per cent to Tuesday’s share price — although the shares stood at only $79.90 before news of a possible approach first emerged.NS said it would consider the approach in the context of NS’s “strategic plans, and its ongoing review of opportunities to enhance stockholder value through strategic, financial and operational measures and pursue the best interests of the company and its stockholders.”CP had said in its statement that it would offer other railroads access to its network if its service levels declined or prices rose following a merger. The provision is designed to short circuit expected opposition from regulators and customers to a merger, which would be the first between the big Class I railroads in the US and Canada since 1999.NS nevertheless expressed doubt about the potential for winning approval. The industry’s current structure— with CSX and NS in the eastern US, Union Pacific and BNSF in the west, CP and Canadian National in Canada and Kansas City Southern operating north-south — is widely regarded as highly consolidated.“Any consolidation among Class I railroads in North America would face significant regulatory hurdles,” NS said.Tony Hatch, an independent railroad expert, said CP’s access suggestion was a surprise.“It has been expected that this would be the response by regulators [to a merger proposal],” Mr Hatch said of the proposal to open up the network. “It is, I will have to admit, a surprising tactic to put it out there at first.”An opening up of the combined company’s network to competitors could help to counter objections from shipper groups that customer service at CP under Hunter Harrison, chief executive since 2012, has worsened. Mr Harrison — one of the industry’s most admired executives, a former chief executive of Canadian National — has vastly improved the network’s efficiency but irritated some shipper groups who thought their needs had been neglected.The NS bid is CP’s second for another North American railroad under Mr Harrison. The company last October approached CSX but was rebuffed..
46;CSX;CSX Corp;2015-11-16T13:15:28Z;Canadian railroad merger efforts separated by a year of change;After being spurned by CSX, Canadian Pacific turns to Norfolk Southern;They are, ostensibly, strikingly similar events. In October last year, Canadian Pacific, one of Canada’s two main railroads, approached CSX, one of the two big railroads in the eastern US, about a potential merger. Talks quickly broke down. Then, on November 9, it emerged that CP had made a similar approach to Norfolk Southern, the other big railroad in the eastern US, in the hope that transaction might fare better.The 13 months between the two approaches have nevertheless transformed the commercial picture on the railroads in the US and Canada, which carry more than 40 per cent of interurban freight. The system a year ago was struggling to cope with surging traffic in coal, grain and oil. Traffic so far this year in the US is down 1.5 per cent, with coal — the most important single commodity — down 9.7 per cent, according to the Association of American Railroads.The question is whether the change in the industry’s fortunes will make the outcome of the current, early-stage talks between CP and Norfolk Southern different from those between CP and CSX.Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive, said last year the rationale for a merger was to eliminate some of the many handovers between the seven big railroads — known as Class Is — that dominate the US and Canadian railroad systems. Those handovers — many of which occur around Chicago — contribute significantly to the system’s congestion.The appeal of a merger this year, according to Charles Cloutis, managing director for global trade and transportation at IHS Global Insight, could be to alleviate the financial effects of the traffic slowdown. Norfolk Southern’s traffic has suffered particularly heavily — its revenue ton-miles of traffic were 26 per cent down for the first nine months this year against last year. Coal traffic by ton-miles fell 36 per cent.Crude oil traffic, while far less significant for railroads than coal, was down 23.5 per cent year-on-year for US Class Is in the third quarter than in the same quarter last year.“I do think the revenues that have been lost have made some railroads think, ‘Should we think about merging with another railroad or consolidation?’” Mr Cloutis says.Tony Hatch, an independent railroad analyst, says Norfolk Southern has suffered disproportionately because it handles large quantities of high-quality, exported Appalachian metallurgical coal, demand for which worldwide has plummeted.The aggregate 15 per cent year-on-year decline in tons of coal handled on its network in the third quarter included a 37 per cent decline in export metallurgical coal. Utility coal for power stations — which has suffered from low natural gas prices — declined only 10 per cent.“Norfolk Southern is now the outlier,” Mr Hatch says of how the company has suffered compared with others.Yet the changes in traffic levels may not be sufficient to change the two biggest barriers to a merger — Norfolk Southern’s expected resistance to a change or the regulatory hurdles.Norfolk Southern’s leadership was particularly adamant following CP’s approach last year to CSX that it was strongly opposed to further mergers, particularly because previous consolidation has disrupted services.Mr Hatch predicts that the company’s distinctive, inward-looking, operationally focused culture will make executives resistant to the idea of merger, despite a change of leadership in the last year. Wick Moorman, chief executive, stood down in March in favour of Jim Squires.“NS is the railroaders’ railroad,” Mr Hatch says.A still more formidable barrier could well be the US’s Surface Transportation Board. The board has shown little interest in further consolidation since a wave of mergers in the 1990s created the current, highly consolidated structure. NS and CSX dominate the eastern US, Union Pacific and BNSF — part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway — the west and Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Canada and some lines in US. A seventh — far smaller — Class I, Kansas City Southern, operates north-south from Canada down into Mexico.A CP-NS merger would face a lengthy approval process and would involve the STB for the first time approving a Class I able to carry goods from coast to coast across North America. Few observers believe it has the appetite to do so.But the experience of the two merger approaches in two years shows that Mr Harrison — the most admired railroad operator of his era — is likely to keep trying. Having previously transformed the performance of Canadian National, Mr Harrison has done the same with every aspect of CP’s performance since Bill Ackman, the activist investor, installed him there in 2011.Mr Hatch says the primary driver for the mergers is that Mr Harrison thinks he can do anything better than a railroad’s current managers.“He does believe he can operate better,” Mr Hatch says. “He can effect a merger that will be good for the entire industry.”
47;CSX;CSX Corp;2015-11-10T00:15:35Z;Canadian Pacific makes second US rail play in 13 months;Early stage talks to buy rival Norfolk Southern, after failed CSX approach;Canadian Pacific Railway is in early stage talks with Norfolk Southern, the number two network in the eastern US, in its second effort in 13 months to gain scale by taking over a US-based rival.CP had hired bankers and was seeking financing for the transactions, those informed about the talks said. Norfolk shares closed up almost 11 per cent to $88.62 after Bloomberg News reported the approach, giving the company a $23.85bn market capitalisation. Shares in Toronto-listed CP closed up 5.69 per cent to C$188.79.CP said in a statement that there was “no material news pending at this time”. Norfolk declined to comment.The deal is the latest effort by Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive since 2012, to increase its reach by buying a larger rival.CP is the sixth biggest of the seven big Class I railroads in the US and Canada by revenues. The company last year sought to buy CSX, Norfolk’s bigger rival in the eastern third of the United States but abandoned the effort.Mr Harrison argued strongly, after abandoning the CSX talks last October, that greater railroad consolidation was vital to reduce the then-severe congestion across US and Canadian railroads. A merger would reduce the number of time consuming, congestion-causing handovers between different railroads in hubs such as Chicago, he said.The congestion has considerably improved as the previously sharp growth in coal, oil and grain movements has gone into reverse.Mr Harrison said after abandoning the bid for CSX that there had been little to choose between CSX and CP as takeover targets.Norfolk shares had slid 31 per cent over the past year before the spike on Monday. The company has suffered more than any other US railroad from sharp declines in coal volumes because exports from the Appalachian coal fields that it serves in Kentucky and West Virginia have fallen so sharply.Two people familiar with the matter said talks were at an early stage, but stressed that a deal was not certain.Tony Hatch, an independent rail analyst, said Norfolk was perceived as struggling in the present market conditions.Norfolk’s third-quarter net income — reported on October 28 — was down 19 per cent from the third quarter of 2014, at $452m, on revenues down 10 per cent to $2.71bn.Mr Hatch said he doubted a deal — which would need to undergo a lengthy clearance process with the US’s Surface Transportation Board — would go ahead. It could also lead to a damaging reassessment of the industry’s current, relatively relaxed regulation, he said.There have been no mergers between US or Canadian Class I railroads since 1999, when Norfolk and CSX took over Conrail, a large rival in the eastern US, and split it between them.“I think rail shippers and regulators and government folks on both sides of the border would either be in opposition or see this as an opportunity to achieve their agendas, which would not be in railroads’ best interests,” Mr Hatch said.

It was consequently appointing Mr Hart to take over his responsibilities for the time being.Mr Hart is United’s third chief executive in six weeks. Mr Munoz — who had been chief operating officer of railroad group CSX and a non-executive director of United — took over on September 8. He replaced Jeff Smisek, who stood down in connection with federal investigators’ examination of transactions between United and the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, operator of the New York area’s airports.The company said Mr Hart — who was United’s executive vice-president as well as general counsel — had recently been taking responsibility for other areas beyond his narrow legal role.Henry Meyer, who was appointed non-executive chairman at the time of Mr Smisek’s departure, said Mr Hart had recently been taking responsibility for a series of operations and “customer-facing” parts of United’s operations.“I am confident in his ability to continue to implement the company’s strategy and Oscar’s mission of bringing United’s people together around the shared purpose of becoming the best airline for our customers and employees,” Mr Meyer said.Mr Munoz had moved quickly between his appointment and last Thursday’s heart attack to transform the company’s poor reputation for customer service. He wrote an open letter to employees on September 25 promising to give employees — disgruntled after the messy merger of United and Continental in 2010 — the “right tools” to deliver better service and reliability. He has also launched an initiative to collect feedback from customers and to improve the airline’s widely derided customer service standards.Mr Hart said Mr Munoz’s agenda had been focused on “customer service, teamwork and innovation”.“I, along with the executive team, will continue to move quickly to implement it,” Mr Hart said. “We believe strongly that we can continue to make steady progress on increasing shareholder value by working together to deliver a great product to our customers.”There has been no official confirmation of the severity of the heart attack that Mr Munoz, 56, suffered or whether it calls into question his ability to lead the company in the long term.

50;CSX;CSX Corp;2015-09-14T16:33:57Z;US rail: off track;A mismatch between depreciation and capex mean the railroads are not in value territory yet;The US has, arguably, the healthiest large economy in the world. Railroads are a crucial part of its circulatory system. Yet shares in the biggest rail companies — Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern and Kansas City Southern — are down by about a quarter so far this year. Relative to expected earnings, the shares are the cheapest they have been in two years. Surely, then, the value train is pulling into the station?No. The problem is an industry-wide gap between depreciation (the item on the income statement reflecting consumption of fixed capital) and capital expenditure (the cash the companies spend on fixed capital). When depreciation is less than capex, cash generation lags behind reported earnings (because capex is a cash expense and depreciation is not). For the railroads, the gap is longstanding but has widened notably over the past decade. This makes a certain amount of sense, given the industry’s solid growth: capex rises first when companies expand. But in general, depreciation and capex should converge as growth normalises.And growth is normalising, to put it kindly. Coal shipments have fallen badly, agricultural volumes are soft and a strong dollar does not help shipments to the country’s ports and borders. Sales at the big four are expected to fall this year, earnings will be flat to down. The market took lagging cash in its stride while the industry was expanding. But as growth investors and momentum-chasers look elsewhere, and value investors start assessing the stocks, the question is going to be asked: when is capex going to come down? Because at 30 or more times free cash flow, value investors are not going to consider these stocks cheap. And, with the exception of Kansas City Southern, capex has risen in the first half of this year.Last year, all four companies spent more on dividends and share buybacks than they generated in free cash. So they are adding leverage, too. Their debt loads are not too heavy but adding debt to please investors can only go on for so long. Increasing cash flow then becomes even more crucial.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
51;CSX;CSX Corp;2015-09-09T17:47:25Z;How a traffic jam on a New York bridge led to a CEO’s ousting;United Continental boss Jeff Smisek has stepped down amid an investigation into port authority;It is one of the strangest business stories in the US in the recent years: an investigation into traffic jams on a bridge into New York that has led to the downfall of the chief executive of one of the country’s largest airlines.On Tuesday, Chicago-based United Continental announced that Jeff Smisek, its chief executive, chairman and president, had stepped down “in connection with” an internal inquiry carried out by the company, which in turn was linked to a US federal investigation into the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.What began as an investigation into allegations — subsequently confirmed — of politically-motivated lane closures on the George Washington Bridge from New Jersey to New York has gone on to examine whether United laid on a special “chairman’s flight” for the benefit of the head of the port authority.It is that investigation that led to Mr Smisek’s abrupt departure, to be replaced by Oscar Munoz, a longstanding director of United and former chief operating officer at CSX, the railway group.The affair has also caused problems for Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey who is seeking to be the Republican candidate in next year’s presidential election, but has been lagging behind in the polls in a crowded field.The lane closures were allegedly ordered to cause traffic problems in Fort Lee, a town on the New Jersey side of the bridge, after its mayor declined to support Mr Christie’s re-election campaign for the governorship. David Wildstein, a former ally of Mr Christie, in May pleaded guilty to having been involved in the conspiracy.The federal investigation into that issue led to a wider look at other issues relating to the port authority, which operates bridges and tunnels in the New York area, including the George Washington Bridge, and also the New York region’s three airports. Mr Wildstein had been a senior official at the authority.United was drawn into the investigation when federal prosecutors started to examine whether the airline had been asked to do favours for David Samson, the port authority’s former chairman, in exchange for benefits such as improvements at Newark airport.Subpoenas have been issued seeking information about those potential favours, including details surrounding United flights between Newark and Columbia, South Carolina. Columbia is a small town 56 miles from where Mr Samson had a weekend home, according to people familiar with the case.The twice-weekly service was known as the “chairman’s flight”, according to The Record, the New Jersey newspaper that first reported on it. The flight was stopped three days after Mr Samson stepped down from the port authority in March last year.Mr Samson has not been charged, although he is under investigation. A spokesperson for Mr Samson declined to comment.Mr Smisek’s exit comes soon after United’s reputation took another battering because of persistent problems with its computer systems. They have been troublesome in spite of efforts to improve them since the group was formed when United Airlines and Continental were brought together through a merger in 2010.In June this year United was forced to stop all domestic flights for an hour because of what it called “automation issues”, and then in July halted all operations out of the country for an hour because of “computer problems”.United was ranked the lowest for customer satisfaction of the traditional US carriers in a survey conducted by JD Power in 2014-15.However, Adam Pilarski of Avitas, a consultancy, says Mr Smisek and his team had been making some progress in improving the performance of United, which had long suffered from poor management before the merger with Continental.“Smisek is an educated lawyer, he’s not a charismatic guy, but he has been an excellent CEO,” says Mr Pilarski.“United was the worst airline, and now they are just mediocre, which is an improvement. They get a solid C grade, and they used to be D-minus.”United Continental’s financial results have improved, and its share price performance has reflected that. Its shares are up 172 per cent over the past five years, compared to a 70 per cent rise for the US airline sector as a whole.The group’s pre-tax profits for the first half of 2015, excluding special items, were more than four times their level in the equivalent period of 2014 at $1.85bn, after it reported record earnings for the second quarter.At the top of Mr Munoz’s agenda will be fixing United’s information technology problems, and that is clearly a tough job.In other respects, though, this looks like a good time to be taking over a US airline. Consolidation appears at last to be creating some market power that will allow carriers to improve their margins, enabling them to benefit from the fall in oil prices.After the turbulence at United Continental this week, Mr Munoz can hope for some smoother air ahead.
52;CSX;CSX Corp;2015-09-08T22:45:11Z;United Airlines chief executive steps down amid inquiry;Investigation over flights involving onetime ally to Chris Christie;United Continental chief executive Jeff Smisek is stepping down in connection with a federal investigation, the US carrier said in an unexpected announcement on Tuesday.Mr Smisek, a former Continental Airlines CEO who has run the merged carrier since the merger with UAL in 2010, will be replaced by Oscar Munoz immediately, the airline said in a statement after the stock market closed.United’s executive vice-president of communications and government affairs and its senior vice-president of corporate and government affairs are also leaving the company.The carrier said in a statement that all three exits were “in connection with the company’s previously disclosed internal investigation related to the federal investigation associated with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.”The investigation is looking into the circumstances under which United Airlines — the biggest user of the port authority’s Newark Airport — came to reinstate its lightly used service to a destination near the holiday home of David Samson, the port authority’s former chairman. Mr Samson was a key ally of Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor who is running for the White House.United Continental Holdings announced on Tuesday that the US airline’s chief executive Jeff Smisek would resign in connection with a federal investigation linked to a key ally of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who is running for the White House. Aimee Keane speaks with Ed Crooks to find out how the carrier found itself entangled in the probe.“The investigations are ongoing and the company continues to co-operate with the government,” the statement said, adding that the probe had not raised “any accounting or financial reporting concerns”.Mr Smisek will receive a separation payment of $4.88m to be paid as a lump sum in cash, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Mr Munoz, who pledged to make United “the top-performing airline”, was most recently chief operating officer of CSX, the US railroad operator. United’s board also promoted Henry Meyer, its lead independent director and a former chief operating officer of CSX, to the role of non-executive chairman.Shares in United fell as much as 3 per cent to $55.80 after the departure news.
53;CSX;CSX Corp;2015-07-23T16:02:41Z;Coal slump weighs on Union Pacific;Revenues drop 10 per cent as natural gas trumps coal;Union Pacific, the US’s largest rail network, on Thursday became the latest rail company to reveal the impact of sharp declines in coal traffic when it announced net income fell 7 per cent to $1.2bn after a 31 per cent drop in coal revenue.The fall in coal revenues compared with last year’s second quarter, to $679m, helped to push group revenue down 10 per cent to $5.43bn.The decline reflected the falling price of natural gas, which has pushed out coal as a fuel for generating electricity, weak demand for export coal and weather disruptions that closed some tracks. The volume of coal carried fell 26 per cent, pushing overall volumes down 6 per cent.Shares in the company fell 5.7 per cent by close of trading in New York at $92.12.The reversal in coal has ended a period when the US’s big railroads were scrambling to add capacity to cope with strong growth in movements of oil, agricultural products and shipping containers to head off growing congestion on their networks. On July 14, CSX, the main railroad in the eastern US, reported an 11 per cent second-quarter fall in coal revenues and a 15 per cent decline in traffic.UP, which operates in the western two-thirds of the US, suffered particularly heavily because its main coal traffic is low-quality coal from the Powder River Basin, which is used mainly for electricity generation. Much of the coal traffic for CSX and Norfolk Southern, which operate east of the Mississippi, is high-quality metallurgical coal used in steel production.Lance Fritz, UP chief executive, said that gains from price increases in the quarter had not been enough to overcome a “significant decrease” in demand.Industrial products — where revenue fell 14 per cent to $970m — and agricultural products — where revenue fell 7 per cent to $867m — also produced what Mr Fritz called “significant volume decreases”. Earnings per share fell 3.5 per cent to $1.38.However, he added that the company had made “meaningful progress” in “right sizing” its resources to the current volumes.Many of the challenges facing UP reflect the reversal in the high oil price, which significantly benefited railroads in recent years. The companies benefited not only from a boom in movements of domestically produced crude oil and supplies for new oil and gas wells, but also from strong movements of coal encouraged by the high price of natural gas.Intermodal traffic — shipping containers and truck trailers — benefited from pressure on companies to convert truck movements to rail to exploit rail’s greater fuel-efficiency.UP’s crude oil traffic for the quarter declined 29 per cent to 25,200 carloads. Intermodal volume was down 5 per cent to $1.09bn, despite a 2 per cent increase in volumes. International intermodal traffic — containers going to and from ports — grew only 1 per cent as US west coast ports continued to grapple with the effects of a months-long labour dispute.

Sales fell 6 per cent to $3.1bn.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 53 cents a share on sales of $3.1bn.The company said lower fuel prices and savings from efficiency initiatives resulted in a 9 per cent drop in expenses, lifting operating income to $1bn during the quarter.Shares of the railroad operator rose 1 per cent to $32.40.Macy’s shares jumped almost 8 per cent to $72.01 after an activist investor was reported to have taken a stake in the US department store group, best known for its flagship store in Manhattan.Jeffrey Smith of Starboard Value told the Delivering Alpha conference that the firm had a stake in Macy’s and argued that the retailer’s real estate was undervalued by the stock market, according to CNBC, which is a co-organiser of the conference of hedge funds and activist investors in New York. Starboard’s previous targets have included stationery chain Staples.Yum Brands shares slipped 3 per cent to $88.88 after the owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell said same-store sales in China slid 10 per cent from a year earlier — offsetting sales at newly opened stores and pulling overall revenues in the country down 4 per cent.The company has struggled to woo customers back to its restaurants after a food safety scare in July 2014. Comparable sales in the country — Yum’s largest by sales — have fallen for four consecutive quarters now.The figures accompanied a 30 per cent drop in second-quarter profits to $235m, or 53 cents a share, falling short of Wall Street estimates. Overall revenues fell 3 per cent to $3.1bn.Mead Johnson Nutrition briefly led the declining stocks on the S&P 500, falling 1.8 per cent to $86.51, after the company warned second-quarter results would fall short of analyst expectations.The company said revenues fell 7 per cent from a year earlier as a stronger dollar and declining sales of China-based manufactured products weighed on growth.

55;CSX;CSX Corp;2015-04-23T23:00:51Z;The Nasdaq — going nowhere for 15 years;Almost any other equity investment would have been a smarter bet;This was the day that many market-watchers thought they would never live to see: the day the Nasdaq Composite index closed at a new all-time high.The last time it did so was on March 10, 2000, at the top of arguably the single most grotesque bubble in stock market history. Within a month it had fallen by more than a third.The valuations the Nasdaq hit at that point were so extreme that many assumed it could take a lifetime to get back to a new high. This was not unreasonable. US stocks at that point were more overvalued by sensible long-term metrics than at any other point in history.Nasdaq stocks looked more expensive even than industrial stocks had done before the Wall Street Crash in 1929 — and it had taken until 1954 for them to set a new high.In history’s other great bubble, Japanese stocks peaked on New Year’s Eve 1989. A quarter of a century later, Tokyo stocks remain almost 50 per cent below that peak.So the recovery of the Nasdaq is genuinely remarkable and is backed, hearteningly, by truly remarkable corporate performance. Apple, still a year away from the launch of the iPod in March 2000, leads the pack. It appeared in the dotcom era to have decisively lost its war with Microsoft. But since then it has gained 4,200 per cent while the Nasdaq has been flat. Its extraordinary success — achieved with profit multiples that still make it look cheap — is the single biggest factor in Nasdaq’s recovery.But buying the Nasdaq at its last peak would still have been a terrible idea. Scarcely any equity market anywhere has fared worse. Even Argentina’s Merval index, despite the disasters of default and devaluation in the interim, has gained 135 per cent.Those who dared to be contrarian would have trounced those who jumped into the hot stocks of the Nasdaq. According to Bloomberg data, five stocks in the S&P 500 have risen more than 1,000 per cent since then. For those who could not foresee the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and missed out on Apple, there was always the Ball Corporation, which makes cans, VF Corporation, which makes jeans, and CSX Corporation, a railroad. All were industries that appeared to be in terminal decline 15 years ago.

Shares of UPS, Avis and Kansas City Southern have all fallen more than 10 per cent, while two-thirds of the Dow Jones Transportation Average members have declined since the start of the year.The Dow Transports retreat casts a cloud over the broader equity market as a bullish or bearish trend is flagged whenever the benchmark rallies or declines sharply. This is based on the notion that transport stocks reflect the underlying economy far better than the average company and thus foreshadow prospects for economic growth.Analysts with JPMorgan said a stronger dollar has crimped export activity, which is a key component of the rail business. Credit Suisse, which remains bullish on the rail industry, noted that a slide in energy prices has weighed on deliveries of coal and crude oil products.“We have witnessed the impact in the past few weeks during which CSX, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern have each experienced notable year-over-year declines in coal,” said Allison Landry, an analyst with Credit Suisse.She added: “This, in conjunction with a step down in shale-related volumes relative to the beginning of the quarter, potentially leading to extra costs related to a mismatch in the resource-to-demand equation, will likely result in downward first-quarter earnings revisions.”That left Dow Transports on course for lagging its namesake counterpart for a fifth consecutive day on Thursday. The benchmark has registered a fall of almost 5 per cent this year, reflecting in part investors increasing bearish or so-called short positions in transport companies after two years of double-digit gains.Shares of SPDR S&P Transport ETF constituents, which includes CSX, FedEx and Avis Budget, on loan to short the underlying stock have climbed 33 basis points from a low touched in January. At 3.4 per cent, the figure was the highest since the middle of November, according to data provider Markit.The case for transport stocks rests largely on wider US and global activity as the rail and shipping behemoths depend on increases in trade to fill rail cars and cargo holds.Retailers have warned that port disputes on the US West Coast have stunted supply chains, prompting companies including Union Pacific to forecast first-quarter volumes that will be flat to slightly down as it takes weeks to clear inventory backlogs.The strength of the dollar is also weighing on export-heavy industries, including semiconductors, as big corporations put systems upgrades on hold.“Foreign demand should be cut as long as [the] dollar stays in this area,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “Until we have consistent strength in the economy, domestic companies may say, ‘Let’s hold off a little bit’.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
57;CSX;CSX Corp;2015-02-23T23:13:11Z;US safety chief in warning over railcars;Fears increase after explosions involving trains moving crude oil;The failure of regulators, operators and manufacturers to agree higher safety standards for railcars carrying dangerous materials poses long-term risks to safety, the acting head of the US’s main transport safety investigator has warned.Christopher Hart, acting chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, was writing on the board’s website after 28 cars in a 109-car crude oil train operated by CSX derailed near Mount Carbon, West Virginia. The resulting huge explosions and fires destroyed at least one house, injured one person and forced the evacuation of the homes of 600 nearby residents.The incident — the latest in a series of derailments and explosions involving trains moving crude oil — caused particular concern because the cars that exploded were built to new, higher standards introduced in 2011 known as CPC-1232. Most serious crashes — including the explosion in July 2013 of a crude oil train at Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, which killed 47 people — involved cars built to the older, DOT-111 standard.The American Association of Railroads, an industry body, issued the CPC-1232 specification, Mr Hart wrote, after regulators failed to agree new, higher standards for cars holding dangerous materials such as crude oil and ethanol.The Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Administration, part of the US Department of Transportation, has still not issued final rules for a new tank car design with thicker sides, tougher ends and other advantages over existing cars. The NTSB investigates incidents and issues recommendations but has no power to make rules.Mr Hart described CPC-1232 as only “marginally improved” from the DOT-111 and warned that, by the end of this year, 51,000 CPC-1232 cars would have been built. Such cars were likely to remain in service for many years.“Unless swift regulatory action is taken, the effect of new tank car safety rules could be weakened by a vast new fleet of cars built to older and less-safe standards,” he wrote.Unless swift regulatory action is taken, the effect of new tank car safety rules could be weakened by a vast new fleet of cars built to older and less-safe standardsThe spate of serious incidents involving crude oil and ethanol shipments in recent years in part reflects the US’s sharply rising crude oil production over the period. The new production areas — such as North Dakota— often lack good pipeline links to the places where their crude is refined, such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey.There were 491,000 carloads of crude oil moved on the US railroads in 2013, the last year for which full information is available, compared with only 10,800 in 2009. Since the Lac-Mégantic crash, there have been several other serious crashes, including one at Casselton, North Dakota, and another at Lynchburg, Virginia.“Safety …has not kept pace with the sheer demand and vigor of the market, potentially placing many who live amid the complex rail network in danger,” Mr Hart wrote.The AAR declined to comment. Shippers rather than railroads usually own the tank cars. Railroads have joined the calls of others in the industry for tougher rules.The PHMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
58;CSX;CSX Corp;2014-11-21T20:41:50Z;Rail chief apologises for ‘lousy’ service;Freight investment ‘will slow’ if regulators tighten rules to curb returns;US railroads will slow badly needed investment to improve their “lousy” service if regulators tighten rules to restrict the returns they can make, Matt Rose, one of the industry’s most respected executives, has said.Mr Rose, executive chairman of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, operator of the US’s second-biggest rail network, was speaking after his company – part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway – pledged to invest a record $6bn in capital expenditure next year.BNSF and other railroads urgently need to spend on increasing track capacity after a surge in traffic growth has overwhelmed parts of their networks that were previously lightly used. The resulting congestion has slowed rail service across much of the US and prompted the industry’s regulator – the Surface Transportation Board – to hold hearings on deteriorating service at which there have been calls for restrictions on railroads’ charging power and other tighter rules.In a speech at the annual Rail Trends conference in New York, Mr Rose apologised to customers for recent service on his company’s network. BNSF’s trains slowed down from last October as the company experienced surging grain, crude oil and intermodal – container and trailer – traffic.BNSF has been a big beneficiary of the surge in movements from new US crude oil producing regions, as well as movements of “fracking sand” and other goods associated with the business. BNSF last year attracted 50 per cent of all growth on the US rail freight network.“It’s been a lousy year, two years, from a service point of view,” Mr Rose said. “I want to apologise for that.”However, he warned that new, tighter rules on returns would form a “regulatory headwind” for the industry if implemented.“With regulatory certainty, we can and will build the capacity,” Mr Rose said. “If the headwinds occur, railroads like ours will slow that investment.”With regulatory certainty, we can and will build the capacity. If the headwinds occur, railroads like ours will slow that investmentMr Rose also criticised the idea that mergers could improve the situation. Canadian Pacific, Canada’s second-biggest railroad, in October briefly held talks about a potential merger with CSX, the main railroad on the US east coast. Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive, has also floated the idea that it could merge with Norfolk Southern, the eastern US’s number two railroad.Mr Harrison had argued that a CP-CSX merger would cut out a large number of interchanges in Chicago, the hub of Canadian and US rail networks which has become seriously congested.Mr Rose said railroads should merge only where one of the two parties was in financial distress or a railroad had insufficient capital to invest in its network. “I don’t believe either of those is in play today,” he said.Among BNSF’s projected $6bn capital expenditure is $1bn of spending on the company’s Northern Corridor route across the northern great plains. The company is double-tracking hundreds of miles of the route to cater for the sudden growth of traffic.It was the growth in such previously lightly used routes that had caused the recent congestion, Mr Rose said. He pointed out that overall traffic volumes had not yet reached the previous peak in 2006.“We’re using different parts of our network,” Mr Rose added. “The last peak didn’t even include crude oil, fracking sand and all that other traffic we’re handling related to energy production.”
59;CSX;CSX Corp;2014-10-21T20:37:49Z;Rail boss says worst ever gridlock looms;Canadian Pacific chief warns as quarterly net income rises 23%;North America’s rail industry cannot continue on its current path and avoid unprecedented gridlock, Hunter Harrison, Canadian Pacific chief executive, warned on Tuesday, after abandoning talks over a potential merger with CSX.Mr Harrison, one of the industry’s most respected figures, had argued that a merger between CP, the number two rail company in Canada, and CSX, the US east coast’s main rail company, would reduce congestion that is slowing service all over the US and Canada.However, the company’s proposals have provoked widespread scepticism, with many in the industry arguing that a merger was unlikely to receive regulatory approval and that a deal might initially make congestion problems worse. There have been no significant mergers in US rail since 1999, when CSX and Norfolk Southern, its rival on the US east coast, took over Conrail, the formerly government-owned rail company, and split it up between them.Congestion started with the rapid growth of grain and oil traffic in plains states such as North Dakota and has gradually spread to the whole of the US and Canada, partly because of the backlog’s effects on a few bottlenecks. Some of the worst problems are in Chicago, where all seven big North American railroads – known as the Class Is – meet and exchange trains.CP announced on Monday that it was abandoning its talks with CSX.Mr Harrison made his comments on the same day CP announced third-quarter net income up 23 per cent to C$400m because of the rapid growth in grain and oil traffic that is contributing to congestion.“We’re quickly approaching a time where none of this works,” Mr Harrison said of the combination of rapid traffic growth and slowly tightening regulation that the industry faces.“We cannot continue to go down the road that we’re going down and be successful and not have gridlock beyond anything we’ve experienced before,” Mr Harrison told analysts and reporters on a conference call. “So I think that’s something we should all take under advisement.”Mr Harrison said that a merged CP-CSX would have moved much of its cross-border traffic away from Chicago and instead moved through Buffalo or Albany in upper New York State.He also revealed that there had not been “a great deal of difference” between CSX and Norfolk Southern as potential merger targets.“There were some issues that pushed one a little bit ahead,” he said.Norfolk Southern reports its third-quarter results on Wednesday.CP’s shares were up 1.9 per cent in New York at $200.18. CSX’s shares were up 2 per cent at $34.19 and Norfolk Southern’s up 2.4 per cent at $109.64.Mr Harrison said that, if other companies in the industry thought they had other means of addressing current service backlogs without new mergers, he was happy to hear them.The company hauled 6.79bn revenue ton-miles (RTMs) of Canadian-grown grain for the quarter, up 27 per cent on the same period last year, and 3.01bn RTMs of US-grown grain, up 20 per cent. Crude oil shipments also increased 60 per cent to 4.63bn RTMs.Canada’s government in March said it would fine both CP and Canadian National, its bigger rival, if they failed to meet set targets for the amount of grain they handled weekly. CP said on Tuesday it was meeting the targets.The US’s Surface Transportation Board has held hearings on the performance of CP and BNSF in moving last year’s record grain harvest amid a surge in traffic in the great plains.CSX declined to comment on Mr Harrison’s remarks.
60;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
61;CSX;CSX Corp;2014-10-20T14:33:33Z;US railroads struggle to get North Dakota crops from the fields;Rail operators including Buffett’s BNSF are grappling with large harvests and shale revolution;There is no disguising the anxiety in the voices of Mark Larson, a farmer, and Jeremy Burkhart, a senior manager at CHS Sun Prairie, an agricultural shipper, as they discuss prospects for moving this year’s expected bumper harvest.A year of poor rail service has left CHS’ giant storage elevator in Minot, North Dakota, with only 50,000 bushels of room – about 15 railcars’ worth – as the annual soyabean harvest starts to come in. The two discuss how best CHS might free up some space.The Minot elevator and CHS’ other storage facilities are close to full because rail service to the company’s facilities has deteriorated drastically. Demand to move grain soared after a record harvest last year, creating congestion on railroads. Growing demand for North Dakota’s oil, part of the shale energy revolution, has added to the rail problems, as did last year’s harsh winter.The congestion has spread beyond North Dakota to affect huge swaths of the rail system in the US and Canada, which handles about 40 per cent of the two countries’ freight movements.However, the white plastic bags in the fields around Minot, full of grain for which there is no room either in storage elevators or farm buildings, testify to how North Dakota is worst affected.“Last year was the worst it has ever been,” Mr Burkhart says of the service the company received from Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Canadian Pacific, the two railroads that serve its nine facilities. “We had facilities that went three, four months without even getting a car to load.”The rail congestion has meant many farmers’ crops moved far more slowly off their farms than they wanted – or not at all.Mr Larson, who works for a credit union as well as the family farm, says the money supply for farmers is already “a little tighter” than it would otherwise be and fears the effects will grow worse. “They’ve not been able to market their grain the way they’d like to,” he says.The railroads’ responses reflect their differing analyses of how the congestion problems arose.Steve Bobb, BNSF’s chief marketing officer, says the company, operator of North America’s second-biggest rail network and owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, simply could not spend money fast enough to alleviate the problems.North Dakota’s rapid growth came after years of BNSF constantly speeding up infrastructure projects and it had exhausted its capacity to accelerate more.By the time congestion had set in, sending extra locomotives and railcars into the area would only have further exacerbated the problems, Mr Bobb says. “That’s the point where we reached this year and in 2013,” he adds.CP attributes its problems to its old, now-abandoned system for letting customers order railcars.John Brooks, head of marketing and sales for CP’s bulk business, says its old system allowed customers to flood the company with orders that far exceeded their real needs. It has been replaced with a more rigorous alternative.“There has been a concerted effort between CP and our shippers to really understand what needs to be moved and when it needs to be moved,” Mr Brooks says.The railroads’ responses are provoking contrasting reactions.BNSF now has a track-laying machine gradually working its way across the great plains as part of an ambitious project to add a second track along much of the 278 miles of the company’s single-track main line between Minot and Glasgow, Montana.The project, part of a record $5bn in capital investment BNSF is undertaking this year, makes many customers optimistic that the company’s service in future will be better as trains move faster and can pass each other more easily.“You’re going to see the trains coming out quicker,” Bob Wentz, general manager of Bakken Transload, a terminal handling equipment and other supplies for the North Dakota shale industry. “It’s going to be huge.”Bakken Transload has nearly tripled over the past year the number of railcars, from 600 to 1,500, it tries to handle every month.Yet, for railroads with less capacity to invest than BNSF, the route back to smooth service is likely to be more difficult.Mr Brooks insists CP has “far greater visibility” over demand for its services as a result of changing its ordering system and is now able to tailor them more closely to customers’ needs.However, the Surface Transportation Board, the US rail regulator, has expressed concerns about the robustness of CP’s plans to improve service and asked it to “clarify ambiguities”. Customers, including Mr Burkhart, whose facilities mainly rely on CP, say the company’s service remains far more problematic than BNSF’s.Mr Burkhart is consequently already making calculations based on receiving only half the number of trains he needs to move crops. With another bumper harvest due, he expects things to “get ugly”.“I’m afraid it’s going to end up being the same as last year,” he says. “It’s just all going to depend on how cold it gets and how much snow we get.”
62;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Canadian Pacific ends railway merger talks with CSX;Deal would have improved customer service and alleviated congestion, notably in Chicago;Canadian Pacific on Monday said exploratory talks with CSX about the two railways merging had ended.CP said a combination with CSX, the main railway in the eastern part of the US, could have improved customer service and alleviated congestion in North America, particularly in Chicago.This is where the seven biggest railways, known as the Class Is, in the US and Canada meet and exchange trains moving between their service areas. Congestion in Chicago has been exacerbated by North Dakota’s growth.“The North American rail industry is confronted today with the challenges of moving more freight than ever and the prospect of moving even more as oil production, crop yields and consumer demand grow alongside the economy,” said CP.“CP is convinced that the significant problems that beset the industry now will only worsen over time if solutions aren’t put in place immediately.”Industry consolidation has been on hold for the past 15 years and Michael Ward, CSX chief executive, said this month he expected industry-wide congestion would discourage the US rail regulator from approving new mergers. Past deals have caused significant initial disruption.In an unusual move for a federal watchdog, the Surface Transportation Board last month sat in a hotel in Fargo, North Dakota, to hear about the rail service in the state. They listened to stories of grain elevators that had gone months without receiving cars, a sugar refinery suffering from lack of coal and many other problems.The hearing was a rare reminder that, although the US railways have been substantially liberalised since 1980, they are not entirely deregulated. The STB retains substantial powers to discipline railways whose service is unacceptably poor and protect customers reliant on a single railway.The regulator will also have the main say in whether any further consolidation in the industry goes ahead.
63;CSX;CSX Corp;2014-10-14T22:13:31Z;Outlook boosts CSX further after deal speculation;;Shares in CSX, the main railroad in the eastern US, rose further in after-market trading on Tuesday after the company made bullish projections about its earnings for next year.The company, whose shares benefited this week from takeover speculation, said it expected double-digit earnings growth and margin expansion in 2015, as it announced third-quarter net income up 12 per cent to $509m, on revenue up 8 per cent to $3.22bn.The figures sent the shares up 2.9 per cent to $33.55 after the close of New York trading. The shares had already risen 2.87 per cent to $32.61 during normal trading hours, and 5.9 per cent on Monday. They were responding to a Wall Street Journal report that Canadian Pacific, Canada’s second-biggest rail operator, had approached CSX about a possible merger but had been rebuffed.CSX made no reference in its short announcement on Tuesday to the reported approach. The company will hold a conference call for investors and analysts on Wednesday morning.Tuesday’s figures gave no details on which traffic types had been the biggest contributors to CSX’s strong performance. However, they suggest that the company – which depends heavily on hauling coal from the Appalachian coalfields – benefited from a modest revival in recent months in demand for coal in the US.Analysts speculate that CP might have been seeking to exploit the differential between CP’s market valuation and that of CSX. CP’s efficiency has been transformed since Hunter Harrison, a respected rail industry veteran, took over as chief executive in mid-2012. Mr Harrison was appointed after an investor revolt led by Bill Ackman, the activist investor.CP is one of only two big rail operators with direct access to the Bakken shale oil formation in North Dakota and Montana, an area of rapid traffic growth. CSX’s valuation, meanwhile, has suffered because of concerns over its coal exposure and the lacklustre traffic growth in the eastern US compared with the west.Michael Ward, chief executive, said CSX was focused on the execution of its core strategy.“That means enhancing our ability to grow faster than the economy, price above inflation, make strategic investments and produce ever more efficient operations to continue delivering superior shareholder value,” he said.It remains unclear whether CP would succeed in completing a takeover even if CSX’s shareholders approved it. Any deal would undergo a probably lengthy approval process with the US’s Surface Transportation Board. The STB has previously refused to allow any single operator to run all across the US. A combined CSX-CP would have operations spanning from British Columbia in Canada to Massachusetts on the US east coast.CP is already embroiled in an STB investigation over a slump in its service reliability in North Dakota and other fast-growing areas, brought on by surging agricultural demand and growing crude oil traffic.
64;CSX;CSX Corp;2014-10-13T16:40:02Z;CSX jumps on talk of approach;Canadian Pacific Railway said to have approached US rail operator;Shares of railway operators rallied on a day when US stocks headed lower, following reports that Canadian Pacific Railway had approached US rail road operator CSX Corporation about a merger.CSX, one of the biggest rail operators in North America, declined to comment saying, “CSX has a longstanding policy of not commenting on such rumours”.Shares of CSX advanced 6 per cent to $31.70. The S&P 500 railroads index, which consists of CSX, Kansas City Southern, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific Corp stocks, closed 0.6 per cent lower on the news.Analysts at Cowen & Co argued that the merger could be beneficial for both in the long term but was not “ideal” at the moment.This is “primarily because both shippers and regulators are currently disenchanted with the rail industry due to the ongoing service and capacity issues, which emerged late last year and are unlikely to abate in any material sense until mid-2015, a timeline that some shippers may still view as wishful thinking”, said Jason Seidl, an analyst at Cowen & Co.Any such deal is expected to come under heavy scrutiny from regulators, because it could prompt rival carriers in North America to begin looking for similar mergers in order to match for scale.Analysts at Cowen argued that it is possible that CP’s management could team up with activist fund Pershing Square Capital, which is CP’s second-largest shareholder, to take an offer directly to CSX’s shareholders.Shares of Boeing fell nearly 1 per cent to $120.40 after the world’s biggest aeroplane maker won a $4.9bn order from Indonesian carrier Garuda for 50 of its 737 aircraft.The 737 Max 8 jets that Garuda ordered will be 14 per cent more fuel-efficient than the Next-Generation 737s.Shares of US department store chain JC Penney fell less than 1 per cent to $7.08 after the retailer announced that Marvin Ellison, an executive at Home Depot, will take over as chief executive from Mike Ullman next year.Mr Ellison had been a contender for the top spot at Home Depot having spent 12 years at the company, but lost out to Craig Menear, another veteran at the company.Analysts at UBS downgraded JC Penney to “sell” from “neutral” and lowered their price target to $5 from $10.“We don’t see what a new CEO hire (and one without softlines experience) will be able to do to amend JC Penney’s many structural issues in the near term,” Michael Binetti, an analyst at UBS said.Shares of drugmaker Tekmira Pharmaceuticals and Lakeland Industries, maker of protective suits, both climbed on Monday after a Texas health worker became the first person to contract Ebola in the US.Tekmira, which makes an experimental drug to treat Ebola, climbed 4 per cent to $23.69. Meanwhile, shares of Lakeland gained 48 per cent to $29.Bond markets remained closed on Monday for the Columbus Day holiday in the US. Stocks continued to decline following the previous week’s sell-off.The S&P 500 fell 1.7 per cent to 1,874.74, falling below its 200-day moving average.

65;CSX;CSX Corp;2014-06-08T07:58:58Z;North America’s rail regulators face safety concerns on oil transport;New standards for tankers may allow the industry to abandon speed restrictions;When a train carrying crude oil exploded by Virginia’s James River, it was a stark confirmation of local environmentalists’ fears.Less than a month before, on April 30, the local chapter of the Sierra Club, an environmental group, had warned that an increase in crude shipments to a transport hub at Yorktown by CSX, the eastern US’s main railroad, was a “recipe for disaster”.And so it proved, when several cars derailed and three exploded, spilling oil into the river and sending fireballs into the sky above the small town of Lynchburg.The crash, which injured no one, was the latest of a series to have hit trains across North America over the past year, as the risks of carrying oil from North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation have become clear.The worst incident came last July when a train of tank cars ran away in Quebec and crashed in the small town of Lac-Mégantic, killing 47 people.Yet the response – from both the oil and rail businesses – has been to improve safety standards, rather than revert to the pipelines that have carried most crude since shortly after oil was first found in Pennsylvania in the 1850s. That reflects the industry’s confidence that the problems can be overcome and the discovery that rail offers unexpected flexibility.Ed Hamberger, chief executive of the Association of American Railroads (AAR), an industry association, insists 99.9 per cent of shipments carried in the traditional North American tank car – the DOT-111 – reach their destination with no leakage. “It’s not an unsafe tank car,” he says.But last October the AAR decided to issue a new standard for tank cars in the face of slow decision making by regulators.It obliges any railroad ordering tank cars after the regulation’s publication to order them with stronger ends, better pressure-relief valves and better insulation to stop a fire heating the car’s contents. “There can be more robust tank cars that are safer,” Mr Hamberger adds.The adoption of new standards should allow railroads to abandon the speed restrictions that have been imposed on most crude shipments in DOT-111 tank cars since the aftermath of the Lac-Mégantic crash, according to Bill Furman, chief executive of Greenbrier Group, one of the US’s biggest tank car manufacturers.The DOT-111 was designed for the slower speeds of previous decades’ railroad network. Overall speeds have increased as railroads have expanded into handling more containerised consumer goods, which tend to be time-critical.Mr Furman says: “In order for the industry to participate in this growth in oil and not hamper the economic benefits that the oil and gas business will bring to North America and the world, we have to be able to run these trains under the current US model. We can’t slow them down.”At the heart of the questions surrounding crude oil transport by rail are the unusual characteristics of the crude oil emerging from the Bakken shale area. It is high-quality light, sweet oil, in contrast to the sour crude emerging from the Permian shale oilfield in Texas.Investigators after the Lac-Mégantic crash concluded that Bakken crude was more prone to explosion than other rail-moved oil, such as the sour crude from Canada’s oil sands. Many of the cars that crashed in Quebec had been labelled as less dangerous than they actually were.The crude’s composition also explains why there is so much demand to move it by rail. Its characteristics are similar to those of internationally traded light, sweet Brent crude usually handled in refineries in the US northeast and California.The US pipeline network, however, best serves refineries around the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. They are either set up to process sour Arabian crude or are supplied with the sweet crude oil that emerges from the Eagle Ford shale, traditional wells in Louisiana and Texas or west African imports.The steep price discrepancy – or spread – between Bakken crude and Brent has made it compelling for refineries that previously depended on imported sweet oil, which mostly lack a ready way to obtain Bakken crude by pipeline.“Spreads are favouring the Bakken crude to move to the east and west coasts, and not to the Gulf coast,” says Jack Koraleski, chief executive of Union Pacific (UP), the US’s biggest rail network.Rail movements have been particularly useful for oil producers, because supply chains can be quickly reconfigured when price changes alter the pattern of demand from refineries.“I think all of this speaks to the nimbleness of this industry, which is perhaps not known in the minds of a lot of people as being very nimble and viewed as a 19th-century industry,” Mr Hamberger says.There is little doubt that pipeline construction will eventually erode railroads’ share of movements – even if increased production keeps rail movements of crude oil growing overall.However, Mr Koraleski and others in the industry remain confident that, even if the main projected pipeline – Keystone XL from Alberta’s oil sands to the US – is built, the outlook remains rosy.Keystone XL would remove between 700,000 and 800,000 barrels a day of oil – 10-15 trains – from the network. There are nevertheless “plenty” of other opportunities for rail to continue to grow, Mr Koraleski says.UP currently handles more of the fracking sand needed to dislodge oil and gas from shale rock than it does actual crude.“If they do build it, it’s 1,200 miles and that’s 1,200 miles of pipe we’ll have a chance to move – the pipe, all the rock, the cement,” Mr Koraleski adds.There would also be 9,000 workers, all of whom would need somewhere to live and trucks to drive during the construction. “It’s win-win either way for us,” Mr Koraleski says.
66;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;CSX hit by uncertain journey ahead;;Uncertain guidance from CSX further weighed on shares that have been under pressure this year since a severe winter hit the largest railroad company in the eastern US.After cutting earnings expectations a month ago, CSX said it remained unclear if it could meet a two-year growth rate of 10 to 15 per cent after stumbling in the first quarter.“Looking at 2015, it is still not clear whether our projected 2015 growth rate will be strong enough to deliver a two-year earnings compound annual growth rate of 10 to 15 per cent across 2014 and 2015, given the modest growth expectations we have for this year,” chief financial officer Fredrik Eliasson said on a call with analysts.The comment sent CSX shares about 3 per cent lower, putting them among the worst performers on the benchmark S&P 500, before they pared losses to close 1.8 down at $27.78.First-quarter earnings were ahead of already trimmed expectations. CSX said profits fell 14 per cent to $398m, or 40 cents per share, despite a 2 per cent rise in sales to $3bn.CSX estimated winter storms increased expenses by six cents per share and lowered revenue contribution to earnings by an added two to three cents.Bubbling profits at Alibaba lifted shares in Yahoo, even as the internet company failed to meaningfully accelerate sales at its core business.Sales at Alibaba soared 66 per cent to $3.1bn in the final quarter of 2013 while profits more than doubled to $1.4bn, according to a presentation from Yahoo on Tuesday.Interest in the profitability of Alibaba will soon extend beyond Yahoo investors as the company prepares for an initial public offering in the US this year.Analysts across Wall Street upped their valuations of Alibaba ahead of its IPO.“This new performance pegs our new Alibaba valuation at [approximately] $184bn, up from $153bn, or $26 per Yahoo share, after tax,” Evercore analyst Ken Sena said. “With the Asian assets comprising nearly $31 per share of Yahoo’s share price, we believe that investors will continue to get paid to wait for this highly anticipated IPO.”Shares in Yahoo rose 6.26 per cent to close at $36.35.Shares of Moelis & Co climbed as much as 9 per cent in their debut on Wednesday, despite tepid market interest a day earlier that forced the company to downsize its offering. They later slipped to end at $26.16, 4.64 per cent up on the day.The boutique bank, which sold shares at $25 apiece, fell short of the $26 to $29 range that it had sought as volatility in US equity markets rattled buyers.Ken Moelis, who founded the bank in an attempt to wrest business away from bulge-bracket banks, owns about 35 per cent of the company because of the dual-class share structure that it had adopted.Online review site Yelp advanced as much as 7 per cent before paring its gains after analysts at Citi upgraded the company to buy from neutral.Analyst Mark May said the company was still at an early stage in rolling out its marketing services for US and western European businesses, forecasting sales of $2bn by 2024.“We believe the recent pullback, most of which we believe is technical, creates a buying opportunity,” Mr May said. “We are confident in near-/long-term forecasts and are increasing our out-year estimates.”Shares in Yelp ended 4.3 per cent higher, at $65.77.Sodastream shares posted their largest one-day gain since July 2013 after an Israeli business publication reported the company was close to selling a large stake of itself to a soft drinks producer. Sodastream declined to comment on the rumour.Its shares rose 10 per cent in early trade before closing 8.12 per cent higher at $40.75.Overall, US equity markets trended higher after two choppy days of trading, buoyed by better than expected industrial production figures.The S&P 500 climbed 1.05 per cent to close at 1,862.31 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1 per cent to 16,424.85. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended 1.29 per cent higher at 4,086.23.
67;CSX;CSX Corp;2014-03-19T18:25:36Z;Harsh winter hits FedEx profits;;FedEx, the express parcels delivery service, on Wednesday became the latest North American transport company to produce disappointing quarterly results and cut forecasts because of the continent’s severe winter weather.FedEx slashed its earnings forecast for the full year to a range of $6.55 to $6.80 per share, down from a previous forecast suggesting earnings of around $6.97, after announcing third-quarter net income of $378m, well short of analysts’ $471m forecasts.The company said “unusually severe winter storms” throughout the quarter had disrupted operations, reducing volumes and increasing costs. The quarter’s $641m operating income had been reduced by around $125m.A range of companies – including carmakers, who have said customers have been reluctant to buy cars from freezing, snow-covered dealers’ lots and transport operators – have blamed bad results on the harsh weather.CSX, the biggest railway in the eastern US, last week warned that the harsh winter would severely affect its first-quarter profits and hold back its profit growth for the full year. The Canadian government has ordered Canadian National and Canadian Pacific, the rail operators, to move grain faster after bad weather held up movements of last autumn’s record harvest.“Historically severe winter weather significantly affected our third-quarter earnings,” Fred Smith, chief executive, said.On days when the weather was closer to normal seasonal conditions, volumes had been solid and service levels high, Mr Smith added. The company’s distinctive strategy of maintaining separate ground and air express networks and running multiple hubs had proved an advantage in the difficult conditions, he went on.FedEx’s results come after UPS, its rival, produced disappointing figures for its September to December quarter after unexpectedly high volumes of pre-Christmas e-commerce overwhelmed its network.Both companies are widely seen as barometers of the health of the US and world economies.FedEx’s figures for the December to February quarter compared with figures for the same period last year that were hit by a $47m charge for voluntary redundancy for some senior executives.Net income for the quarter was up 5 per cent on last year, to $378m, on revenue up 3 per cent to $11.3bn. Diluted earnings per share – which benefited from FedEx’s share repurchase programme – rose 9 per cent to $1.23.The company’s operating results reflected the continuing shift from high-value premium air express services to lower-yielding products that has dogged the company over the past two years.Operating income in FedEx Express – the core parcels service – rose 14 per cent to $135m, on revenue down marginally from $6.7bn to $6.67bn. Average daily international priority package volumes declined 5 per cent, in line with the move downmarket, while international economy volumes grew 8 per cent.Operating income for FedEx Ground grew 2 per cent to $477m, on revenues up 10 per cent to $3.03bn.For FedEx Freight, the freight forwarder, operating income rose from $4m to $29m, on revenues up 9 per cent to $1.35bn.Alan Graf, FedEx’s chief financial officer, said the weather’s effect on the company’s performance had been “significantly more pronounced” this year than previous years. The company’s plan outlined in 2012 to improve FedEx Express’s profits remained on track, however, he insisted.In premarket trading, shares held steady at $138.50.
68;CSX;CSX Corp;2013-10-18T07:38:39Z;Corporate debt boom expected after US budget resolution;;This month’s US government shutdown also furloughed corporate debt issuance and now bankers expect a rebound in bond sales by companies.Sales of US investment grade bonds have totalled $30.1bn so far this month, after a record breaking $149bn in September, according to Dealogic. But global corporate borrowers are starting to return to debt markets after the shutdown, with issuers including Dominion Gas and transportation company CSX Corp lining up new offerings.Issuance during October has averaged $60bn for the past three years and heading into November, companies usually seek to clean up any financing needs ahead of slower market activity due to Thanksgiving and the end of the year.“The resolution of the crisis will probably open the issuance floodgates following several very quiet weeks on the origination front,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, strategist at TD Securities.As more companies report quarterly earnings, they will also be able to tap capital markets, and on Thursday Bank of America sold $3bn of bonds.Also proving a more favourable backdrop for issuance has been the drop in benchmark Treasury yields following the resolution of the US debt ceiling and the reopening of the US government.“Conditions in debt capital markets are still fantastic, both in terms of technicals and in terms of demand,” said Jonathan Fine, head of investment grade syndicate at Goldman Sachs, who estimates total sales of high-grade debt to reach $175bn in the fourth quarter.For other analysts, the move lower in US Treasury, corporate and mortgage yields, which move inversely to prices, is also seen reflecting investors putting money to work after activity dwindled while Washington battled over the debt ceiling.Money funds and banks sold Treasury bills maturing in October and November during the fiscal showdown, and the added cash on the sidelines now seeks a home, say strategists.“For those investors waiting for this to pass, for now they could finally put their money in fixed income to work without having to ask a hundred ‘what if’ questions in regards to a US default,” said William O’Donnell, strategist at RBS Securities.“I would expect the new issue calendar for corporate credit and asset-backed securities to pick back up, with the end of October through Thanksgiving window for issuance now open.”Prospective issuers, however, may elect to wait for how the backlog of economic releases plays out, particularly the September jobs report.Mr Goldberg said: “We suspect that issuers will wish to wait for further guidance on the flow of key economic data over the coming weeks, the September non-farm payroll release being the focus, but expect a significant resurgence in new issuance activity toward month-end.”
69;CSX;CSX Corp;2013-05-14T23:03:27Z;Transport: Virginia port shows transport pressures;Investment in extra capacity and rate changes illustrate the continuing potential of coal, oil and gas, writes Robert Wright;On the waterfront in the port of Lamberts Point, Virginia, the activity is more intense than for several years. Two machines, owned by Norfolk Southern (NS), one of two big railroads in the eastern US, haul railcars two at a time up to a big rotating drum. With a sudden twist, the drums turn, tipping out coal from the cars on to a conveyor belt that leads to a waiting ship. A plume of coal dust fills the air.The activity at Lamberts Point, a dedicated coal port that NS owns, reflects the state of the US coal market. Faced with slumping domestic coal demand, NS, according to Wick Moorman, its chief executive, has cut its prices for handling export coal to boost volumes.It is one of many examples of how transport providers’ investments in new capacity and changes to rate structures have helped to facilitate and smooth the big changes under way in US energy markets. NS and CSX, its bigger rival in the eastern US, have both sought to boost coal export volumes to make use of their extensive networks in the coal-producing parts of the Appalachians and Illinois River Basin.In the western US, the two big railroads – Union Pacific and BNSF – have invested heavily in the region’s booming oil production. Railroads across North America increasingly handle sand and other material going to wells that produce natural gas by hydraulic fracturing. The question is whether the recent big changes are likely to become permanent, with coal traffic depressed and significant oil traffic by rail, or whether coal volumes will rebound and oil revert to pipelines.For NS the price cuts in the first quarter produced a 21 per cent increase in export coal volumes that slowed the overall decline for all coal traffic – including domestic volumes – to 4.4 per cent. Revenues from transporting coal, however, fell 17 per cent to $635m.“There’s some US coal that just doesn’t compete in the global market that well,” Mr Moorman says.The company has changed its rate structures to improve such coal’s competitiveness. “It’s still a good business,” Mr Moorman says. “But the rates are down 25 or 30 per cent.”At the heart of NS’s coal conundrums and energy transport in North America lies the question of how most cost-effectively to bring products to the markets that will deliver the highest prices. The effect has been particularly marked, according to Jonathan Garrett, an upstream analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy, for producers of oil from the vast Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana.Wood Mackenzie estimates that although it costs about 60 per cent more to move crude oil by rail than by pipeline, the benefits have more than outweighed the costs. Producers moving the Bakken’s light sweet crude by rail have been able to sell it to coastal US refineries at the international benchmark price of Brent Crude.If they had moved it by pipeline, it would have sold at the price at the inland pipeline junction of Cushing, Oklahoma, which has been consistently running $13/bbl lower than Brent. Wood Mackenzie calculates that Continental Resources, the biggest holder of Bakken production and exploration acreage, has boosted the PV10 value – an industry standard measure – of its holdings by $574m by using rail to reach coastal refineries, rather than only pipelines. PV10 measures the net present value of an area’s future revenues, discounted by 10 per cent annually and net of production expenses. “If you can rail your barrels to markets where you get premium pricing, then you see a premium over what you’ve been receiving in the past,” Mr Garrett says. “Now you’re getting $85 a barrel, rather than $75.”Similar calculations lie behind changes in coal movements by rail, according to Fredrik Eliasson, chief financial officer of CSX. Coal from the Illinois river basin, which CSX serves, can compete with natural gas for power generation when natural gas prices are about $3.50 per million British thermal units (mBTUs).Appalachian coal competes only from about $4.50 per mBTU. A recent rise in gas prices has taken rates only up to around $4.10 per mBTU, compared with $13 at their summer 2008 peak.The best hope of finding a profitable market for more expensively-produced coal lies outside the US – although CSX still experienced a 3 per cent decline in its coal export volumes for the first quarter against last year. Its domestic coal volumes fell 14 per cent.“While the US is going through this big energy renaissance as a result of fracking and horizontal drilling, the rest of the world isn’t going through that energy renaissance,” Mr Eliasson says. “Coal is still the baseload capacity in most countries for electricity generation.”In the longer term, both Mr Moorman and Mr Eliasson express hope that rising gas prices and the gradual running down of big coal stockpiles at power stations should mean demand for their domestic coal services has at least hit bottom.For railroads in the western US, meanwhile, the outlook in energy is more positive.Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive. says there is no immediate prospect that, even if some rail volumes move to new pipelines, a pipeline will be built to move crude oil from North Dakota to the US east coast.“Our markets will move around a little bit,” Mr Rose says. “We don’t see at all that our business is going to go away.”
70;CSX;CSX Corp;2013-04-14T14:20:07Z;US rail operators divided over LNG future;;The US rail industry has reached a crossing point in its debate over making a transition from running diesel fuel to adopting liquefied natural gas.Natural gas power could slash costs for US railroads, which operate the world’s largest and busiest rail freight network, compared with existing diesel fuel. Despite a recent increase in prices, US natural gas prices remain historically low at a time when oil – and diesel fuel – prices are near record highs.Matt Rose, chief executive of BNSF, the US’s second biggest rail network by route miles, is one of the most enthusiastic exponents for a potential switch to LNG. BNSF could convert on its own to using LNG if necessary, Mr Rose said.“We don’t change a lot in our industry,” Mr Rose said. “There was a big change from steam to diesel. This is that kind of change.”However, Jack Koraleski, chief executive of Union Pacific, operator of the biggest network, Wick Moorman, chief executive of Norfolk Southern, operator of the fourth-biggest, and Fredrik Eliasson, chief financial officer for CSX, the number three, have all expressed reservations.Mr Eliasson said it was “pretty clear” the economics of operating on LNG would work. But a switch at one railroad could jeopardise the smooth running of locomotives between different railroads.“It’s much more a question of how much and how quickly will the industry convert small portions, large portions or all of their fleet over to utilise LNG,” Mr Eliasson said.Mr Moorman called LNG conversion “an extraordinarily interesting opportunity”. But he queried whether gas-powered locomotives would generate the power of diesels.Mr Koraleski acknowledged it was undoubtedly possible to run a locomotive on natural gas, but he added: “The question is, can you do it economically, can you do it safely and can you do it on a consistently reliable basis?”The LNG, which is generally regarded as cleaner than diesel, would be carried in supercooled liquefied form either within the locomotive itself or an adapted freight car. Both GE Transportation and Caterpillar are co-operating with railroads in trials of the new technology due to start later this year.Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of GE Transportation, the General Electric business that is one of the US’s two big locomotive builders, said his company was developing LNG power in response to customers’ demands. He added that the company’s intended LNG locomotives should produce at least the same power as existing ones running on diesel. The locomotives might also be able to run further than existing ones between fuelling stopsGE’s main rival, the EMD unit of Caterpillar, said locomotives were likely to be able to carry substantial quantities of fuel within existing locomotive bodyshells, even without a neighbouring car to carry additional stocks.
71;CSX;CSX Corp;2013-04-07T19:41:18Z;Coal’s decline comes as oil booms;;The boom in rail-borne crude oil movements from windswept North Dakota has run parallel with a downturn in the fortunes of another area that was once North American rail’s new energy frontier: Wyoming’s Powder River Basin.US utility companies turned to Powder River Basin coal in the 1970s and 1980s because its low sulphur content helped them meet the era’s strict new energy requirements.The area provides most of the coal that both Union Pacific and BNSF move.Capacity on rail routes to and from the area was very tight until recently.However, low natural gas prices after the US shale boom have prompted many utilities to drop coal where possible, pushing BNSF’s coal traffic down 6 per cent last year and Union Pacific’s down 14 per cent.Coal’s decline poses even greater problems for the main railways in the eastern US– CSX and Norfolk Southern – which rely heavily on carrying more expensively mined coal from the Appalachians, Pennsylvania and the Illinois basin.Neither of the big eastern railways are benefiting as much as the western railroads from fresh energy sources, yet there is little doubt that every big US railway would appreciate some revival in the coal business.Even after last year’s decline, coal accounted for 24 per cent of BNSF’s freight revenues last year and 20 per cent of Union Pacific’s.Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive, says even the breakneck growth in oil and gas-related movements is still only halfway to making up for the revenue lost because of declining coal volumes.Nevertheless, Jack Koraleski, Union Pacific’s chief executive, expresses optimism that better times are approaching.Natural gas prices are expected to rise – and cheap PRB coal will compete after even a modest price rise.Both Union Pacific and BNSF are also working on plans for providing new coal export facilities in Washington State that could take PRB coal to Chinese power stations.“We’re cautiously positive [about the] outlook for our coal business,” Mr Koraleski says.
72;CSX;CSX Corp;2013-01-22T23:28:02Z;Shift away from coal hits US rail groups;;Both large rail operators in the eastern US reported lower fourth-quarter profits as plummeting demand for utility coal outweighed price and profitability improvements for the wider industry.The announcements from CSX and Norfolk Southern came as Canadian National, one of North America’s most respected rail operators, said it planned to double its crude oil traffic this yea r compared with last year. Kansas City Southern, smallest of the seven Class I rail companies that dominate North America’s rail industry, also reported a quadrupling of its crude oil volumes for the fourth quarter, alongside a 23 per cent fall in utility coal traffic for power stations.All four companies are experiencing the effects of a sudden shift away from coal use in US power stations, in favour of newly cheap and abundant natural gas. All are seeking opportunities to ship the fine fracking sand used to release gas and oil and to move the crude oil that emerges.CSX, operator of the main rail network east of the Mississippi, said net earnings for the quarter to December 28 fell 3 per cent to $443m on revenue down 2 per cent to $2.88bn. Full-year earnings rose 2 per cent to $1.86bn on revenue flat at $11.8bn.Norfolk Southern, the other big eastern network, announced fourth-quarter net income down 14 per cent to $413m on revenue down 4 per cent to $2.68bn. Its full-year net income fell 8.7 per cent to $1.75bn on revenue down 1.2 per cent to $11bn.CSX’s coal volumes declined 19 per cent for the quarter over last year’s fourth quarter, dragging coal revenue down 18 per cent to $747m. NS’s coal volume for the period fell 13.2 per cent, while revenues fell 23 per cent to $657m.Michael Ward, CSX’s chief executive, said the company continued to demonstrate the ability to respond quickly to significant events in the marketplace. Wick Moorman, NS’s chief executive, said that, despite the declines in coal shipments, it had seen steady gains in intermodal traffic – carrying containers and trailers – chemicals, automotive and materials for housebuilding.“We remain focused on controlling costs and improving productivity while continuing to provide high service levels for our customers,” Mr Moorman said.CN gave its commitment to double crude oil volumes over the current year, as it reported petroleum and chemicals volumes for the last quarter of 2012 up 19 per cent on the previous year and revenues up 13 per cent.CN – which mainly caters to the growing market for export coal, rather than the utility coal that CSX and NS mainly carry – also reported coal volumes for the fourth quarter 23 per cent up year-on-year and revenues up 15 per cent.CN’s net income for the fourth quarter rose 3 per cent to C$610m ($616m) on revenues up 6 per cent to C$2.53bn ($2.55bn). Net income for the year rose 9.1 per cent to C$2.68bn on revenue up 9.9 per cent to C$9.92bn.
73;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Norfolk Southern rail hit by fuel switch;;Norfolk Southern, one of the two main railroad operators in the eastern US, broke the industry’s run of robust results when it announced third-quarter net income down 27 per cent as natural gas displaced its coal traffic.NS, which handles coal moving from the Pennsylvania and Kentucky coalfields to power stations, steel mills and ports, also warned the fourth quarter was likely to reflect the weak trends of September.The company, which more heavily depends on coal than any of the eight Class I North American railroads, said on September 19 that its third-quarter figures would be at least 25 per cent down year on year.Wick Moorman, chief executive, said the figures reflected weak market conditions, which had led to falls in shipments of coal and general merchandise.“We remain focused on controlling costs while continuing to provide high service levels for our customers and invest in projects that will support future growth,” he said.Net third-quarter income fell to $402m, from $554m last time, on revenues down 7 per cent to $2.7bn. Earnings per diluted share fell 27 per cent to $1.59.Both CSX, NS’s rival in the east, and Union Pacific, operator of the largest network, have reported significant falls in coal volumes in the third quarter as generators switch to cheap natural gas and Chinese coking coal demand falls. But both CSX and UP largely made up for this in other areas, particularly movements of crude oil from new shale oilfields.However, as well as recording a 14 per cent year-on-year decline in coal volumes, NS suffered from the 27 per cent decline, brought on by low natural gas prices, in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale area in Pennsylvania and New York. Drilling activity generates demand for fracking sand and pipeline parts.Demand for utility coal fell 15 per cent to 225,100 carloads, while demand for export coal, which had been supporting NS’s coal volumes, was down 7 per cent year-on-year and 28 per cent on the second quarter. Coal revenue fell 22 per cent to $701m.Volumes in intermodal services – movements of containers and truck trailers by road – increased 5 per cent, while revenues grew 3 per cent to $567m. Revenue in general merchandise fell 1 per cent to $1.4bn, on traffic down the same amount.The results emerged after close of trading. The shares fell 2.3 per cent in after-market trading to $64.50.
74;CSX;CSX Corp;2012-10-18T18:47:55Z;Oil and gas boom boost Union Pacific;;Union Pacific, operator of the largest US rail network, illustrated the industry’s continued robust earning power in the face of the global downturn when it unveiled record quarterly profits despite a sharp fall in coal volumes.Union Pacific, which operates in the two-thirds of the US west of the Mississippi, reported a 15 per cent rise in net income compared with last year’s third quarter to $1.04bn on operating revenues up 5 per cent to $5.34bn.Union Pacific is the second of North America’s big rail operators – known as the Class Is – to report third-quarter figures. There had been an intense focus ahead of the earnings round on the likely effects of sharp drops in demand for coal both for use in domestic power stations and for export. Union Pacific said its coal revenue fell 5 per cent to $1.06bn, while the volumes of coal carried fell 12 per cent to 501,000 carloads.However, Union Pacific benefited more strongly than CSX, operator of the largest network east of the Mississippi, from the boom in crude oil and gas production from shale rock formations. Some railroads have experienced sharp rises in their crude oil traffic as states such as North Dakota, which are unconnected to the US’s oil pipeline network, have emerged as significant oil producers.Union Pacific’s petroleum product traffic rose 95 per cent year-on-year to 62.1m carloads, contributing to an 18 per cent year-on-year increase in chemical traffic. The chemical segment’s revenue rose 17 per cent to $841m.Eric Butler, Union Pacific’s executive vice-president of marketing, said the company had seen a “steady ramp-up” in crude oil volumes throughout the year.“We would see ourselves being able to continue to take advantage of that growth opportunity,” Mr Butler said.Intermodal traffic – truck trailers and shipping containers – rose 1 per cent while revenue from the business increased 8 per cent to $1.02bn. The business had suffered from sluggish US economic growth, Union Pacific said, but continued to benefit from conversions of traffic from truck to rail amid high fuel prices.Tony Hatch, an independent railroad analyst, said the results were a tribute to a company that following some years of lacklustre performance, had “got its operational momentum back”.“This is very impressive,” he said.Union Pacific was solidly in the second tier of rail beneficiaries from the switch towards new energy sources, Mr Hatch added. It handles significant quantities of oil heading from other railroads’ networks to its customers and large volumes of the sand used in hydraulic fracturing of shale oil and gas wells.Union Pacific’s shares rose 1.4 per cent to $125.43. Diluted earnings per share rose 18 per cent to $2.19, while the company declared a dividend of 60 cents, up 26 per cent.
75;CSX;CSX Corp;2012-10-17T18:09:16Z;CSX ponders long-term coal declines;;CSX, operator of the largest railroad network in the eastern US, is examining whether recent coal volume falls represent a permanent change in the market, after it warned investors that declines would continue into the new year.Clarence Gooden, executive vice-president for sales and marketing, said on a conference call that the company was working with “outside parties” to understand the nature of the sharp change under way.Mr Gooden was speaking on Wednesday after CSX announced the evening before that its third-quarter net earnings fell 2 per cent to $455m on revenue down 2 per cent to $2.89bn. Domestic coal volumes were 29 per cent down year-on-year.Coal was traditionally the biggest single commodity for many of the biggest US railroads, known as Class Is. CSX has been reporting big drops in its domestic coal traffic all year, as power generators have switched to using newly abundant, low-cost US natural gas supplies to produce electricity.The nature of the rail business had changed as a result of falling natural gas prices, Mr Gooden said.“We’re looking at it with some outside parties to help us,” Mr Gooden said. “What has happened with these low natural gas prices is gas has become more of the baseload for utilities. We just don’t know.”Overall coal volumes for the fourth quarter would be lower than the third quarter and last year’s fourth quarter, Mr Gooden told investors. However, increases in some other traffic, such as goods flowing to and from car factories and movements of truck trailers and containers, would balance out the declines.“Overall, the outlook for the fourth quarter is neutral,” he said.Declines in coal and agriculture, which has suffered from this year’s drought in grain and corn-producing areas, would continue, however.“Although we expect these headwinds to moderate, they will continue well into 2013,” Mr Gooden said.CSX has replaced some of lost domestic demand by hauling US-produced coal to ports for export. Export coal volumes were up 20 per cent year-on-year for the third quarter. However, the company also warned that China’s slowing growth would mean fourth-quarter export coal volumes would be down on last year’s fourth quarter.Greater volatility in coal demand increases the cost of handling each carload. Weakening demand also reduces what CSX can charge.Fredrik Eliasson, finance director, said that while the company expected modest earnings growth for next year, it would be “difficult” under the changed circumstances to meet its target of a 65 per cent operating ratio – costs as a proportion of revenue – by 2015. The third-quarter operating ratio was 70.5 per cent.CSX’s shares fell 1.7 per cent to $21.26 in afternoon trade on Wednesday.
76;CSX;CSX Corp;2012-10-16T22:46:11Z;CSX shrugs off falling coal traffic;;CSX, operator of the largest rail network in the eastern US, illustrated the robustness of the sector’s earnings when it announced third-quarter net income down just 2 per cent, despite a 29 per cent fall in domestic coal traffic.The railway, first of the North American Class I operators to report for the third quarter, also said agricultural traffic – which fell 8 per cent against last year’s third quarter – had suffered from this year’s record drought in many agricultural areas.However, CSX benefited from the strong rebound in the US’s motor industry– automotive traffic was up 17 per cent year-on-year. Intermodal traffic – shipping containers and truck trailers – was also up 8 per cent, as the segment benefited from continuing transfers from trucks amid high fuel prices.Net earnings fell to $455m, from $464m for 2011’s third quarter, while revenue also fell 2 per cent to $2.89bn. Earnings per share, however, rose 1 cent to 44 cents, a result of a share buyback programme over the past year.Michael Ward, chief executive, said the company continued to respond well to “moderating economic conditions” and domestic coal business challenges.“The company is driving strong safety, customer service and productivity results while building its capabilities for the long term,” he said.Tony Hatch, an independent rail analyst, said there had been concern after Norfolk Southern, CSX’s main rival in the eastern US, warned that declining coal volumes could push its third-quarter earnings down as much as 25 per cent on 2011.“Coming in with a solid result was pretty good given the circumstances,” he said.The falling coal volumes reflect generators’ increased reliance on the US’s newly-abundant natural gas supplies to produce electricity, as well as the high levels of coal stockpiles after the last, mild winter.CSX’s domestic utility coal volumes – traffic heading to power stations – were down 30 per cent to 19.9m tons, while other domestic coal shipments, to customers such as steel mills, were down 19 per cent to 3m tonnes. International coal traffic, mostly heading to emerging markets such as China, rose sharply. Export coal volumes rose 25 per cent to 11m tonnes. Overall coal volumes fell 16 per cent to 36.3m tonnes.In common with other railroads, CSX recovered some of the lost coal revenue carrying products associated with coal’s new rivals. CSX attributed a 2 per cent rise in chemicals traffic partly to business hauling fracking sand and other products used to open shale oil and gas wells.CSX’s shares rose 1.25 per cent in after-hours trading to $21.90.
77;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Falling coal demand hits Norfolk Southern;;Norfolk Southern, the number two rail operator in the eastern US, became the latest to show the effects of changing energy consumption when it warned third-quarter profits could be more than 25 per cent down on last year.The announcement, made after the New York market close on Wednesday, sent shares in Norfolk Southern down 5.1 per cent in after-market trading to $68.99.The effects of decreased coal traffic and shipments of completed merchandise, partly offset by shipments of containers and trailers, would reduce revenues by $120m from the $2.9bn in last year's third quarter, Norfolk Southern warned. Changes in fuel surcharges as a result of fuel price falls would cut revenue a further $80m.Earnings per diluted share were expected to be between $1.18 and $1.25 against $1.59 in last year’s third quarter.Norfolk Southern, which serves the coal fields of Pennsylvania and Kentucky as well as handling coal heading for power stations from western coal fields, has traditionally been one of the most reliant of the large US railways on coal. The commodity accounted for 31 per cent of last year’s third-quarter revenues.Increasing use of cheap natural gas and last winter’s mild weather have pushed down demand to move coal sharply. Norfolk Southern reported coal volumes down 12 per cent in the second quarter on last year.US railways’ energy traffic has been transformed in the last two years by decreasing demand to move coal and surging demand to move crude oil emerging from shale formations, sand to release gas and oil from shale, and pipes for new pipelines.Norfolk Southern has narrower exposure to the new energy traffic than some other operators, including BNSF, the number two operator in the western US, which serves the fast-growing Bakken oilfield in North Dakota.CSX, the larger of the two big eastern rail operators, has announced still sharper coal volume declines in the past year. It said in July domestic utility coal volumes had been down 35 per cent in the second quarter against the previous year.Norfolk Southern and CSX are benefiting from investments to allow containers stacked two-high to travel to and from some of the most important east coast container ports. Both have invested heavily in the networks in the hope of gaining new traffic ahead of the 2014 widening of the Panama Canal, which will bring new, bigger ships from Asia to the US east coast.
78;CSX;CSX Corp;2012-09-11T21:01:32Z;US rail groups track shale boom;;When the cold, windswept plains of North Dakota opened to large-scale European settlement in the 1870s, the region was part of the Wild West. Resistance from native Americans had been largely broken and settlers from other parts of America poured in, seeking quick fortunes.Nearly 150 years later, parts of North Dakota around the Bakken Shale formation – a vast, oil-bearing geological formation in North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Saskatchewan – are boom towns again. Camps have been set up for temporary workers and infrastructure is straining to cope.The vast US rail network links the two eras. Newly built railways brought in the first wave of European settlement. Today, long trains of black tank cars head off daily, taking the region’s newly unlocked oil reserves to coastal refineries.The exports have helped North Dakota become the second-biggest oil producing US state, behind only Texas. Customers of BNSF, the railway that handles 44 per cent of the region’s oil exports, have built terminals on its routes through the region capable of handling 1m barrels of oil a day.The surge in oil traffic has provided railways with unexpected benefits amid a shift in energy consumption that threatens one of their main traffic sources. Low natural gas prices resulting from “fracking” drilling techniques had led to a sharp fall-off in railways’ coal traffic. CSX Corp, the largest railway on the US east coast, announced a 28 per cent fall in domestic thermal coal traffic for the first quarter this year.Railways are now optimistic that crude oil shipments and movements of fracking sand, used to release the hydrocarbons, and of oil pipe segments can help recoup some of the lost revenue.The concern, however, is that railways profiting from the early stages of the shale oil and gas boom could be setting themselves up to serve a disappearing market. Railways opening up new oilfields and transporting pipeline segments could be repeating the experience of the railways that in the 1960s carried building materials for motorways, only to see trucks on motorways take their markets away.Frederik Eliasson, CSX chief financial officer, accepts that there are risks involved. Among them is investment in new tank cars – a particular challenge given that the unexpected boom has created long order backlogs among manufacturers.“There are many things that need to come into place before really seeing the benefit,” Mr Eliasson says.Some railways have seen tail-offs in demand for fracking sand used in the shale boom, shipped mostly from Minnesota to the areas where it is needed.Denis Smith, BNSF’s vice-president of marketing for industrial products, says demand has suffered as low prices have deterred new drilling activity.“Down here in the Barnett Shale, there have been a lot of closures of drilling rigs,” Mr Smith says, referring to a gasfield near BNSF’s Texas headquarters.Nor are crude oil, fracking sand or surging export coal volumes yet sufficient to counterbalance big fall-offs in domestic coal traffic. Coal has traditionally accounted for between 20 and 25 per cent of traffic for many big US rail companies.“I’m not going to say that hauling petroleum products is total compensation for the rail volumes, because we’d like to have the coal volumes back,” Mr Smith says.Yet there remains optimism that neither pipelines’ arrival nor market volatility will turn the rail companies’ hydrocarbon boom into another natural resources bust.Mr Smith says BNSF should retain between 25 and 37 per cent of the Bakken Shale’s export market once pipelines arrive, and when the field is fully developed, that should provide more traffic than its current 44 per cent market share.“As long as we can provide transportation services to markets that pay better than [the market served by] the pipeline, we’re going to maintain and retain our market share,” Mr Smith says.Many railways point to their customers’ behaviour – including the order in June by Phillips 66, the refining and chemicals group, for 2,000 rail tank cars to transport shale oil– as evidence of a long-term interest in moving oil by rail.However, according to Rick Webb, chief executive of Watco, owner of several of the small railways involved, rail’s defence may be the flexibility that it has demonstrated in the face of fast-shifting energy demand.“A pipeline cannot be picked up and moved,” he says. “A rail supply chain can be built between an origin and a destination almost overnight.”
79;CSX;CSX Corp;2012-07-19T18:29:08Z;Union Pacific rolls through coal drop-off;;Union Pacific, the operator of the largest US rail network, reported record quarterly net earnings of $1bn, becoming the latest big railroad to overcome slumping coal volumes to produce strong results.The company, the main rail operator in the western two-thirds of the US, said it also expected record results for the full year, despite growing economic uncertainty.The quarter’s net earnings were 28 per cent up on the $785m reported a year earlier, on operating revenues up 7 per cent to $5.22bn. Diluted earnings per share rose 32 per cent to $2.10.Union Pacific’s shares were 3.8 per cent higher in afternoon trade in New York at $123.10.Jack Koraleski, Union Pacific chief executive, said strong growth in most of the company’s product areas had offset a 17 per cent decline in coal volumes.“When combined with solid pricing, efficient network operations and continued productivity gains, the net result was our best-ever quarter by almost every financial measure,” he said.Railroads have experienced steep declines in demand to move coal, largely because of utilities’ switch to suddenly cheap natural gas. Union Pacific’s coal revenue for the quarter fell 9 per cent year-on-year to $869m.Eric Butler, Union Pacific’s director of marketing and sales, said: “Coal demand remained weak as historically low natural gas prices reduced coal’s share of electricity generation and mild winter weather sent coal stockpiles soaring.”Union Pacific’s results came two days after CSX, operator of the largest railroad network in the eastern US, reported marginally improved second-quarter earnings despite a 35 per cent drop in domestic coal demand. Union Pacific gave no detailed breakdown of the balance between domestic and international demand.Revived demand for US-built cars drove Union Pacific’s automotive traffic up 15 per cent and revenue was up 25 per cent to $475m. Chemical traffic rose 12 per cent, raising revenue 13 per cent to $795m, while industrial product traffic rose 6 per cent, with revenue up 14 per cent to $917m. Both chemicals and industrial products have benefited from traffic in fracking sand, wind turbines and other materials associated with new energy sources.North American rail groups have generally performed strongly during the economic downturn because their fuel efficiency has helped them to win traffic at times of high fuel prices. Union Pacific’s intermodal traffic – trailers and shipping containers that can also go by truck – was 3 per cent up year-on-year, while revenue rose 10 per cent to $1bn. Rail operators have also benefited from growing export demand for US-produced bulk commodities.Mr Koraleski acknowledged that the world economic outlook was growing more uncertain. But he went on: “We are going to continue to take opportunities provided by our diverse portfolio to achieve record full-year earnings.”
80;CSX;CSX Corp;2012-07-18T09:31:05Z;CSX defies coal slump with earnings rise;;CSX Corp, the largest railroad in the eastern US, showed the industry’s continued ability to withstand economic weakness when it reported second-quarter net earnings marginally up despite continuing sharp falls in coal demand.Net earnings at the company, the first of North America’s big six railroads to report second-quarter figures, rose 1 per cent to $512m, while earnings per share rose 7 per cent to 49 cents. Revenue fell less than 1 per cent to $3.01bn.The figures were achieved despite a 35 per cent drop to 19.9m tonnes in domestic coal traffic against last year’s second quarter as low US gas prices, increasing environmental regulation and low electricity demand all hit power stations’ demand.Michael Ward, chief executive, said the results were the company’s 10th consecutive quarter of year-on-year earnings growth, despite what he called “significant headwinds” in the coal market.“The company continues to perform well across a wide range of economic and market conditions,” he said.North America’s large railroads have withstood recent years’ economic weakness and high fuel prices far better than other transport modes. Because they are more fuel-efficient than some rival modes, railroads have attracted large volumes of “intermodal” traffic– shipping containers and truck trailers – from trucking companies. They have also benefited from continued strong demand outside North America for the continent’s commodities.However, CSX said after publishing its first-quarter figures that it would need to “sit down” with some of its utility coal customers to renegotiate their long-term contracts if volume declines – running at 28 per cent year-on-year – continued.In the second quarter, CSX made up for the fall-off in coal, where revenue fell 14 per cent to $820m, with gains in areas including automotive traffic, which benefited from the sharp rebound in the US car industry. Automotive traffic was up 27 per cent against last year’s first quarter, while revenues rose 34 per cent to $302m. Intermodal volumes rose 8 per cent and revenues rose 10 per cent to $408m.Even in the troubled coal sector, the slump in domestic demand was partly offset by an increase of 41 per cent to 14.7m tonnes in movements of coal heading for export and an increase of 20 per cent to 2.4m tonnes in demand for high-quality coking coal.CSX announced its figures after the close of New York trading on Tuesday.
81;CSX;CSX Corp;2012-04-18T11:45:09Z;US rail group eyes coal contract rethink;;US railroads will need to “sit down” with power utilities to revise their contractual arrangements if the first quarter’s sharp falls in generating coal traffic continue, senior executives at one of America’s largest rail operators have warned.The executives at CSX, operator of the US eastern seaboard’s largest rail network, were speaking after its first-quarter figures showed coal shipments to US power stations were down 28 per cent on last year’s first quarter. CSX blamed the shift mainly on power companies’ preference for America’s newly abundant natural gas, as well as unusually low power demand in a mild winter.Coal was the weakest spot in figures that otherwise showed CSX continuing to enjoy the robust profit and volume growth that most of North America’s large Class I railroads have experienced in recent years. First-quarter net earnings were up 14 per cent to a record $449m on revenue up 6 per cent to $2.97bn.Clarence Gooden, vice-president for sales and marketing, said there would need to be discussions if there was a “secular change” towards using coal for power only during peak demand. Cheap shale gas increasingly provides the main fuel for many US power generators. Such a change could leave railroads expensively maintaining excess capacity used only occasionally.“What we can’t do is build the church for Easter Sunday,” Mr Gooden said. “I think there will end up being common ground reached between the carriers, the coal suppliers and the utilities as we move forward.”Michael Ward, chief executive, said: “There will be dialogues between us and the utility companies as to how we ensure they have the capacity they need and we have the predictability we need.”The US rail industry has traditionally derived about 20 per cent of its volumes from coal. Weak domestic coal demand was partially offset by a 19 per cent rise over last year’s first quarter in demand to move US export coal. Coal traffic overall fell 14 per cent year on year, on revenue down 5 per cent to $832m.Revenue in the merchandise segment – agricultural products, automotive products and construction – rose 10 per cent to $1.68bn on traffic up 3 per cent. The segment benefitted partly from increased movements of the “frac sand” used to open up shale gas reserves. Revenue from intermodal movements – shipping containers and truck trailers – rose 19 per cent to $389m on traffic up 9 per centMr Ward insisted the company was off to a “fast start” in the year. “A significant majority of our transportation markets are performing very well and our operations are delivering excellent results,” he said.Earnings per share improved 23 per cent to 43 cents, while the proposed dividend improved 33 per cent to 12 cents. The shares were unchanged at $22.44.
82;CSX;CSX Corp;2012-04-16T19:05:36Z;Georgian Railway to list in London;;Georgian Railway, which claims to be one of the world’s most profitable rail operations, on Monday outlined plans to become the first quoted state-controlled railway monopoly by listing on the London Stock Exchange.Irakli Ezugbaia, Georgian Railway’s chief executive, said the ex-Soviet state’s government would use proceeds from the listing, expected in May, to invest in the Caucasian state’s infrastructure. An exact date for the IPO – under which Georgian Railway will list global depositary receipts representing 25 per cent of its capital – would depend on market conditions, the company said.Two other railway operators from the former Soviet Union – Globaltrans, a private Russian rail freight operator, and TransContainer, the container arm of Russia’s state-owned rail company – are already listed in London. Georgian Railway will be the first traditional state railway monopoly – with an infrastructure-owning arm and freight and passenger operations – to list its shares anywhere in the world.Mr Ezugbaia said the company was listing itself as an undivided, integrated organisation to mimic the structure of large, North American railroads, such as Union Pacific and CSX. Those companies own their own track, locomotives and wagons, instead of dividing the infrastructure and operations as normally happens in the European Union.“We found that this exact strategy is the way to be oriented to successful growth for the railway operations,” Mr Ezugbaia said.The company’s profitability depends entirely on its handling of freight traffic, particularly oil moving from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan towards western Europe. Freight provided 95 per cent of the company’s $286m revenues for last year, it said. The company earned earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) of $156m and $104m net income last year. The ebitda margin of 54.4 per cent for the year was one of the highest globally, it said.The company had undergone a five-year restructuring to transform its previously Soviet-style management practices, Mr Ezugbaia said. Its organisation was now based on “profit maximisation”, he said.The other ex-Soviet rail companies listed in London all depend on RZD, the Russian state-owned train operator and infrastructure owner, to provide access to its network and, in many cases, to haul their trains. Regulatory rules stipulate how much RZD can charge.However, Georgian Railway will be an unusual example of a listed company enjoying a state-sanctioned monopoly in its industry but allowed to set its own charging levels. Such a position allowed Georgian Railway to maximise shareholder value, Mr Ezugbaia said.“This has to be more interesting for private shareholders,” he said.Mr Ezugbaia downplayed, meanwhile, the risks to the company of a renewal of conflict between Georgia and Russia over the breakaway region of South Ossetia, where the two fought a brief war in 2008. The two had reached an agreement over the region that had allowed Russia to join the World Trade Organisation, Mr Ezugbaia pointed out.

The bank said in a statement that it expected earnings for the first quarter of 2012 to beat initial estimates.Zions Bancorporation soared 10.5 per cent to $21.58 as the bank said it planned to issue $600m in senior debt to help repay $1.4bn in US government bailout funds.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,394.28, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.1 per cent to 13,194.10, led higher by Bank of America.The bank, which passed the tests but said it would not return money to shareholders at present, climbed 4.1 per cent to $8.84 with its shares now up more than 59 per cent in the year to date.American Express was the second-leading gainer on the index, up 3.5 per cent to $56.15. The world’s third-largest payment networks company said it would boost dividends by 11 per cent to 20 cents and buy back up to $5bn of shares.The Walt Disney Company was leading the fallers, down 1.2 per cent to $43.48. Earthmover Caterpillar dropped 0.9 per cent to $112.27.The Dow Jones Transportation Average was down 1.4 per cent to 5,180.39 as gas prices hit a record for 2012. The average price of regular unleaded gas struck $3.81 with its impact taking a toll on airlines and rail companies.Southwest Airlines was the worst off among airlines, down 2.7 per cent to $8.18. United Continental Holdings, the parent company of United Airlines, fell 2.1 per cent to $19.42, and Delta Air Lines shed 0.1 per cent to $9.30.Norfolk Southern Corporation, the Virginia-based railroad company, dropped 3.1 per cent to $64.95. Rail-based transportation supplier CSX Corporation fell 2.9 per cent to $20.20.The Nasdaq Composite index was up fractionally to 3,040.73 as Apple continued to add to its gains.The most heavily weighted stock on the index climbed again into record territory, gaining 3.8 per cent to $589.58. David Evanston, analyst at Canaccord, raised the 12-month price target for Apple to $710.“Since we attended the iPad launch last week, our checks have indicated record pre-orders with wait times for shipping iPad models now reaching 2-3 weeks …Apple remains a top pick,” he said.Netflix, the streaming and home DVD delivery provider, fell 2.3 per cent to $103.90. Its shares were hit by news that Walmart would let customers buy online access to movies they have already purchased.
85;CSX;CSX Corp;2012-03-14T20:50:13Z;TCI/Coal India: legal threat;There appears to be a degree of governmental sway over the prices that Coal India charges;"The Children’s Investment Fund sounds like the cuddliest toy in the nursery. As executives at Japan Tobacco and railroad company CSX will testify, however, it is a tireless activist investor. Always alert to any danger to its interests as a minority investor, TCI is now focusing on Coal India. It has threatened the company’s board members with legal action for alleged breach of fiduciary duties. TCI chief Chris Hohn could be in for a long fight.That is hardly likely to faze TCI; the question is whether it has a case. Mr Hohn claims that the world’s biggest coal miner by output sells two-thirds of its coal to customers such as power groups at a 70 per cent discount to the market. TCI also accuses Coal India of bowing to government pressure and of failing to meet production targets.There appears to be a degree of governmental sway over the prices that Coal India charges. A price increase that the company put into effect on January 1 drew a sharp request from the coal ministry to revise it, according to a letter from the ministry made available by TCI. Coal India, producer of 80 per cent of the country’s output, ought to have a bit more operational freedom than that, especially as imports are on the rise. Citigroup estimates that Indian thermal coal demand will rise at a compound annual rate of 13 per cent up to 2015 while supply will grow at only 5 per cent. This means that imports would need to rise by roughly half. That is the kind of opportunity that Coal India should be minting.TCI’s success rate in its battles with recalcitrant management teams is mixed, though shares of Japan Tobacco have risen by a half since last June when the investor called for the company to raise its dividend and buy back shares. The board of Coal India is one thing; the Indian government, which owns 90 per cent of the company, is quite another.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
86;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Capital markets used to top up pension funds;;Low borrowing costs have brought companies to the capital markets for a variety of reasons, including paying their pension bills.CSX, the transportation company, supermarket group Kroger, NiSource, an energy company, and Raytheon, the defence contractor, have sold corporate bonds over the last year, with at least a portion of the proceeds being used to shore up pension funds.Low interest rates are making company pension funds increasingly expensive to maintain because they erode investment returns and increase the estimated size of future benefits. However, low rates also make the cost of issuing debt cheap.“The same interest rate environment that increased liabilities provided an opportunity to issue debt to fund an accelerated pension plan contribution,” said Dave Vajda, NiSource’s vice president, chief risk officer and treasurer. The company sold $250m of bonds last year at 4.45 per cent, the lowest coupon in its portfolio, to help fund a pension contribution of $400m, more than double what it planned to contribute at the start of the year.But not all companies see it that way. Borrowing to pay into a pension “crystallises” the pension obligation as debt. Unlike an annual contribution, which many companies have deferred over the years, corporate bonds must be paid on schedule to avoid default.Some companies are hoping a rise in interest rates to more typical levels and a few years of robust equity markets will alleviate the current level of pension under-funding. A potential risk is that the pension fund suffers a large loss, as many did during the financial crisis in 2008. The company then is on the hook for the bonds, but it has lost the money it put in the pension fund.Consultants argue in favour of companies funding their pension schemes. “It actually limits your risk,” says Martin Ragde, head of the global finance structuring and advisory group at Barclays. “What happens if at the absolute worst time, perhaps during another financial crisis, a company has a large mandatory funding obligation? It is prudent to try to cut off those tail risks.”Companies, whether they borrow to contribute to their pensions or not, are also taking steps to lower their exposure to equities after the volatility in stock markets of recent years.“A lot of contributions have been invested in bonds,” said Caitlin Long, a strategy consultant to capital markets clients at Morgan Stanley. “The dollar amount of the shift [in pension fund allocations to bonds] is roughly equal to contributions in recent years. That is not a coincidence.”The funding level at US corporate pension plans stands at about 77 per cent, estimates JPMorgan, the same level as during the financial crisis. However, the dollar gap at S&P 500 companies has grown to about $380bn, from $300bn in 2008, as liabilities have continued to rise.
87;CSX;CSX Corp;2012-01-24T18:43:49Z;Strong results keep rail boom on track;;The owners of CSX, the eastern US’s largest railroad network, and Canadian National, Canada’s largest network, have provided the full-year earnings season’s first evidence of the sector’s continuing robust health, both reporting record earnings for the fourth quarter.CSX, the larger of the two rail networks east of the Mississippi River, recorded net earnings for the 52 weeks to December 30 up 17 per cent on the 53 weeks to December 31 2010 to $1.82bn. Revenue for the period rose 10 per cent to $11.7bn. Fourth-quarter net earnings rose 6 per cent to $457m, on revenue up 5 per cent to $2.95bn.CN recorded fourth-quarter net income up 18 per cent to C$592m (US$587m), on revenue up 12 per cent to C$2.38bn, while net income for the year rose 17 per cent to C$2.46bn, on revenue up 9 per cent to C$9.03bn.Both companies were also positive about prospects for the coming year.“There are favourable conditions in nearly every market we serve,” Michael Ward, CSX’s chief executive, said. “We see an economy that continues to be favourable for growth.”Claude Mongeau, CN’s chief executive, said that although the economic recovery might be affected by global uncertainty, the company believed the gradual improvement in the North American economy would continue in 2012.North America's freight railroads have seen a significant growth in earning power in recent years as rising fuel prices and strong demand for commodities combine to push traffic from road to rail and to increase overall demand. CSX has also moved from being one of the industry’s least cost-efficient companies to being one of the most efficient. The company’s operating ratio – the proportion of its revenue taken up by operating costs – fell from 71.1 per cent in 2010 to 70.9 per cent for the year. CN’s operating ratio for the year was 63.5 per cent, 0.1 points worse than the 2010 figure.Mr Ward said that, although oil prices were now falling, his company expected transfers of journeys from trucks to railroads to continue. Trucking companies increasingly leave the trunk legs of many movements to rail, with trucks taking goods only to and from railroad yards.Mr Mongeau said his company was targeting a growth in earnings per share for 2012 of up to 10 per cent.CSX also announced that Oscar Munoz was taking over from David Brown, who was leaving the company, as chief operating officer, while Fredrik Eliasson would take over from Mr Munoz as chief financial officer.CSX’s shares fell 84 cents to $21.85, while CN’s shares fell $3.88 in New York to $75.03.
88;CSX;CSX Corp;2011-10-19T22:46:52Z;Record CSX earnings show strong outlook for US rail;;CSX, the biggest railroad on the US’s eastern seaboard, reported record third-quarter earnings late on Tuesday with revenue growth in all its main traffic areas, in the first sign that US railroads’ strong performance has survived the US economy’s recent weakening.Strong growth in metals traffic and resilient revenue in both coal and container traffic helped to drive net earnings up 12 per cent to $464m, on revenues up 11 per cent on the same quarter last year to $2.96bn.CSX’s results are closely watched because it is the first of the seven large Class I North American railroads– which also include Union Pacific, Burlington Northern & Santa Fe and Norfolk Southern – to announce financial figures.The railroad industry has produced its strongest financial results in decades in recent years as rationalisation in the 30 years since deregulation has combined with strong commodities demand and a shift in traffic from trucks to rail to boost the system’s earning power.Michael Ward, chief executive, said that even as the US economy had moderated, CSX had produced strong financial results while investing in additional resources to strengthen customer service.“This helped position our business, our customers and our communities for growth in the near and long-term,” he said.In intermodal or container traffic, which accounts for 36 per cent of volumes, there was only modest traffic growth because declining traffic to and from ports offset domestic traffic increases. However, it recorded 16 per cent growth to $369 in revenue per unit. Domestic intermodal traffic has benefitted from US truckers’ growing struggles with high fuel prices and driver shortages, which have prompted customers to shift from truck to rail.Volumes of coal, which accounts for 24 per cent of traffic, declined 1 per cent, although revenue per unit increased 16 per cent.The company forecast that growth would continue in the fourth quarter and into 2012 and that demand for export coal would continue to offset declining demand from US electricity generators.“The underlying fundamentals of the business continue to support our aspirations for the future,” Mr Ward said. “The outlook for freight rail transportation remains attractive.”CSX’s operating expenses rose 13 per cent to $2.09bn for the quarter, largely because of a 48 per cent increase to $412m in fuel costs. Earnings per share rose 19 per cent to $0.43.
89;CSX;CSX Corp;2011-09-21T23:21:57Z;Alpha sparks fears of coal demand slowdown;;Fresh signs of a slowdown in demand for natural resources emerged as a leading US coal producer warned that it was likely to ship less coal than previously forecast this year because of “unexpectedly curtailed customer activity levels”.Shares in Alpha Natural Resources, which issued the statement, and other US miners, including Arch Coal and Cliffs Natural Resources, fell sharply on Wednesday.Walter Energy, another metallurgical coal producer, was also hit after warning of production delays that meant its output would be lower than expected in the second half of 2011.Metallurgical, or “met”, coal, an essential raw material for steelmaking, is often seen as an indicator of the health of the economy, both globally and specifically in China, which last year accounted for 44 per cent of total world steel production.Indicators of Asian demand for raw materials have generally remained robust. Rio Tinto, one of the world’s largest natural resources companies said on Tuesday that markets were “somewhat weaker” and a few customers were asking to reschedule deliveries, but said the slowdown was not spreading into Asia.However, Virginia-based Alpha on Wednesday revised down its guidance for 2011 shipments to 102.5m to109.5m tonnes, compared with its previous range of 104m to112m tonnes, in part because of weaker than expected demand.It also cited other factors, including lower than expected production from some of its mines, including some brought in with the $8.5bn acquisition of Massey Energy agreed at the start of the year.Alpha’s shares dropped 17 per cent to $22.30. Arch fell 11 per cent to $16.12 and Cliffs Natural Resources, which exports coal as well as iron and other materials, was down 13 per cent to $61.55. Walter was down 12 per cent at $66.25.However, some analysts said they did not see any evidence of a general slowdown in demand for raw materials.“All of the metrics that we have show solid demand for metallurgical coal,” said Brandon Blossman, energy analyst at Tudor, Pickering & Holt.Metallurgical coal shipments from US ports were up 7 per cent year-on-year in July, and vessel queues at US coal terminals remain high.The mere hint of a Chinese slowdown was enough to move any stocks related to raw materials. Joy Global, the mining equipment manufacturer, fell 7 per cent to $70.44.Stocks in railroad companies, which transport US coal to ports for export, were also buffeted. Norfolk Southern and CSX were both down 8 per cent, and Union Pacific fell 6 per cent.All three companies have benefited from strong demand for coal, by negotiating individual contracts with miners.James Squires, chief financial officer of Norfolk Southern, said at a conference on Wednesday: “We are getting no such indications that across the board demand is softening for export metal coal.”He added: “We are very bullish on the long-term outlook for US export coal based on the feedback that we have got from our customers and information about global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by Jeremy Lemer
90;CSX;CSX Corp;2011-09-21T21:04:08Z;US stocks fall after Fed announcement;;The S&P 500 plunged 30 points, or 2.5 per cent, in the last 30 minutes of trading, as investors reacted with alarm to the much anticipated monetary policy announcement by the Federal Open Market Committee.The FOMC said it would buy $400bn of long-dated Treasuries and sell the same amount of shorter-dated government bonds to drive down the long-term interest rate. It also said it would reinvest any early repayments from mortgage securities back into debt issued by mortgage agencies such as Fannie Mae, to reduce household mortgage rates.“I don’t know if I want to use the word desperate, but it feels like the Federal Reserve is out of bullets,” said Scott O’Neill, portfolio manager of MarketSmith.The S&P closed down 2.9 per cent at 1,166.72, its lowest level in a week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.5 per cent to 11,124.84 and the Nasdaq was off 2 per cent at 2,538.19.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were down 4.9 per cent after Moody’s downgraded its credit ratings for Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, arguing the government would be less likely to rescue the big lenders if they face failure, following banking reforms.BofA shares fell 7.5 per cent to $6.38, Citigroup fell 5.2 per cent to $25.52 and Wells Fargo dropped 3.9 per cent to $23.71.Wall Street’s worries were compounded by concerns about falling demand from Asia for raw materials. A broad swath of material, industrials and transport stocks fell after Alpha Natural Resources warned it would ship less coal than expected this year due to falling demand.ANR dropped 17.2 per cent to $22.30, a two-year low, after it said it would ship between 102.5m and 109.5m tonnes of coal this year, down from a previous estimate of between 104m and 112m tonnes.Cliffs Natural Resources was down 12.8 per cent to $61.55 in sympathy. Joy Global, which manufactures coal mining equipment, fell 7.2 per cent to $72.29. Transport groups CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern, which transport coal to ports for export, both fell. CSX was down 8.1 per cent to $18.59, and Norfolk was down 8.3 per cent to $61.93.That pushed the Dow Transport Index, which analysts watch closely as a forward indicator of demand for goods and materials, down 3 per cent by lunch. But the index ended down 5.6 per cent for the day, after a further slump following the FOMC announcement.Software developers rallied strongly, however, as investors reacted to better than expected quarterly results posted by Oracle.Hardware sales declined, but software sales were up for the San Francisco-based company. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, software sales grew more than 50 per cent year-on-year, confounding fears that Europe’s debt crisis would hurt demand. Oracle also predicted revenues would grow 4 to 8 per cent in the current quarter. Its shares closed up 4 per cent to $29.49.“What we’re seeing is a relief rally,” said Richard Davis, software analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “People were scared out of their wits about what these results might be, given the weak macro data.”Adobe shares were up 1 per cent at $24.89, as it was caught up in the software relief rally despite posting quarterly earnings that were below expectations.Shantanu Narayen, chief executive, said the company could still deliver 10 per cent revenue growth for the year, based on a strong fourth quarter.But Steven Ashley at Baird pointed out “guidance assumes normal fourth-quarter economic activity, which might raise eyebrows with some investors”.A key differentiator among software companies may be the level of exposure to businesses, which have stronger balance sheets than consumers.With 55 per cent of Adobe revenues coming from creative professionals, Mr Ashley said this could be a problem. He expects Adobe to deliver 7 per cent growth in revenue from sales to creative professionals this fiscal year.Hewlett-Packard jumped 8.7 per cent to $23.98 on reports it may replace Léo Apotheker, chief executive.Microsoft shares were down 3.7 per cent to $26.35 after the company announced a 25 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend late on Tuesday. Microsoft will increase quarterly dividends by 4 cents to 20 cents.At close to 3 per cent, Microsoft’s dividend is one of the highest among tech companies on the S&P 500, but the company is under pressure to compensate investors for a stagnant share price.Shares in Range Resources, an independent oil and gas explorer, were up 4.7 per cent to $67.96 on buy-out speculation.
91;CSX;CSX Corp;2011-08-30T17:46:58Z;Panama Canal upgrade sparks US ports battle;;Beyond the berths at Seagirt Container Terminal in the port of Baltimore, tamping machines pound the earth and bulldozers clear space for a long stretch of new quay. When the work is done, Seagirt will be able to handle some of the largest container ships in the world.At the moment, barely any of the vessels that sail up Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore need such a facility. But that could change in 2014 when the $5.25bn project to build larger locks along the Panama Canal is due to be completed.The project will remove a bottleneck that has prevented the large ships on many major trade routes sailing direct to the US east coast from Asia. The new vessels are expected to have up to three times the capacity of the biggest ships currently on the route.Scenes like the one at Baltimore are being played out all along the east and gulf coasts ahead of what promises to be the biggest shake-up in US distribution since the advent of shipping containers 50 years ago.Ports, terminal operators, rail companies and state governments are jostling to win the new traffic they expect to be generated by the bigger ships.Billions of dollars are being spent to build new quays, deepen channels and expand rail tunnels.Consumers, manufacturers and retailers in the US mid-west and inland eastern cities could all benefit.Containers heading to these areas will have the option of going via east- coast ports then heading west on trains. Their traditional route has been eastward from California, where larger ships free of Panama Canal restrictions already dock.Seagirt should emerge a winner, says Bayard Hogans, a manager at the facility, part of the Ports America group.“We feel we’re going to be one of the ports that’s prepared when the Panama Canal expands, for these new opportunities,” Mr Hogans says.Yet it remains unclear how many of the projects will generate enough traffic to justify the investments.Bill Clement, president of the container-handling division of CSX, the largest eastern US railroad, says it will take some time for new trade flows to establish themselves.He adds: “Our experience has been that whenever new capacity is built in a global transportation system, people find a way to use it over time.”The Port of New York and New Jersey, the US east coast’s busiest container port, faces the most acute physical challenges.The area’s vast consumer market is certain to keep attracting shipping lines. But the largest vessels will have difficulty reaching four of the port’s five container terminals before 2016, when the $1bn raising of the Bayonne Bridge over an approach channel is completed.Brian Clark, a senior manager at APM Terminals Elizabeth, across a bay from the bridge’s troublesome low steel arch, insists that, since many ships call at New York first on leaving the Panama Canal, the port will be able to bring goods to mid-western customers quicker than rivals.“It would make sense to handle that cargo out of New York, provided that the costs were comparable,” Mr Clark says.Executives at the Virginia Ports Authority, operator of the port of Norfolk, insist their port’s strategic location on the mid-Atlantic coast – in convenient rail reach of many large cities – will attract more new traffic.“We think it makes sense that you could serve so much of the population east of the Mississippi by making a port call here in Virginia,” Jeff Keever, the port’s senior deputy director, says.Wick Moorman, chief executive of Norfolk Southern, CSX’s main rival in the eastern US, points out that many key factors – including future fuel costs, canal tolls and railroad charges – remain uncertain.Most experts consequently avoid predicting which new cranes will be well used and which will lie idle. “The best answer that we seem to receive is a qualified, ‘I don’t know’,” Mr Moorman says.
92;CSX;CSX Corp;2011-08-22T17:24:21Z;The biggest North American railroads;;The US and Canadian railroad industry is dominated by the seven “Class I” railroads, most of them formed as a result of a wave of consolidation in the 1980s and 1990s.In order of 2010 operating revenue, they are:1. Union Pacific: $17bnStill operator of the largest route network of any Class I, Union Pacific is also the only one able to trace its history back to the earliest years of the US railroads, having been formed in 1862 to build the eastern end of the historic Iowa to California trans-continental railroad. It was transformed, however, by its 1996 merger with Southern Pacific. Operating west of the Mississippi, UP depends heavily on hauling containers from west coast ports, on hauling coal from Wyoming’s Powder River Basin and transporting mid-western grain and other bulk products.2. BNSF: $16.8bnThe Burlington Northern and Santa Fe is currently most famous for being owned by Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment vehicle, which bought it in 2009. However, the railroad, product of a 1995 merger between Burlington Northern and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads, was already well-known in the industry for running a highly efficient railroad – which now rivals Union Pacific in revenue despite having a smaller network.3. CSX: $10.6bnCSX, operator of the largest railroad network east of the Mississippi, depends heavily on the region’s industrial base for its traffic. The company divided Conrail, the formerly government-owned railroad company, with Norfolk Southern in a 1997 merger.4. Norfolk Southern: $9.5bnOne of the most efficient railroads, Norfolk Southern has the smaller network of the two east-of-the-Mississippi Class Is but has routes more tightly focused on the main sources of traffic and has long generated better returns than its rivals. It is the most reliant of the Class Is on coal, handling coal produced in the Appalachians, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Much of it is exported through the company’s dedicated coal facility at Lamberts Point in Portsmouth, Virginia.5. Canadian National: $8.38bnCanadian National operates a substantial network in the US, as well as its core trans-continental line linking Vancouver and Calgary to the main eastern Canadian population centres.6. Canadian Pacific: $5.05bnCanadian Pacific, operating a network parallel to CN’s, is less profitable than its larger rival but gradually improving.7. Kansas City Southern: $1.81bnSmallest of the US and Canadian Class Is, Kansas City Southern markets itself as “the Nafta railroad”, since its main routes run north to south, linking Canada to Mexico. It also has extensive operations in Mexico and operates the Panama Canal Railway in Panama.
93;CSX;CSX Corp;2011-08-22T16:20:42Z;Union Pacific crosses profitability threshold;;The operator of the US’s largest railway network has crossed a key profitability threshold for only the second year in its 149-year history, amid a rebound that has vindicated Warren Buffett’s 2009 gamble on the sector.Rob Knight, finance director of Union Pacific, told the Financial Times that its 2010 returns on invested capital exceeded its cost of capital – a key test that the industry’s regulators and investors consider when deciding how much railways can reasonably charge their customers.UP had until recently been slower than other big railways to catch up to its cost of capital threshold – a mark most railways started missing before the second world war. Last year might therefore have been the first in many decades when nearly all big industry players earned returns strong enough to cover their investment costs.Executives at all four of the biggest US-based railway companies – UP, Burlington Northern & Santa Fe, CSX and Norfolk Southern – told the Financial Times that high road fuel prices were pushing increasing numbers of containers on to rail from road. Some export commodities – including grain heading to China – are also performing well.Mr Buffett, the billionaire investor, earlier this year told shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway investment vehicle that his bet on the industry – his $44bn November 2009 acquisition of BNSF – was working out even better than he had expected.Find out the shunting order of the seven Class I railroads on the continentUP, founded in 1862 to build the US’s first trans-continental rail link, said in its annual filing to the Surface Transportation Board watchdog – which uses different methods from published company results to calculate what rail operators can charge – that it generated returns on invested capital of 11.5 per cent for 2010. Since the STB is all but certain to declare the industry’s cost of capital last year was below 11 per cent, UP will comfortably clear the hurdle.The company, which endured several bankruptcies in its chaotic early years, previously earned its cost of capital only in 1995, the year before its takeover of the financially-troubled Southern Pacific.“In our 150-year history, we’re just now getting close to earning our cost of capital on a book value basis,” Mr Knight said.Anthony Hatch, an independent analyst, said the other big US-based operators had also probably either met or come close to meeting the cost-of-capital test.Mr Knight promised the company would not rest on its laurels, however. Like other railways, UP argues the STB’s calculations overstate its returns, meaning that it still has room to improve.“We’ve got to continue to move the business forward, which is where we’re headed,” Mr Knight said.
94;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Texas rail yard highlights growth challenges;;Beneath the scorching Texas sun at Burlington Northern & Santa Fe’s Alliance intermodal yard outside Fort Worth, orange mobile cranes straddle container trains so long they seem to stretch into infinity. The cranes swing containers from trains to waiting tractors then move on swiftly, reflecting the pressure on a yard whose management is stuggling to cope with 13 per cent year-on-year traffic growth so far this year.There is a similar sense of bustle at many key facilities across the US’s railroad system, still the world’s largest by route miles. US railroads’ container traffic – traffic in boxes that can carry anything from Chinese-manufactured toys to food or chemicals – was up 7.8 per cent in the first half of this year, to 421,241 units, against the same period last year, amid only 1 per cent first-half growth in US GDP. Maru Iabichela, the Alliance yard’s manager, says that there have been instances this year where have been held outside the yard, obstructing a main line, for lack of anywhere to put them.The rows of white trucks belonging to JB Hunt, one of the US’s biggest trucking companies, in the Alliance yard’s truck park illustrated one of the main reasons for the robust growth. Many US trucking companies, suffering from high fuel prices, driver shortages and road congestion, have shifted many long-haul trips to rail, and opted instead to handle only the short-haul trips to and from yards such as Alliance.Railcars carrying some of the in-demand commodities that are also contributing to growth – including grain, soya beans and ethanol – are handled at a neighbouring yard.Ms Iabichela’s most pressing concern is to extend the yard’s truck parking area for the fifth time this year – and to find more workers.“We’ve had to hire more aggressively,” Ms Iabichela says. “With these volumes, we need to be flooding those tracks with people, getting cranes up to trains . . . It’s good times.”Yet the good times for BNSF and other railroads are not solely a result of rising traffic. Rob Knight, finance director of Union Pacific, owner of the largest US rail network, is one of many executives to highlight the importance of efficiency improvements since industry deregulation in 1980.A programme to tackle yard congestion and other productivity problems reduced the proportion of UP’s revenues used up by costs from 81.6 per cent in 2006, to 70.6 per cent in 2010, he says. “It’s really unlocking the motivation of all of our employees,” Mr Knight adds.Investment is also sharply up. Norfolk Southern, the second-largest network in the eastern US, has spent heavily on upgrading its Heartland Corridor between Virginia and Chicago to handle new traffic arriving at eastern seaports. Traffic is expected to grow after 2014, when the expanded Panama Canal will allow shipping lines to introduce new, bigger ships on services from Asia.“We’re willing to make those investments in a way that, 20 years ago when every dollar was tight, we would hold back,” Wick Moorman, NS’s chief executive, says.Uncertainties remain, meanwhile. If expansion to the Panama Canal encourages shipping lines to send more goods to US east coast ports, that could cut out some lucrative, long-distance train journeys eastwards from southern Californian ports for BNSF and Union Pacific.“I think our view is that the Panama Canal will change things, certainly in ways that we’re not sure of,” Mr Moorman says. “But our traffic is going to continue to grow from both directions.”Mr Knight also sounds a cautious note about the growing traffic in “ag” commodities such as grain and soya beans that he acknowledges have boosted both UP’s and BNSF’s traffic this year.“Ag markets have tended to come and go, particularly export markets,” he says.Regulators could also step in if market conditions remain favourable. Hearings this year of the Surface Transportation Board – the industry regulator – have investigated customers’ claims that some railroads are exploiting current conditions to overcharge.Mr Knight of UP, which plans $3.3bn capital expenditure this year, says railroads would reduce expenditure on improving capacity and buying new locomotives if regulators capped returns.Yet there remains a powerful sense that today’s railroads face fundamentally different circumstances from 30 years ago.“They’ve changed from inwardly-focused slow or no-growth engineering companies, to companies who have offices globally,” Anthony Hatch, a veteran industry analyst, says. “[They] look to see where manufacturing changes in Asia, how that’s going to impact trade flows.”The US’s clogged highways, poor public finances and truck driver shortages should ensure the growth that has facilitated that transformation continues, according to Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive.“There’s going to be such a shortage of transportation on the highway side of the sector that the railways are going to have to continue to step up and provide more and more capacity,” he says.
95;CSX;CSX Corp;2011-05-25T15:41:16Z;DP World planning London listing;;The company that took P&O, one of the UK’s most famous maritime names, off London’s stock exchange through a £3.9bn takeover is aiming to return to the London market on June 1.DP World, the container port operator that took over P&O in March 2006, said it was planning the London listing to attract a broader range of investors than it had been able to do since its November 2007 listing on Nasdaq Dubai.The company, which raised $5bn in the Middle East’s biggest-ever IPO, has been bitterly disappointed in its share price performance since the Dubai listing. Its shares, which listed at the equivalent of $26 per share, are currently worth barely half that. It published the prospectus for the new, dual listing on Wednesday.Yuvraj Narayan, chief financial officer, also said the London listing would give DP World a more widely accepted acquisition currency than its solely Dubai-listed shares.DP World turned itself from being predominantly a local container terminal operator in Dubai into one of the world’s largest container terminal operators through the P&O acquisition and the $1.15bn takeover of CSX World Terminals in 2004. Both acquisitions were made for cash.“We don’t have any reason in the foreseeable, short-term future to use it,” Mr Narayan said. “But certainly it creates an acquisition currency which is slightly more widely acceptable than the one we had prior to the London listing.”Unusually, there will neither be an issue of new shares with the start of the secondary listing nor a sale of further shares by the existing controlling shareholder, Dubai World, the government-owned conglomerate that holds 80 per cent of the company.“We don’t need any more capital,” Mr Narayan said. “This is essentially giving an additional platform to investors who wish to have an interest in our stock to be able to come and do so.”DP World is heavily focused on developing container terminals in fast-growing emerging markets, where it has long been one of the most active bidders to build new container terminals or take over existing facilities through privatisations.It has the fourth-highest throughput of the four largest container terminal operators, behind Hong Kong’s Hutchison Ports, Singapore’s PSA and APM Terminals, the ports arm of Denmark’s AP Møller-Maersk. DP World claims, however, to have a wider geographical spread than any of its rivals.
96;CSX;CSX Corp;2010-12-22T09:38:44Z;DP World sells $1.5bn Australian stake;;"Dubai’s DP World, one of the world’s biggest shipping container terminal operators, is to raise $1.5bn by selling a 75 per cent stake in its Australian operations in its latest effort to shift focus towards emerging markets.Citi Infrastructure Investors, part of the US’s Citigroup and one of DP World’s largest investors, will pay A$1.5bn (US$1.5bn) for the stake, DP World announced on Wednesday. The Dubai-based company, which manages terminals in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Fremantle, will continue to do so after the stake sale.The operator said it would use the proceeds to pay down some of its $5.9bn net debt. Yuvraj Narayan, DP World’s chief financial officer, said the company would book a $300m profit on the transaction. DP World acquired most of the Australian operations during its £3.92bn takeover of the UK’s P&O in 2006, while it acquired the Adelaide and Brisbane operations through its $1.15bn 2005 takeover of US-based CSX World Terminals.It is the first large-scale deal by an infrastructure fund to buy container terminals, since the credit crisis forced many such funds to financially restructure operations they bought at the height of the pre-crash boom.DP World said the deal was unconnected with the continuing debt problems of Dubai World, the government-owned holding company that owns 80 per cent of DP World’s shares.Mohammed Sharaf, DP World’s chief executive, said the company’s focus was now on emerging markets, including south-east Asia, Latin America and Africa. But he added that it did not necessarily follow, however, that the company would seek to sell stakes in all its operations in mature markets.DP World has significant operations in Antwerp, Europe’s third-busiest container port; a new port under development at Shell Haven on the Thames near London; a stake in operations at the ports of Southampton and Tilbury in the UK; and terminal operations in Vancouver, Canada.“We believe that this is one of the best models that we have today,” Mr Sharaf said of the Australian deal’s structure. “Their focus is on the infrastructure; our focus in on the infrastructure and operating that.”The deal’s proceeds would allow DP World to look at opportunities in markets that would earn it better returns, he added.DP World currently has terminals under development at Santos in Brazil, Kulpi and Vallarpadam in India and Dakar in Senegal. In the past two years, it has also opened terminals in Peru and Vietnam.DP World’s Australian operations handle around half of the containers moving in and out of Australia. Nearly all the others are handled by Sydney-based Patrick, the only other terminal operator at most of the ports covered by the deal. Hong Kong’s Hutchison Port Holdings, the world’s largest container terminal operator, entered the market in January 2008, signing a deal to operate a terminal in the port of Brisbane.The company expected no problems with achieving competition clearance for the deal, Mr Narayan said."
97;CSX;CSX Corp;2010-12-10T23:38:38Z;Equity X factor often spells exasperation;X doesn't often mark the spot;Investors should be wary when companies show more flair for marketing their shares than their products. In his 1989 bestseller One Up on Wall Street, investing legend Peter Lynch warns that “a flashy name in a mediocre company attracts investors and gives them a false sense of security”, and he specifically cautions against buying stocks that have an x in their name.Though I am inclined to give a man who generated average annual returns of 29 per cent for Magellan, the world’s largest mutual fund, the benefit of the doubt, Mr Lynch’s acolytes have no way of knowing whether his warning was the investing equivalent of an old wives’ tale. Until now, that is.There are 109 stocks in the Wilshire 5000 index, among the broadest measures of US equities, that either begin or end with an x, and a few that do both. One obvious measure of how speculative such “x stocks” are is their price-to-earnings ratios but, in the first hint that Mr Lynch was on to something, only 49 of them made a profit in the past year. A way around this is to aggregate the market value and net earnings of the entire group. The results are not pretty. “X Inc” trades at a steep 29 times trailing earnings versus 18 for the entire index. On price-to- book, a measure that cannot be negative, the average “x stock” trades at 4.9 times, nearly, more than double the index. They are also twice as volatile on average.Unsurprisingly, the list is packed with futuristic-sounding names like GigOptix, Cytrix, Keryx Biopharma, Affymetrix and Oncogenex that offer technological promise but scant profits. Some that are profitable like Netflix must keep growing rapidly to justify current multiples. Partially making up for this are some large, profitable companies in the relatively dowdy logistics and retail industries such as FedEx, CSX and TJX. And then there are those like Idexx and Xilinx that break the stereotype by adding a gratuitous second x while sporting pedestrian valuations. The company that blazed the trail for double-x stocks was Xerox, a blue-chip that appreciated by 5,000 per cent during the 1960s after changing its name from Haloid. Inventing the photocopier probably helped too.Still, an x can often spell even worse trouble than a frothy valuation. A disproportionate number of “x stocks” have been embroiled in scandal, with Canada’s Bre-X being perhaps the largest. The company was on the verge of being bought by Freeport-McMoRan after supposedly discovering the world’s largest gold mine in Indonesia. When it emerged that ore samples had been infused with jewellery shavings, Bre-X’s lead geologist became the fall guy – literally – plunging to his death from a company helicopter.Another “x stock,” the futuristic-sounding YBM Magnex, lured investors with purportedly surging industrial magnet sales. After being valued at $1bn in 1998, it was exposed as a money-laundering front for Russia’s leading mafia kingpin.Weirdest of all was Solv-Ex. The company, which claimed to have developed a novel way to extract Canadian oil sands, so impressed British fund manager Peter Young that he set up unauthorised offshore accounts to magnify his exposure to the firm. When it emerged that its plant and technology were a sham, it cost his employer Morgan Grenfell an estimated £400m. Mr Young became a tabloid sensation by coming to court in a dress, pleading insanity.One does not have to be a Scrabble star to grasp how rare the letter x is in the English language – Samuel Morse did so when developing his code – so modern-day telegraph operators would surely notice that listed companies with an x in their name show up about 17 times more than common words.Lynch retired a decade before the dotcom bubble burst. It would have been interesting to see how he steered the billions at his disposal when confronted with glamour stocks such as Pets.com. Retiring in the prime of his career, he avoided the dilemma of ignoring his instincts or facing outflows to rivals claiming he “just didn’t get it”. His seemingly throwaway comment about x stocks is yet more evidence that he most certainly did.

Hewlett-Packard rose 1.2 per cent to $44.25 after it was added to the UBS short term buy list.Analysts said holiday sales of computers and servers would drive fourth quarter results. But they kept its long term rating “neutral” on concerns of increasing competition.Intel was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” by UBS and given a price target of $25. Shares rose during the day but closed down 0.1 per cent at $21.23. Analysts predicted that the PC component inventory cycle had bottomed out and that the threat from tablet computers was included in the sales outlook.Amazon.com surged 0.7 per cent to $171.99 after the online retailer bought privately owned Quidsi, which owns diapers.com and soap.com. It paid $500m in cash for the company that will help it expand into baby care products.Yahoo rose 1.1 per cent to $16.44 after it was reported that the search engine operator could be exploring a tie-up with AOL. The latter’s shares climbed 4.7 per cent to $26.10.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,223.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.3 per cent to close at 11,406.84, but the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.1 at 2,580.05.Last week, stocks hit their highest levels in two years as investors cheered the Federal Reserve’s decision to extend quantitative easing and the Republican victory in the House of Representatives. David Bianco, head of US equity strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, comparing the market to last time the S&P 500 broke out above 1,200 in April, said: “There are many fundamental reasons for stocks to rally further.“Higher earnings per share has made the S&P cheaper today than in April. Currently, the S&P is trading at 13.8 times annualised third-quarter earnings per share compared with 15.2 times annualised first-quarter earnings per share in April.“We believe the rising likelihood of Congress passing a tax package before year-end can get the S&P close to 1,300.”Financials fell 0.8 per cent as regional banks continued to suffer since they reported their third-quarter results.The S&P 500 regional banking index slid 0.8 per cent with Regions Financial Corp losing 1.7 per cent to $6.34 and PNC Financial Services declining 1.3 per cent to $57.65.Analysts at Oppenheimer reaffirmed their “overweight” rating for the industrial sector but said they were selectively increasing risk exposure, looking at machinery and road and rail stocks. They said machinery stocks were attractive because they would benefit from new orders and construction spending trends. Analysts at Credit Suisse echoed this recommendation, saying the stocks were cheap.Oppenheimer analysts also said road and rail stocks were expected to increase their sales, earnings and margins at a higher rate than the overall sector in 2011 because of freight volumes and truck tonnage increasing significantly in recent months.The S&P 500 industrials sector lost 0.3 per cent.But manufacturing and construction company Fluor added 2.2 per cent to $55.72 and rail transport stocks CSX and Union Pacific both edged up.CSX rose 0.7 per cent to $62.23 and Union Pacific, which benefited from an upgrade at Credit Suisse, was up 0.8 per cent to $91.98. Also in industrials, Boeing shares fell in spite of a $3.3bn order from Saudi Arabian Airlines for 12 aircraft and were lower by
1.5 per cent at $70.21.In materials, General Steel Holdings fell 6.8 per cent to $2.76 after the Chinese group reported a surprise third-quarter loss as it suffered from higher prices of iron ore and coking coal.McDonald’s was almost flat at $79.31 after it reported its global sales in October. The rise of 6.5 per cent was helped in recent months by sales of smoothies and its dollar menu but the increase in the US was lower than analysts had forecast. Sysco, which distributes food for the food service industry, fell 2.7 per cent to $29.23 after it reported its earnings were squeezed by higher food and commodity costs."
99;CSX;CSX Corp;2010-11-02T16:56:04Z;Investors gauge election bounce;;Even though Republicans, touting business-friendly policies, appear set to take control of the US House of Representatives from Democrats, analysts are far from certain about the potential for a positive bounce for the US stock market.Historically, US markets have performed extremely well in the fourth quarter of a midterm year, following the typical loss of seats for the president’s party in the midterm election.The S&P 500 index has not made a total return of less than 10 per cent in such a quarter since 1950, according to figures from LPL Financial. UBS research shows that the year after a midterm, the S&P 500 sees a median price increase of nearly 20 per cent.Stock markets tend to prize political gridlock, believing fewer new regulations will emerge and less government deficit spending will keep borrowing rates low. A study by Fidelity Investments found that large-cap stocks saw average price gains of 23 per cent during the four periods of gridlock – a split in party control of the White House and both houses of Congress – since 1970.Some of those gains will already be priced in, however, in part because gridlock to some degree has been the rule in Washington since Democrats lost their 60th vote in the Senate. Only a surprise Republican seizure of the Senate could be a near-term catalyst for further gridlock-led gains.Other factors will also limit the effect. The largest looming change resulting from increased clout for the Republicans – an agreement to extend the Bush tax cuts, which would lower government revenues by $500bn, according to the Congressional Budget Office – will probably not be resolved to the market’s satisfaction by the election.“The changes may not be permanent,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. “A one-year extension of current tax rates may not be as welcome as a [permanent] resolution of the tax rate uncertainty.”A report on deficits by a bipartisan committee set for December could be a much more important event for clarity on tax cuts, analysts said, as a recommendation to extend would provide cover for Democrats who may face frustration from their own base if they agree to cuts.If such changes do come to pass, higher-yielding stocks could rally as investors look to take advantage of the extended tax break to pocket dividends.“High dividend-paying sectors such as telecoms and utilities may benefit. Cash-rich companies in other sectors may also benefit as they introduce or substantially increase their dividend payout as they look to attract a new class of investors seeking yield,” said Mr Kleintop.Many strategists have argued that the S&P 500 index has been discounted in 2010 due to uncertainty created by the tax expiration, heavier regulation and deficit spending. The S&P has risen just 6 per cent so far this year, even as earnings-per-share are projected to increase 35 per cent this year.Thomas Doerflinger, strategist at UBS, termed recent policies such as healthcare reform, financial regulation, a Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium and the tax rises likely to follow from deficit spending, “the Great Suppression”.“It should be positive for equities if the 2010 elections begin a policy shift toward lower taxes, less spending, and lighter regulation,” he said.He warned, however, that the Republican victory would not represent an immediate reversal of the “Great Suppression”. He said he was watching for a “tax holiday” on a repatriation of foreign earnings, which could signal a significant shift in the balance of power.Economists at RBS warned that a sizable victory may also raise expectations of Republican victory in the 2012 presidential election, and could hinder the economy over the next two years.“Hopes of a more business-friendly fiscal agenda, if the Republicans sweep both the presidency and Congress in 2012, could keep companies from aggressively hiring and capital spending near-term,” said Michelle Girard and Omair Sharif of RBS.The circumstances of this election are also historically unique, coming on the eve of what is expected to be a massive intervention by the US Federal Reserve in the form of “quantitative easing”.Bruce Bittles, equity strategist at Robert W. Baird, said the expected election result would not be a strong catalyst itself, instead only raising the relative importance of the Fed as an economic actor.“If we get political gridlock in Washington, as expected, the Federal Reserve will be the one left with any ability to provide stimulus to the economy,” he said.Economists at Société Générale suggested that changing course could unravel the gains seen as “QE2” has been priced in, and from a cheap dollar powering global revenues at multinational groups.“New fiscal stimulus, more likely [if the Democrats retain significant power], could prove potent, particularly when combined with further monetary easing,” they said. “The increased presence of conservatives could lead to premature fiscal tightening, which would be a negative for the economy, and risky assets.”The economy is also not in a typical position. In the 1980s and 1990s, gridlock was prized because it was not to going to upset already strong growth. The 1994 Republican sweep into power in Congress saw the S&P 500 index return 30 per cent in the fourth quarter of that year.The poorest showing for the market after a midterm election was in 1978, when inflation was rampant and investors were frustrated that the government was not cutting spending faster. The S&P rose 12 per cent.In an environment with high unemployment and deflation, gridlock may similarly not be as valuable to the market.Richard Soultanian of Nus Consulting, who advises companies on financial decisions, said: “Gridlock can be a positive when the country’s underlying economy and fiscal situation are in good order. Today this is not the case …The act of doing nothing will hamper the global economic recovery rather than accelerating it.”

Intel said fourth-quarter sales could be below expectations.Analysts noted that its development of a new chip product, known as Sandy Bridge, could hinder future margin improvement.Linear Technology, which builds components for Apple’s iPad, missed its quarterly earnings target and said next quarter’s earnings could also miss. The shares lost 3.9 per cent to $30.15.However, the technology sector was broadly higher thanks to Intel’s steady consumer sales. Cisco was up 2.5 per cent to $23.18, and Hewlett-Packard added 2.1 per cent to $42.21.JPMorgan Chase topped estimates by reducing its credit loss write-offs, but income in its investment banking division declined. It also said it could incur more losses due to its mortgage portfolio.Its shares fell 1.4 per cent to $39.84.Financials were the only sector to decline, amid fears that banks would have to buy back bad mortgages and incur heavy losses.Wells Fargo fell 0.7 per cent to $25.81, Citigroup slipped 0.6 per cent to $4.28 and Bank of America was down 1.7 per cent at $13.29.The St. Joe Company, a Florida real estate developer, fell 9.8 per cent to $22.14 after David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital revealed that he was shorting the stock.“Mortgages continue to produce stiff headwinds,” said Glenn Schorr, head of financials equity research at Nomura Securities.Chevron, the US oil major, warned that costs due to the Gulf of Mexico drilling ban and the weaker dollar would hurt third-quarter earnings.

101;CSX;CSX Corp;2010-09-22T21:28:30Z;Return trip to top levels of UK transport;Tim O’Toole elevated to the leading job at First Group;Tim O’Toole’s elevation to the leading job at First Group represents a remarkable return to the top levels in British transport, less than 18 months after he announced his departure from the UK to return to his native Philadelphia.Mr O’Toole had spent six years in London as managing director of London Underground, operator of the capital’s tube. He left in April last year saying he wanted to spend more time with his family, amid rumours of rows over future funding for underground upgrades.He had become one of the most respected figures in UK transport and brought new discipline to London Underground’s operations.He never fully left the UK. He became a non-executive director of FirstGroup in May 2009 and, this March, was approached by Tube Lines, the private contractor upgrading three London tube lines, to be its chief executive. That offer lapsed after London Underground announced in May it was taking Tube Lines over.Instead, in June he became FirstGroup’s chief operating officer and deputy chief executive, a move that can now be seen as preparation for his elevation to the top job.Mr O’Toole, who has a reputation as an intense, methodical man with an eye for operational detail, has previous experience as chief executive of a major company. He was the last chief executive of Conrail, one of the US’s biggest railroads, before it was split up between CSX and Norfolk Southern, two rivals. He is still a non-executive director of CSX.However, he is likely to need both his operational expertise and his skill at operating with the public sector in his new task. FirstGroup both needs to maintain a tight grip over complex operations such as its First Great Western rail franchise and do its best to avoid losing out from looming cuts in UK public spending.

However, he added: “Nevertheless, we believe the potential for somewhat waffling guidance has the equity community worried at present.”Investors remain fearful. Mr Zyblock said: “The budding note of caution seems most closely linked to the idea that we had all turned too optimistic about growth rates on earnings.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 1.5 per cent at 1,095.34, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4 per cent to 10,363.02 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2 per cent to 2,242.03.Alcoa advanced 1.2 per cent to $11 a day after the largest US aluminium producer reported second-quarter profit that modestly beat analysts’ expectations, as higher metal prices boosted revenues.CSX, a freight transportation company, fell 1.4 per cent to $51.72 after rallying at the start of the session. It had reported second-quarter earnings of $1.07 per share, also topping analysts’ average estimates.Tyco Electronics, a leading maker of electronic connectors, rallied 2.5 per cent to $25.92 as it agreed to buy ADC Telecommunications for about $1.25bn to bolster its broadband connectivity products offering.Shares in ADC surged 41.5 per cent to $12.52. Trading in the stock was halted for part of the session.AIG gained 6.8 per cent to $37.99 as the bailed-out insurer’s board was reported to be close to agreeing to sell its AIA Asian unit in an initial public offering. An announced sale of the unit to London-listed Prudential collapsed last month after the latter’s shareholders failed to support the deal.Intel, a leading semiconductor maker, was up 2.1 per cent to $21 ahead of its second-quarter earnings announcement, due after the close of trading.US-listed shares in BP were up 0.3 per cent to $36.88, as tests continued on its new sealing cap for the leaking oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The company is forecast to pay about $10bn less tax over the next four years as it meets the costs of its huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, hitting the revenues that Britain and the US receive from the oil group each year.Apple was among the worst performers in the S&P 500 as the stock dropped 2.1 per cent to $251.80. Its latest iPhone model was not recommended by Consumer Reports, an influential publication which carries out consumer products comparisons, in its latest review of smartphones. JPMorgan said that Apple was set for “prolonged negative” public relations after failing to win the’commendation.“The problem seems to be a design flaw, and it is significant,” said Mike Gikas, senior electronics editor at Consumer Reports. The publication has recommended the three previous iPhone models.Financial stocks were higher across the board as a landmark financial reform bill neared final approval in Congress. Three Republicans said late on Monday they would support the bill, boosting the 54 Democrats and two independents who are also expected to vote for it. The bill needs 60 votes be approved.Goldman Sachs was up 2.2 per cent to $140.25, Citigroup added 4.6 per cent to $4.30, Morgan Stanley gained 4.5 per cent to $25.66 and JPMorganclimbed 3.3 per cent to $40.48.Invesco, the manager of the Aim and PowerShares funds, was one of the day’s best performers as it rallied 6.5 per cent to $19.43. The company reported assets under management of $558bn at the end of the second quarter, beating analysts’ average estimates.Fastenal, an industrial distributor, posted better-than-expected earnings, boosted by a 20 per cent surge in revenues. But its shares fell 4.1 per cent at $50.44 after rallying more than 22 per cent since the start of the year. Its net income in the quarter was 47 cents per share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 44 cents.
103;CSX;CSX Corp;2010-07-13T20:52:42Z;Solid start to US earnings season trumps China worries;Investors shrug off mixed global economic data;Tuesday 21:35 BST. A positive start to the US second-quarter earnings season overpowered worries about China’s property market, the US trade deficit and evidence of waning investor confidence in the German economy.The FTSE All-Word equity index was up 1.5 per cent, commodities reversed early losses and the dollar shed initial gains as traders embraced elements of risk. Treasury yields rose after a lukewarm reception in an auction of 10-year notes, suggesting that confidence in risky assets was such that near-3 per cent yields were no longer very attractive.While the session began with Asian markets struggling, Wall Street’s S&P 500 was up 1.5 per cent, with optimism on earnings trumping a downbeat NFIB small business survey and a fall in weekly chain store sales. Markets also barely reacted to a two-notch downgrade of Portugal’s sovereign debt by Moody’s, the rating agency.Traders even seized on a sunnier interpretation to the widest US trade deficit since 2008, after some economists pointed out that imports rose faster than exports, which could contradict the impression that US consumers were no longer in a buying mood.The collective shrug to bad news was a welcome sign after every negative indicator in May and June was greeted as evidence of an impending second recession.“During that period, the market extrapolated each weaker-than-expected data point into ‘double dip’ fears,” said John Canally, economist at LPL Financial. “This is in sharp contrast.”Such is the spring in investors’ step during earnings season. The US season kicked off after the close on Monday with Alcoa. The aluminium giant – the traditional curtain-raiser to several weeks of reporting – increased its demand forecasts for the metal and highlighted the appetite for its product in quickly growing economies such as China.This helped calm fears among traders that activity was slowing in developing nations, as the fallout from several months of market turmoil – particularly with regard to the eurozone’s fiscal woes – takes its toll.Risk appetite in the early part of the session was tepid amid rumours that Beijing may be instituting tougher controls on property speculation. Although analysts disagree whether the Chinese real estate market can be described as a bubble, many fear that too draconian a clampdown could cause a sharp retrenchment that may hit broader demand and leave some of the nation’s banks vulnerable to bad loans.Asian markets turned tail on the development and confidence in Europe took a further knock after the ZEW reading of German investor sentiment fell in July by much more than expected, hitting a 15-month low. Infosys, the Indian software services group, also said it missed profit forecasts after disappointing sales in Europe. That increased concerns that the region’s woes will trim the earnings of those groups with exposure to the bloc.But animal spirits were reinvigorated by a spate of strong company reports. BMW raised its 2010 outlook. In the US, CSX, the railroad operator, also on Monday had reported a 36 per cent gain in second-quarter profit, crediting sharply improving volumes of coal shipments, though it warned that the second quarter may be its peak for the year.And, to top off the day, Intel, the US chipmaker, said that second-quarter earnings – and its best sales figure in its 42-year history– topped expectations on the strength of improving margins. That should continue the rally into Wednesday’s session.● Asia. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index lost 0.3 per cent, with Chinese stocks doing much of the damage. Shanghai’s property sector fell 3.2 per cent, leading the Composite Index to a 1.6 per cent decline. Hong Kong fell 0.2 per cent.Sydney closed down 0.7 per cent as miners succumbed to global growth worries. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gave up early gains to finish down 0.1 per cent.● Europe. Bourses opened higher, reflecting Wall Street’s rally off lows, following Europe’s close on Monday. London’s FTSE 100 rose 2 per cent, boosted by miners reversing early losses and again helped by an advance for BP.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was up 1.9 per cent, as the BMW comments boost autos and with all sub-sectors sporting gains. Athens climbed 2.6 per cent, with the nation’s beleaguered banks up between 4 and 10 per cent on relief following the debt auction.● Forex. Sterling rallied 0.9 per cent versus the dollar to $1.5165 following news that UK core inflation moved higher in June.The dollar was the main beneficiary of Asia’s wobble, but it relinquished its gains as Europe took a more risk-aggressive stance, and following the trade deficit figures. The buck was down 0.8 per cent on a trade-weighted basis and was down 0.9 per cent versus the euro to $1.2714The single currency came under further pressure after Moody’s, the rating agency, downgraded Portugal’s debt, though the wobble was brief and news of the successful Greek auction later provided support.● Debt. The Moody’s action weighed on Lisbon’s bonds, however, pushing the 10-year yield up 9 basis points to 5.51 per cent. The spread between Portuguese and German benchmarks rose above 290 basis points at one stage as investors demanded a greater risk premium for the former.However, the spread was 287 basis points as Bunds falter in the face of improving risk appetite after Greece managed to sell €1.63bn of bills.US 10-year Treasury yields are still flirting with 3 per cent as some bond investors appear reluctant to swallow the recent risk rally. The benchmark was up 5 basis points at 3.11 per cent – fresh intra-day highs – after an auction of $21bn of 10-year notes stopped at 1bp higher than the market price. That follows a weak debut for 3-year bonds on Tuesday.“With the lessening of concern over an immediate blow-up in the EU sovereign debt markets, the flight-to-quality bid is losing some steam,” said Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies.A relatively successful, if expensive, auction of Greek six-month bills also calmed nerves – though given the ECB remains as an implicit back-stop to the eurozone sovereign debt markets, the outcome was hardly surprising.● Commodities. Any China growth concerns are guaranteed to hurt metals, and sure enough, copper led the complex lower in early European trading. However, the improvement in broader risk appetite encouraged buying, and the red metal moved into positive territory, helping the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index to rise 1.4 per cent.Oil has also turned round an initial decline and tracked equities’ move higher. The US crude contract was up 3 per cent at $77.18 a barrel.Gold was up 1.3 per cent at $1,212 an ounce. Some analysts were suggesting the bullion had spiked because the Portugal downgrade had raised eurozone concerns. But if that was the case, then gold was the only asset – other than Portuguese debt – that seemed remotely bothered by Moody’s move. A weaker dollar may be a better explanation, but again, gold has recently lacked any consistency in its negative correlation to the buck.Follow Jamie Chisholm’s market comments on Twitter: @JamieAChisholm
104;CSX;CSX Corp;2010-04-14T21:24:51Z;S&P rises past 1,200 on earnings momentum;;The S&P 500 index broke through the key 1,200 level on Wednesday for the first time since September 2008, as positive earnings results from JPMorganChase and Intel gave the bulls reason to cheer.A good US retail sales report and tame inflation figures also helped boost risk appetite.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 1.1 per cent at 1,210.65, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 11,123.11 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.6 per cent higher at 2,504.86.Financials stocks were some of the session’s best performers.JPMorgan rallied 4.1 per cent to $47.73 as the second-largest US bank by assets reported first-quarter earnings that beat average analyst expectations. Excluding non-recurring items, it earned 74 cents per share.Chipmaker Intel, which announced its results after the market closed on Tuesday, climbed 3.3 per cent at $23.52 as it forecast second-quarter sales that exceeded average analyst expectations.Intel’s first-quarter earnings of 43 cents per share also topped average expectations of 38 cents per share.The strong results helped boost semiconductor stocks.Micron Technology rose 5 per cent to $11.30, Texas Instruments was up 4 per cent to $26.90 and SanDisk added 4.8 per cent to $37.68 – a two-year high.Morgan Stanley climbed 2.2 per cent to $31.14 in spite of reports that the bank had advised investors that it faced up to a two-thirds loss on its $8.8bn real estate fund.Citigroup was 6.7 per cent higher to $4.93 as the bank announced its plan to sell a hedge fund unit with $4.2bn worth of assets to SkyBridge Capital, a New York-based company that invests in small fund managers.The sale is part of Citigroup’s strategy to streamline its operations. Terms of the deal were not disclosedPalm, the smartphone maker, rallied 3.1 per cent to $5.32 on continuing speculation that the company will be sold.It has hired Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners, a firm run by Silicon Valley banker Frank Quattrone, as advisers.Speculation over a potential buyer has centred on Chinese PC maker Lenovo and Taiwanese smartphone producer HTC.Health insurance companies were the session’s laggards. UnitedHealth led the sector lower, losing 3.5 per cent to $31.05. WellPoint declined 2 per cent to $58.96 and Cigna fell 2.9 per cent to $34.68.Among pharmaceuticals, Pfizer was down 0.6 per cent to $17.07 and Merck lost 1.3 per cent to $36.21.Apple rose 1.3 per cent to $245.69 as the company said it would delay the international launch of the iPad tablet computer device by one month as demand in the US had been higher than expected. It said it had sold more than 500,000 units in the first week of its launch.Carmaker Toyota added 1.6 per cent to $80.33 in spite of announcing that it had suspended sales of a new Lexus SUV model in the US while it investigated the risk for roll-over accidents. The move comes a day after Consumer Reports magazine labelled the model a “safety risk” and advised its readers not to buy it until the issue had been resolved.W. W. Grainger, a distributor of building-maintenance supplies, slid 3.9 per cent to $111.15, in spite of reporting better-than-expected first-quarter profits. The stock closed at its all-time high on Tuesday.Speciality chemical company Lubrizol was 2.5 per cent higher at $93.59 as reports emerged that it had approached Cognis, a German additives group, about a takeover that could value the target company at about $4.1bn. Neither company has commented on the reports.Nasdaq-listed shares in Ericsson, the Swedish telecom equipment company, rose 4.6 per cent to $10.97 as the stock was upgraded from “neutral” to “outperform” at Credit Suisse and the target price raised.“Ericsson should see a robust recovery in earnings over the next 12 months,” Credit Suisse said.CSX, a leading railway company in the eastern US, was 4.1 per cent higher at $55.46 after posting better-than-expected first-quarter earnings after the session’s close on Tuesday.
105;CSX;CSX Corp;2010-04-13T21:05:33Z;Investors trim bets as worries about Greece return;US pessimism on economy weighs on sentiment;22:00 BST: A mildly disappointing start to the US first-quarter earnings season and a more cautious assessment of the bail-out for Greece provided the excuse for investors to pare back risky bets on Tuesday.The FTSE All-World equity index dropped 0.3 per cent from cyclical highs and the euro weakened as some traders argued that details of the €30bn ($41bn, £26.6bn) aid package for Athens were – yet again – vague, and did not solve the fundamental budget problems that heavily indebted nations face.“Reaction to the Greek bail-out package can only be described as lukewarm,” said strategists at Royal Bank of Scotland in a note.“The market still has some doubt over Greece’s ability to turn its fiscal position around and some investors view the bail-out as only kicking the can down the road.”In addition, investors were wary that equities, in particular, were looking overstretched in some major markets – the S&P 500 has risen six weeks in a row to recent 18-month highs – and looked vulnerable to any earnings anti-climax.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.1 per cent at the end of a mostly down session after Alcoa, the traditional vanguard of the reporting season, missed analysts’ sales estimates when the aluminium group reported after the market close on Monday. A weak reading of US small business confidence also weighed on sentiment as did rumours that the Federal Reserve was preparing to change its language on monetary policy guidance.“Not to diminish the impact of Greece or any of the other significant global headwinds that has the US markets on edge,” said Tom Porcelli, US market economist at RBC Capital Markets, “but we don’t need to look very far to find enough of our own headwinds right here inside the US.”Against those headwinds, however, traders are still anticipating an earnings season that will confirm their underlying belief in a solidifying US recovery. Hopes for companies such as JPMorgan Chase and GE, presenting later this week, buoyed the market.Shares in railroad CSX, the first to present after the bell, jumped 3 per cent in after-hours trading after reporting a 22 per cent earnings rise. Intel shares jumped 4 per cent in late trading after beating both revenue and earnings expectations.● Longer-dated Greek bonds were again under pressure in spite of strong demand for a €1.6bn auction of six-month and 1-year bills.The auction’s outcome was as expected, given the backstop provided by the eurozone, but investors remain unconvinced that Greece has the ability to deliver a long-term solution to its budget deficit and this has left the funding costs of Athens at stubbornly high levels. The 10-year yield on Tuesday rose 25 basis points to 6.89 per cent, leaving the spread with Bunds – the premium Greece must pay to raise money – at a punishing 375 basis points. Two-year Greek yields retraced early declines to rise 4 basis points to 6.35 per cent and the cost of insuring Greece debt against default rose 2 per cent.The yield on 10-year Treasuries were lower, continuing the retreat from the 4 per cent level breached last week as investors found the payout attractive relative to supposedly overstretched stock markets. The benchmark yield dipped 3 basis points to 3.81 per cent.● Asian and European bourses took their lead from the softer US futures. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.2 per cent and the FTSE 100 in London lost 0.3 per cent, with miners causing most of the damage. Athens fell 2.2 per cent as bank stocks relapsed after Monday’s sharp bounce.The FTSE Asia-Pacific index dropped 0.6 per cent, led lower by Tokyo, where the Nikkei 225 lost 0.8 per cent as higher risk aversion boosted the yen and hurt exporting stocks. Shanghai came back from an early fall to advance 1 per cent, with technical issues seeing heavyweight stocks bought ahead of the introduction of index futures on Friday, according to Reuters. Hong Kong dropped 0.2 per cent, while softer commodity prices hurt Sydney, which fell 0.7 per cent.● The euro struggled to make further headway after its bounce over the past two trading sessions. The single currency fell fractionally to $1.3587 as traders took a more cynical view of the likely effectiveness of the Greek aid in drawing a line under the eurozone’s fiscal woes.The yen was in focus after a group of politicians from Japan’s ruling party said they wanted to see the yen at Y120 to the dollar. The Japanese currency lost early gains versus the greenback to sit 0.1 softer at Y93.16.The dollar index, which measures the buck against a basket of its peers, was slightly lower at 80.53 as traders contemplated the chatter about the Fed’s policy language shift.● Industrial commodities were mixed. Oil lost 35 cents, to $83.99 a barrel, extending a four-day losing streak. It pared earlier deeper losses after President Obama started talking tougher about Iran at a nuclear summit, prompting the usual fears of an interruption in supply.Copper appeared still to be buoyed by strong Chinese import figures and managed to rise 0.9 per cent to $3.59 in US trading.Gold continued its sharp reversal from the four-month high of $1,169 an ounce hit early in the previous session. The precious metal fell 0.4 per cent to $1,151.Meanwhile, there were signs of shortages building in agricultural commodities after China sold nearly 80 per cent of its 1m tonnes of reserves in an attempt to damp market prices.“China can only pull this trick once, and in the context of grains and now resurgent sugar prices being the only items keeping the CRB [the benchmark commodities index] from soaring in Q1, we would gain highlight the underlying swell of inflationary pressures,” said Marc Ostwald at Monument Securities in London.Additional reporting by Telis Demos in New York
106;CSX;CSX Corp;2010-02-06T00:43:00Z;Perfectly preserved;;"Were someone to ask you to name the largest city in the US, you would be forgiven if you cited New York, Los Angeles or Houston. But the answer is Jacksonville, Florida. Of course this is a trick question – Jacksonville is the largest (in the contiguous 48 states) only in terms of land area. In terms of population it is further down the list.The city is defined by the St Johns River, which bisects it en route to the nearby Atlantic coast. The mild climate and access to the ocean have made it an important centre for the US Navy and for commercial shipping and it has attracted the back-office operations of several national financial institutions. A logistical centre, Jacksonville is also home to CSX Corporation, the dominant rail company in the eastern US.Many of the city’s residents live in the cookie-cutter subdivisions that seem to define much of Florida but, since the 1970s, a dedicated group of locals has fought to preserve two neighbourhoods, Riverside and Avondale. Today the result of those efforts is one of the largest collections of early to mid-20th-century residential architecture in the country, protected by national historic district status.All told, Riverside and Avondale, which lie contiguously along the bank of the St Johns River, comprise a collection of about 5,000 buildings, of which about three-quarters are protected by historic designation. Architectural styles range from late Victorian to craftsman bungalows, colonial revival and prairie school, the design tradition of America’s pre-eminent 20th-century architect, Frank Lloyd Wright.That this collection exists is largely due to a disaster – Jacksonville’s Great Fire of 1901, which destroyed the city centre and left 10,000 homeless. The fire triggered a construction boom, with more than 13,000 new residential and commercial buildings erected in the following 11 years. Riverside, which had previously been a retreat for Jacksonville’s wealthy, filled up rapidly and developers moved on to Avondale, further down the river.Henry John Klutho, a young architect from the Midwest, designed much of the new city centre, influenced by Wright’s horizontal motifs. One of his buildings, a department store with atrium, became City Hall and his firm picked up many residential commissions in Riverside and Avondale.Riverside went into decline in the 1960s as more affluent residents fled the city for the suburbs. By the 1970s the housing stock was deteriorating and crime was growing but local activists launched an ultimately successful drive to secure historical recognition and created Riverside Avondale Preservation (RAP), now a strong and politically active organisation of residents of the area. Many houses sport an RAP plaque and the group’s members and staff lobby city government to protect their neighbourhood. An ambitious new project undertaken by the group has been the establishment of a weekly art market that takes place under a bridge and has space for 180 vendors, with a waiting list of hundreds more.The historic district designation in 2000 and the opening of a big supermarket in Riverside three years later spurred interest in the area, says Sally Suslak, owner of Traditions Realty, a boutique estate agency that focuses on the Riverside-Avondale market. Today buyers are seeking out the area because of its demographic diversity and its central location, she says. It is a measure of the renewed interest that she has taken on 13 agents since starting her firm in the depths of the 2008 slump.Typical of the enthusiasts for the neighbourhood is Joe Kincart, a patent attorney who works for Johnson & Johnson, the consumer health and medical device company. Kincart moved to Jacksonville after spending years in large New York intellectual property practices, seeking a life where he could spend more time with his family and less time commuting. Initially, the family moved to one of the city’s numerous gated communities but Kincart’s discovery of Riverside was serendipitous. His daughter, Rachel, had been invited to a party at a local park and her father accompanied her. When it turned out they had the date wrong, they took a long walk and by the end of their stroll Kincart had decided he wanted to live there. Fortunately, his wife and other children agreed.They now live in a four-bedroom, three-bathroom, fully restored frame house on Riverside Avenue within easy walking distance of two commercial districts containing a clutch of small stores, restaurants ranging from traditional Southern cooking to Spanish tapas, and even tattoo parlours. “It’s the closest thing to Greenwich Village you’ll find in Florida,” says Kincart.They are leasing their new home as they wait to sell their suburban house, paying $2,500 a month for a lease with the option to buy. Kincart says a similar house would lease for $4,500 a month in the Connecticut commuting town where he previously lived.Ginny Steiger moved into a 1930s-style, three-bedroom, two-bathroom bungalow in Avondale in 2007. She says visitors often ask about the renovations the house required and are surprised when they learn it is new. A retiree, Steiger says her block exemplifies the diversity of local residents. “It’s a complete mix of people, just every type of person.”Another recent arrival in the neighbourhood is Al Letson, a 37-year-old rap artist/flight attendant/poet who won a $200,000 grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to develop a new radio programme, “State of the Re:union”, themed, appropriately enough, around the rebuilding of community in US cities.Until four years ago Letson lived in Riverside but he moved further out when property prices began to escalate. Now he has returned – at least during the workday. His new production company is housed in a colonial revival house that has been outfitted with computers and studios. “To me, Riverside is the heart of Jacksonville; it’s the soul of Jacksonville,” says Letson. “I love this place because once you are here a while everybody gets to know you.”Like cities all over Florida, Jacksonville has sustained damage from the collapse of the housing market. According to data from RealtyTrac, which tracks foreclosures, in 2009 one in 22 homes in the city was affected, and the Jacksonville metropolitain area ranked 26th in the US in terms of percentage of homes in some form of reposession. Despite the troubles, however, Riverside and Avondale remain free of the boarded-up houses and dereliction that scar many urban and suburban areas elsewhere.Myrtice Craig, a longtime Riverside resident and estate agent, acknowledges that the property price run-up got out of hand, leading even her to make investments that have put her under financial strain. Nonetheless, she remains committed to the area.“Here’s why people love it here,” she says. “They can walk, they can bike, they can jog, they can buy most of what they need [in local shops] and they feel safe. It’s a walking neighbourhood.”For prospective residents, the downturn means there are deals to be had, though sales have picked up in the lower price ranges. Sheron Willson, a broker with Prudential Network Realty, says single-family houses range in price from $150,000 for a renovated bungalow to a fully restored mansion on the riverfront for more than $3m.A renovated three-bedroom house built in 1944 in Riverside is listed for $129,000 while a renovated 1909 craftsman bungalow with three bedrooms, two bathrooms and working fireplaces is $239,000. At the top end of the market, a two-storey, 4,858-sq ft home with landscaped gardens and brick patios is listed at $1.45m.Henry Hamman is an FT contributor based in Sewanee, Tennessee………………………Estate agenciesPrudential Network Realty, tel: +1 904388 5005, www.prudentialnetworkrealty.com

107;CSX;CSX Corp;2010-01-21T20:29:07Z;Train spotty;Investors’ zeal for US railroads comes amid mediocre fundamentals;When Warren Buffett described his $34bn deal for freight railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe as an “all-in wager” on the US economy, it highlighted the utility-like nature of these natural monopolies. But for anyone whose thinking is shorter term than Mr Buffett’s – and this includes nearly everyone – the ride may be dull and uncomfortably bumpy.As an industry with high fixed costs, volumes matter immensely and these are now recovering from an epic decline that sapped a quarter or more of traffic by early 2009. Recent earnings reports by Union Pacific and CSX Corp show that the worst has passed. Some categories like automobiles, which saw traffic rise 50 per cent recently versus a year ago on restocking, are skewing the sense of recovery though. Other categories like coal, the bread-and-butter of most railroads, will remain depressed for some time.Even once the industry gets back to pre-recessionary volumes, railroads will be a proxy for growth rather than the one-way investment bet they were for most of the past decade. Railroads were an industry in crisis in the 1970s and 1980s, but deregulation paved the way for painful consolidation and major efficiency gains. During the past two decades, the ton-miles of freight hauled by America’s large, interstate railroads doubled. Booming trade and high oil prices drove more traffic to energy-efficient railroads, helping turn these once chronic destroyers of capital into a hot sector. In the decade ending in July 2008 the four large US freight railroads had total shareholder returns of between 200 and 350 per cent, handily outpacing equities overall.The easy money has been made though. No longer priced for perfection as they were two years ago, railroads are fairly priced only for those investors prepared for a long, slow haul.
108;CSX;CSX Corp;2010-01-20T22:18:54Z;CSX boss warns on US rail legislation;;Investment in US freight railways will fall if proposed federal rail legislation is passed in its present form, the chief executive of the sector’s third-largest company has warned after announcing improved fourth-quarter net earnings.Michael Ward was speaking on Wednesday after CSX, the larger of two big railways in the eastern US, became the first major US-based rail company to announce 2009 results.CSX reported net earnings for the three months to December 25 up 23 per cent over the same quarter of 2008 to $305m on revenue down 13 per cent to $2.32bn. Full-year net earnings fell 16 per cent to $1.15bn on revenue down 20 per cent to $9.04bn.CSX had demonstrated its operating capability by withstanding the worst economic recession of recent times and emerging stronger, Mr Ward said. However, he expressed concern about the potential effects of legislation being debated to strengthen the powers of the Surface Transportation Board, the industry’s regulator.The main railways have long been concerned that tightening regulation could reduce the incentives for large investments in improved infrastructure and rolling stock. Some railway customers – particularly those that have no choice of operator – have complained about steep price rises.CSX is due to make $1.7bn capital investment this year.“We are concerned about threatened federal regulations that will without doubt cut investment in freight rail systems,” Mr Ward said.The company would comply with new federal regulations on rail signalling – expected to cost CSX $750m by 2015.But Mr Ward went on: “At the same time, we see other substantial federal demands on the horizon which could negatively impact the financial health of the industry. The current Senate version of the STB re-authorisation bill is not balanced.”Fuel – one of CSX’s largest outgoings – cost $250m in 2009, down 24 per cent on the year before. However, revenue from fuel surcharges also fell. Revenues and profitability were also hit by a 24 per cent fall in revenues from coal, the single biggest commodity for most freight railways and one of the most profitable cargoes.
109;CSX;CSX Corp;2009-11-03T20:42:04Z;Buffett sends important signal in rail move;;When Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s chief aide, addressed the 2007 shareholder meeting of one of the companies in the Berkshire Hathaway group, he was frank about railroad investing. The pair who run Berkshire had been too late to spot a change in the nature of a business they had hated, he admitted.In light of that admission, Berkshire Hathaway’s $26bn bid for Burlington Northern Santa Fe – which values the company at $44bn, including $10bn of debt and the value of the stake Berkshire had accumulated since 2007 – looks like a bold effort to make up for lost time.“We threw out our paradigms, but did it too late,” Mr Munger said in 2007.The question now is what light Berkshire Hathaway’s offer for the railroad company sheds on the wider prospects of a business Mr Munger says he and Mr Buffett had regarded as “terrible” and “lousy for investors”.Henry Posner, who invests in railways worldwide through his Pittsburgh-based Railroad Development Corporation, welcomes the signal the proposed takeover will give to would-be rail investors.“This is the highest vote of confidence any company can have,” Mr Posner says.The BNSF takeover conforms to many of Mr Buffett’s famous rules of investment. The company has some of the most highly regarded managers in the US railroad sector, led by Matthew Rose, chief executive. BNSF management invested heavily in improving capacity earlier this decade, at a point when most investment analysts doubted it was worthwhile.The result was that, when Union Pacific, the other main railroad in the western US, suffered severe congestion during a surge in container traffic in 2004, BNSF handled the traffic far more easily.“They are extremely well run,” says Anthony Hatch, an independent railroad analyst.BNSF also faces far fewer competition problems than many railroads have faced in recent years. Railroads compete strongly against trucking companies, which labour with higher fuel and labour costs. A wave of consolidation in the sector – Burlington Northern merged with the Santa Fe railroad in 1995 – has left two major operators.Mr Buffett’s move also comes amid an economic downturn that has shown the profitability of the bigger rail companies to be resilient. While the profitability of many transport operators has slumped, BNSF’s third-quarter figures, announced on October 22, showed operating income down only 25.3 per cent on the same quarter in 2008, to $901m. This was in spite of a 27 per cent fall in the third-quarter freight revenue to $3.49bn.“There are still people out there who believe the rail industry is obsolete and slowly dying,” Mr Hatch says, but adds: “That’s not been true for 15 years.”The deal is unlikely to run into the regulatory problems that have held up other railroad mergers. Thomas Hund, BNSF’s finance director, told investors yesterday that, because Berkshire Hathaway controlled no other railroads, the Surface Transportation Board, the regulator, should not need to get involved.According to Mr Hatch, the deal also suggests Mr Buffett is unconcerned at the prospect of more rigorous railroad regulation under Barack Obama’s presidency. Concerns over such prospects have increased since February, when BNSF was ordered to pay $100m reparations to Western Fuels, a coal customer, and cap its rates to the customer for 16 years.Instead, Henry Posner argues, the transaction could encourage BNSF to take a longer-term view of investment in capacity – potentially improving its service to its customers.The wider impact of Mr Buffett’s move remains unclear, however. Other companies among the big four US railroads saw share price rises on yesterday’s news. Main rival Union Pacific rose 6.8 per cent, while Norfolk Southern rose 2.4 per cent and CSX 6 per cent. Investor interest is frequently boosted when Mr Buffett makes a major move in a sector, Mr Hatch says.But few investors now are likely to find the resources for as ambitious a bid.His conversion to believing in the merits of railroad investing is unlikely to remain unique, but his ability to swallow large operators might be, according to Mr Hatch. “I don’t think there are a lot of other private investors who can afford this kind of price, particularly in the current environment.”
110;CSX;CSX Corp;2009-11-03T19:14:02Z;Buffett rail deal offsets banking concerns;;"Wall Street clawed back early losses in volatile trading on Tuesday after news of Warren Buffett's biggest takeover deal offset lingering concerns over the banking sector.Financial stocks had led the market lower after UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, reported a larger loss than expected for the fourth quarter.Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, the UK's two partnationalised banks, also announced that they were raising £54bn in an effort to appease European Union concerns about state aid.Technology stocks also suffered after Morgan Stanley lowered its rating on the semiconductor industry from ""attractive"" to ""cautious"" and downgraded Intel, causing its shares to lose 2.7 per cent to $18.50.""EPS, gross margins utilisation and growth metrics tell us that we are in the final innings of the semi cycle,"" Mark Lipacis, Morgan Stanley's chip analyst, wrote in the research note.Inventory concerns also led the brokerage to cut its ratings on several of Intel's smaller rivals.The market had been set for steep declines as a result but deal activity helped Wall Street to regain ground. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it would acquire Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the second-biggest US railroad by revenue, for $26bn in cash and stock.The deal valued Burlington Northern at $44bn, pushing its shares up 27.5 per cent to $97. Berkshire gained 1.7 per cent to $100,450. The takeover, which is the biggest acquisition made by Berkshire, prompted a rally in other US rail companies, pushing Union Pacific up 7.9 per cent to $59.41 and CSX up 7.3 per cent to $45.97.Stanley Works was up 10.1 per cent at $49.69 after the tool supplier announced after the closing bell on Monday that it would buy Black & Decker for $3.46bn in stock.Encouraging data on September factory orders also helped push stocks higher, lifting the market into positive territory and prompting a late recovery in financial stocks. After early losses, Bank of America closed 1.2 per cent higher at $14.80 while Citigroup gained 1.3 per cent to $4.04.However, investors re-mained cautious before today's closing comments from the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting.The S&P 500 finally closed 0.2 per cent higher at 1,045.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 9,771.91 and the Nasdaq gained 0.4 per cent to 2,057.32.""The downgrade on Intel is weighing on the market somewhat but the big story is Berkshire buying Burlington Northern,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon. ""The M&A [activity] fortifies the notion that corporate America is feeling good about the prospects of economic growth next year and the factory orders were also another plus point for the economy.""Cognizant Technology Solutions also helped to mitigate losses in the technology sector after reporting better results than expected from the third quarter and raising its full-year profit forecast. Its shares were up 8.2 per cent to $41.97.Synchronoss Technologies, the communications software maker, gained 12.2 per cent to $13.02 after posting a 34 per cent rise in quarterly earnings owing to strong demand from wireless carriers.Viacom, which owns the MTV Networks and Paramount film studios, posted profits above expectations after video-game sales and box office hits including Transformers helped the company overcome a slump in advertising revenues. The shares gained 1.3 per cent to $30.17. A late recovery in oil prices also helped lift energy stocks into positive territory before the closing bell.However, Johnson & Johnson weighed on the market after it announced a significant restructuring plan. The healthcare company said it would cut up to 7 per cent of its global workforce, or 8,000 positions, generating savings of between $1.4bn to $1.7bn in 2011. Its shares dropped 0.9 per cent to $58.93.Ferro, which produces materials such as enamel and plastic compounds, fell 6 per cent to $5.60 after announcing the pricing of a common stock offering."
111;CSX;CSX Corp;2009-10-19T18:06:10Z;Diesel stockpiles could derail crude’s rally;;For many months, crude has fluctuated between $65 and $75 a barrel even as other risky assets, from stocks to gold, have taken off.But last week oil broke free, passing $75 for the first time in a year.The rally continued on Monday, with the US crude contract for delivery in December, the most active, flirting with the $80 a barrel level after eight consecutive days of gains.Analysts have taken note.Barclays Capital, an oil bull, bid a “final farewell” to the “long, comfortable $65-$75 band and …hello to the $70-$80 band”.Hopes that the worst of the economic crisis is over after better-than-expected third-quarter corporate profits in the US, the arrival of winter in the northern hemisphere when demand picks up, and a weaker US dollar have contributed to the surge.Oil’s nascent rally could, nonetheless, be washed out by rivers of diesel.Demand for diesel, burned in trucks, locomotives and construction equipment, is an important reflection of economic activity. Yet while consumption should pick up as the economy recovers, big stockpiles of the fuel and others like it could keep the price of crude in check.JPMorgan cautioned that “while we can justify the rally, we do not trust it”.In the US, stockpiles of middle distillates (which, alongside diesel, includes heating oil) are at their highest in decades. Europe faces a surplus of distillates so great that traders are booking tankers to store it offshore after running out of inland deposits.The International Energy Agency, the industrialised countries’ oil watchdog, says the volume of refined oil products in floating storage offshore Europe rose 25 per cent in September. In Asia, diesel stocks are rising fast, with inventories in the Singapore hub trebling since August to a record.“The world has yet to come to terms with the massive middle distillate stock surplus,” JBC Energy, the Vienna-based oil consultancy, says.A quarterly statement from CSX, the US railway operator seen as a bellwether of the country’s industrial and trade activity, points to weak distillates demand.CSX locomotives used 18 per cent less fuel in the most recent quarter than in the same period a year ago.Lower distillate consumption means less need for the crude from which it is derived and could translate into lower prices.Chris Thorpe of Hudson Capital Energy, a New York options dealer that works with oil refiners, resellers and large manufacturers, says he has yet to hear of “any physical players seeing significant demand improvement”.Most analysts say oil demand will pick up in 2010 after two years of decline. US drivers are pumping 5 per cent more petrol – the other big oil product alongside distillate – than last year, according to official data.But the diesel glut has forced refineries to shut down or scale back.In the US, they were running at about 80 per cent of capacity, a rate that could fall to the 70 per cent range, Valero Energy, the largest independent US refiner, said last month.The cutbacks will restrain the world’s thirst for crude and cap surging prices.“If you look at the fundamentals, we still have very high inventories. Refining margins are dire,” says Sean Corrigan, chief investment strategist at Diapason Commodities Management, a $6bn asset manager in Lausanne, Switzerland.“Demand seems to have stabilised. That’s the best we can say,” he adds.Some analysts are confident oil prices are headed higher. A day before oil pierced $75 last week, Goldman Sachs said the market was “poised for a break-out”, identifying goods shipped for Christmas from Asia to the west as the wild card that could rescue diesel demand and push oil prices higher.“All indicators still point to a normal seasonal pick-up in shipping to retailers this year,” the bank said.Given Goldman’s reputation as Wall Street’s largest oil trader, some observers said the call was a self-fulfilling prophecy. The bank predicts $85-a-barrel crude by early next year and $95 by December 2010.Deutsche Bank, which forecasts $75 crude for early 2010, says a steadily weakening dollar points to higher prices. Since oil is priced in dollars, a weaker US currency suggests a higher nominal price.“It now looks like the dollar is driving oil prices once again,” the bank said in a note. “The prospect of fresh lows in the US dollar will exacerbate this trend.”But even the most bullish analysts are not predicting a near-term price spike comparable to last year’s run to almost $150 a barrel.Opec’s spare capacity is now more than 5m barrels a day, three times the amount estimated as crude spiked last year.“As long as there’s that much slack, there’s no immediate need for oil prices to skyrocket in the spot market,” says John Brynjolfsson, chief investment officer at Armored Wolf, a California-based global macro hedge fund.The cartel has indicated it is satisfied with prices at around $80. Higher prices could encourage some members to flout official levels or even convince Saudi Arabia to push for a formal production increase at Opec’s meeting in December.Either of these moves would damp crude prices and derail the rally above $75 a barrel.
112;CSX;CSX Corp;2009-10-13T21:11:20Z;Wall St mixed after Goldman downgrade;;US equities were mixed on Tuesday, amid weakness in financials and healthcare, although technology offered some respite, and after the closing bell results from Intel exceeded forecasts.Earnings from Johnson & Johnson and an equity analyst downgrade for Goldman Sachs weighed on sentiment for much of the day and outweighed further weakness in the dollar.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,073.19 points and the benchmark broke a six-day winning streak that pushed it to a 12-month closing high on Monday.Half of the S&P’s 10 main industry sectors were lower, led by financials as sentiment for banks came under pressure in the wake of Goldman being downgraded by Meredith Whitney Advisors to a “neutral” rating from a “buy”.Ahead of its third-quarter earnings being released on Thursday, shares in Goldman fell 1.5 per cent to $187.23. The stock closed at a high of $190.48 this month, up more than 200 per cent from a closing low of $59.20 in January.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ceded ground and closed 0.2 per cent lower at 9,987.06 points.The third-quarter earnings season moved into gear on Tuesday, with the release of results from Johnson & Johnson. The pharmaceutical giant recorded a 1 per cent rise in third-quarter profit, which exceeded expectations. The company missed its revenue forecast as sales slipped 2.7 per cent. The shares fell 2.4 per cent to $61.01.On the plus side, the company raised its fiscal 2009 earnings forecast to a range of $4.54 to $4.59 per share, up from a prior estimate of $4.45 to $4.55 per share.Also weighing on the Dow was JPMorgan, down 0.9 per cent at $45.66 and due with earnings on Wednesday, and Bank of America, lower by 1.2 per cent at $17.81 ahead of quarterly results on Friday.The Nasdaq Composite closed a fraction higher at 2,139.89, making it the most resilient benchmark during the session.In deal news, Cisco Systems announced that it had agreed to buy Starent Networks for $2.9bn. Shares in Cisco were 0.5 per cent higher at $23.89, while Starent, which produces equipment for wireless carriers’ support of smart phones, jumped 16.8 per cent to $33.91. Cisco plans to pay $35 per share in cash and the deal should close early next year.“We believe the pending acquisition would significantly strengthen Cisco’s mobility standing, via Starent’s leading market presence with tier 1 US wireless providers,” said Ari Bensinger, telecom analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.After the closing bell, Intel reported earnings of 33 cents per share versus a forecast 28 cents, and also posted better-than-expected revenues. In regular trade shares in Intel rose 0.4 per cent to $20.49 ahead of its earnings report.Also after the market closed, CSX, the rail transporter, beat earnings expectations. Ahead of the numbers, its shares dropped 1.4 per cent to $44.28 in regular trade.Elsewhere, Vascular Solutions, rose 3.1 per cent to $8.61, after the medical device maker received US regulatory approval for a blood clotting valve.Vanda Pharmaceuticals fell 3.6 per cent to $11.04 and shed early gains after it announced a $200m deal with Novartis over rights to sell a schizophrenia drug.Shares in CIT Group dropped 11.5 per cent to $0.92 after the troubled lender said its chairman and chief executive officer planned to resign at the end of the year.Sentiment for equities of late has been boosted by higher commodity prices and the weak dollar, with nearly half of sales by S&P 500 companies generated abroad, according to Standard & Poor’s.“The dollar’s weakness is attracting increased investment flow from foreign investors who on a dollar-adjusted basis are finding US stocks cheap [compared] with their foreign peers on a relative valuation basis,” said John Stoltzfus, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities.“We believe that as long as the dollar remains weak and does not plummet from current levels this trend is likely to continue to add support to US stocks, particularly US multinationals that have large exposure to foreign sales.”
113;CSX;CSX Corp;2009-09-20T16:07:43Z;CSX prepares for a railroad rebound;;The US railway that spent 18 months fighting a hedge fund demanding it cut investment is spending $1.6bn this year to prepare for a post-recession rebound, said its chief executive.The comments by Michael Ward, of CSX Corporation, are the latest bullish sign from the US railroad sector, where improved returns and profitability of recent years have held up surprisingly well in the recession’s slump in traffic.It is a sign of renewed confidence from CSX, which was one of the worst-performing large US railroads for many years. This followed its botched integration in 1999 of parts of Conrail.Between October 2007 and April this year, The Children’s Investment Fund, a London-based hedge fund, tried to push CSX to raise borrowing, hand cash back to investors and reduce capital spending. TCI, which with 3G, another hedge fund, had appointed several directors to CSX’s board, sold its stake suddenly in April.CSX is now “on a par with or better than” other large US railroads, Mr Ward says. In this year’s second quarter, CSX had an operating ratio – the proportion of revenue taken up by operating costs – of 73 per cent. This is better for example than the 74.8 per cent of the Norfolk Southern railroad or the 75.2 per cent of the Burlington, Northern and Santa Fe railroad – both had been better performers in recent years.“One of the big questions everybody has had is, ‘How do [railroads] fare during a recession?’” said Mr Ward. “We’re doing quite well, all things considered. The market is starting to say, ‘Gee, this railroad industry can withstand a recession’.”The company was investing in track upgrades and terminals to receive and distribute goods to be ready for the recovery, Mr Ward added. “We’re still finding $1.6bn this year for further investments.”Traffic fell less sharply in the second quarter of the year than in the first, Mr Ward said. Unusually, the third quarter was so far producing higher traffic levels than the second. But some forms of traffic, including automotive parts and intermodal traffic – goods moved in shipping containers – were down sharply from their peak.CSX has responded by parking 600 of its 3,600 engines and 30,000 of its 93,000 coaches, while putting 2,400 employees on extended leave. “What we’ve been able to do is resize the network,” Mr Ward said. “We said, ‘We have much lower volumes here. How do we still serve the customers well and do it with a lot fewer trains and a lot fewer people?’”But long-term factors that fuelled recent years’ rail traffic growth were still at work, he insists. They included a growing tendency for trucking companies to use trains for long-haul moves of containers, to save on expensive fuel and labour, though rate cuts from desperate small trucking lines masked the trend.“We think long term, so we don’t overreact to some of these short-term aberrations,” Mr Ward said.Factors favouring rail would re-emerge particularly strongly when consumer spending rebounded, Mr Ward said.He expected that to happen in spite of recent increases in saving by US consumers.“We think the highways in the US are going to get more and more congested.“There’s going to be a real position for us and we’re investing accordingly.”
114;CSX;CSX Corp;2009-07-14T20:48:45Z;Wall Street rises in choppy trade;;US stocks managed to rise during a choppy session on Tuesday as a stabilisation in the price of oil encouraged investors to buy shares in energy companies.The sector was one of the strongest during the day as oil slowed its recent slide. Schlumberger gained 1.7 per cent to $51.83 and Chevron picked up 0.9 per cent to $63.It was supported by firmer consumer stocks, which rose after advance figures showed retail sales higher in June than May.Home Depot climbed 2.5 per cent to $23.68 while rival Lowe’s advanced 1.6 per cent to $19.57.But the effect of the data was tempered by the fact that much of the rise had come from increased spending on petrol.“People have got the money in their pocket, but they are still not spending it, which is not a surprise given how much the oil price rise in June will have affected petrol prices,” said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.5 per cent higher at 905.84, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 8,359.49 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.4 per cent to 1,799.73.Financial shares were mixed, even after Goldman Sachs reported much higher profits than expected.The bank had led a broad market rally on Monday after analyst Meredith Whitney, who turned bearish on financial stocks last year before many of her peers, recommended buying the shares.Ms Whitney said that Goldman’s profits would come in at $4.65 per share, much higher than the consensus view of $3.48, boosted by strong revenues from underwriting new issuance of stock and debt.Even her prediction proved overly-pessimistic though, as earnings were $4.93, excluding the amount Goldman had to pay back to get out of the government’s bail-out programme.The company managed to hold on to Monday’s gains, although did not build on them significantly, gaining 0.2 per cent to $149.66.“Most firms cannot play in Goldman’s league, so investors will focus more on earnings from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo to give them a sign on how financials are doing,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at thinkorswim.Other banks were mixed. Citigroup rose 5.1 per cent to $2.92 but Bank of America dropped 0.6 per cent to $12.91 and Wells Fargo gave up 1.6 per cent to $24.40.Elsewhere in the sector, shares in commercial lender CIT Group spiked following two sessions of heavy falls after the ailing company said that it was in “active” discussions with regulators about a possible government rescue before it has to pay back $1bn of debt next month.The renewed hope that the company may avoid bankruptcy sent the shares up 19.3 per cent to $1.61.Johnson & Johnson was the second large corporate group to report its second-quarter earnings and the world’s largest healthcare company managed to beat both revenue and profits forecasts.Its shares picked up 0.9 per cent to $58.23.CSX, the railway operator, also announced its profits on the busiest day yet for announcements this earnings season.The company’s shares jumped 7 per cent to $34.80 after it revealed better profits than Wall Street had expected. The performance came largely from cost-cutting, with revenues coming in roughly as analysts had predicted.Dell weighed on the technology sector after the company warned that its second-quarter profit margins would be weaker as customers bought cheap notebook computers rather than more expensive items on which Dell makes more of a profit. The shares lost 8.1 per cent to $11.97 and the news put some pressure on its rivals.IBM fell 0.4 per cent to $103.25 while Hewlett-Packard gave up 0.4 per cent to $37.14.Sun Microsystems added to the pessimism in the sector after it forecast a steeper quarterly loss than expected on weak revenues as the company lost business to its competitors.The shares managed to rise 0.1 per cent to $9.17, but those in Oracle, which is in the process of buying the company for $5.6bn, lost 0.4 per cent to $20.63.
115;CSX;CSX Corp;2009-06-02T02:19:37Z;Car industry could learn from Penn Central;;Passengers arriving at the station in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania’s state capital, are greeted by the sight of a magnificent, ageing 1930s electric locomotive with the word “Pennsylvania” down the side.The locomotive – known as a GG1 – is one of the most visible reminders of the links between this crucial part of the US rail network and a bankruptcy filing that, in its time, was just as shocking as General Motors’ filing is now: that of the Penn Central railroad in June 1970.Harrisburg’s continuing role as a key hub in the current flourishing, healthy US rail sector offers some hints, meanwhile, about how the US motor industry could recover from its problems via government ownership to be a healthy part of the US economy again.Harrisburg station’s GG1 in 1938 pulled the first electric train into Harrisburg at a time when the Pennsylvania Railroad, which operated the route, called itself “the standard railroad of the world”.Its markets, providing express passenger services and moving heavy freight, looked as secure as GM’s prospects did in the 1950s and 1960s. However, by the 1960s the company was facing competitive pressures from the interstate highway system and increasing air travel. It tried to solve the problems through a merger with the New York Central, which came into effect after long negotiations in February 1968.As in GM’s case, the unions played a big role – they won an agreement that every dismissed worker after the merger would receive a year’s pay for every five years of service, making it prohibitively expensive for the two railroads to cut jobs. The Interstate Commerce Commission, the then-regulator, also forced railroads to keep operating lossmaking services. The ICC forced the merged company to take on the lossmaking New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1969. Much of Penn Central’s accounting was questionable and the merger poorly organised, with service standards collapsing in the aftermath.When the merged railroad sought bankruptcy protection in June 1970, it had $7bn in assets, 94,000 employees, was the sixth-largest company in the US by market capitalisation and was by far the largest US corporate bankruptcy.Henry Posner, chairman of Railroad Development Corporation, a Pittsburgh-based railway investment company, says Penn Central’s involvement in infrastructure and its strict regulation make its case different from GM. But Penn Central’s collapse, he points out, helped to lead to the abolition of the rules that brought about its collapse.“Railroads were thought of as businesses that required external funding from the public sector,” Mr Posner says. “The ultimate lesson was that that was not necessary. It was deregulation as opposed to public funding that turned the tide.”Penn Central’s passenger services were hived off to government-funded Amtrak. Penn Central’s freight operations were taken into government ownership and merged with other bankrupt north-eastern railroads in government-owned Conrail in 1976. The sector was then comprehensively deregulated under the Staggers Act in 1980 that allowed railroads to cut unprofitable services and charge market rates for their services.The railroad sector that has emerged had until recently been one of the US industries most resistant to the economic downturn.Motor industry executives can only hope that their industry can be returned to sound health more quickly.
116;CSX;CSX Corp;2009-05-06T19:13:20Z;Executive pay;One legacy of the recession will be more meddling;"One legacy of the recession will be more meddling. Not just by a vastly expanded government and regulators embarrassed into furious activity, but from investors burning with desire to clamp down on rewards for failure. High protest votes against remuneration at Xstrata and BP in the UK have given others, including Shell, a taste of what to expect at their forthcoming annual meetings. Demand for greater boardroom accountability is increasing also in the US. Research from Risk Metrics, a consultancy, shows that pay is the hot topic this year, accounting for 22 per cent of proposals so far in 2009. Of these, advisory votes on executive compensation – so called “say on pay” – is the most popular issue mooted for a vote. Investors have in the past not been keen to take a view on pay when given the chance. But pay for performance votes have been creeping up the agenda and last year attracted average support of 36 per cent of votes cast, up from 25 per cent in 2006.Measures to open up boards to the influence of shareholders attract an even greater level of endorsement. Votes to force the annual election of directors, or to end supermajority voting requirements, for example, typically attract two-thirds support. The trend is clearly towards more involvement: a change to the law in Delaware, where most S&P 500 companies are incorporated, means that from August it will become easier for shareholders to nominate and elect directors. But the same problems of dispersed ownership remain. The high cost of activism leaves it a minority pursuit, with the Children’s Investment Fund decision to sell its stake in CSX just the latest high profile retreat. And the overall number of shareholder proposals has actually fallen this year, as investors look to cut expenses. Having the ability to act is one thing. Choosing to do so before disaster strikes is another.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

117;CSX;CSX Corp;2009-04-27T21:33:29Z;TCI quits fight for CSX with share sale;;The Children’s Investment Fund, the controversial activist investor, has pulled out of the last of the companies where it has fought high-profile battles for control, selling most of its shares in CSX, the US railway.The sale brings to an end a struggle for control of CSX, the US’s third-largest rail operator, that had become a highly personal struggle between Michael Ward, CSX’s chief executive, and Chris Hohn, TCI’s founder and chief executive.TCI, one of the most successful investors of the past decade’s boom years, has sold stakes in Deutsche Börse, of Germany, and in J-Power, of Japan, a power utility.The fund also headed the campaign that eventually led to ABN Amro selling itself to the Royal Bank of Scotland, in the UK.Senior executives have quit TCI, leaving Mr Hohn alone among the founding senior executives still at the fund. Mr Hohn has given no public explanation of the series of stake sales.The battle over CSX had been master-minded by Snehal Amin, a US analyst who left the fund last month shortly after James Wilk, operations manager. Mr Wilk had been in the post for just 10 months.Filings by TCI with the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed the company sold all but a handful of its 4.5 per cent stake in CSX for $515m.TCI, which worked with 3G, another activist investor, argued that CSX had long under-performed other US railway companies and initially demanded it slash capital investment, nearly double the prices it charged customers and increase its debt to raise pay-outs to shareholders.The battle ended in court in the US when CSX sought to exclude the two activist investors from voting at its annual meeting.TCI and 3G were criticised by the judge over their conduct in the battle, particularly their use of indirect shareholding instruments to increase their stake without declaring it to the company.CSX’s case was ultimately unsuccessful.After winning backing from several large investment advisory firms in the US, the two activist investors succeeded last July in having four of their five candidates elected to CSX’s 12-member board.TCI declined to comment on why it had sold the shares.
118;CSX;CSX Corp;2009-04-15T20:52:46Z;US stocks rise in choppy trade;;"US stocks rose on Wednesday as a dividend increase by Procter&Gamble and rising confidence in the homebuilding sector outweighed fears about demand in the technology sector.Procter & Gamble gave consumer companies a much needed boost amid falling retail sales numbers after the company raised its dividend for the 52nd straight year. It lifted its quarterly shareholder payout 10 per cent to 44 cents, and its shares gained 3.2 per cent to $48.75.Homebuilders also outperformed after data showed confidence among professionals in the sector in April rose to its highest since October, although remaining negative. Lennar gained 11.7 per cent to $8.69, while KB Home picked up 10.5 per cent to $15.75 and DR Horton rose 8.2 per cent to $11.16.The hope for the housing sector also boosted financial stocks, which were given further impetus when American Express said the growth in the number of customers defaulting on payments slowed during March. AmEx gained 11.9 per cent to $20.62. This helped offset earlier negativity on bad debts from Capital One, its rival credit card company.But Intelfuelled concerns about consumer demand in the technology sector after it refused to give formal guidance for its second-quarter earnings despite reporting better results than expected. The shares lost 2.4 per cent to $15.62 on the uncertainty.Rival chipmaker National Semiconductor also fell, dropping 2 per cent to $12.01, while Microsoft gave up 2.7 per cent to $18.83.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned the market could have priced in better earnings than analysts had predicted, which could mean equity falls even after strong results.“Intel provided good results compared to printed expectations, but the market reacted poorly to margin guidance. The after-market selling may hint that the trade is too long into earnings,” he wrote.Concern over future revenues for technology companies limited gains on the Nasdaq, which lifted 0.1 per cent to 1,626.80 points. The S&P rose 1.3 per cent meanwhile to 852.06 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4 per cent to 8,029.62 points.The Dow was helped by industrial stocks, which joined consumer staples in positive territory. They were led higher by railway operator CSX, which reported
better-than-expected earnings. Its shares closed 7.8 per cent higher at $30.59, helped also by figures showing manufacturing in New York contracted much less severely than expected.CPI numbers indicated inflation was lower than expected, and the Federal Reserve said five of its 12 districts saw contraction slow during March, both of which helped support stocks.As earnings season began to hit full speed, there was mixed news from companies reporting quarterly results.Peabody Energy disappointed investors in spite of reporting increased sales and revenue by less earnings than expected. The company also deferred providing full-year targets, with future demand unclear. Its shares fell 11.5 per cent to $25.96.Abbott Laboratories also fell, despite reporting increased profits. Wth global sales declining, including those of its top-selling drug Humira, shares in the group lost 4.6 per cent to $42.66.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, jumped 25 per cent in 20 minutes after it reported narrower losses than expected. Its shares closed 18.7 per cent up at $5.01.“Confidence has started to return,” said Vaughn Affonso, a dealer at of CMC Markets. “But we need to see what earnings, and more importantly, forecasts will be like over the next few weeks before the recent rally becomes longer lasting.”Allegheny Energy rose after Barclays raised the utility company to “overweight” from “equal weight”, saying it may benefit from an auction for Pennsylvania power prices.

119;CSX;CSX Corp;2009-04-15T18:48:45Z;TCI rocked by resignation of Asia director;;The Children’s Investment Fund, the activist hedge fund, has suffered another setback with the resignation of John Ho, director in AsiaChris Hohn, TCI founding partner, told investors in a letter this week, that Mr Ho, 32, would leave the fund for personal reasons.Mr Ho’s departure comes at a difficult time for TCI, which suffered a decline of more than 40 per cent in the value of its global investments in 2008 and has lost three senior members already this year.In the past four months, James Wilk, the fund’s operations manager, has resigned, as have co-founders Snehal Amin, head of US investing, and Patrick Degorce, who was in charge of investments in Europe and the financial sector but fell ill.The departures highlight the turbulence that has hit the hedge fund industry, with many funds battered by poor returns and a wave of redemptions.There has long been speculation in Japan that Mr Ho and Mr Hohn disagreed over investment strategy following the fund’s controversial attempt to raise its stake in J-Power, the Japanese electricity wholesaler.One fund manager who knows both men and who has seen TCI’s letters to investors, said: “John probably didn’t want to go through with the [fight over] J-Power …and I assume the results in Asia have been driving [Chris] ape-shit,”.TCI became a household name in Japan after the fund acquired 9.9 per cent in J-Power and attempted to double its stake against the clear opposition and discomfort of the Japanese government.Mr Ho became the face of TCI in high-profile battles with regulators in Japan over J-Power and he also led a widely followed campaign to force through changes aimed at increasing J-Power’s corporate value.The bid was blocked by the government on national security grounds, raising concerns about protectionism, while TCI’s attempts in a proxy battle last year to force J-Power’s management to improve shareholder returns were defeated.J-Power eventually bought back TCI’s stake at a 30 per cent premium to the current share price, which cost it more than it would have had to spend to increase its dividend as demanded by the hedge fund.TCI, which has $9.5bn under management, first made its name as an activist fund when it successfully thwarted Deutsche Börse’s £1.4bn bid for the London Stock Exchange in 2005.Its activism also put Dutch bank, ABN Amro, in play, leading to its ill-fated purchase by Royal Bank of Scotland.But the activist fund, after a long run of double-digit gains, has had a difficult time amid the financial crisis, suffering a decline of more than 40 per cent last year.It had problems in all three regions, as it bowed out of J-Power, had shares in CSX, a US railroad with which it fought a painful battle, halve from their peak and, earlier this month, finally bowed out of its five-year-long holding in the Börse.Mr Hohn was not available to comment and Mr Ho declined to comment.
120;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;US rail companies steam through the downturn in profit;;North America’s principal rail companies underlined their growing resilience and pricing power by reporting improved operating profits for the quarter when the economic downturn started in earnest.Over the past three weeks, the four biggest US-based operators – Union Pacific, BNSF, CSX and Norfolk Southern – all reported improved operating profits for the quarter compared with 2007, in spite of sharp volume falls in some commodities.Anthony Hatch, an independent railroad analyst, said the last quarter’s figures showed the companies had continued to enjoy the power to maintain prices they developed in the years of strong growth between 2003 and 2007.In the past, railroads were often forced to slash their rates during a recession to win traffic from trucking companies and keep the cash flow necessary to service their debts.“In the fourth quarter, we went from a slowdown to a complete collapse in demand,” Mr Hatch said. “Railroads responded with a good quarter. It’s further evidence that the rail renaissance, as I call it, is actually happening.”Railroads’ finances have improved as growing traffic levels have filled up the available capacity of their networks. For many, that has raised the returns on investments in new capacity above the cost of the capital required for the first time in more than 60 years.Even in areas where demand fell in the fourth quarter, revenue generally fell less than traffic. BNSF, which with Union Pacific dominates rail traffic in the western two-thirds of the US, saw volumes of automotive traffic – mainly new cars – fall 28.6 per cent between the last quarters of 2007 and 2008. But revenue per unit moved rose 20 per cent. Similarly, international inter-modal traffic – shipping containers moving between ports and end-customers – fell 11 per cent but revenue per unit moved rose 5.9 per cent.The companies’ pricing power was still more evident in the areas where demand remained strong. Norfolk Southern, which depends on coal mined in West Virginia and Pennsylvania for about a quarter of its revenues, benefited both from steady domestic demand for power station coal and continuing export demand. Coal volumes in the fourth quarter were up 5 per cent on the previous year, while revenues rose 33 per cent to $798m.However, according to Mr Hatch, demand for railroads to move containers within North America could be a still more positive long-term sign. Many observers had believed growth in recent years in the segment was dependent on high fuel prices, which made it cheaper for trucking lines to send goods by train for most of their trips.The only slight falls in volumes in the fourth quarter, when fuel prices fell substantially, suggest that instead a long-term shift of such traffic from road to rail is under way.
121;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-12-07T20:38:46Z;From value strippers to value protectors;;“Activist” shareholders have gained notoriety over the past few years, and are an easy target in the current climate when people look for someone to blame for the financial crisis.Many believe activists are relentlessly short-term in focus and strip value from companies. The investment in Mitchells & Butlers, the UK pub group, by Robert Tchenguiz, the British property entrepreneur, is often cited as an example of a deal that led to the company acting against its long-term interests by moving its property assets into a Reit (real estate investment trust).Similarly, an investment consultant in the US suggests moves by the Children’s Investment Trust and 3G Capital Partners to make CSX, the largest freight carrier in the south-eastern US, reduce capital expenditure and distribute the cash to shareholders were short-sighted. “If you look at this from a traditional point of view, you would take the money and go home,” the consultant says. “But railroads are by definition capital intensive businesses and if you look at it from the viewpoint of how this affects your other investments – GM, Toyota or any one of 45 S&P companies – voting for this measure is the last thing you should do.”There have always been two types of shareholder activists, says Penny Shepherd, chief executive of the UK Social Investment Forum, the responsible finance association – those encouraging short-term financial engineering to “unlock value” and those seeking to improve companies in the interest of their long-term owners.Research suggests activism can be beneficial for shareholders. A paper* by a group of US academics acknowledges that “hedge funds increasingly engage in a new form of shareholder activism and monitoring that differs fundamentally from previous activist efforts by other institutional investors”. However, it says hedge fund managers suffer fewer conflicts of interest and are not beholden to managers and that as a result, “hedge funds are better positioned to act as informed monitors than other institutional investors”.There is a clear distinction between activist investors who are heavily geared and those who are not, according to one leading and high profile activist investor. “There is no doubt that a lot of businesses that engaged in activism did so on the basis of leverage. They have had to deleverage, which has hit returns and ability to continue in business,” he says.Some hedge funds agitate to bring about corporate change “in an aggressive and selfish manner,” says Adrian Clark, head of corporate law at Ashurst. However, the credit crisis has effectively eliminated this type of activity. For investors with a more thoughtful, longer-term approach opportunities remain, however.Lars Förberg, managing partner at Cevian Capital, says being leveraged means having to focus on the price of the asset you buy into. By contrast, activists such as Cevian, whose investments include Munich Re, Volvo Trucks and Telia Sonera, take positions for a number of years, often taking board positions. “You cannot be leveraged if you’re on the board because it makes you too short-sighted.”Many institutional shareholders see themselves as limited in the action they can take because they are invested across the index and do not have the resources to invest in understanding the companies they own. They therefore value the rigorous approach that activist investors are able to take. “It is very resource-intensive, it takes months and large investors cannot systematically research all the companies they own – it would cost too much,” says the high profile activist investor.Some of the investors in his fund specifically approach the firm asking it to unlock value in companies they own shares in. “They want someone prepared to engage with corporates in a way that protects their value,” he says.This is part of a growing realisation among mainstream investors that they need to be more active. “As shareholders we have not been as vigilant as we should have been,” says Karina Litvack, head of governance and socially responsible investment at F&C.Mark Goyder, founder of Tomorrow’s Company says: “The financial crisis is a failure of ownership and we have to learn the lesson.”There has been a failure in the measurement of risk and it would be irresponsible not to sharpen oversight of risks, whether financial or related to issues such as climate change, adds Stephen Hine, head of responsible investment development at Eiris, the ethical investment research service.John Wilcox, chairman of Sodali, a global consultancy, and an adviser to TIAA-Cref, the retirement specialist, says activists and corporate governance reformers will target companies, particularly in the finance sector, because “they feel very strongly that the retirement savings of millions have been lost because they were thrown into the casino”. This will lead to wholesale withholding of votes from directors and the withholding of approval of accounts (only an option outside the US), he believes.“Shareholder activists are really good at pinpointing areas where an individual company falls short of its peers, but they cannot deal with systemic issues such as incentive structures,” says Ms Litvack. Everyone in the chain of ownership is incentivised on a short-term basis, adds Colin Melvin, managing director of Hermes Equity Ownership Service, which represents the owners of $60bn of assets. “Two years ago, we were challenging investment banks about inappropriate pay and incentives. If others had been doing that, we might not be where we are today.”*Hedge Fund Activism, Corporate Governance, and Firm Performance (2006), Brav et al
122;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-10-29T20:59:01Z;US railroads on track;;The US economy may be going off the rails, but don’t tell that to the men who make the trains run on time. It would seem the four big freight railroad companies that haul much of the industrial output and deliver commodities from coast to coast would be the first to feel the pain of the sharp downturn. Instead they are thriving. Recent quarterly reports for Norfolk Southern, CSX, Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe revealed an average of 29 per cent earnings per share growth versus the same period a year ago, with all four beating consensus forecasts and issuing mostly upbeat guidance.This stands in stark contrast to the ailing trucking industry or indicators such as the Baltic Dry index, measuring bulk shipping rates, which is off 90 per cent since June. The reason for the huge discrepancy is the quasi-monopolistic nature of railways and long-term tariff agreements. The sector’s return on equity climbed enough to attract Warren Buffett’s interest in BNSF last year.Since 1980, when the industry was partially deregulated and emerged from decades of decline, it has seen volumes rise and productivity increase amid falling tariffs. Tight capacity has allowed railways to raise prices the past few years but rates per-ton-mile are 54 per cent less in real terms than in 1981. That means rail remains extremely competitive versus trucks.All the big railways see easing volumes next quarter, having taken a hit from the slumping housing, auto and chemical industries. Next year they may even face some weakness in cash cows such as coal and grains, while expensive new safety mandates are also a concern. Railway shares’ relative outperformance does not make them expensive though. At about 11 times prospective earnings, the industry is priced for neither growth nor a derailment, and that seems about right.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here

Wells Fargo fell 1.7 per cent to $34.56. Citigroup, which was poised to acquire Wachovia’s banking business earlier in the week, said it would oppose the new deal. Citigroup’s shares tumbled 18.4 per cent to $18.35.Housing-related stocks were among the worst hit as fears grew over the health of the economy. CB Richard Ellis fell 11.7 per cent on Friday to $9.45. Lennar and DR Horton fell 13 per cent at $12.08 and 8.4 per cent $11.07.Regional banks were one of the few sectors to hang onto gains. Regions Financial and Sovereign Bancorp rallied 14.1 per cent to $13.52 and 11.2 per cent to $5.84, respectively.That left the regional banking sector 3.3 per cent lower for the week. Financials overall ended the week 10.8 per cent lower as money markets remained paralysed.The S&P 500 finished down on Friday 1.4 per cent at 1,099.23 points after a steep sell-off towards the close. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1.5 per cent at 1,947.39 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 1.5 per cent lower at 10,325.38 points.In a highly volatile week, the S&P was down 9.4 per cent, the Nasdaq down 10.8 per cent and the Dow Jones off 7.3 per cent.Stocks suffered their biggest one-day fall since 1987 on Monday in response to the House of Representatives failure to approve the original bail-out package.Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, said its passage on Friday was “not a panacea . . . There’s still a list of things weighing on the economy.”Grim job figures on Friday added to a glut of downbeat economic data from manufacturing to mortgage applications released in the week.“All the evidence suggests a massive retrenchment in US consumer spending in September,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley.Regulators extended a temporary ban on short selling of financial stocks that had been due to expire after Thursday’s session.Throughout the week, the index compiled by Bloomberg of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list hovered around the level of when the ban started last month and fell 1.4 per cent on Friday.Bucking the negative trend, JPMorgan reached its highest level in more than a year during the week, although it reversed course and fell 7.9 per cent on Friday to $45.90.Bank of America reached its highest level since May during the week but fell
5.2 per cent to $34.48.General Electric’s need to raise $15bn capital highlighted the risks the credit crunch posed for corporate America. GE fell 14.6 per cent over the week and threatened to reach an 11-year low.Other industrials suffered sharp falls. Railways – heavily owned by hedge funds, whose redemptions observers said pushed several stocks sharply lower – erased much of their gains for the week. CSX and Union Pacific lost 15.4 per cent and 15.6 per cent over the period.Big name technology companies, also heavily owned by hedge funds, sustained losses. Yahoo sank 15.4 per cent over the week after recovering 2.7 per cent to $16 on Friday."

Mosaic sank 41.3 per cent to $39.65 after disappointing first quarter earnings and warning it would sharply reduce phosphate production.Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on fertiliser peers Potash and Agrium, which lost 27 per cent to $93.51 and 24.2 per cent at $41.61 respectively, from “buy” to “underperform”.Monsanto, meanwhile, dropped 16.2 per cent to $82.01 after Merrill Lynch also cut its recommendation on the seed and herbicide producer from “buy” to “neutral’’.Industrials endured another heavy fall, down 6.8 per cent. Hedge-fund redemptions weighed on the performance of some stocks, observers said.CSX and Union Pacific, down 11 per cent at $47.21 and 10.1 per cent at $62.10 respectively, led a nosedive in the railway sector that erased much of its gain for the year.Both were included in a list of stocks that “matter most” to hedge funds, compiled by Goldman Sachs.A profit warning from trucker Con-way pushed the shares 20.5 per cent lower to $34.16.Airlines – such as Northwest, down 7.5 per cent at $9.71 – endured sharp declines in spite of a drop in oil prices.Meanwhile, GE sank 9.6 per cent to $22.15 on Thursday after it priced 547.83m shares at $22.25 apiece, below Wednesday’s closing price.The S&P 500 closed down 4 per cent at 1,114.28 points. The Nasdaq Composite index was down 4.5 per cent at 1,976.72, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.2 per cent to 10,482.85.The resource-heavy Toronto Stock Exchange dropped 7 per cent to 10,900.54 points.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index shot up 14.6 per cent to 45.61, indicating extremely high levels of distress.Although US senators revived the banking sector bail-out plan on Wednesday night, investors were nervous ahead of another vote from the House of Representatives expected on Friday.Financials also continued their slide, down 4.3 per cent in spite of a relatively positive update from Swiss bank UBS. Banks continued to hoard cash amid severe strain in the money markets.Regulators said they would extend their ban on short selling of financial stocks that had been due to expire on Thursday.The index of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list, compiled by Bloomberg, fell 4.5 per cent, below the level when the ban started last month.Semiconductor stocks took scant comfort from global sales figures. The sector fell 4.5 per cent even after Semiconductor Industry Association data showed sales rose 5.5 per cent in August from the previous year.Big name technology companies, which have sustained heavy losses and are also widely held by hedge funds, continued their slide. Google and Apple lost 5.2 per cent to $390.49 and 8.3 per cent to $100.10, respectively.Ebay tumbled 8.2 per cent to $19.15 after Morgan Stanley downgraded its recommendation on the internet auctioneer from “overweight” to “equal weight”.Bucking the downward trend, Atmel jumped 34.2 per cent to $4.40 after Microchip Technology and ON Semiconductor made an unsolicited $2.3bn offer.Constellation Energy rose 14.7 per cent to $27.23 after the Financial Times reported EDF was nearing a deal with private equity group KKR to trump Warren Buffett’s $4.7bn takeover.Some defensive stocks – such as Kraft, up 0.3 per cent to $33.54 – escaped the worst declines.
125;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-09-29T17:52:10Z;US freight lines carrying a lighter burden;;"The huge yellow crane straddling the tracks at one of Norfolk Southern Railway’s container-handling yards works steadily along the train. It lifts each of the two containers stacked on each railcar and places them on to a waiting flatbed truck trailer, ready to be driven off.Business at the yard in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania remains steady in spite of the downturn in demand for the consumer goods often carried in containers. Falling overall demand has been partially offset by the high fuel prices and driver shortages facing the US trucking industry.Lines such as JB Hunt, the US’s largest trucking company, save money by bringing containers to rail facilities such as Harrisburg for their journeys’ long-haul legs rather than hauling them by truck. As a result, revenues in Norfolk Southern’s Intermodal arm – its container-hauling business – were up 11 per cent year on year to $532m in the three months to June 30.There is even more robust activity at the Lamberts Point coal port that NS, the fourth largest US rail operator, operates in Virginia. Long lines of coal trucks wait at the port for loading on to ships. Demand for coal – including the 20m tonnes of Pennsyvlanian and West Virginian coal exported through Lamberts Point annually – gave NS coal revenues for the second quarter this year up 33 per cent on the same quarter of 2007.The less-severe-than-expected impact of reduced US consumer spending and strong growth in bulk commodities have together helped the seven large US and Canadian railways to withstand the economic slowdown better than any previous such crisis for several decades.For the second quarter this year, NS, one of two leading US operators east of the River Mississippi, reported net income up 15 per cent year on year to $453m on rail operating revenues up 16 per cent to $2.76bn. Union Pacific, the biggest operator west of the Mississippi, reported second-quarter net income up 19 per cent year on year to $531m on operating revenues up 13 per cent to $4.57bn.Anthony Hatch, an independent, New York-based rail analyst, says most leading groups beat market expectations in results in the second quarter. They were among the few groups in industrial North America to have done so.The sector’s strength has allowed it to raise prices. NS’s average revenue per carload of coal in the second quarter was up nearly 30 per cent year on year to $1,729; intermodal yields rose 9.6 per cent to $656.James Squires, NS’s chief financial officer, gives several reasons for the improvement, including the industry’s improving service.But a key factor has been rationalisation. The industry’s liberalisation in 1980 permitted operators to close lines and tear up unused tracks, saving millions of dollars in maintenance costs.There has also been consolidation among operators, which has allowed elimination of underused routes. “Capacity is still, on a comparative basis historically, relatively constrained,” Mr Squires says. “That leads to better pricing and financial performance even through a downturn.”Thanks to the price increases and volume growth, most large US rail groups for the first time in decades earn returns from investments higher than their cost of capital. As a result, railways are among the few US infrastructure owners investing heavily in increasing capacity. NS is still, for example, working on the $151m Heartland Corridor project to clear its route from the Hampton Roads ports in Virginia to Chicago to carry containers stacked two-high, as already happens on other parts of the network.The work – which, because of its potential to remove trucks from roads, is being part-funded by state and federal governments – should hugely improve the competitiveness of the Heartland route for container shipments to the Midwest.Mr Squires accepts that rail’s profitability and investment might not survive if the slowdown becomes very severe. “If there’s a long, deep recession, things are not going to go as well for us, even with the advantages and benefits we have,” he says.But NS is in a very different position from the years following its 1997 acquisition of part of Conrail, another leading railway, when its priority was to cut its debt.Now, says Mr Squires, NS is inclined to borrow so that its investments need not stop. “That gives you a lot more flexibility – including the ability to maintain growth-oriented investments which traditionally have been cut at the first sign of a downturn.”"
126;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-09-22T12:22:38Z;Road congestion and oil price invigorate trains;;Anyone arriving on an Amtrak passenger train at Union Station in Washington, DC sees evidence of the world’s railway boom. The trains arriving from Boston, New York and Philadelphia are fuller than ever in publicly owned Amtrak’s 38-year history. Downstairs in Union Station’s metro stop, the trains are full for much of the day and then, during the night, long freight trains run by CSX, the US east coast’s largest freight railroad, rumble through downtown Washington’s empty commuter stations, a reminder of the growth in most forms of rail freight over recent years.The boom is still more obvious in Asian cities such as Taipei, the Taiwanese capital. Smart new Japanese-built Shinkansen high-speed trains have captured significant market share from airlines for the journey between Taipei and Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s second city, in the island’s south. At Jawaharlal Nehru Port, near Mumbai on India’s west coast, rail brings and hauls away an increasing share of the containers heading to and from inland India.In Europe, some of the strongest growth has come from the new, private freight operators competing with the continent’s established players and from private companies that have taken over some of the continent’s previously moribund regional rail routes. The continent’s web of high-speed rail connections also continues to grow impressively.The worldwide traffic growth has created a boom in work for the world’s trainmakers and equipment suppliers. According to a report published this month by Unife, the European Railway Industry Association, industry turnover has grown by an average 9 per cent annually in each of the last two years. Western Europe, the industry’s traditional heart, remains the most important region, says the report, prepared by consultants Roland Berger. But Asia’s rapid growth is set to move it ahead of North America as the industry’s second most important market. The industry’s annual average turnover in the last two years has been €123bn ($178bn), the Unife report estimates.“The short-term time horizon is characterised by huge growth rates,” says Andreas Schwilling, who compiled the report. Several large European rail operators are about to place significant orders, including France’s SNCF, Germany’s Deutsche Bahn and Spain’s Renfe, he points out. Only after those deliveries will the industry’s growth rate slacken off again – because so many important customers will have satisfied much of their need for new rolling stock.Michael Clausecker, Unife’s director general, points to long-term factors likely to sustain growth even once current orders are delivered. Growing environmental concerns have helped to shift both passengers and freight to rail. Well-loaded trains emit far fewer greenhouse gases per passenger or tonne of freight moved than road or air traffic. In many places, rail also provides an alternative to increasingly congested road systems.Surprisingly, the most obvious factor – rail’s price advantage over road and air because of high fuel prices – has been relatively minor, according to Mr Clausecker. While it has helped to encourage growth, the current upsurge in traffic started well before the most serious oil price hikes, he points out.As evidence of the shift, Mr Clausecker mentions the consideration being given to a dedicated high-speed passenger rail line from San Diego to Sacramento in California, an area that currently sees negligible long-distance passenger rail traffic, in contrast to the narrow, busy east coast corridor.“Even the fact that they’re investigating such a project shows that at least the economics for consideration of such a project have changed,” Mr Clausecker says, adding that greater importance is now placed on environmental considerations. Rail traffic in many regions has also benefited from strong worldwide demand for commodities such as coal, one of the cargoes best suited to travelling by train.The huge Lamberts Point coal-unloading facility of Norfolk Southern, one of the US’s major rail operators is far busier than for years, thanks to strong overseas demand for Appalachian and Pennsylvanian coal. The fuel arrives at the port in two-mile long trains to be tipped out of cars by huge machines and loaded on to ships.Australian and Brazilian railways are also seeing booming demand to move their countries’ coal, iron ore and other commodity products.Donald Seale, Norfolk Southern’s chief marketing officer, says demand for exported coal is up 63 to 64 per cent on last year – which was in turn 50 per cent up on the previous year. Domestic coal demand is also strong. Among Norfolk Southern’s locomotive purchases this year will be 24 aimed specifically at the demands of hauling coal.“We see very robust demand for coal for electrical generation going forward,” Mr Seale says. “That business continues to be good for us.”The recovery in rail’s fortunes also reflects the improving reliability and quality of rolling stock emerging from railway industry facilities – including the Erie, Pennsylvania, factory of General Electric, several hundred miles north-west of Lamberts Point.Among the improvements over the last 15 years has been a transformation in the design of the electric motors that drive nearly all rail vehicles, whether powered from electricity transmitted through overhead cables or from an onboard diesel engine. Many new vehicles have motors driven by alternating current electricity, rather than direct current. Such trams, suburban trains and diesel locomotives can provide greater power from motors requiring less maintenance.Diesel engines have been made far more fuel efficient – GE’s latest models produce the same power for 3 to 5 per cent less fuel, the company claims.In high-speed rail, France’s original Train à Grand Vitesse was considered a marvel when introduced in 1981 for its top speed of 270kph. But in Spain, Velaro high-speed trains built by Germany’s Siemens now routinely run at 350kph. The technology has been miniaturised so that the motors are now hidden beneath the floors to free up extra space for passengers. The new AGV high-speed train unveiled by Alstom, the TGV’s builder, in March has a standard top speed of 360kph.When a new metro such as that under construction in Dubai is planned, modern train control equipment means trains without drivers are the natural – and safest – choice. The world’s highest-profile train control project – the European Commission’s controversial European Rail Traffic Management System – also appears to be growing more reliable. It has gained significant overseas orders from customers glad that, because its specification is a publicly-available document, it can be produced by more than one supplier. Previously, railways that had chosen a signal supplier were its captive for any subsequent orders.The industry’s outstanding challenge, however, remains improving its profitability enough to afford more of the capacity expansions and rolling-stock purchases the new, higher levels of traffic demand. Amtrak, despite the strong traffic growth evident in Washington, made a net loss of $1.12bn in 2007 on $2.15bn revenue. The UK’s fast-growing rail system faces challenges meeting its investment needs as it faces sharp cuts in government subsidy over the next five years. Many other large railway systems rely to some degree on government support to survive.Yet profitability is already strong for some equipment suppliers. GE Transportation, the Erie-based locomotive builder, announced operating profits of $495m on $2.35bn sales for the first half of this year. Two of the big three European trainmakers are now solidly – if unspectacularly – profitable. Operators in many countries may follow suit as growing revenues cover the industry’s mostly fixed costs better and better.North America’s freight railroads have shown the way for train operators to achieve the same kinds of results. Many now earn such strong profits that, for the first time in 60 years, they earn more than it costs them to raise money for new investments.However, the growing revenue is bound to be good news even for less well-performing corners of the industry. Most of the industry’s costs are fixed, so that extra revenue can quickly turn into profit at the right level. That in turn may justify fresh investment and set off the next phase of rail’s renaissance.

TCI/3G said the railroad was underperforming, while CSX said the hedge funds would saddle it with too much debt.That battle culminated in the vote at the June shareholder meeting on the dissident slate of five directors proposed by TCI/3G.CSX said in July that a preliminary count showed that four of the hedge funds’ nominees had been elected to the board in June, but two of those seats were subject to an appeal of a US District Court ruling.In that ruling, a judge in Manhattan ruled that while the funds violated securities law by evading disclosure obligations related to their stakes in CSX, they were allowed to vote their shares at the June meeting.A decision on Monday by a US federal appeals court upheld the lower court’s ruling.TCI/3G nominees Gilbert Lamphere and Alexandre Behring joined the board after the election results were announced.
128;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-09-11T21:02:25Z;Wall Street rallies in late session;;"Merrill Lynch fell to its lowest level in a decade on Thursday, one of several notable financial casualties in an otherwise bullish session for Wall Street stocks.In spite of continued concerns over Lehman Brothers – whose shares fell 41.8 per cent to $4.22 – the wider market rallied late in the day as heavy sell-offs were contained to a handful off stocks. By close, the financial sector had risen 1.5 per amid speculation that Bank of America was in talks to buy the embattled investment bank. Bank of America shares rose 2 per cent to $33.06.Concerns over some financial stocks were sparked by a further loss of confidence at Lehman as analysts raised doubts about its restructuring strategy. Several analysts, including those at Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank, cut their recommendations amid mounting worries that its credit rating could be cut.Merrill Lynch’s implied volatility – a measure of expected future movements over the next month – has reached a record, according to IVolatility.com. Its shares were off 16.6 per cent at $19.43Yet Washington Mutual – down as much as 24.6 per cent – rose 22 per cent at $2.83. In recent weeks, the shares have been pushed down by heavy shorting,. Reports also suggested that the US Office of Thrift Supervision was monitoring the condition of the company.Other financial stocks sustained large falls earlier in the day, only to rally later. American International Group stood 0.3 per cent higher at $2.83 by the close.However, Wachovia was the other main stand-out loser, down 5.3 per cent at $14.28.In volatile trading session, the benchmark S&P 500 index was at one point on course to close down at its lowest point this year before rallying before the close.By the close the S&P 500 closed up 1.4 per cent at 1,249.05 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.5 per cent at 11,433.71. The Nasdaq was 1.3 per cent higher at 2,258.22.That came even though confidence in Lehman Brothers appeared to evaporate. Citigroup wrote in a note to clients that “confidence and perception issues are overwhelming Lehman’s franchise value”.Investors were beginning to compartmentalise the risk of internal difficulties at certain institutions that face particular internal problems, said Walter Gerasimowicz, chief executive of Meditron Asset Management. “Just because the financials are getting hurt doesn’t mean there are not opportunities in other sectors.”Oil refiners were boosted as oil edged closer to the $100 mark.Leading the gains were Sunoco, Tesoro and Valero, up 12.4 per cent at $47.66, 9.3 per cent to $17.98 and 6.9 per cent to $33.03, respectively.The failing oil price boosted consumer discretionaries, which edged into
positive territory.Among the gains in the retail sector was Lululemon Athletica, which advanced 14.4 per cent to $18.94 on the back of well-received second-quarter results.Transport stocks also benefited. Among leaders, Continental Airlines rose 15.2 per cent to $18.51 after the carrier introduced plans to introduce a bag-check fee, which it expected to generate $100m in revenue.Also in transport, CSX rose 10.7 per cent to $60.70 after the third-largest US rail operator raised its 2008 profit forecast, citing a “positive outlook’’ for the industry.There were bright spots elsewhere. Allergan rose 10.9 per cent to $60.53 after the maker of Botox, the wrinkle-smoothing treatment, said clinical trials showed Botox was effective in treating chronic migraines.In technology, Microsoft put on 3.4 per cent to $27.34 after Research in Motion agreed to use Microsoft’s web search engine on its BlackBerry smartphones.Meanwhile, Altria Group’s purchase of UST took its toll on the rival tobacco company Reynolds American, which fell 3.8 per cent to $49.48.Earlier in the day, economic data weighed on investor confidence and served as a reminder that difficulties are not confined to the financial sector.Data pointed to a further weakening in the labour market, while a separate report showed a greater-than-expected widening in the US trade deficit, to its highest level since March 2007."
129;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-08-03T17:05:57Z;US ruling on swaps bolsters defences;;US companies that fear unwanted takeovers are increasingly counting derivatives as beneficial share ownership when they install “poison pill” anti-takeover devices, a move that could become more common in the wake of a landmark legal ruling on the matter.A poison pill is triggered if any one shareholder buys up enough shares of a company to reach a certain threshold, usually set at 10 to 20 per cent.Ownership of derivatives backed by shares in the company, including “swaps” and other instruments, have generally not counted towards that total.However, a legal decision reached in June is changing that. A judge in the Southern District of New York said that two hedge funds had tried to evade the spirit of disclosure law by building up a stake in railway operator CSX through swaps, a type of derivative instrument.The judge did not rule outright that derivatives should be counted as beneficial share ownership but a few takeover-wary US companies have decided to define the issue as it applies to their own shareholders, and corporate attorneys expect that number to grow.Republic Services, a US waste hauler whose bid to buy a rival sparked a third-party bid for its own assets, became the third known US company to address the issue of derivatives as beneficial ownership when it adopted a shareholder rights plan last week.The plan will be triggered if a shareholder buys 10 per cent or more of Republic’s stock – including derivatives – flooding other shareholders’ wallets with new shares and diluting the stake of any unwanted acquirer.Semiconductor maker Micrel and building materials supplier Louisiana-Pacific had already enacted shareholder rights plans prior to the ruling that included derivatives in their tally of beneficial ownership.Other companies that are nervous about getting hit with an unsolicited bid are also dusting off their shareholder rights plans to add a derivatives clause, say corporate attorneys.
130;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;TCI and 3G secure places on CSX board;;"The Children’s Investment Fund and 3G, its partner in its battle with CSX, the US railway, appear to have won a major victory after preliminary figures showed four of their five nominees for the company’s board had been elected.The announcement comes after an acrimonious annual meeting on June 25 after which CSX, the US’s third-largest railway by revenue, announced results were too close to be produced immediately. The preliminary figures were published on Wednesday by IVC Associates, the independent election scrutineer, ahead of the reconvened annual meeting, which take place on July 25.The nominees will join a 12-person board chaired by Michael Ward, CSX’s president and chief executive, who has faced severe criticism from the funds over his record in charge at CSX and his pay.The two funds have been in conflict with CSX for months, accusing the company of providing poor shareholder returns at a time when railways across North America are reviving because of booming demand for commodities and Asian imports.CSX had fought a legal battle against TCI and 3G and inspired a lobbying campaign accusing the two groups of seeking to gain control of the company and also of representing a threat to US national security.The funds said that their nominees’ election was a great victory for all CSX shareholders. “We thank our fellow shareholders for their strong support for the principles and ideas advanced by our nominees, and we appreciate the focus and dedication of all CSX employees throughout this process,” the funds said.The successful candidates included Chris Hohn, TCI’s founder; Alex Behring, managing director of 3G; Gilbert Lamphere, a former director of Canadian National Railway; and Tim O’Toole, a former chief executive of the jointly-operated Conrail rail routes who is now managing director of London Underground. Only Gary Wilson, a former executive of Northwest Airlines, missed out on election.The results had been expected since several US corporate governance advisers had suggested shareholders vote for the four successful nominees because of the expertise that they would bring to the board of the company. CSX was long one of the worst performers of the seven large railroad companies – known as the Class Is – in the USA and Canada.However, CSX has insisted that its returns are now near those of its peers and has fought a bitterly political campaign against TCI, accusing the fund of seeking to gain control of the company.The preliminary figures could still be overturned if CSX succeeds in its appeal over a court ruling before the annual meeting that criticised how TCI and 3G had secretly built up their stakes in CSX but refused to bar them from voting. CSX wants the pair’s votes discounted or reduced in weight, while the investors are appealing against the original criticism."
131;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-07-08T20:37:10Z;Wall Street rallies in late trade;;Wall Street stocks rallied the most in over a month on Tuesday, bouncing back from bear market territory as falling commodity prices boosted consumer facing stocks and financials roared ahead.Oil was the prime mover on Tuesday, falling about $6 a barrel and dropping below $137 a barrel.That retreat, and some new data showing that tax rebates continue to fuel spending helped consumer-facing stocks. Gap added 5.6 per cent to $16.75 and Ford rose 9.6 per cent to $4.90 while the consumer discretionary sector advanced 2.2 per cent.Office Depot, however, was a weak spot, dropping 31.6 per cent to $7.08 after it said North American same-store sales fell nearly 10 per cent in the second quarter and it warned on operating margins.Consumer staples also fared well, climbing 1.5 per cent. SuperValu rose 5 per cent to $32.67 while Wal-Mart rose 3.9 per cent to $59.11.Results from Pepsi Bottling Group took some of the shine off the sector, however. The company posted second-quarter results that topped analysts’ expectations but investors were unimpressed, trimming the share price by 2.7 per cent to $27.88.Industrials and healthcare stocks also advanced, adding 0.7 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.An analyst upgrade boosted United Parcel Service 4.3 per cent to $60.40 while falling oil prices helped other transport-related stocks gain.GE climbed 3.5 per cent to $28.06, CSX advanced 6.9 per cent to $60.79 and Ryder System rose 4.4 per cent to $70.08.In healthcare sector, stocks rallied a day after S&P equity strategists upgraded the group to “market weight” arguing that with equity volatility likely to remain elevated and valuations low, “investors will re-focus on healthcare’s defensive qualities, allowing for better relative performance. ”Schering-Plough was among the leading gainers, climbing 4.6 per cent to $20.86 after it said its experimental treatment for infertility had met its main goals in a late-stage study.Biogen Idec and Abbott Laboratories gained 6.9 per cent to $62.94 and 5.9 per cent to $57.37 respectively.The benchmark S&P 500 closed the day up 1.7 per cent at 1,273.68. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 per cent to 11,384.21 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3 per cent at 2,294.42. Both indices moved out of bear market territory.Financials stocks climbed sharply, adding 5.7 per cent for their biggest one day gain since early April. The Federal Reserve chairman suggested the central bank would give investment banks access to emergency cash into 2009 while the chief executive of JP Morgan said credit losses would ease.The news offered the sector some consolation after a volatile start to the week in which they re-tested five year lows.The most heavily sold stocks made the strongest advances. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Washington Mutual jumped, soaring 11.9 per cent to $17.62, 13 per cent to $13.64 and 16.8 per cent to $5.99 respectively.On Monday a wave of speculation that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the government sponsored mortgage entities, might have to raise capital to retain their triple A credit ratings triggered heavy selling .In spite of Ben Bernanke’s soothing comments, there were some moments of excitement.IndyMac Bancorp provided the most spectacular of those, plummeting 38 per cent to $0.44. The California mortgage specialist said it did not have enough capital to offer new home loans and an analyst said shareholders may be wiped out.Energy stocks crumpled in response to the falling oil prices however. The sector fell 1.6 per cent and is now on the brink of a correction from its May highs, down about 9 per cent..Exxon Mobil fell 1.2 per cent to $85.94 while ConocoPhillips lost 1.3 per cent to $89.15.Still, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, warned: “It is a passing thing. I don’t think we are going to get a real break in energy prices until the fourth quarter when prices are seasonally weak and some Fed rate hikes take effect.”The materials sector fared little better, losing 0.6 per cent as commodity prices slipped back and investors worried that a global economic downturn would hurt demand. US Steel fell 4.6 per cent to $150.55 while Nucor lost 4.4 per cent to $63.16.
132;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;FSA rules trigger mixed reactions;;The Children’s Investment Fund (TCI), the London-based activist hedge fund, is at the sharp end of the fight over disclosure of covert stakes in companies built up through derivatives.TCI, run by the secretive Chris Hohn, lost a court battle against CSX, a US rail network, last month, with the judge ruling that the fund should have announced a holding via derivatives that peaked at almost 14 per cent – even though the Securities and Exchange Commission backed the fund’s view that disclosure was not required under US law.The SEC labelled the eventual result “novel” – officialese for disastrous – in a view backed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which said it could “chill legitimate and desirable commercial activity”.On Wednesday the Financial Services Authority dismissed such views, calling for derivatives that give exposure to moves in the shares of London-listed companies to be disclosed just as the underlying shares are above 3 per cent of a company.Contracts for difference – the most popular such derivative – now account for almost a third of UK equity trading, it estimates.Alexander Justham, director of markets at the regulator, said: “Our goal is to provide an effective and proportionate disclosure regime that works for all involved, and sustains market confidence and efficiency”.The new rules chime with international moves for disclosure of derivatives, demands for more transparency at hedge funds, the main users of equity derivatives, and increased political pressure on short-sellers, again hedge funds.Traditional investors welcomed the regime while hedge funds warned of increased bureaucracy. But hedge funds are not universally against the rules. Many of the biggest are supportive of greater disclosure, albeit preferring a different method of applying them.Colin Kingsnorth, head of Laxey Partners, a $2bn (£1bn) activist hedge fund in London, said the “vast, vast, vast bulk” of CFD trading was nothing to do with activism. “I’m absolutely in favour of more disclosure,” he said.Laxey’s willingness to disclose might come as a surprise to many: the fund is notorious for its attempt to break up British Land in 2003, where it took a stake of almost 9 per cent, the majority held through CFDs.Laxey was attacked this year by Swiss regulators, who recommended criminal action against the fund for failing to disclose a holding in Implenia, the country’s biggest building services company, built up through CFDs. Laxey, which took 22 per cent of Implenia, plans to appeal against the ruling and denies breaching Swiss rules, which were later tightened to demand disclosure of significant CFD holdings.The FSA’s move required more openness than the option it previously said it preferred – the second time in three weeks that it had surprised markets with demands for transparency.Last month it introduced a disclosure regime for short positions in stocks during rights issues, after anecdotal evidence of abusive short-selling.Those rules met with protest from the hedge fund industry and criticism of a confusing lack of detail. This time there was more praise.“The shorting rule was ill-informed and they didn’t get the wording right. The CFD regime is the FSA showing itself in a more favourable light,” said Simon Morris at CMS Cameron McKenna. “You can argue with the policy, but the FSA’s approach on this cannot be faulted.”Others contrasted the speed of action: the short-selling rules were introduced under emergency powers with just a week’s notice.CFD disclosure has been under discussion for two years and the rules will not take effect until late next year – although the FSA said it would try to introduce them earlier if possible.Observers linked both moves to a greater decisiveness at the regulator, given the market turmoil.“It seems like there is a desire to be tough and it does seem related to the current circumstances,” said Andrew Shrimpton, a partner at hedge fund consultancy Kinetic Partners and a former FSA official.“That is the only explanation for this move, given that we hadn’t got the evidence from the market studies to lead us to this option.”

Both are now down more than 20 per cent from their recent peaks.Oil prices smashed through $143 a barrel after a government inventory report showed a sharp drop in crude oil supplies, knocking all ten leading industry groups on the S&P500 into the red.Rising oil prices have been a constant scourge for equity markets in recent months, raising the spectre of spiralling input costs and tumbling corporate profits.The biggest faller on Wednesday was the material sector, which lost 5.3 per cent - its biggest one day fall since March.Energy intensive steel producers fell for a third day. US Steel lost 12.5 per cent to $153.40 and Nucor dropped 14.2 per cent to $61.94.Gold miners also fell back as gold prices dropped. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 6.9 per cent to $107.57 while Newmont Mining lost 4.5 per cent to $50.99.The energy sector also dragged. Coal stocks were the weak link, tumbling as European prices fell the most since 2005. Massey Energy and Consol Energy fell 18.9 per cent to $74.87 and 14.6 per cent to $95.57 respectively.In industrials, transport-related stocks suffered. CSX fell 6.4 per cent to $57.06 while Paccar lost 7 per cent to $39.86.The day began in a positive fashion after European banks dismissed speculation that they would have to raise more cash, bolstering their US peers.But gains were erased after another rash of analyst downgrades while comments by Hank Paulson also took their toll. The Treasury secretary proposed the president should have to approve any use of taxpayer funds to aid a financial company in trouble.Citigroup fell 1.7 per cent to $16.84 while Merrill lost 3.4 per cent to $31.15. The financial sector as a whole slipped 1.4 per cent.Macroeconomic news did little to improve the mood. New data from the Commerce Department showed US factory orders climbed a faster-than-expected 0.6 per cent in May for a third monthly increase.Any positive momentum was curtailed by the ADP Employer Services report, which showed private companies cut jobs at four times the expected rate in June.Carmakers came under renewed pressure after analysts at Merrill Lynch punctured the euphoria surrounding General Motors sales figures, which were released on Tuesday.The brokerage downgraded GM from “buy” to “underperform” and cut its 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates, citing lower forecasts for US car sales and noting that “bankruptcy is not impossible.”GM fell 15.1 per cent to $9.98 while Ford dipped 7.4 per cent to $4.36.The consumer discretionary sector also slipped back 1.7 per cent as oil prices rose. Liz Claibornlost 6.6 per cent to $13.08 while Staplesfell 4.9 per cent to $23.12.Starbucks clung to a 0.4 per cent gain at $15.68, buoyed by plans to cut 7 per cent of its workforce and close 600 stores as part of efforts to revitalise the coffee chain.Blockbuster rose 5.8 per cent to $2.65 after it dropped a $1.35bn bid for Circuit City Stores the lossmaking electronics retailer. Circuit City shares slumped 9 per cent to $2.32.The technology sector was volatile. Semiconductors were the worst performing subsector, while software and services companies followed close behind.But there were exceptions. Yahoo climbed 3.4 per cent to $20.88 after the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft had approached media companies about teaming up for a break-up deal. Microsoft fell 3.7 per cent to $25.88.Meanwhile, Dell shares rallied 2. per cent to $23.70 after chief executive Michael Dell revealed he had bought 4.5m shares in the company at between $21.89 and $22.39 since June 27.
134;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-07-01T22:39:55Z;Fears for US disclosure rules after CSX ruling;;Lawyers on Tuesday warned that a court ruling involving CSX, the US railroad operator at war with two hedge funds, would have significant implications for US disclosure rules.The ruling, they say, could mean investors, including activist hedge funds, must include derivatives when they calculate their total stake in a company.The ruling, by Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York two weeks ago, comes amid rising concern from US companies and institutional investors that the use of derivatives in building company stakes has broken the link between economic ownership and voting rights.In a case brought by CSX, the railway operator, Judge Kaplan ruled that he did not have the power to stop two hedge funds, The Children’s Investment Fund and 3G Capital, from voting their combined 8.7 per cent stake in CSX.However, in a strongly worded statement, he said that the two had attempted to evade the spirit of the law by building their stake through swaps, a form of derivatives. He indicated that swaps, which are widely used by hedge funds, should be viewed as beneficial share ownership, treated in the same way as common shares and included in calculating the size of a stake.The ruling is at odds with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has said that swaps should not count as beneficial share ownership. The decision is also being appealed by the two funds, which together hold 11.8 per cent if swaps are included.One lawyer who has studied the ruling said: “This has a significant rippling impact in a whole host of areas …the SEC will need to weigh in on this.”Richard Swanson, a partner at law firm Arnold & Porter, said: “If the ruling is affirmed, most people would assume they should accept this as the correct interpretation of 13D rules [on disclosure], and disclose their swaps”.The 13D rule requires a shareholder to disclose when their stake in a company has reached 5 per cent. The ruling might mean that they should count swaps in the total.“A lot of hedge funds and others are out there now who are doing their calculations on how far above the 5 per cent they may be [with their swaps],” said Mr Swanson.One lawyer said: “This will create significant uncertainty for hedge funds that have stakes of any size in a company. It will act as a significant inhibition to them, a form of poison pill.”It would also have a “meaningfully chilling” impact on the swaps market, he said. Swaps are widely used by hedge funds and a reduction in their use would affect the big banks, which profit from them.There are many trigger points which could be affected.Section 16 of the 1934 Act says that if a shareholder has 10 per cent of a company, certain rules apply. They must disclose their trades every two days, and if they buy or sell within six months, the company can require them to disgorge any profits. “If swaps count, it could result in someone inadvertently triggering a company’s poison pill, which results in a series of actions taking place as soon as a shareholder reaches 15 per cent,” said the lawyer.Also, many state laws say that if a shareholder acquires more than 15 per cent of a company without the approval of the board, then the shareholder cannot acquire more shares.Many companies have change of control provisions at 30 per cent …the list goes on,” said the lawyer.Most agreed that there would be pressure from market participants for the SEC would issue a clarifying ruling, stating which circumstances, if any, swaps should be included in the count.
135;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-07-01T20:42:32Z;GM helps dispel some of Wall Street gloom;;"US equity markets fought back tenaciously on Tuesday, throwing off fuel and financial worries to post modest gains after General Motors showed a smaller than expected decline in sales for June.The morning session proved volatile and gloomy as oil prices streaked higher, keeping up the pressure on consumer-facing and energy-dependent stocks while earnings downgrades hit the banking sector.New data showing an unexpected expansion in manufacturing activity in June helped limit losses. The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing index rose from 49.6 in May to 50.2 last month. Economists had expected the index to slip back in June.Markets swung into positive territory in mid-afternoon when General Motors reported that its sales in North America, seasonally adjusted, declined only 8.3 per cent in June – far less than expected.GM shares, which hit a 54 year low on Monday, overturned early losses to surge as much as 15 per cent. The shares closed 2.2 per cent ahead at $11.75. Ford lost 2.1 per cent to $4.71 after it posted a larger decline in sales.The picture for US auto makers in general looks challenging. Record high oil prices have encouraged buyers to purchase smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles, often made by foreign competitors.Investors also bought back into financial shares, picking up some of the most heavily sold stocks.Still, gains were limited by a slump in material stocks, which lost 1 per cent, while the consumer discretionary sector, of which automakers are a part, also lost ground.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,284.93 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 per cent to 11,382.26 points while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 2,304.97 points.On Monday, most stocks fell, rounding off the S&P 500’s worst month in six years as rising oil prices and worries about the health of the leading financial institutions undermined investor confidence. The Dow showed its biggest June decline since 1930.Larry Smith, chief investment officer at Third Wave Global Investors, said: “These very poor equity numbers directly reflect the fact that, until oil comes down, we are going to continue to have growth that is weak and gets weaker.”The downward trend paused on Tuesday, but weak spots were evident.In materials, energy-intensive steel producers were among the biggest fallers. AK Steel , US Steel and Nucor lost 4.9 per cent to $65.59; 5.1 per cent to $175.35; and 3.3 per cent to $72.23, respectively.In the industrial sector, railway stocks CSX and Union Pacific lost 3 per cent to $60.93 and 2.5 per cent to $73.65, while package delivery companies FedEx and UPS slipped 3.1 per cent to $76.37 and 1.5 per cent to $60.55.A rally in GE and Deere shares helped counterbalance those losses at the close however. The pair added 1.6 per cent to $27.12 and 1.8 per cent to $73.42 respectively.Meanwhile, consumer discretionary stocks also fell slightly as fuel prices rose. Dillard’s, the department store operator, fell 6.2 per cent to $10.85 while Jones Apparelslipped 1.9 per cent to $13.49.The biggest loser was Fortune Brands. The home products maker gave up 13.3 per cent to $54.13 after second-quarter profit fell more than it forecast, in part because of the US housing slump.Energy stocks made up for those losses. Schlumberger, the oil services company, added 2.3 per cent to $109.86 while the sector as whole gained 0.6 per cent. The refiners struggled however. Tesoro lost 2.2 per cent to $19.37.Banking stocks proved surprisingly resilient, looking past a UBS note in which the firm slashed its earnings forecasts for US banks for 2008 and 2009 by up to 30 per cent.The sector overturned losses of as much as 2.8 per cent to gain 1 per cent and snap a three day losing streak. JPMorganand Citigroup recovered from early losses to gain 0.3 per cent to $34.02 and 2.2 per cent to $17.13.Lehman Brothers also made ground, rebounding 5.8 per cent to $20.96 after Morgan Stanley rated the firm “overweight” in new coverage.CIT Group the loss-making business lender, was the leading sector gainer however, rising 30 per cent to $8.83 after it agreed to sell its manufactured housing and home-loan businesses for $1.8bn to focus on commercial lending."
136;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
137;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Losing in Japan;;You win some, you lose some. The Children’s Investment Fund laid claim to victory in the US, after a close vote on board representation at railroad company CSX, but was roundly defeated in Japan just a matter of hours later.The battle lost was the bigger one. Activist investor TCI mounted a two-track campaign in Japan: to enhance returns at J-Power, the electricity wholesaler in which it has a near-10 per cent stake, and to highlight inadequacies in the country’s corporate governance. Both are legitimate causes. J-Power lagged behind its domestic peers in terms of payout ratios, while its return on equity is roughly half the global sector average. Much the same could be said for Japan Inc, which has an ROE well below that of the US and Europe. Shareholder friendliness is unlikely to change any time soon if last year’s series of failed proposals, mainly for dividend hikes, is anything to go by. Rather, companies have responded by implementing poison pills and boosting cross-shareholdings to bolster their defences.It is therefore tough for TCI to claim success on either score. True, Tokyo is getting more shrewd, prefacing the annual general meeting season with proposals designed to please foreign investors. But deeds are yet to follow words. Meantime, TCI is sitting on an investment that, at best, has produced small gains since TCI began accumulating shares in 2005. J-Power’s share price continues to slide, down by nearly a fifth in the past 12 months.In fact TCI’s timing now looks unfortunate and its target ill-judged. J-Power can argue more easily for only modest dividend increases when a heavy capital expenditure plan is in the offing and the economic backdrop is deteriorating. With most investors firmly on management’s side (partly a reflection of cross-shareholdings), and two rounds of failed proposals behind it, TCI must question the wisdom of sticking around.Post and read comments on this Lex
138;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-06-19T20:47:02Z;Wall St rebounds after drop in oil prices;;Wall Street stock markets rebounded on Thursday after a drop in oil prices buoyed consumer discretionary and transport stocks, taking the sting out of data showing continued weakness in the US economy and a warning from Citigroup about further writedowns.The day began in a downbeat fashion with new data that showed initial jobless claims dropped by less than expected last week, while manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region contracted more than expected in June.Still, it was the travails of the banking sector that weighed heaviest on equity markets in early trading. Comments from the chief financial officer of Citigroup accelerated losses.Gary Crittenden told investors that the largest US bank would have substantial writedowns on its holdings of subprime mortgage-related debt. Citigroup shares slid as much as 4.9 per cent before recovering to $20.17, down 1.3 per cent.As oil prices fell back however, a rally in the consumer discretionary and industrial sectors picked up steam, and they advanced 1.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively erasing early losses.Amid the broad market rally, even financials ended the day in positive territory, adding 0.9 per cent alongside a 1.2 per cent gain for technology.By the close S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent at 1,342.83 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly dipped below 12,000 points for the second successive day, before reviving. The index ended the day 0.3 per cent higher at 12,063.09 points. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.3 per cent to 2,446.99 points.On Wednesday, equity markets sold off sharply, and the Dow hit a three-month low, after declines in the banking sector and a downbeat outlook on the economy from FedEx weighed on sentiment.The pattern initially repeated on Thursday after analysts cut their earnings estimates for Morgan Stanley, triggering a sell-off. Morgan Stanley shares, which struggled to a small gain on Wednesday, fell 1.2 per cent to $40.19.Regional banks have come under particular selling pressure in the past few days as a number of analysts have questioned the ability of smaller, less capitalised banks to stand up to the strains of the credit crisis and mounting losses on mortgage assets.But they also found some positive momentum on Thursday, adding to their gains after BB&T said that it would increase its dividend, dismissing an analyst’s prediction that the North Carolina bank would do just the opposite. BB&T overturned early losses to climb 0.1 per cent to $24.35, while Fifth Third recovered 5.3 per cent to $9.75.Industrials proved robust, as transport stocks helped them shake off the poor macroeconomic data.A number of rail companies have given warnings that flooding in the Midwest of the US will dent earnings, most recently Burlington Northern Santa Fe, but analysts and investors remain positive over the long-term outlook for the sector.Burlington shares added 2.3 per cent to $105.55 while peers Union Pacific and CSX climbed 2.6 per cent to $77.80 and 3.3 per cent to $66.34 respectively.In earnings news, Circuit City Stores, the electronics retailer that put itself up for sale last month, disappointed investors by reporting a loss of $164.8m and revenue down 7.4 per cent to $2.3bn. Circuit shares fell 1.7 per cent to $3.98.Better than expected second-quarter results from Carnival, the cruise line company, a rally in oversold stocks in the staples sector and a $5 drop in oil prices helped keep consumer-facing stocks well above water.Carnival rose 5.4 per cent to $36.84 and Tyson Foods added 5.8 per cent to $14.47.Technology stocks were among the biggest gainers, benefiting from tumbling oil prices, which may ease strains on global economic growth. Microsoft rose 1.7 per cent to $28.93, Intel 2.6 per cent $22.85 and IBM 0.7 per cent to $125.02.Broadcom, the maker of chips for Nintendo’s Wii video-game console, rose 7.6 per cent to $27.22 after analysts at Lehman Brothers said second-quarter earnings will get a boost off higher demand.Energy was the only sector to close in the red.ExxonMobil dropped 2.3 per cent to $85.79 while ConocoPhillips fell 1.6 per cent to $93.66.
139;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-06-18T20:34:48Z;US stocks fall as oil prices surge;;US stocks fell for a second session on Wednesday as oil prices surged in late trading while poor results from FedEx underscored the challenges of rising energy prices and crumbling profitability facing the broader economy and equity markets.FedEx said it had lost $241m in the fourth quarter after rising fuel costs and a writedown on FedEx Kinko, its copy centre unit, took their toll. The company’s outlook statement for 2009 was also downbeat.The results will further heighten fears about the impact of elevated oil prices on the wider economy.The parcel delivery firm is often seen as a bellwether because its business depends on the levels of activity in the economy.FedEx shares fell 2.1 per cent to $82.60 while rival UPS lost 2.3 per cent to $65.80, dragging the industrials sector down 1 per cent.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said profit dropped 57 per cent in the second quarter due to weak performances at its trading and investment banking units. The stock initially fell as much as 7.8 per cent, weighing on sentiment, only to swing back into the black in late trading.Still, the rally had little effect on the broader financial sector.On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs undermined market sentiment, in spite of posting better-than-expected results, after its analysts warned that US banks might have to raise as much as $65bn in additional capital to shore up balance sheets weakened by the mortgage crisis.As if to confirm those predictions, Fifth Third Bancorp said on Wednesday that it would raise $2bn by selling shares and assets to shore up its balance sheet after nine quarters of declining profit. The Ohio-based bank will also cut its dividend.Morgan added 0.5 per cent to $40.80, Goldman rose 1.9 per cent to $182.77 but Fifth Third slumped 27.3 per cent to $9.26.The S&P 500 financials sector slipped 1.2 per cent while the KBW banking index hit a six-year low.By the close, the S&P 500 was down 1 per cent at 1,337.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 1.1 per cent to 12,029.06, hitting a three-month low, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,429.71.On Tuesday, equity markets ended a weak three-day rally, led lower by the financial sector and economic data that triggered further worries about inflation and the housing market.Regional bank shares were sold particularly hard after some negative analyst comments. That trend continued on Wednesday as Fifth Third’s capital-raising weighed on the sector.SunTrust Banks fell 9 per cent to $36.95, Regions Financial dropped 10.4 per cent to $11.40 while Huntington Bancshares slipped 9.5 per cent to $5.52.The FedEx results cast a pall over equity markets and by the end of the day, all 10 leading industrial groups on the S&P 500 retreated into the red.A rise in oil prices did little to help, and the consumer discretionary and staples sectors were among the leading fallers, dropping 1.9 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively.Carmakers led the way down after analysts predicted that US vehicle sales could slump to their lowest in more than 15 years this month as buyers shun the gas-guzzling vehicles that are their bread and butter. General Motors lost 5.9 per cent to $14.89 while Ford slid 5.8 per cent to $6.22.Tyson Foods, the chicken producer, also fell back, slumping 8.2 per cent to $13.68 after Fitch cut its debt to non-investment grade.In other corporate news, MF Global, the broker of exchange-traded futures contracts, tumbled 41 per cent to $7.83 after it said revenues would come in below analysts’ estimates. It added that it planned to sell shares to pay down debt.There were bright spots. Union Pacific said in the week that flooding in the Midwest had disrupted services and damaged its infrastructure – it estimated that the weather would trim second-quarter earnings. However, its shares still rose 4.6 per cent to $75.82 on Wednesday following an upbeat report from Morgan Stanley said rising productivity would offset higher oil prices and boost profit.Peer CSX added 1.3 per cent to $64.20 while trucking company YRC Worldwide added 5.4 per cent to $17.68 after reaffirming its second- quarter guidance.
140;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-06-11T21:40:15Z;UK fund set to escape Cfius probe;;The US Treasury is unlikely to pursue a request by senators to investigate an attempt by the Children’s Investment Fund, a British hedge fund, to replace some members of the board of the rail operator CSX.Snehal Amin, a partner at the fund (TCI), said in an interview with the Financial Times that the fund’s attorney had since January been in contact with Cfius, the committee that investigates foreign deals. The attorney had answered questions about the deal and offered to make TCI partners available to the committee.But in a sign that the Treasury is unlikely to seek an investigation, the department has not requested a meeting or indicated that the hedge fund should submit the transaction for formal review.TCI’s comments come after six senators, led by Indiana Democrat Evan Bayh, pressed for Cfius to investigate the fund’s acquisition of what they called a “dominant minority” of CSX shares because of concerns that the deal would give “unknown [foreign] investors” control of critical US infrastructure.“We don’t want to take part in trying to politicise this and drag Cfius, a serious body with important responsibilities, into this. We don’t want to clog up the Cfius system with a filing, just for the sake of public relations,” Mr Amin said.TCI’s attempt to place its own directors on CSX’s board is not the first time a foreign-based hedge fund has sought to gain more influence over a US company’s management and decisions. But the battle, which now involves a group of influential legislators seeking to protect CSX from the hedge fund, is being closely watched in Washington.One influential legislator said he was not ready to rise to CSX’s defence.Barney Frank, the Democratic chairman of the powerful House financial services committee, told the FT he was sceptical of allegations by other legislators that TCI’s proxy fight might represent a threat to national security and should be investigated.Mr Frank, a Massachusetts congressman, said he was disinclined to “protect” CSX because of a tussle between Massachusetts lawmakers and the company over a commuter rail line from Boston to New Bedford.“At this point CSX is being so unreasonable, maybe some new group would be more reasonable,” Mr Frank said. “I’m not looking at it with an open mind right now.”If the Treasury, which chairs Cfius, agrees to the senators’ demand and opens an investigation, it risks setting a dangerous precedent and making the committee look like a political tool to be used by US companies seeking to stave off fights with non-US hedge funds.The Treasury must also, however, show it is sensitive to national security concerns in Congress or risk a congressional backlash in an election year. TCI’s proxy fight has become a pet issue for Lou Dobbs, one of the leading proponents of US protectionism and a top anchor on CNN, the television news networkUnder current rules Cfius can investigate investments in sensitive US assets by non-US companies if they constituted a “change in control”.TCI says it is not seeking to take over CSX and has sent a letter to the senators stipulating it would not compromise US security.The Treasury said on Wednesday: “Whether Cfius does or does not meet with any particular company is not indicative of whether any matter is or may be before the committee.”One Democratic staffer involved in the fight to force a review said that the senators were not passing judgment on whether the deal should be approved by Cfius or not.“We thought it would be a good test case for the new critical infrastructure standard,” the person said, referring to regulatory proposals that state Cfius may review takeovers of assets that are so vital to the US that their incapacity would have a debilitating impact on national security.
141;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-06-11T20:40:57Z;Wall St falls led by financials;;Wall Street fell sharply on Wednesday as financials resumed their relentless downward path and technology stocks came under heavy selling pressure after a key industry group cut its sales outlook for semi­conductors.In the background, oil prices jumped more than $5 a barrel, taking the momentum out of Tuesday’s shallow rally in consumer-facing shares. The consumer discretionary sector fell 2.2 per cent while the homebuilder sub-sector fell 8 per cent to within touching distance of a seven-year low.The leading fallers, however, were financial stocks, which dropped 3.3 per cent, giving up recent fragile gains and suggesting that the sector has yet to find a solid bottom amid a steady trickle of bad news.Technology stocks followed close behind, slipping 2.4 per cent after the Semiconductor Industry Association said sales will grow less rapidly than expected this year as competition drives down prices, particularly for memory chips.Nine of the 10 leading industry sectors were in the red, dragging the S&P 500 index down 1.7 per cent to 1,335.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.7 per cent to 12,083.69. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2 per cent to 2,394.01.The tone on Wall Street has perceptibly darkened over the past few weeks as investors cope with bad news from financials and look ahead to rising inflation, weak consumer spending and a prolonged period of depressed earnings.While the S&P 500 posted monthly gains of 1.1 per cent and 4.8 per cent in April and May, so far in June the benchmark index is down 4.6 per cent.Scott Armiger, a vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust, said: “We were thinking that you would see some signs of expansion in the second half, and now it seems that it is going to be a long, hot summer and perhaps we won’t start to recover until next year.”Financials reprised their role as the villains of the piece on Wednesday and have fallen in all but two sessions in June. The sector is down 23.8 per cent this year.Washington Mutual, First Horizon and Huntington Bancshares fell 9.3 per cent to $6.06, 6 per cent to $8.27 and 6.5 per cent to $6.92 respectively. The banks have some of the highest exposures to home equity loans, which some analysts see as the next front in the ongoing credit crisis.Investment banks also took a beating as Lehman Brothers fell a 13.6 per cent to $23.75, dragging the sector down 5.3 per cent. It was followed by Merrill Lynch, down 6.6 per cent to $35.46. Matthew Albrecht, an equity analyst with S&P, said: “Preliminary results from Lehman Brothers should remind investors that this group is not out of the woods regarding mortgage and bridge loan exposure, and risk governance remains in focus.”Industrials came under pressure after UBS rated Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the railway company, a “short-term sell”, suggesting rising fuel prices may impact second-quarter earnings. Burlington dropped 7 per cent to $103.77, dragging down peers Union Pacific and CSX, which slipped 5.7 per cent to $74.10 and 4 per cent to $63.60 respectively. CSX is in the middle of a messy proxy battle with British hedge fund The Children’s Investment Fund.Energy stocks were the sole gainers amid the broader malaise, following oil prices higher. ExxonÂ­Mobil rose 0.8 per cent to $88.61 and ConocoPhillips added 1.3 per cent to $94.08.Materials stocks fell in spite of some positive momentum for gold focused shares. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, for example, rose 0.6 per cent to $120.09.Gains for the broader sector were swamped, however, after JPMorgan downgraded Alcoa from “overweight” to “neutral”, suggesting that the aluminium producer would likely not be a take­over target. Alcoa dropped 8 per cent to $39.32.In technology, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel were among the leading fallers, losing 6.3 per cent to $6.96 and 3.8 per cent to $21.81 respectively.Amerigroup, the managed healthcare provider, fell 14.1 per cent to $23.36. It suspended its annual profit forecast as higher-than-expected claims forced it to renegotiate rates with the state of Tennessee.Meanwhile, Staples succeeded in its efforts to buy Corporate Express, a Dutch peer, with a revised $2.7bn offer. Staples shares rose 5.3 per cent to $24.38.
142;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-06-11T02:47:17Z;China hits out at US ‘protectionism’;;Chinese officials have accused the US of harbouring “hostility” to investments by foreign government-controlled entities and of drifting towards “investment protectionism” in proposed regulations that set out how cross-border deals ought to be vetted.The Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission said in a letter to the US Treasury that the proposed regulations left “too much room for interpretation” by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or Cfius, an inter-agency panel chaired by the Treasury, and left the body with “excessive authority”.The proposals were also criticised by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. “This discriminating provision apparently tilts toward investment protectionism and is tinged with the colour of politicising economic issues. It therefore stands as a grave impediment for the normal course of investment in the US,” it said.The letters, sent during a public comment period on the proposed rules, come one week before US and Chinese authorities prepare to meet for a fresh round of their strategic economic dialogue in Annapolis, Maryland. Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, said on Tuesday the talks would include discussions about bilateral investment and how to “counter protectionist pressures”.In a sign that the US had its own gripes about Chinese regulations, Mr Paulson added: “We will also discuss the concerns of American companies that China’s investment regulations are opaque and seem in many ways to be designed to favour China’s ‘national champions’.”If adopted, the proposed US regulations would clarify a grey area of existing law by making it clear that Cfius could open national security investigations of foreign investments in sensitive US assets, even if they fell below a threshold of 10 per cent, if the investments constituted a “change in control”.The proposed rules, in effect, encourage foreign minority investors to forgo certain rights that might appear to give them control of a company – such as acquiring seats on a board or the right to fire and hire management – in order to avoid a national security review.The proposed rules were also criticised by the Association of British Insurers, which said they sent a signal that the US “is not genuinely open to inward investment”.The ABI focused on two issues: that Cfius could raise concerns about deals that were “wider than genuine national security concerns” and that the regulations would lead to bona fide investors disclaiming rights they would otherwise be entitled to.The US Treasury said on Tuesday that it would consider all submissions. It has previously argued that, if adopted, the rules would clarify Cfius procedures and safeguard national security while reinforcing an open investment policy.The China Investment Corporation, which holds minority investments in Blackstone and Morgan Stanley, agreed with that assessment, saying the proposed rules helped “clarify issues” that were previously ambiguous and served as a “useful roadmap” for potential investors.But at the heart of criticism by both Chinese regulators and the Chinese ministry of commerce were accusations that the proposed rules discriminated against companies with state ownership, a big source of China’s outbound investment.…………………………………Foreign investors face political backlashThe danger that deals involving foreign investors may become politicised was highlighted last week when six US senators asked Hank Paulson, the Treasury secretary, to initiate a Cfius investigation into the alleged acquisition of a controlling stake in rail operator CSX by a “dominant minority” of foreign investors, write Stephanie Kirchgaessner and Robert Wright.The senators, headed by Democrat Evan Bayh, believe The Children’s Investment Fund (TCI) is behind the share buying. Mr Bayh, a potential running mate to Barack Obama, described the Cayman Island hedge fund as “aggressive” and “invisible to government regulators”.“The investment funds being used lack transparency, leaving the ownership and control of critical US infrastructure in the hands of unknown investors,” the senators said.Snehal Amin, a partner at TCI, denied the fund was seeking to take over CSX.The rail operator, which had lobbied the senators, was criticised by the head of the Organization for International Investment, which represents foreign companies in the US.“CSX is using a serious national security process as a public relations prop in a run-of-the-mill proxy fight. TCI doesn’t have any control of CSX,” said Todd Malan.
143;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-06-05T20:32:33Z;Disclosure demands build up steam;;Demands on hedge funds to lift the lid on their secret holdings in companies are growing as executives fight back against activists while regulators and traditional investors worry about orderly markets.The latest pressure comes in the US, where CSX, the rail operator, is suing The Children’s Investment Fund and 3G Capital Partners, claiming they used derivatives as part of a plan to “influence control of CSX by acquiring a large stake in CSX while evading the reporting requirements of the securities laws”.The case revolves around cash-settled equity swaps, derivatives very similar to contracts for difference used to gain economic exposure to a company without buying the shares.TCI has won the support of the main global derivatives trade body, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which is worried that the judge could change the rules if he backed the CSX view that the swaps should be disclosed as though they were beneficial interests in the shares they reference.In an amicus brief to the court ISDA warned that if CSX’s interpretation of the rules was accepted it “would create substantial uncertainties in the securities and derivatives markets and could chill legitimate and desirable commercial activity”.The Securities and Exchange Commission also intervened this week. Its Division of Corporation Finance told the judge that requiring disclosure would “create significant uncertainties for investors who have used equity swaps in accordance with accepted market practices understood to be based on reasonably well-settled law”.But outside the US, transparency advocates have made progress in both the UK and Switzerland.More disclosure appears likely in the UK – where contracts for difference have boomed – as a result of a review by the Financial Services Authority due to conclude next month.“It is an orderly markets question,” says Peter Montagnon, head of investment affairs at the Association of British Insurers, which has been campaigning for a more open approach.“We need to know more because of the size and impact of all this on the market.”He also argues that it is “perfectly fair and reasonable that companies should know who their significant owners are”.Hedge funds and other activists like derivatives because they allow significant holdings to be built up before they go public, which for big funds typically prompts a jump in the share price as others expect a fight. If they were to gain holdings purely by buying shares that jump would make their stake-building more expensive.However, hedge funds, backed by ISDA, argue that there is no reason to disclose holdings of derivatives that give them no right to vote and cannot directly be converted into shares – even though they can make stake-building easier by hedging the risk of share price rises.“People who complain about it tend to be management of companies who don’t like activist shareholders,” says François Barthelemy, an investor in activist hedge funds at F&C Partners in London.If the judge in the CSX case rules that disclosure is required, it will prompt a flurry of filings by hedge funds and others using cash-settled equity swaps, most of whom simply make bets on share price moves with no plans ever to buy the shares.In the UK, the FSA has estimated that requiring disclosure of derivative holdings of more than 5 per cent would cost investors up to £50m.It has indicated a preference for allowing derivative holdings to be kept secret as long as the bank providing the contract cannot be pressured into voting the underlying shares.All derivative positions of more than 1 per cent in UK companies subject to a bid have to be disclosed under Takeover Panel rules, something the ABI cites as evidence that disclosure does not harm the market.Switzerland has also changed its rules to require disclosure of derivative holdings, following a long-running battle between London-based Laxey Partners and Implenia, Switzerland’s biggest building services group.The Swiss Federal Banking Commission has recommended Laxey face criminal action for building a 22 per cent stake through stakes it says were “parked” with banks to avoid disclosure. Laxey denies it breached the old rules.Richard Metcalfe, head of policy at ISDA, says requiring disclosure of derivative positions would confuse the market by making it look as though the holders could vote, even though they cannot.“It is vital to maintain a distinction that is based on the true legal situation.” he said. “Such regulation risks blurring that distinction.”For TCI, pressure is exactly what it wants to exert.Together with 3G, it is trying to secure five of the 12 seats on the CSX board, where it wants to change company strategy – a threat that has put it in conflict with some politicians in Congress who have warned of national security risks if the railway were to be under the control of “foreigners”.
144;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-05-27T19:25:50Z;A letter to TCI;;Dear Mr Hohn,As investors, we have applauded your ability to take on corporate giants and deliver returns. We are, however, concerned about The Children’s Investment Fund’s activity in the public utilities space. Look at that tricky court case over CSX, the US railroad, and the continuing tussles with J-Power in Japan.Let us be clear: as long-term investors, we never expected a quick return on the Japanese utility (though the small gains on the stake, bought over the course of 2005-06, are disappointing). We support plans to improve returns by upping debt and dividends and slashing cross-shareholdings. But may we humbly suggest that further efforts to force change on an unyielding management might prove as fruitless as the attempt to lift your stake to 20 per cent earlier this year? It was a safe bet that, in a world where French yoghurt and American ports are off limits, Tokyo might frustrate a big foreign holding in a company building a nuclear plant.As you repeatedly remind J-Power, we are all in this to maximise returns. We are, however, a little unclear as to how your latest gambit, to take stakes in companies that have friendly stakes in J-Power, achieves this for us, your investors. Indeed, there is an eerie echo that TCI is replicating J-Power’s cross-shareholdings. These positions are unlikely to prompt a change of heart at the utility and they may well prove a drag on our funds. Mizuho Financial, Japan’s biggest subprime casualty, expects to earn much the same this year as it did in 2006. As for Kajima Corp – unfortunately, few of us had even heard of this $4bn construction company – earnings per share are expected to almost halve this year. We do at least trust these acquisitions were made before the March rebound in share prices, since when both stocks are up by over 45 per cent.Post and read comments on this Lex
145;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-05-19T20:52:22Z;Signs of hope on economy lift Wall St;;"US stocks pared gains in late trading on Monday but held on to close at their highest levels since early January after new data suggested that the US economy may skirt outright recession.The Conference Board’s index of leading indicators, which is used to predict business cycle peaks and troughs, rose marginally for a second straight month in April, beating consensus expectations of a 0.1 per cent fall.Industrial stocks added 0.5 per cent thanks to the news and some bullish analyst reports; energy stocks rose 1 per cent.Technology stocks initally surged on a series of analysts’ upgrades. But in mid-afternoon they dropped precipitously after downbeat comments from the chief executive of a leading chip company, denting the strong run on the S&P.Financial stocks followed a similar trajectory to end the day down 0.5 per cent.Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets, said: “This morning most of the major indices broke through their 200-day moving averages and when they started getting a little weak I think you saw a bit of profit taking as people wanted to lock in their recent gains.”The benchmark S&P 500 index eventually closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,426.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 13,028.16, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,516.09.The S&P 500 index has now largely recovered from its dismal start to the year, and is down less than 3 per cent for the year to date.However, some remain cautious about the durability of the rally, pointing to surveys showing consumer confidence at generational lows and more fundamental, unresolved problems affecting the US economy.Tim Drayson, an analyst with ABN Amro, said: “Financial markets appear to believe the worst is over. I disagree and think the deepening housing correction and oil prices at $125 a barrel are increasing the risk of a full-blown recession later in the year.”Indeed, the decline in the housing sector continues to take its toll on related companies. Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, said first-quarter profit fell 18 per cent to $607m as the housing crisis curtailed consumers’ appetite for fixing up their homes. The company also forecast more declines in the full year and its share price slipped 2.6 per cent to $24.25.Amazon, however, was the leading gainer in the sector, rising 7.6 per cent to $82.29 after Goldman Sachs put the internet retailer on its conviction “buy” list.Goldman also raised its six-month price target from $75 to $98, saying the company would continue to expand revenue and sustain better margins than offline peers.In technology, stocks swung into the red in the early afternoon when the chief executive of SanDisk said sales to makers of consumer products were “soft” last month.SanDisk slumped 7.5 per cent to $30.02 in short order and was followed down by Apple which lost 2.2 per cent to $183.6.Still, so far this quarter, technology stocks have rallied about 13 per cent, a trend some observers expect to continue.Analysts at Merrill Lynch said: “The recent advance is showing the sector is finally being rewarded for its stable and diversified growth, results and prospects.”In the industrials sector, transport and aerospace companies made particular headway. CSX added 2.1 per cent to $66.94 while Boeing rose rose 2.2 per cent to $87.07.Yahoo remains a reliable spark of intrigue and its pas de deux with would-be acquirer Microsoft continued this week. On Sunday, the software group said it was looking into a limited agreement with Yahoo. Yahoo has been under pressure to return to talks with Microsoft since Carl Icahn, the billionaire activist investor, amassed a big stake and threatened to try to replace its board should it fail to do so. Microsoft’s shares lost
1.8 per cent to $29.46, while Yahoo’s shares rose 0.1 per cent to $27.68.In financials, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley were among the biggest fallers, dropping 2.3 per cent to $47.71 and 2.1 per cent to $46.20 respectively.In energy, Chevron advanced 1.8 per cent to $102.20, while Exxon Mobil climbed 1.8 per cent to $94.36."
146;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-04-18T20:48:26Z;Wall St rises sharply ending week higher;;"Wall Street stocks cantered towards the weekend break, climbing for a fourth straight session on Friday after Citigroup posted first-quarter results that were worse than some expected but better than many feared and Google impressed investors with resilient earnings.The biggest US bank posted its second quarterly loss in a row on writedowns of about $12bn. Revenue fell by almost half, but that was better than a number of analysts had forecast.During the past year Citigroup shares have lost more than half their value amid a slew of writedowns, but on Friday they clawed back 4.5 per cent to $25.11 and were 7.5 per cent ahead for the week. Other financial stocks rallied on the news. Bank of America rose 2.9 per cent to $38.56 and Lehman Brothers added 4.3 per cent to $45.50. The S&P 500 financials index gained 1.8 per cent on the day and 5.2 per cent for the week.Google also made ground. Overnight, the internet search company delivered revenues and earnings well ahead of estimates for the first quarter thanks to overseas growth. Google surged 20 per cent to $539.41 as a number of analysts significantly raised target prices for the stock, citing the company’s ability to skip past signs of a US slowdown.Stocks eased off their highs towards the close but the benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 1.8 per cent at 1,390.34 on the day and 4.3 per cent ahead for the week – its best finish since February.The Nasdaq Composite added 2.6 per cent to 2,402.97 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.8 per cent to 12,849.36.Positive earnings reports from a number of large US corporations this week helped soothe fears a US economic slowdown would hit profits, sparking a broad-based market rally and sending measures of volatility to their lowest levels this year.Technology companies have led the way. On Tuesday Intel, the semiconductor titan, offered a ray of hope to the beleaguered sector with solid results and upbeat forecasts for the full year.That news was followed by sturdy earnings reports from Ebay and IBM. Over the week Intel rose 6.2 per cent to $22.55, Ebay added 2.7 per cent to $31.71 and IBM rose 7.2 per cent to $124.40.Industrial stocks found momentum this week on the back of strong earnings
from conglomerates such as United Technologies, CSX, and Textron.Those results reassured investors that diversified international companies can find growth abroad to offset soft domestic markets, and they helped overturn losses in the sector triggered by disappointing results from industrial bellwether General Electric last Friday.Upbeat results from Honeywell International and Caterpillar on Friday bolstered that rally, pushing an index of industrial stocks up 4.7 per cent for the week.Honeywell added 6.3 per cent to $60.99 on Friday while Caterpillar shares rose 8.5 per cent to $85.28.During the week UTC, CSX and Textron climbed
4.3 per cent to $72.51, 8.8 per cent to $61.24 and 6.7 per cent to $60.97 respectively.In spite of a series of massive losses and writedowns begun by Wachovia on Monday and capped by Citigroup on Friday, financial stocks for the most part performed well this week.The run began on Tuesday after a handful of regional banks, including Regions Financial and M&T Bank, cheered investors with
better-than-expected results.Those results were followed by mostly inline earnings reports from JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch.Investors responded positively, sending JPMorgan shares up 7.6 per cent to $45.76 and Merrill shares up 8.4 per cent to $47.35 for the week. But analysts were wary, pointing to “problem” assets, a slowing economy and the rising costs of funding as potential headwinds.Analyst are also sceptical about equity market resilience in the face of macro- economic data showing weakening growth, rising inflation and continued distress in the capital markets.“To us, the Pollyanna-ish calm expressed by the equity market relative to the grim reality displayed in numerous credit-market indicators is a source of constant difficulty,” said Rob Carnell of INGMany believe expectations of about 7 per cent earnings growth from S&P 500 companies excluding financials remain far too optimistic.The sector for which forecasts remain highest however was the leading gainer during the week. Energy stocks rallied strongly, up 7.7 per cent, on the back of record high oil prices.BJ Services and Baker Hughes led the sector, climbing 16.3 per cent to $33.21 and 12.5 per cent to $80.80 over the week."
147;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-04-16T20:39:03Z;Wall St rallies on robust results;;US stocks rallied for a second session on Wednesday after JPMorgan Chase, Coca-Cola and other leading companies reported robust results, cheering investors after a lacklustre opening to the 2008 first-quarter earnings season.JPMorgan said profit halved and it took substantial writedowns but the results were roughly in line with expectations and the shares climbed after Jamie Dimon, chief executive, said the credit crisis may be nearing an end.The third-biggest US bank has proven to be one of the more resilient institutions amid recent financial markets turmoil, allowing it to profit from the distress of competitors. Over the past year, its share price has fallen by 11 per cent compared with a 30 per cent fall for the S&P 500 financials index. JPMorgan rose 6.7 per cent to $44.96.Wednesday’s results should go some way towards reassuring investors that other banks about to release their earnings could at least hit reduced analyst targets.Merrill Lynch, which reports on Thursday, rose 3.6 per cent to $44.89 and Citigroup, which reports on Friday, climbed 2.8 per cent to $23.44. The S&P 500 index of financial stocks added 2.3 per cent.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola said first-quarter profit and revenues jumped, thanks to strong trading in Latin America and Russia. It also benefited from the earnings-enhancing effect of a weaker dollar. Shares in Coca-Cola, which have gained about 18 per cent in the last year as investors have looked to consumer staples for a safe haven, added 0.1 per cent to $60.99.The positive results sparked a wider market rally that gained momentum during the day. By the close the benchmark S&P 500 index was 2.3 per cent higher at 1,364.66, its biggest gain since the start of the month. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.8 per cent to 2,350.11 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.1 per cent to 12,619.27.“There is a lot of cash on the sidelines [with investors] desperate for good news so they can get to work and start making some real returns,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim.com, an online brokerage.“Fund managers cannot continue to have 2 per cent 10-year rates, so what we are seeing today is that at any hint of good news, money comes pouring into the market.”That enthusiasm was barely dented by new data showing that inflation rose in March, potentially limiting consumer spending, while housing starts and permits fell to their lowest levels since 1991.In fact, homebuilders rose on the hope that reduced supply might begin to dent the glut of housing stock depressing prices. KB Homes added 6.6 per cent to $24.41 while Lennar climbed 6.3 per cent to $18.50.A vigorous forecast from Intel, the technology sector bellwether that reported after the close on Tuesday, helped maintain positive momentum overnight.Intel shares climbed 6.1 per cent to $22.18 while an index of technology stocks, battered in recent weeks by a series of warnings from major manufacturers, recovered 3.1 per cent.IBM rose 2.8 per cent to $120.47 in after hours trade after it posted big increases in first-quarter profits.Wednesday’s results may go some way to combat the market’s disappointment at earnings misses and reduced forecasts from blue chips Alcoa, UPS and GE last week. The picture now is a mixed one, with pockets of resilience set against a bleak backdrop of a faltering US economy.Amid the broader market rally, the industrials sector was particularly strong, buoyed by sturdy results from CSX, the railroad company. CSX climbed 3.7 per cent to $59.89 while fellow railway company Burlington Northern Santa Fe rose 4.9 per cent to $99.30.The leading sector on the S&P 500, however, was materials.US Steel rose 6 per cent to $155.37 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gained 7.3 per cent to $113.22. Monsanto hit a record high, gaining 7.2 per cent to $131.54.Oil prices, which touched record highs, and lower-than-expected inventories of petroleum products also lifted related stocks.Tesoro jumped 7.7 per cent to $27.99 while Exxon Mobil advanced 2.3 per cent to $92.89.
148;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-03-17T19:09:26Z;CSX battle moves to courts;;The battle for CSX moved to the courts when the US rail operator sued two hedge funds which are trying to shake up the company, a high-profile fight that has already sparked political intervention.CSX accused The Children’s Investment Fund (TCI), the London activist hedge fund run by Chris Hohn, and partner 3G Capital Partners, of violating disclosure laws in building up a stake through swap contracts.The lawsuit, filed in New York, follows assaults on activists using derivatives to build up undisclosed stakes in companies in Europe.However, TCI hit back by accusing CSX of using the case as an excuse to “manipulate” the board proxy fight by delaying the annual meeting. The hedge funds are trying to elect five new directors, including Mr Hohn, to the 12-person board. Last week they filed a preliminary proxy statement in which they also said they wanted changes to company bylaws.“It is unfortunate that CSX has chosen to manipulate the governance and board election process by delaying the annual meeting and filing baseless claims,” TCI said. “These allegations are wholly without merit.”CSX – which put out bullish earnings forecasts – claimed in its lawsuit that TCI used swap agreements to “evade” disclosure requirements, and that TCI’s statements were “materially misleading” because banks on the other side of the swaps intended to vote as TCI wished.TCI and 3G have disclosed an 8.7 per cent stake in CSX, with another 11.5 per cent held through swaps.The battle over CSX has attracted concern on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers quizzing TCI last week over what some called “aggressive” investment tactics they argued could lower investment by the railway. Some also expressed worries about “foreign” funds buying key parts of the country’s infrastructure, although TCI partner Snehal Amin told legislators the hedge funds were “not mysterious foreigners” but Britons and Americans.The use of contracts for difference, a derivative similar to a swap, has been controversial with European companies. The Swiss banking regulator this month recommended criminal action against Laxey Partners, a London hedge fund, for “parking” stakes in a company with banks in order to avoid disclosure – charges Laxey claims are politically motivated. Switzerland has changed the law since Laxey took its stake.CSX said it would raise its quarterly dividend by 20 per cent and spend $3bn on a share buy-back as it predicted stronger profit increases than analysts had expected. CSX shares rose 1.9 per cent to $49.91 in afternoon trading.
149;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-03-06T01:23:02Z;Washington concern at CSX board tussle;;Lawmakers in Washington on Wednesday expressed deep reservations about attempts by The Children’s Investment Fund, the London-based hedge fund, to increase control of US rail operator CSX, suggesting the move would threaten public safety and put US infrastructure in foreign hands.Legislators’ criticism of TCI, aired before the House transportation committee, included claims that the firm’s “aggressive” investment tactics would lead to a decline in capital investment at CSX.TCI, one of CSX’s largest investors, has been locked in a boardroom battle with the US rail operator since last year, when it tried to replace five of the company’s 12-member board with its own slate of directors. The decision by lawmakers to step into the fray could bode well for CSX, which may benefit from general suspicion about hedge funds in some quarters in Washington and resistance to non-US ownership of infrastructure.James Oberstar, the Democratic chairman of the committee, compared the hedge fund’s activities with Carl Icahn’s takeover of TWA more than two decades ago, pointing out the activist investor’s failure to abide by commitments he gave Congress before he took over the now-defunct airline. Peter DeFazio, another Democrat, said: “We don’t need those kinds of characters involved in our railroads.”Snehal Amin, a partner at TCI, said on Wednesday the company was not seeking to control CSX. “We are not mysterious foreigners – we are Americans and Britons and the majority of our investors are US institutions,” Mr Amin said.TCI’s position was boosted by Charles Nottingham, chairman of the Surface Transportation Board. “Given [STB’s] board’s ability to address concerns that may arise in the future, I would not recommend doing anything…to deter needed investment in the industry,” he said.
150;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-02-26T23:20:48Z;TCI agrees to CSX hearing;;Politicians will enter the increasingly bitter feud between one of London’s most powerful hedge funds and CSX, one of the biggest US railway operators, next week when The Children’s Investment Fund faces scrutiny in Washington.The voluntary appearance of TCI, the second-largest shareholder in CSX, before the House of Representatives subcommittee on railroads has the potential to become a highly politicised step in the attempt by CSX to resist the hedge fund’s demands.TCI founding partner Snehal Amin is expected to face questions about foreign ownership of US infrastructure, a potential minefield for London-based TCI, as well as its secrecy and its questioning of capital spending at CSX.The subcommittee hearing, called to discuss railway investment, will also hear from Michael Ward, the chairman and chief executive of CSX. TCI began its campaign to split the chairman and chief executive roles in October, accusing management of a “cavalier” attitude to risk and “undisciplined” spending.It has proposed replacing five of the 12 directors with its own nominees, including Chris Hohn, founder of TCI.CSX has powerful allies in the US capitol and has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to lawmakers in Congress, including Corrine Brown, the chairman of the subcommittee who will lead the hearing on March 5. Ms Brown represents the third congressional district of Florida, home to CSX headquarters.“My boss doesn’t want to get into dictating how companies [constitute their boards] but the the idea that investors would be able to take over a board and make decisions that most would see as detrimental to the industry …is concerning,” said Ms Brown’s legislative director, Nick Martinelli.“When you get into foreign ownership, then you start facing similar issues with the Dubai Port management issue,” he said, referring to the 2006 congressional backlash that scuppered attempts by a state-owned Dubai company to own five US port terminals.“The chairwoman has concerns that they are an unknown, unnamed hedge fund who would have control of CSX.”CSX said it was “looking forward to discussing key issues” with members of Congress.TCI declined to comment. But Mr Hohn is no stranger to the mix of politics and business, having been labelled a “locust” by German politicians when he successfully took on Deutsche Börse, scuppering its efforts to buy the London Stock Exchange.The CSX assault is the first activism by TCI in the US, although it is also active in Japan, where it has taken on several companies including J-Power.According to one person familiar with TCI’s views it will tell the subcommittee that it has a majority of US investors and note that it is run from London, as well as pointing out that five directors would not give it control – and that four are US citizens and independent of TCI.“The reason we are putting these guys on [the board] is they bring 50 years of railroad experience to a board that has zero experience right now,” the person said. “This is our chance to make things public and clear the record.”TCI may be helped in efforts to gain public support if it highlights its charitable links, as Mr Hohn is one of the most generous philanthropists in the UK thanks to his donations to the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation. The charity had $1.4bn last summer, secured by a combination of a cut of the hedge fund’s fees, donations by partners of the fund and its investments in the fund.
151;CSX;CSX Corp;2008-01-23T07:24:08Z;Management: Leaders and responsibility;;Harvard Business School celebrates its centenary this year. We can look forward to a series of grand events, much back-slapping and frequent blowing of its own trumpet. But how energetically will the great school salute the achievements of perhaps its most famous alumnus of all, George W. Bush (class of ’75)? It seems unlikely that the outgoing US president will be claimed as a poster boy for the Master of Business Administration (MBA) qualification any time soon.Maybe this Bush administration merely represents an embarrassing hiccup in the otherwise increasingly deep and intimate relationship between commerce and elected leaders. The worlds of politics and business inevitably overlap, and collide. What President Dwight D. Eisenhower once labelled the “military-industrial complex”, we might rebrand as “politico-commercial”.Even in this era of (more or less) free markets, trade takes place within the constraints of man-made regulation. Some politicians may remain uninterested in the business of wealth creation, and some business people may be left cold by the idiosyncrasies of democratic politics – but each side has to deal with the other.The smartest actively seek cross-fertilisation. When JP Morgan, the US investment bank, snapped up the newly available former British prime minister Tony Blair earlier this month – to serve as an adviser for an estimated $5m a year – some of the sceptical noises that greeted the news were inspired by simple professional jealousy. Mr Blair had already turned down several offers from commercial organisations, his friends maintained. But he does plan to accept a few more. The ex-prime minister’s access to key figures and his understanding of how geo-political trends are likely to develop make him a highly valuable commodity.Indeed, Mr Blair had long been attracted by the qualities, as he saw them, of successful business leaders. When he wanted to convince the sceptical British electorate in 1996 that his Labour party could be trusted to form a competent government, he turned to his growing body of friends in the business community for inspiration. Encouraged in particular by his contacts with BP, the oil company – a relationship that grew increasingly important as his time in office went on – Mr Blair conceived a series of “performance commitments” that he made to the British people. These commitments, five of them, were printed on a credit-card sized “pledge card”, and carried by Labour party candidates.This was state-of-the-art performance management introduced to the scruffy world of party politics. The message was: do not bother reading our unwieldy, old-fashioned manifesto. Focus on these modest, practical and business-like proposals instead. Vote Labour – or your money back. And in the course of his 10 years in office, Mr Blair continued to seek the insights and experience of business leaders to lead enquiries, policy groups and task forces.George Bush too, when he entered the White House in 2001, appeared determined to make the most of business expertise. His administration has been packed with former corporate executives. His vice-president, Dick Cheney, had been chief executive at Halliburton, the engineering and services company. His first treasury secretary, Paul O’Neill, had been CEO of Alcoa, the aluminium company, while Mr O’Neill’s successor, John Snow, had been CEO of CSX, a transport business. Mr Snow’s successor, Hank Paulson, was CEO of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank. President Bush’s first defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, had been CEO of the pharmaceutical company GD Searle between 1977 and 1985 – before it was bought by Monsanto. Not for nothing was this known as “the CEO administration”.Karl Rove, President Bush’s key adviser, spoke with admiration of his boss’s business-like administrative skills. Gone was the chaos and aimless late-night chat of the Bill Clinton administration. In the Bush era, meetings would start and end on time. Ties would be worn. President Bush is said to be a great believer in Peter Drucker’s now rather dated idea of “management by objectives”, or MBO. “I had read Peter Drucker, but I’d never seen Drucker until I saw Bush in action,” Mr Rove once said in an interview with Atlantic Monthly, the political magazine. President Bush has also revealed how business school influenced his approach to the job. “Harvard gave me the tools and the vocabulary of the business world,” he wrote in his 1999 book A Charge to Keep: My Journey to the White House.In October 2002, before his early departure from the administration, Mr O’Neill visited Harvard Business School. He told the assembled students that much was expected of them. “The world is desperate for the application of what you’re learning here,” he said. “Not only do you have the talent and the tools – you have the obligation.”Today, the worlds of business and politics look towards each other with greater intensity than ever. The theme for this year’s meeting at Davos is “The Power of Collaborative Innovation”. Business and political leaders will look to learn from each other. One session at Davos exemplifies this. It is called: “Rebuilding Brand America: Five Suggestions for the Future President.”And yet both parties to this collaborative conversation should take care. Critics – perhaps we should properly say cynics – will be closely watching what they do. As Professor Henry Mintzberg (no friend of MBA orthodoxy) of Montreal’s McGill Univeristy has said: “Davos: where the people who spend 51 weeks a year creating all our problems take another week to see if they can fix them.”If that sounds harsh, remember these words from President Eisenhower when he gave his farewell address on January 17, 1961: “In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought …The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.”Stefan Stern is the FT’s Management columnist
152;CSX;CSX Corp;2007-11-16T18:15:29Z;CSX launches defence against activists;;The board of CSX Corporation has rebuffed criticism of its management from The Children’s Investment Fund in its first formal response to the activist investor.In a letter to London-based TCI, the board said it “respectfully disagrees” with the hedge fund’s criticism and backed CSX’s performance under the leadership since 2004 of Michael Ward, chairman and chief executive. CSX, one of the US’s largest freight railroads, pointed out that net operating income had nearly doubled over the period.It also defended its own performance against TCI’s accusations that it did too little to encourage better performance from senior managers. “Be assured that this board constantly challenges the CSX management team to improve performance,” members wrote in the letter.The board’s response follows TCI’s publication on October 17 of an open letter accusing CSX of having poor corporate governance, poor profit growth and an insufficiently rigorous approach to allocating investment.The letter was the first public sign of efforts by TCI to achieve a change of direction at CSX. The CSX campaign is TCI’s first against a non-European company. It has previously forced change on ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, and Deutsche Börse, operator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.The board’s letter says operating income for the first 10 months this year was $2.1bn, against $1.06bn during 2004, when Mr Ward was appointed. It also points out that CSX’s operating ratio – the proportion of revenue eaten up by operating costs – has fallen from 86.8 per cent in 2004 to 78.7 per cent in the past 10 months.Mr Ward said the lengthy response showed the board had done a very thorough job of examining TCI’s letter. The company intended to continue strong profits growth in future. It was targeting 15-17 per cent annual growth in earnings per share until 2010, he said.
153;CSX;CSX Corp;2007-11-13T13:39:36Z;Investors flock to railroad recovery;;The recovery in the fortunes of the largest North American railroads has been marked by enthusiasm from three different types of investors - the very long-term, those adept at forcing a quick change of tack and private equity.The biggest name involved is Berkshire Hathaway, the vehicle of Warren Buffett, the legendary investor, which emerged as a major buyer of railroad stocks in May. Buffett’s company has concentrated heavily on BNSF, where it is by now much the biggest shareholder, but it has also taken stakes in Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. All three are seen as having the strong managements Mr Buffett favours.Railroads have been less enthusiastic about the attention of activist investors, often hedge funds. The Children’s Investment Fund, a London-based hedge fund, is now the second-largest shareholder in CSX, whose management it is trying to force to change course, and also holds stakes in Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific. Carl Icahn, the celebrity investor, and Atticus Capital have also taken railroad stakes.The most significant development, meanwhile, could be rising interest from the private equity industry. In July it emerged that one private equity house - Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management - had made a tentative approach to Canadian Pacific, which turned it down. However, private equity firms have bought up several short-line railroads, including the Florida East Coast Railroad, which sold itself to Fortress Investment Group in May for $3.5bn.
154;CSX;CSX Corp;2007-11-12T21:59:05Z;US rail chiefs say new laws will halt investment;;Accelerating investment in US railroads’ capacity could come to a halt if proposed legislation to re-regulate many of the railroads’ prices is brought into force, the chief executives of three of the top five US railroads have warned.The chief executives of CSX Corporation, Union Pacific and BNSF – all among the five large US-based Class I railroads – have told the Financial Times that fewer new investments will be justifiable if any of the four bills to regulate rates being debated in Congress becomes law.Most US rail rates were deregulated in 1980, in response to a financial crisis at many railroads exacerbated by the previous system of federal oversight.Railroads have invested heavily in capacity in recent years following a surge in traffic caused by the growing popularity of coal for power generation, expanding wheat production and growing imports of shipping containers from Asia.The increased demand and need to pay for investments has pushed up many freight rates, although the Association of American Railroads says they remain about half the level they were before rail deregulation in real terms. Railroads plan to invest about $10bn in new capacity this year.However, some rail customers back the bills – which would cap freight rates and increase competition – because they say consolidation has given more operators monopoly power over certain customers.The controversy has fed into a debate about how the government can best encourage increased use of the US’s railroads to relieve pressure on highway networks.Jim Young, chief executive of Union Pacific, the US’s largest railroad by revenue and network size, said he had told legislators that the company would change the size of its network to suit its returns.“I said: ‘The government needs to be careful because you’re making decisions that determine how much business you want moving on the railroads long term,’” Mr Young said. “If they make the wrong decisions and we restrict that growth, they are going to have to figure out how to handle it on the highway.”Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive, said a legislative restriction on earning potential would force capital out of the industry.The only big point of dispute among railroads is over the likelihood that the legislation will succeed.Mr Young said he was taking it seriously, while Michael Ward, chief executive of CSX, said he thought the consequences would be so damaging that the legislation would fail.
155;CSX;CSX Corp;2007-11-12T21:59:05Z;Mergers signal the rise of an all-powerful seven;;A series of mergers during the 1980s and 1990s shaped the structure of North America’s Class I railroads – all those with annual revenue of more than $319.3m – leaving most regions with just two competing operators.BNSF and Union Pacific compete over the western two-thirds of the US, while CSX and Norfolk Southern operate almost exclusively east of the Mississippi. The two Canadian Class Is – Canadian National and Canadian Pacific – have parallel routes from British Columbia to Canada’s main population centres, and substantial US operations.The seventh and smallest Class I – Kansas City Southern – operates mainly in a north-south corridor from the Canadian border through the Midwest into Mexico, where it owns one of the country’s two largest railroads.One of the two competing operators in each region has a history of being stronger than the other, even if the recent surge in traffic is reviving all lines. Just as BNSF’s operating figures have long been better than UP’s, Norfolk Southern has generally had stronger figures than CSX.
156;CSX;CSX Corp;2007-11-12T21:59:05Z;Railroads’ US revival entices investors;;Just four years ago, an economic slowdown like that now under way in the US would have produced long faces and worried expressions at the headquarters of Union Pacific, the US’s largest railroad by annual revenue, or at Burlington Northern and Santa Fe, the number two.This autumn, in spite of a slowdown of consumer demand – which drives railroads’ business carrying maritime containers – and of the housing market – which drives demand for building materials – executives at the two companies are positively buoyant.Omaha, Nebraska-based UP’s third-quarter operating income was a record $1bn, 34 per cent up on the year before, on $4.2bn revenue. Fort Worth, Texas-based BNSF’s income, also $1bn, on $4.07bn revenue, was 9 per cent up on the previous year.The robust performance results from a long-term surge in demand for nearly everything they deliver, from coal to shipping containers and from cars to wheat.The traffic has filled all the spare capacity on many routes and allowed operators to withstand slowdowns like the present one without cutting their rates.In previous economic cycles, the struggle to cover their high fixed costs meant railroads would often cut their rates in bad times to ensure truckers did not take too much of their business. This time the truckers are suffering.The railroads’ revival has provoked interest from many different kinds of investors. Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by Warren Buffett, has taken stakes in several companies, including 17.2 per cent of BNSF, seen as soundly managed.The Children’s Investment Fund, a London-based hedge fund, and Carl Icahn, the activist investor, have concentrated on operators such as CSX, which they see as having the most turnround potential.CSX and UP still have more to do to catch up with the best-performing of the four largest US railroads, Norfolk Southern and BNSF. Of the two largest, BNSF, which competes with UP on key routes in the western US, still enjoys better returns and higher profitability than UP, thanks to its managers’ early spotting of the looming capacity shortage.BNSF had most of its key Los Angeles to Chicago line double-tracked before a sudden surge in container traffic in 2004 that overwhelmed UP’s systems and pushed traffic to BNSF.“We are behind the capacity curve,” admits Jim Young, UP’s chief executive, who blames the problem partly on the former Southern Pacific, which UP took over in 1996 during a consolidation wave that also saw the then Burlington Northern take over the better-maintained Santa Fe.UP is now rushing to double-track the Southern Pacific’s key Los Angeles to Texas Sunset Corridor, whose deficiencies lay behind many of its problems in 2004.Even the better-performing operators face a challenge raising the funds needed to invest for continued growth. UP plans to invest about $3.2bn this year, while BNSF plans to spend $2.75bn.Of the two, only BNSF consistently earns more than the roughly 10 per cent it and other railroads have to pay to raise capital.Even its position would look less healthy if its returns were calculated against the replacement cost of its assets, not the unrealistically low historic cost.Matthew Rose, BNSF’s chief executive, consequently concentrates investment on the core, strategic network, such as the Los Angeles-Chicago route, which is high-growth and low-risk for capital investment.This approach has required freight rate rises, which have angered customers of BNSF and other railroads. “Quite frankly, if you’re a shipper in the US, you’ve been used to lower costs every year since motor carrier, railroad and airline deregulation [in 1980],” Mr Rose says. “So customers are frustrated because for the first time they’re seeing rates go up.”The development is leading to “a lot of noise” from the marketplace saying the industry is making too much money, Mr Rose adds.“When you look at the basic returns and compare that to the S&P 500, we’re still below the majority of the S&P 500. It’s puzzling how anyone can look at the industry and say we’re making excessive profits.”As long as there is no serious re-regulation there is substantial evidence rates will keep increasing, helping to fund projects such as the UP’s double-tracking of the Sunset Corridor.That is the hope at UP, whose financial performance is poorer largely because 25 per cent of its business is still conducted under long-term contracts signed in the industry’s fallow days.The company, which earned 8.2 per cent on its invested capital last year, hopes to improve its performance as the contracts gradually come up for renewal.

Google, which reports today, rose 2.8 per cent to $633.48.Equity indices were volatile. The Beige Book, a survey of anecdotal reports from the Fed’s 12 regional reserve banks, said the economy was still growing but the “pace of growth decelerated since August” in five regions.“Contacts in a number of industries indicated a higher-than-usual degree of uncertainty about the outlook for economic activity,’’ the Fed report said.“Residential real estate markets continued to weaken, and most districts reported additional declines in home sales, prices and construction.”There was more bad news for the real estate sector as housing starts slumped 10.2 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 1.191m annual rate in September, worse than an expected 4.2 per cent slide. That followed a fall of 3.2 per cent in August. For the past year to September, housing starts are down 30.8 per cent.The S&P homebuilder index was down 2.4 per cent at 404.20. The S&P consumer staples index, a bellwether of negative economic sentiment, closed 0.2 per cent higher at 291.15.After the market closed Washington Mutual, the mortgage lender, said third quarter profit fell 72 per cent to $210m.But JPMorgan beat earnings estimates in spite of the credit squeeze in the third quarter.

The figure was in line with market expectations.But the Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing services index slipped to 54.8 in September from 55.8 in August. Economists had expected a reading of 55 – a level above 50 indicates an expansion in activity.The relatively benign economic data provided a catalyst for retail-related stocks early on but this rally tailed off later in the session.Consumer discretionary stocks remained the best of the leading 10 sectors on the S&P on Wednesday.Home Depot, up 1.5 per cent at $33.87, posted some of the best gains on the Dow.Materials, energy and technology stocks were weaker.Investor focus remains on the September payroll report, due tomorrow, which includes new private sector and government jobs. Economists expect growth of about 115,000. That would represent a rebound from the 4,000 decline in August.“As you look at ADP, bear in mind this is private payroll growth and so not exactly strong and not the sort of figure that keeps the Fed from easing again,” said David Ader, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.The status of the labour market is seen as crucial to determining future Federal Reserve policy action.Analysts at UBS said: “We look to this Friday’s change in non-farm payrolls for direction on whether the Fed will continue to ease further.”The futures market was on Wednesday factoring in a 72 per cent implied probability of a 25 basis points cut at the end of this month. This is two percentage points lower than the previous day and compares with a reading of 86 per cent a week ago.The probability that the Federal Fund rate will remain unchanged has increased to 28 per cent from 14 per cent a week ago.Financial stocks were in focus again after a third-quarter earnings update from Deutsche Bank.Deutsche said it would incur a charge of up to $3.09bn for the third quarter owing to exposure on leveraged loans, structured credit and mortgage securities.Financials and investment banks have outperformed the market this week as investors believe the worst is behind banks dealing with problems in the mortgage and credit markets.The S&P investment bank index pared early gains to close flat at 212.70. Bear Stearnswas down 0.7 per cent at $127.74 after it announced 310 job losses at its mortgage businesses.CSX was 2.6 per cent lower at $41.93 after Morgan Stanley lowered its rating on the rail freight transportation concern.The stock weighed on the Dow transportation index, which closed 1.7 per cent lower at 4,840.77.Transportation has underperformed since the credit squeeze hit in mid-August, recovering just 3.7 per cent compared with 9.1 per cent for the Dow.In corporate news, Procter & Gamble, 0.5 per cent lower at $70.41, was in focus after reports it was considering selling brands including Duracell and its remaining food assets, Pringles and Folgers.Homebuilder stocks were higher for a third consecutive day after an analyst at Citi Investment Research said recent big share price falls meant it could be time to buy into the sector.The S&P homebuilder index was 2.3 per cent higher at 463.39.

160;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
161;CSX;CSX Corp;2007-05-16T20:36:48Z;Wall St rallies on billionaires’ bets;;Wall Street rallied strongly on Wednesday with trading influenced by a number of well-known investors revealing their latest purchases in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Early on Wednesday, stocks traded in a choppy fashion as a better-than-expected rise for industrial production in April was offset by news that building permits last month fell at their fastest pace since 1990.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was boosted by the disclosure that its constituents, Citigroup, and Johnson & Johnson were in favour among leading investors.The Dow closed up 0.8 p+er cent at 13,487.53, and set its 23rd record close for the year. The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to close at 1,514.14 and edged closer to its record level of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Georges Yared, chief investment officer at Yared Investment Research said good earnings and guidance for the coming quarter should support stocks and that the S&P was building up to moving higher towards its 2000 record peak.Within the S&P, telecom, and financial stocks led the major sectors higher, while materials lagged.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that while all 10 major S&P sectors were still trading near their recent highs, “many seem to be rolling over a bit.”They said: “Financials, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and health care have all had slight declines after hitting overbought levels, and it will be key to see how they react to resistance levels.”The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 2,547.42, and shrugged off weakness among semiconductors stocks. Earnings and lower guidance from Applied Materials did weigh upon technology for much of on Wednesday and the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 0.2 per cent, following a slide of 1.1 per cent on Tuesday.Applied Materials, a chipmaker, reported better-than-expected earnings, but its guidance for sales disappointed investors. Its shares were down 3.1 per cent at $19.17.Meanwhile the Russell 2000 index of small companies rose 0.7 per cent at 820.29 and rebounded from its lowest closing level in more than a month on Tuesday.A number of stocks were in the spotlight on Wednesday when Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment company, said it had invested in Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific, two railroads, and also bought stock in Wellpoint and raised its holding in Johnson & Johnson, two healthcare companies.Norfolk Southern rose 1.65 per cent to $56.79, Union Pacific gained 0.9 per cent to $119.39 and the S&P railroad index rallied 1.3 per cent, taking its gain for the year to 25.1 per cent.Wellpoint gained 1.6 per cent at $84.86, while Johnson & Johnson rallied 2 per cent to $63.05.Edward Lampert, the hedge fund manager, said late on Tuesday that he had purchased 15m shares of Citigroup. This prompted the shares to jump 4 per cent to $54.91. Analysts believe that the banking conglomerate could now become the next high-profile target for activist investors, given its underperforming share price in recent years. Such a move would show that even the biggest companies were not immune to activist pressure.Meanwhile, George Soros, another of the most famous hedge fund managers, said his stake in Microsoft had doubled, and the stock rose 0.55 per cent to $31.07. Mr Soros had lowered his holdings in Oracle, and shares were up 0.8 per cent at $18.99, while he had sold shares in Ebay, down 0.75 per cent at $33.25, and Take-Two Interactive, and shares in the video game maker slid 0.2 per cent at $19.08.Another big investor, Carl Icahn, a well-known activist, said he had purchased a large slice of Anadarko Petroleum, boosting its shares by 1.6 per cent to $47.20, and also bought shares in CSX, the railroad finished up 1.4 per cent at $46.40. Mr Icahn also disclosed that his stake in Time Warner, had been cut by nearly half. Its shares in the media group rallied 1.55 per cent to $21.60.In takeover news, Bausch & Lomb agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus for about $3.7bn in cash. Shares in the the maker of eye-care products jumped 9.8 per cent to $67.50.“We believe pressure on operating cash flow, as the company struggles to recapture lost market share, creates significant risks in terms of return on capital for an acquiring firm and we do not expect any higher offers,” said Robert Gold, medical devices analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.After the closing bell, Hewlett-Packard said second-quarter profit fell 6.5 per cent after a tax gain in the year- earlier period. In after-hours trade, shares in the computer maker were 0.7 per cent lower at $44.86, after a rise of 1 per cent in regular trade.Shares in Amazon closed 4.4 per cent higher at $63.22, after the online retailer said it plans to launch a digital music store later this year and sell songs without copy protection restrictions.In earnings news, Compuware reported a 20 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings and its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $10.67.Shares in Federated Department stores rose 1.2 per cent to $62.69 after its first-quarter profit rose more than 5 per cent, but missed analysts’ estimates.
162;CSX;CSX Corp;2007-05-08T20:45:29Z;Wall Street pares early losses;;"Wall Street was slightly mixed on Tuesday, with investors lacking a catalyst to extend a winning streak that had driven blue-chip stocks on their best run since 1927.Deal talk, share buy-backs, upside earning results and an upgrade for year-end targets on the major benchmarks by Goldman Sachs were the highlights on Tuesday. Early in the day, investors adopted a cautious approach with the Federal Reserve set to meet on Wednesday. But the market pared most of its early losses as investors stepped in and bought on the dip said traders.At late-afternoon, the S&P 500 index closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,507.72, while the Nasdaq Composite was a fraction higher at 2,571.75, ahead of earnings from Cisco, after the closing bell.Cisco closed up 2 per cent at $28.36, but fell 3.8 per cent to $27.25 in after-hours trade as its fiscal third quarter earnings just beat estimates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed a fraction lower at 13,309.07 and broke its longest winning streak in 80 years. As of Monday, the blue-chip barometer had risen in 24 of the past 27 trading days.The long-term outlook for stocks remains bullish said analysts.William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading, said any weakness in stocks was a buying opportunity and he expects the S&P will rally towards 1,600 in the coming months.That target met with approval from Goldman Sachs, based on the bank’s outlook of higher profits in 2008. Goldman raised its year-end estimate for the S&P to 1,600 from 1,550 yesterday, while the bank sees the Dow reaching 14,000 versus a prior target of 13,500.Goldman expects average earnings of $100 a share in 2008 for the S&P, up from an upwardly revised $93 in 2007.“The sources of growth continue to rotate, away from housing and consumer durable spending and toward capital spending by corporations and solid ex-port gains linked to improved growth outside the United States,” said Goldman’s analysts.Although current quarterly earnings have exceeded forecasts, Mr Strazzullo said they had not been strong enough to justify stock benchmarks hitting multi-year highs. Instead, the strong pace of mergers and buy-outs along with stock buy-backs was offsetting mixed economic data and bearishly positioned hedge funds, he said.Buy-backs continued on Tuesday as CSX said it would repurchase an additional $1bn in its stock, taking its current programme to $3bn, and boost its dividend by 25 per cent. The railroad operator closed up 1.3 per cent at $46.50, after earlier setting a 52-week high of $47.38.“This year, announced corporate buying has averaged $5.7bn daily, which is 36 per cent higher than the annual record pace of $4.2bn daily in 2006,” said analysts at TrimTabs.“With corporate America sucking this much cash out of the market, it is no wonder this market keeps confounding the bears.”In trading activity on Tuesday, shares in AK Steel rose 9.2 per cent to $35.02 amid talk that the company could be acquired by Arcelor-Mittal, the world’s largest steelmaker. The shares hit a 52-week high of $37.70 earlier in the day and shares in US Steel set a 52-week high of $110.90.US Steel closed up 4.6 per cent at $109.68. For the year to date, the S&P steel index has risen 29.6 per cent as consolidation talk has bolstered the sector.Shares in Countrywide Financial jumped 7.2 per cent to $41.28 amid a lack of news on Tuesday. But, the bank has been touted by analysts as a likely buy-out candidate.Shares in Motorola fell
2.1 per cent to $17.70 after Carl Icahn, the activist shareholder, failed to win a seat on the company’s board at its annual meeting late on Monday.In earnings news, Warner Music posted a wider fiscal second-quarter net loss because of weaker revenue and costs from restructuring. Shares fell 0.9 per cent to $17.14.Walt Disney reported better than forecast quarterly earnings after the closing bell and its shares rose 1.1 per cent to $36.95 in after-hours trade. The stock rose 1.4 per cent to $36.55 in regular trade on Tuesday.CVS/Caremark, the pharmacy services provider, said first-quarter earnings rose 24 per cent. Its shares gained 2.5 per cent to $37.01. The results included 10 days of operation since Caremark, the drug benefits manager, was acquired by the retail pharmacy chain.Meanwhile,Hewlett-Packard raised guidance for its fiscal second quarter, due on May 16, to a range of $25.50bn to $25.55bn, up from a prior estimate of $24.5bn. Shares in the computer software maker rose 2.8 per cent to $45.01 and set a 52-week high of $45.13 earlier in the day."
163;CSX;CSX Corp;2007-04-30T20:50:52Z;Rail stocks hit new highs on activist interest;;If a train-carriage existed for activist hedge fund managers with investments in the US rail industry, it would look rather crowded these days.Earlier this month, The Children’s Investment Fund said it owned a big stake in CSX, one of the six “Class I” rail companies.TCI first came to prominence agitating for change at Deutsche Börse with Atticus – a hedge fund that also happens to have big stakes in several rail groups, including CSX.Speculation over the funds’ motives – combined with Warren Buffett’s interest in Burlington Northern– have propelled rail stocks to new highs. In spite of deteriorating traffic volumes, the S&P Railroads index rose 10 per cent in April.While TCI and Atticus may not mount a public campaign for change soon, their presence in this hitherto sleepy industry is a sign of the growing pressures on rail company executives.For some months, shareholders say they have been encouraging executives to explore different ways to use their balance sheets more efficiently.Suggestions have ranged from the piecemeal (gearing up to pay for share buybacks) to the radical (splitting the company’s track and train operations and putting the former in a real estate investment trust).The response – particularly to the more radical ideas – has been “uninterested” at best and “dismissive” at worst, according to two leading shareholders.“The average senior executive has been there for 30 years and the first 27 were poor,” said Rick Paterson, analyst at UBS. “Every CEO remembers the bad old days and they’re naturally cautious.”Converting to a Reit would be controversial. The details of such an unprecedented move are unclear, but it would probably involve artificially splitting the train operator from the track and real estate assets.If successful, this has tax benefits and allows the infrastructure Reit to borrow at better rates due to its assets and more stable cash flow.One problem analysts have identified is that rail company land is often use-specific. “Complexities over the ownership of the land would make this a difficult path,” said Tom Wadewitz, analyst at JPMorgan.Aligning the incentives of the operating and infrastructure divisions is also tricky. As the UK saw after the botched privatization of British Rail in the 1990s, rail infrastructure companies tend to scrimp on capital expenditure and push up the rates they charge.This has political implications. “Safety advocates would make a lot of noise and the politicians would likely jump on the bandwagon,” said Mr Paterson.A more likely scenario is that rail groups will gear up and return cash to shareholders.“These companies are overcapitalized and there is plenty of room to redress the balance sheet,” said one leading industry investor.Low gearing, better pricing power and high barriers to entry have fed speculation about a private equity bid.Strong unions and historically low returns on capital make many analysts sceptical about a takeover bid. But the entry of these influential new shareholders into the sector has surely made the challenge facing a private equity bidder a little easier.
164;CSX;CSX Corp;2007-04-27T20:37:03Z;Wall St steadier following GDP jitters;;A fresh batch of strong earnings updates pushed Wall Street stocks to historic highs this week, but the advance remained more symbolic than substantial.The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 13,000 point threshold for the first time on Wednesday, in a move heralded by bulls as a sign of good times ahead.Yet the technical breakthrough came amid a listless week for the broader S&P 500 index. The benchmark index closed 0.7 per cent higher this week after falling slightly on four out of five days. The Dow rose 1.2 per cent this week.The Dow closed 0.1 per cent up on Friday at 13,120.94 while the S&P 500 was 0.2 points lower at 1,494.08.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent at 2,557.21.“It has been a week where the Dow has caught up with the S&P, they are now both up over 5 per cent for the year to date,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co.“The market has been celebrating earnings and upbeat guidance.”The indices were led upwards by companies such as Whirlpool and 3M that were boosted by a weak dollar and strong growth overseas. Railway and steel stocks, which are more exposed to the US economy, fared less well.Microsoft broke through the $30 mark for the first time since the launch of the Vista operating system to stand up 3.5 per cent to $30.12 on Friday. But overall investor sentiment was subdued by data showing economic growth slowing.This came towards the end of one of the best months on Wall Street for more than three years. The Dow rose 6.2 per cent in April, but the gains were driven by a relatively narrow base. About half of the gains were made by just eight of the 30 Dow component stocks.The steady rise in stocks has made it a testing month for short-sellers. Amazon, for instance, rose 36.9 per cent to $61.50 this week after entering April with short selling of its stock at the highest level since 2003.While the surge was sparked by a strong earnings report, the jump was partly explained by the unwinding of loss-making short positions.With more than two-thirds of the company’s shares held by a handful of investors, many short sellers looking to buy the stock may have found it hard to come by.Baker Hughes, the oil services group, was one of the biggest risers this week, up 11.7 per cent to $81.01.Like many other US groups reporting during the week, Baker was boosted by strong overseas sales. Whirlpool rose 17.6 per cent to $106.41 in spite of a US housing downturn because of strong appliance sales abroad.Meanwhile 3M, the Post-it Note maker that generates the majority of its revenues overseas, rose 4.9 per cent to $81.55 on strong profits.Railways and steel, two sectors that surged this year amid a burst of takeover speculation, began to lose some of their shine.The S&P Rail index, which is up 19.9 per cent this year, fell 3.5 per cent this week amid signs of weak traffic volume. CSX fell 2.9 per cent to $43.74.Profit updates from a number of steel groups undermined hopes that the steel cycle was on the up. US Steel slipped 3.6 per cent to $103.04 while Nucor fell 4.1 per cent to $64.94.Apple surged 9.8 per cent to $98.92 after handily beating analysts’ profit estimates as sales of Macintosh computers rose strongly.Texas Instruments gave upbeat guidance on chip demand, sending its stock up 7.2 per cent this week to $34.83. But relatively positive sentiment towards the sector began to wane on Friday.Broadcom plunged 4.2 per cent to $33.40 on Friday after the chipmaker fell short of analysts’ sales forecasts.JetBlue Airways slipped 3.6 per cent to $10 after JPMorgan described the group as “the most expensive airline money can buy” as it cut its rating on the company from “neutral” to “underweight”.JPMorgan reduced its recommendation on a total of six airlines, including US Airways and Continental, citing concerns about over-supply and weaker demand.Pressure on General Electric to pare its operations increased on Friday after Citigroup advocated selling the conglomerate’s NBC Universal media division.Jeffrey Sprague, a Citigroup analyst, said the group “needs to be more focused” and should sell NBC because it had “no meaningful synergy with the rest of the portfolio”.Shares in GE, down 1 per cent this year, rose 2.8 per cent to $36.84 on Friday.
165;CSX;CSX Corp;2007-04-20T13:02:38Z;Wall St advances to new highs;;Solid earnings and speculation about buy-outs of financial groups pushed US stocks into record territory this week as the leading indices recouped all the losses from the slump that began in late February.Boosted by bullish earnings updates from Caterpillar and Honeywell on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record level for a third successive day, climbing 1.2 per cent to 12,961.98.The S&P 500 index broke through its high for the year reached before the plunge in equities two months ago, rising 0.9 per cent to 1,484.35 on Friday to stand 2.2 per cent up this week.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3 per cent this week to 2,526.39.While the advance gathered pace on Friday, the rally earlier in the week was driven by a relatively narrow base of stocks. Blue chips had the best of the gains: the Dow Jones advanced 2.8 per cent this week while the Russell 2000 index of small companies rose just 1.2 per cent.“The big driver has been earnings, which have been much better than anticipated – we set the bar so low,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.“It is a ‘Chicken Little’ recovery – the market rises yet never seems able to generate confidence.”Google led the way up after beating analysts’ expectations with a sharp rise in profits on the back of strong search engine revenues. Its shares rose 2.3 per cent to $482.48.This rise was in stark contrast to Yahoo, which slid 12.6 per cent to $27.46 this week after the introduction of Panama, its new online advertising system, failed to stem the deterioration in profits and sales. Caterpillar, a Dow component, surged 4.7 per cent to $71.82 on Friday after the heavy machinery maker reported profits in excess of analysts’ estimates and raised its earnings forecasts.Shares in Honeywell International rose 4.8 per cent to $51.40 on Friday after the industrial conglomerate raised its earnings forecasts for the year and beat Wall Street profit estimates.The financial sector came in from the cold this week, with the S&P Financial index up 3.9 per cent to break past its 50-day moving average and stand in positive territory for the year.The rise came amid a burst of takeover speculation after a $25bn agreed buy-out of Sallie Mae, the student loan group, by a JC Flowers-led consortium that sent shares in Sallie Mae up 15.5 per cent to $54 this week.The groundbreaking deal, which is structured to make it unnecessary for Sallie Mae to hold its own capital, turned attention to financial groups that were previously considered improbable buy-out targets. Foremost among those was Countrywide Financial, the biggest home lender, which jumped 11.1 per cent to $37.36.Speculation about the identity of a potential buyer has centred on Merrill Lynch, which has made bullish comments about the subprime mortgage market.Merrill rose 6.7 per cent to $92.02 this week after reporting a four-fold rise in profits.In the latest example of the growing appetite for financial deals, H&R Block agreed to sell Option One Mortgage, its subprime mortgage unit, to a company affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity group. Shares in H&R Block rose 3.3 per cent to $22.56 on Friday.Intel made big gains this week, rising 8.3 per cent to $21.16, as the chipmaker raised its revenue forecasts after a successful overhaul of its product line.Rival AMD fared less well, easing 0.8 per cent to $14.16 on Friday after what Robert Rivet, chief executive, described as a “disappointing and unacceptable” first quarter, with lower sales and deteriorating margins.The rally in railway stocks gathered steam as TCI, the activist hedge fund, built a stake in CSX, highlighting the potential for takeovers and asset sales in this cash-generative sector.Shares in CSX jumped 6.1 per cent to $4504.Atticus, a hedge fund that has worked with TCI in the past, already holds big stakes in railway groups, including Union Pacific, which rose 6.8 per cent this week to $117.21.Homebuilders bounced off their lows for the year as fears eased about the severity of the housing market downturn. The S&P Homebuilders index jumped 8.6 per cent while DR Horton rose 8.9 per cent to $23.39.
166;CSX;CSX Corp;2007-04-18T21:01:08Z;JPMorgan helps the Dow to record high;;Wall Street pressed into record territory on Wednesday as strong profits from JPMorgan lifted financial groups and offset weakness in the technology sector.Weak earnings updates from Yahoo and IBM had weighed on the mood in morning trading but stocks later rallied as investors shrugged off concerns about corporate profits.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.2 per cent at an all-time high of 12,803.84 after setting an intra-day high of 12,838.46. JPMorgan, Boeing and Caterpillar accounted for the majority of the Dow’s gains.The S&P 500 index was up 0.1 per cent at 1,472.50. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent at 2,510.50.“From a technical standpoint we need something to push [the Dow] through its new high and I don’t think earnings will do it,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards.“Financial groups have helped – but I would not be surprised if we tread water or went lower for the rest of the week.”JPMorgan rose 3.8 per cent to $52.07 after the bank reported record first-quarter profits. Higher losses from consumer lending and credit cards were easily offset by a big rise in fee revenue from investment banking.Boeing climbed 3.8 per cent to $93.88 on news that it was the sole bidder for a $2.5bn South Korean jet deal.Yahoo plunged 11.8 per cent to $28.31 after the introduction of Panama, its new online advertising system, failed to stem the deterioration in its profits and sales. Its shares stand 11.1 per cent up on the year.Justin Post, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the update was “disappointing” because of “very positive comments made by management to advertisers on early Panama results and deceleration of branded advertising growth”.IBM slid 2.4 per cent to $94.80 after two analysts downgraded the stock amid fears sagging US corporate spending would undermine its sales.Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs both reduced their recommendations on IBM from “buy” to “neutral”. Credit Suisse cited “soft US enterprise spending” and “execution issues in all three” of IBM’s chief business divisions.Motorola stock rose 1.5 per cent to $18.22 after the struggling mobile phone maker reported a first-quarter loss but forecast “gradual quarterly improvements” for the second half of the year.Intel rose 1.8 per cent to $21.35 after the chipmaker raised its profit forecasts for the year.In deal news, CSX rose 2.8 per cent to $44.56 – a record high point – after activist hedge fund TCI said it had built a “significant” stake in the railroad group.eSpeed was up 9.5 per cent to $10.57 after Tullett Prebon said it approached the electronic bond trading company with a $12-a-share offer. However, Cantor Fitzgerald, which controls eSpeed, rejected the offer.
167;CSX;CSX Corp;2007-04-09T22:09:29Z;Buffet buys heavily into US railroad sector;;The value of the largest North American railroad companies was boosted on Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway emerged as a big investor in the sector.Over the weekend, Mr Buffett’s conglomerate disclosed that it had amassed a 10.9 per cent stake, worth more than $3bn, in Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the Texas-based freight company. The news sent Burlington shares soaring to close up 6.6 per cent at $88.17 on Monday.The effect of Mr Buffett’s investment in Burlington quickly spread to other big railroad companies, particularly after a Berkshire Hathaway spokeswoman confirmed to Reuters that the company was also investing nearly $1.4bn in two other railroad groups.The biggest gain came at Canadian National Railway, whose shares rose 5.3 per cent. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern rose 3.8 per cent, while Canadian Pacific gained 3.1 per cent and CSX was up 2.2 per cent. The companies being targeted by Berkshire have not been identified.The North American railroad industry has for several months been considered a prime candidate for investment by buy-out groups. This is because freight operators generally have little debt on their balance sheets given the steady cashflows they are generating. Moreover, railroad businesses have been performing relatively well amid tight supply in the trucking industry.However, the first quarter brought signs of a slowdown, as a series of winter storms and the slowdown in the housing market brought fears of lower volumes.CNBC first reported Berkshire’s plans to invest in the two railroad groups besides Burlington.Burlington generated $1.9bn in net income last year from about $15bn in revenues. One of the main business of the company, which has a market value of nearly $31bn, is to transport coal and other commodities.The disclosure of Mr Buffett’s interest in the railroad sector comes only three weeks ahead of Berkshire’s annual meeting with shareholders, a two-day pilgrimage by investors to the company’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska.Berkshire has made a number of large investments in recent years, including acquisitions of PacifiCorp, the electrical utility, Russell, the clothing manufacturer, and Iscar, the Israeli tool manufacturer. Because of Mr Buffett’s long and successful track record, the destination of Berkshire’s money is closely followed on Wall Street and around the world.A Berkshire spokeswoman declined any further comment on the company’s acquisition plans.

170;CSX;CSX Corp;2006-07-25T23:28:06Z;UPS battered by retail weakness;;Shares in UPS plunged nearly 16 per cent in early trading on Tuesday after the package delivery group reported disappointing second-quarter earnings and warned of a worsening economic outlook for the remainder of the year.UPS and other express delivery groups are viewed as important economic bellwethers because of their increasingly central role in global supply chains.Scott Davis, chief financial officer, said the group did not expect a severe downturn but it was becoming clear that a slowdown was under way.“Every indication says there are some challenges and headwinds out there, but we’re not saying the sky is falling in,” he told investors. “We’re saying that growth is going to moderate from the levels we’ve seen.”Mr Davis said shipments by manufacturers remained strong but some of the group’s retail customers were showing signs of weakness.Express delivery groups such as UPS and FedEx have enjoyed several years of rapid expansion on the back of soaring global trade and increasing demand for just-in-time services.But Tuesday’s results and guidance from UPS triggered a sell-off throughout the US freight transportation sector in expectation of slower growth.BNSF, the second-largest US rail operator, saw its stock fall nearly 5 per cent despite reporting a forecast-beating 28 per cent increase in second-quarter net profits.All the other big US rail companies, such as Union Pacific and CSX, have also reported strong results over the past week, but investors have preferred to focus on the uncertain outlook.UPS’s net earnings were up 7 per cent at $1.06bn, or 97 cents a share, but missed Wall Street’s consensus forecast of $1 a share, in part because of surging fuel prices.Jet fuel prices increased by 14 per cent and diesel fuel by 11 per cent during the quarter, causing $21m in unexpected costs, according to Mr Davis.Like most freight carriers, UPS recovers some of its fuel costs through a customer surcharge, but there is a 41-day lag before increased prices are factored into the rate.Mr Davis warned that full-year earnings growth would be at the lower end of the group’s 11-16 per cent target, but stressed that demand for express delivery services remained solid.Mr Davis indicated that he did not expect a prolonged economic slowdown and forecast that UPS would return to stronger growth next year.Shares in UPS closed 10.25 per cent lower on Tuesday at $71.80 - up from an intraday low of $67.25.

Analysts expect synergies to result from the deal.Retail stocks were closely watched as leading stores reported sales figures for June. Costco dropped 1.8 per cent to $55.85 on weaker than expected sales data.Other retailers did better after beating Wall Street forecasts with strong June sales.

173;CSX;CSX Corp;2006-05-17T22:10:10Z;Wall Street spooked by inflation fears;;Wall Street slumped on Wednesday as inflation fears punctured an already fragile mood among market participants. All the important indices suffered heavy losses, with the S&P 500 index falling to its lowest in two months. The Dow had its worst day since 2003.Investors were unsettled by the latest consumer price inflation data, which were stronger than expected and led the market to price in a greater chance of further interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve. The data reverberated across all sectors, striking the transport, finance and energy sectors hardest.?They are finally talking about the top-line number,? said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, referring to concern about both the headline index, which rose 0.6 per cent, and the core index, which was up 0.3 per cent.?The reason energy was taken out [of the core number] was because it was very volatile month to month. But for the last few years, crude has been trending up. This reaction is a shift in focus from the core to the top line.?At the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.7 per cent, or 21.76 points, at 1,270.32. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.5 per cent, or 33.33 points, at 2,195.80 ? its lowest level since November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.9 per cent, or 214.28 points, to 11,205.61, a one-month low.All sectors fell on the Big Board, with energy the biggest loser. Stocks of gasoline rose for the third consecutive week. BJ Services slumped 3.4 per cent to 34.75. ExxonMobil dropped 2.9 per cent to $60.18.The bellwether transport sector also took a hit, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average retreated from an all-time high set less than two weeks ago to fall more than 2.4 per cent in one day. It has now fallen 5.4 per cent in less than two weeks. Federal Express lost 4.8 per cent to $109.92, while Burlington Northern dipped 3.5 per cent to $76.13 and CSX shed 3.8 per cent to $68.09.Interest rate jitters afflicted the financial sector, with investment banks and brokerages particularly hard-hit. The S&P Investment Bank and Brokerage index has fallen more than 5 per cent in less than a week. Goldman Sachs fell 2.9 per cent to $148.21 and Morgan Stanleyshed 3.3 per cent to $59.99. E*Trade dropped 3.7 per cent to $24.05.Technology stocks fared less poorly, although they were still down for the day. Hewlett-Packard was a bright spot in the gloom. The shares gained 3.4 per cent to $32.16 after the computer maker reported a better-than-expected 51 per cent increase in second-quarter profit. Broadcom gained 3 per cent to $37.46 after an attorney from the International Trade Commission issued a non-binding briefing arguing that Qualcomm infringed two patents of Broadcom.Applied Materials was down 5.2 per cent at $16.93 in spite of reporting a 35 per cent rise in quarterly profit.
174;CSX;CSX Corp;2006-05-05T20:59:16Z;Wall Street rally helped by easing oil prices;;Wall Street made strong advances this week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a fresh six-year high – to bring it within about 150 points of its all-time record – while the S&P 500 reached its highest level in five years. The Russell 2000 index of small companies reached an all-time high.Robust gains in materials and transport outweighed mixed economic data and disappointing earnings in software and healthcare.The week had an inauspicious start after CNBC revealed that Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, felt markets had misinterpreted his congressional testimony as being dovish on interest rates. Markets briefly panicked, pushing the leading indices down.However, continued solid earnings and an easing in the crude price to its lowest level in a month were enough to perk up Wall Street.The markets were also largely cheered by the week’s economic news. Fears of further monetary tightening eased thanks to figures showing an increase in productivity and a fall in non-farm payrolls.“Investors are cheering the top line numbers in employment and not paying attention to the fact that wages are up,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach, who was still nervous about the fact that oil, bond yields, gold and equities were all moving higher. “The market is focusing on the fact that the economy is still quite strong. We have all four markets going up, and somewhere along the line, something is going to give.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 had gained 1 per cent to 1,325.76 on the day, up 1.2 per cent for the week, its highest level since February 2001. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8 per cent at 2,342.57 on the day, up 0.9 per cent on the week. The Dow was at 11,577.74, up 1.2 per cent on the day and 1.9 per cent on the week.The materials sector was a star performer, with demand for steel and base metals fuelling upgrades. Nucor added 7.6 per cent for the week to $117.05 after an upgrade from Merrill Lynch, while US Steel gained 9.6 per cent to $75.10. Shares in both have doubled since October 2005, thanks to deal talk.Falling inventories helped copper prices to record highs. These supply constraints sent copper miner Phelps Dodge soaring 9.2 per cent to $94.15, and was upgraded by Bear Stearns. It has risen over 40 per cent since March.Transport was also strong. The Dow Jones Transportation index touched an all-time high, and at one point was up 5.9 per cent for the week. The index has gained 16.5 per cent since the start of the year.Freight shipper Expeditors International soared 24.5 per cent to $106.55, after it raised its dividend and reported earnings per share 20 per cent higher than analysts had forecast.Rail-freight carriers also gained, thanks to increased pricing power and growing imports from China. CSX rose 8.3 per cent to $74.19 on the week and Burlington Northern Santa Fe rose 4.6 per cent to $83.19.Software was one of the worst performing sectors: the S&P software index fell 2.3 per cent on the week.Microsoft continued its slide, losing 4 per cent before a slight recovery. It is down 12.7 per cent since releasing its earnings last week. Online auctioneer eBay lost 5 per cent on Friday - the second worst performance on the S&P 500 - and 5.6 per cent for the week.Adobe Systems, makers of graphic design software, slumped on Wednesday after it said second-quarter revenue and profits would come in at the lower end of its forecasts. It fell 12.8 per cent over the week to $34.18.Electronic Arts fell after its revenues and earnings forecasts fell short of market expectations. The shares fell 15.8 per cent to $47.85, their lowest since November 2004.The healthcare sector remained poorly. Cigna reported sharply lower first quarter profits and the company’s shares fell 14.1 per cent to $91.88. Aetna lost 1.3 per cent to $37.99.One of the biggest fallers was Procter & Gamble, whose forecast for the current quarter was below analysts’ forecasts. It fell 4.3 per cent for the week to $55.73.The NYSE Group rose 3.3 per cent to $68.60 on speculation that it would beat Nasdaq for control of the LSE. NYSE gained 9 per cent on Friday, in reaction to its successful secondary equity offering, which frees it to bid for other exchanges.
175;CSX;CSX Corp;2006-03-17T18:39:41Z;Wall Street bulls come out in force;;"An explosive start to the bank reporting season and fading concerns over interest rates brought out the bulls on Wall Street this week, with the main indices hitting their highest levels for nearly five years.Benign US inflation and housing data helped relieve worries about the outlook for US interest rates. After racking up three consecutive days of gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its advance yesterday, rising 0.2 per cent to close at 11,279.65.The S&P 500, which broke through the 1,300 mark on Wednesday for the first time since May 2001, edged up another 0.2 per cent to 1,307.25 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to settle at 2,306.48.This took the weekly gain for the Dow to 1.8 per cent, for the S&P to 2 per cent and for the Nasdaq to 2 per cent.The week produced record quarterly figures from Wall Street’s top investment banks, which defied expectations that their trading businesses would suffer as US short-term interest rates increased.Goldman Sachs set the bar for its peers on Tuesday as it delivered first-quarter net profits 50 per cent ahead of analyst forecasts.The stellar performance was followed by Lehman Brothers, which unveiled a 24 per cent jump in quarterly earnings and Bear Stearns, which reported a
34 per cent earnings increase on the back of strong performances in trading, derivatives, investment banking and wealth management.Brad Hintz, analyst at Bernstein Research, said he expected merchant banking “to remain an exceptional business in 2006”.Goldman Sachs ended the week 6.2 per cent higher at $150.36, while Lehman and Bear Stearns inched up 0.5 per cent to $142.80 and 0.5 per cent to $132.87 respectively, having seen their gains pared by profit-taking.Investment banks were not the only ones doing brisk business. Charles Schwab shot up 11 per cent to $18.13 after the discount broker issued a bullish first-quarter forecast, saying client trade was up 52 per cent last month, compared with the same period a year before.Railroad stocks also chugged ahead after Union Pacific, the largest US rail operator, raised first-quarter profit guidance by 20 per cent, and CSX, the third-
biggest, was upgraded by analysts at UBS.Separately, Merrill Lynch raised its price estimates on Union and four other rail companies, saying railroads had benefited from increased shipping of commodities such as coal.The Dow Jones transportation index gained 2.2 per cent for the week. The S&P railroads index jumped 6.2 per cent, led by Union, up 6.2 per cent to $91.07 and CSX, up 7.6 per cent to $59.46.Energy stocks had a lacklustre start to the week, thanks to data which revealed rising crude inventory levels in the US. However, that news was overshadowed by mounting tensions in Iraq.The announcement by the US military of the start of “Operation Swarmer” – the largest aerial bombing campaign since the 2003 invasion – saw traders rush to cover short positions.Heavyweight oil stocks felt the benefit of heightened worries over the sustainability of crude supplies, with ExxonMobil climbing 3.2 per cent to $61.05, Chevron up 5.7 per cent to $57.18 and Marathon Oil putting on
9.9 per cent to $76.36.The upswing in crude prices weighed on chipmakers. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, which tumbled 3.2 per cent on Thursday, ended the week with a loss of 1.2 per cent. Advanced Micro Devices led the way with a 7.3 per cent fall to $33.95 as investors exited the sector to jump on the energy bandwagon.Merrill Lynch said it believed investors were factoring in the reality that there was little additional volume growth upside or margin leverage left in the semiconductor sector.North Fork Bancorp climbed 14.8 per cent to $29.10 after credit card issuer Capital One Financial said it had agreed to buy the company in a $14.6bn cash-and-shares deal. Calyon Securities said the deal came as a surprise, but it was a good acquisition at a reasonable price. Shares in Capital One fell 8.9 per cent to $81.90.General Motors, which tumbled nearly 5 per cent yesterday after announcing 2005 losses were $2bn deeper than previously thought, ended the week 2.4 per cent lower at $21.13."
176;CSX;CSX Corp;2005-11-29T20:07:49Z;Gulf group achieves global scale within a year;;If Tuesday’s deal with P&O succeeds, as looks likely, DP World will have transformed itself within a year from having only an insignificant share of the world container terminals market to overtaking Denmark’s APM Terminals to become number three.The first step was taken in January, when DP World defeated tough competition to secure CSX World Terminals, the container ports business, for $1.15bn from the US railroad. The deal made DP World the world’s sixth largest container terminal operator by annual throughput on most analysts’ figures.The P&O acquisition completes the building of the business, which is now unlikely to be able to secure a significant further acquisition and is likely to rely on deals to buy or build individual terminals.The business will have terminals in most important areas of the world, stretching from Australia to Canada and Argentina to eastern Russia.The biggest task now could be to exercise control over the whole group and to devise a strategy for the company now that it is one of the heavyweights of the world container ports industry.Neil Davidson, container ports analyst at London-based Drewry Shipping Consultants, says the challenge for DP World is to understand the businesses it has bought and to successfully integrate them.“The challenge is making sure that both sides work together in a complementary manner and avoid cutting across each other,” he says. “That’s an information issue and a management issue. It’s also about motivation for the P&O management and making sure they buy into the DP World aims.”However, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, DP World’s chairman, says that the experience with CSX gives him confidence the company can manage the process. “We took a company that wasn’t well run and we were able to improve on it,” Sultan Sulayem says of CSX. “Now we are taking a company that is very well run.”The company has the advantage of being decentralised, he says. “We’re not going to have a headquarters that’s going to tell everybody how to operate,”Sultan Sulayem says the company sees its aim as serving the shipping lines with which it has built relationships wherever they operate in the world.“We are matching the growth of our customers and matching their requirements,” he says. “As they grow, as they require services in other places, we find it effective to give them services in other markets.”Sultan Sulayem says DP World’s approach is not to offer price deals but to offer common service standards, investing heavily in ports to ensure they remain uncongested. Many container ports became heavily congested last year.The approach could prove good news for P&O’s employees. Sultan Sulayem says the company will not only hang onto P&O’s ferries and properties business but also parts of the container ports business, which might seem to many investors less attractive than the fast-growing Chinese and Indian ports.
177;CSX;CSX Corp;2005-11-29T19:43:16Z;Lex: P&O/DP World;;"P&O’s concessionary shareholders will still be able to get discounted ferry tickets after their company is sold to DP World. They will hardly need them, given the price DPW, owned by the emirate of Dubai, is paying for the UK ports and ferries operator.The cash bid for the deferred shares is a 37 per cent premium to the average price in the three months before the news broke and 25 times last year’s earnings – themselves inflated by one-offs. DPW is also lobbing £125m into the pension deficit and plans no job cuts, so it looks like a great deal for staff too.The deal’s £4.2bn enterprise value, including the pension contribution, shows just how deep DPW’s pockets are. At 12 times 2006 consensus earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, it is still less than the 14 times DPW paid for CSX World Terminals in January. While the geographic spread of P&O’s business offers DPW diversification, there has been no mention of any synergies to justify the near £1bn premium. Other potential buyers will be discouraged by the need to stump up an even higher price, as well as the £34m break fee P&O must pay DPW if it sells to someone else. The only puzzling part of the deal is why DPW, which only operates ports, would want to retain P&O’s troubled ferry business,which operates in the North Sea, English Channel and Irish Sea. Maybe those cheap ferry tickets will not be available for long.- Click here to add your comments

178;CSX;CSX Corp;2005-11-01T09:35:38Z;Gulf petrodollars set to flow into UK takeover boom;;"A flood of petrodollars is likely to make its way into the nascent takeover boom in the UK, with Arab countries deploying private equity tactics to diversify their holdings, experts say.The approach by DP World, Dubai’s state-owned ports operator, to P&O is a harbinger of things to come. Although Dubai is not a large oil producer, experts say its role as a financial entrepôt in the Arab world means billions of petro-
dollars are likely to underpin the investment plans of its rulers, the al-Maktoums.Traditionally, such Middle Eastern funds have gone into conservative investments in the US but increasingly, the young, well-educated rulers are being more selective about where they invest the oil profits. In some cases, they are pulling out of deals that when they consider them too expensive.Gulf investors are moving away from traditional assets such as hotels, retail space and commercial property towards more industrial enterprises. As a sign of their boldness, Dubai Investment Group is one of the bidders for Refco, the collapsed New York futures brokerage that has filed for bankruptcy protection.DP World itself has a long record as an investor overseas. It has operations in Latin America and south-east Asia and last year spent $1.15bn (£650m) buying the international business of Florida-based CSX World Terminals.Dubai – its prosperity is symbolised by the Burj Al Arab hotel – is the second largest of the seven emirates that make up the federated United Arab Emirates. Other Dubai- and UAE government-owned entities have recently been intent on expanding abroad.In March, Dubai International Capital, the international investment arm of Dubai Holdings,

owned by Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, bought Tussaud’s Group, the theme park operator, for £800m.In January, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia bought London’s Savoy Group hotel company – the latest in a string of high-profile acquisitions he has made.This summer, Mubadala Development Company, an investment firm owned by the Abu Dhabi government, acquired a 5 per cent stake in Ferrari from Mediobanca, the Italian merchant bank. It also participated in a €2bn (£1.35bn) acquisition of Leaseplan, the Dutch car leasing company. Earlier, Abu Dhabi had sought a small stake in Volkswagen, the German car group.In January, Dubai Holdings also acquired a $1bn stake in Daimler Chrysler, making it the third largest investor in
the US-based

carmaker. “There’s a feeling that post 9/11 they shouldn’t be putting too many eggs in to the American basket,” says Adrian Creed, a partner specialising in the Middle East at Trowers & Hamlins, the international law firm.The main focus of their attention is on countries closer to home, such as Egypt and Turkey. But they are also keen to diversify. “I wouldn’t say we’re at the front of the queue but they’re casting their sliderules over UK plc and western Europe,” Mr Creed says.Last year, Bahrain’s First Islamic Investment Bank bought the UK’s South Staffordshire Water for £236m. “Private equity is the right analogy. They are pooling their resources and identifying potential targets,” Mr Creed says.Walid Khadduri, business editor at al-Hayat, the
pan-Arab daily newspaper in Beirut, says these are early days for Gulf investment internationally.He points out that Gulf companies have not just been looking in Europe and the US but in the Arab world – Jordan, Egypt and Morocco – and more broadly to India and Pakistan."
179;CSX;CSX Corp;2005-10-31T19:57:11Z;Lex: P&O;;"Just a week ago, analysts suggested that shares in P&O should be valued between 276p and 357p. At 310p on Friday, investors clearly agreed. On Monday, following news of a potential bid by DP World, the Dubai ports operator, P&O's “fair” value soared. The shares rose 30 per cent, upping the group's enterprise value to £3.7bn, nearly 10 times consensus forecasts for next year's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.P&O has not changed overnight. But Dubai has very deep pockets, and was prepared to pay 14 times EV/ebitda for CSX World Terminals last year. Temasek, which owns the Port of Singapore, paid a similar multiple for part of Hutchison International Terminals in June, while financial buyer Macquarie International Infrastructure Fund was willing to pay almost 10 times for a third of Chinese port Changshu Xinghua.Betting on buyers paying inflated prices is risky. However, P&O is a genuinely rare asset, with the most diversified geographical exposure among the dominant top five operators. If a bidding war develops Temasek and Denmark's AP Moller-Maersk could also join the fray P&O investors will be handsomely rewarded for sitting out a painful restructuring. Although the ferries operation is still ailing, prospects for the ports business, which represents two thirds of ebitda, are promising. Deep pockets to help fund the large capital-intensive projects P&O has planned in the UK and Asia will help it deliver on this promise. In the meantime, shareholders can sail away into the sunset.- Click here to add your comments

180;CSX;CSX Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;P&O part of drive to reduce Dubai dependence;;"Even before Dubai Ports’ bid for P&O, the key question was whether it could transfer the expertise and success of its ports in Dubai – last year the world’s 10th busiest container port – into success in its growing international business.If the operator takes over P&O – the world’s fourth-largest operator of container ports, whose ports are spread from India to South America and eastern Russia – the questions will be more acute.The questions are similar to those that have faced PSA, the world’s second-largest container port operator, which handles nearly all the container throughput of
Singapore, the world’s second-busiest container port. It is also state-owned and has a strong base in a prime location but has not gained the reputation for efficiency abroad that it has in its home operations.Dubai Ports announced only on September 28 that it was merging the domestic business in the United Arab Emirates – previously known as DPA (Dubai Ports Authority) and DPI (Dubai Ports International), the international business – into one company, DP World.The merger was intended to allow an easier exchange of expertise between the successful Dubai business and other worldwide operations. The operation continues to be owned by the Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation of the Dubai government. It has never published any financial figures.Jorn Hinge, deputy chief executive of United Arab Shipping Corporation, a container shipping line that uses Dubai heavily, says the success there has been a result of Dubai Ports’ operating like a true international business.“Not many companies in the Middle East owned by Middle Eastern companies get run in an international way,” he says. “The port of Dubai has done that.”The port’s operations are on a par with the best in the world, he says.Any bid for P&O is likely to be part of a continuing drive to reduce Dubai Ports’ dependence on the Dubai operation. It depends heavily on trans-shipment, where a deep-sea ship drops off containers at the port for another ship to take onward.Dubai is a significant enough market to justify calls from deep-sea ships, it is nearer main shipping lanes than other Arabian Gulf locations and is still convenient for smaller Gulf markets, which justify calls from smaller feeder ships.Trans-shipment business can sometimes be tempted away if another, rival location opens a port. Singapore – the world’s largest trans-shipment port – lost significant business in 2000 and 2002 when two large shipping lines defected to the newly-opened Malaysian port of Tanjung Pelepas.According to figures from London-based Drewry Shipping Consultants, Dubai accounted for more than half Dubai Ports’ container volumes last year, even including the 3.3m 20-foot equivalent units handled by CSX World Terminals, a US-based operator bought by Dubai Ports for $1.15bn in January.If it succeeded in buying P&O, the company would gain a more balanced portfolio of ports, most of which are gateway ports – located near the cargo’s eventual destination. Last year’s combined throughput of CSX World Terminals, Dubai Ports and P&O would have been 33.3m TEUs, just ahead of Singapore’s PSA."
181;CSX;CSX Corp;2005-10-31T15:01:44Z;Lex: Dubai;;"It may be a tiny emirate of just 1.1m people, but Dubai is out to conquer by land, sea and air. DP World's bid for P&O, the UK ports group, is the latest foreign move by one of Dubai's state-owned investment vehicles. Dubai Holding has spent $2.4bn buying Tussauds Group and 2 per cent of DaimlerChrysler. Disgraced US brokerage Refco is now in its sights. Emirates, the state-owned flag carrier, is one of the world's fastest growing and most profitable airlines.A relative lack of oil and gas - just 7 per cent of the economy - has encouraged diversification. A relaxed investment climate and proximity to other Gulf states ensures there is no shortage of petrodollars looking for a home.Dubai's emergence as a regional hub for finance, tourism and transit, while laudable, is not without problems. Local equities and real estate look frothy. Retail space per head, already on a par with the US, is set to double within five years. Any big fall in oil prices would stem the tide of liquidity flowing in.Then there are those foreign investments. Those that play to Dubai's strengths, such as P&O, make sense although DPW is estimated to have paid a rich 14 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for CSX World Terminals last year. Waxworks museums and flashy German cars, as well as skyscrapers, do much to build Dubai's “brand”. But there are inherent risks when a government that already dominates the domestic economy also leads the charge overseas to find a home for surplus capital.- Click here to add your comments

182;CSX;CSX Corp;2005-08-30T20:35:13Z;Stocks lower as Katrina damage is assessed;;Hurricane Katrina depressed Wall Street stocks on Tuesday with retailers and transportation companies suffering most as one of the worst hurricanes to hit the US continued to wreak havoc in the south of the country.The storm knocked the market both by helping to push oil prices to yet another record high and through catastrophic damage to infrastructure in the storm’s path, and therefore to the bottom lines of insurance companies.Nine and a half weeks after oil prices caused consternation by passing the $60 a barrel mark, crude soared past $70 to $70.85, sparking concerns that high energy costs could damage the US economy by slashing corporate profits and finally ending the spending spree of the country’s heavily indebted consumers. Nymex crude futures finished the day up $2.61 at $69.81.Retailers and restaurants dominated the top 10 fallers in the S&P 500 with Staples, the office supply chain, falling 2.9 per cent to $21.85 and Darden Restaurants fell 2.8 per cent to $30.61. Tiffany, the jewellers, fell 2.6 per cent to $33.31. Wal-Mart also fell 1 per cent to $45.19 after announcing that 123 stores had been shut down due to a power cut.Insurers and re-insurers suffered. Shares of American International Group fell 0.4 per cent $59.28 and Hartford Financial Services dropped almost 0.3 per cent to $73.15.The transport sector, another area of the US economy that will see profits squeezed by higher oil prices, was also well down. United Parcel Service was 1.1 per cent down at $70.42 and CSX, a rail freight company, slipped 1.7 per cent to $44.85.The oil price was bad news for long-suffering airlines with Delta Air Lines, the cash strapped carrier widely expected to be the next airline to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, down 5.5 per cent to $1.20. The Amex airline index dipped 3 per cent at 46.75.All of which left the indices lower by the close, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.5 per cent at 10,412.82 and the S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent at 1,208.41. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent at 2,129.76.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, said the bears need not despair, however, citing a “longer-term rally”.“That rally is a series of higher-lows. Even the weakest market average remains above its June low. If this decline bottoms out around these levels, it will appear to be just a normal pullback within the context of that ongoing rally.”The news that a measure of consumer confidence showed that Americans’ attitudes about the economy improved in August only gave the most brief of respites to indices. While the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence rose in August the US Commerce Department released a report showing a less than expected decline in factory orders in July.Oil producers continued to benefit from high prices with ConocoPhillips, the largest US refiner, gaining 2.1 per cent to $64.41. Halliburton, the world’s biggest oilfield services company, rose 3.5 per cent to $59.84.After rising, Sprint Nextel, the third largest US mobile-telephone company, which announced it had agreed to buy an affiliate for $427m, fell 1.3 per cent to $25.25.
183;CSX;CSX Corp;2005-08-14T15:58:31Z;US grapples with rails' heavy load;;US railroad operators are increasing investment in infrastructure and labour as they seek to overcome chronic congestion across the system.CSX, one of the biggest US rail freight carriers, last week became the latest to lift capital expenditure, with some of the additional cash earmarked for urgently-needed capacity expansion.Congestion on the railroads is part of a broader capacity crisis gripping the country's freight transportation system, with ocean ports and truck operators also under strain.Railroad operators have sought to tackle the problem by hiring thousands of new workers, leasing more rolling stock and building new tracks and rail yards.CSX said annual capital expenditure over the next two years would be $1.3bn-$1.4bn, up from an average of $1bn over the past three years. The increase will fund large-scale infrastructure improvement projects on two of the company's busiest lines: those between Chicago and Florida and between Albany and New York City.“These investments will enable CSX to meet demand for freight service to the rapidly growing south-east while continuing to improve service in the populous north-east,” said Michael Ward, chief executive.However, with construction not scheduled to start until 2006, the investment will do nothing to ease congestion this year.Most operators, among them Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and BNSF, have improved service levels compared with last year.But delays continue to blight the rail network, especially around large ocean ports and coal mining regions. A combination of record demand for energy and rail bottlenecks have caused some power stations to run short of coal.Analysts blame the railroad capacity crunch on years of under-investment in infrastructure and reductions in workforce.Many critics believe this year's increases in spending fall far short of what is needed. Railroads, scarred by decades of boom-to-bust cycles, are reluctant to invest too much for fear of being left with surplus capacity should the economy falter.Soaring demand and capacity shortages helped railroad operators achieve record profits over recent quarters. Share prices in the sector have also risen.CSX's Mr Ward said a co-operative relationship was developing between road and rail services, with long distance freight shipments increasingly being made by rail while local deliveries were made by road.Mr Ward predicted that US freight hauling demand would increase by 40 per cent over the next 15 years, assuming average annual increases in industrial production and consumer spending of at least 3 per cent.
184;CSX;CSX Corp;2004-12-21T21:40:51Z;Wall St hits three-and-a-half year high;;"Wall Street steamed ahead on Tuesday, boosted by strong gains in transportation stocks and an upbeat report from the chip sector. Pharmaceuticals were also in the spotlight after a new study raised fresh questions about painkiller safety.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 10,759.43 - a 3½-year high - while the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent at 1,205.45. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,150.91.A strong rally in October and November has left shares in the leading US indices hovering near their highest levels since 2001, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq touching 3½-year highs last week. The strong gains that came in the wake of the US presidential election have given way this month to slower progress on Wall Street, however, leaving stocks trading mostly flat in spite of a slew of year-end merger and acquisition activity.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries & Co, said an expected slowdown in corporate earnings growth seemed to be the biggest factor keeping gains in check.Earnings among companies in the S&P 500 grew by 19 per cent this year, while forecasts for next year are 10 per cent.""I would argue that stock valuations still are relatively attractive, especially given the interest rate environment,"" said Mr Hogan.Most analysts predict that the stock market will continue to creep higher until the year's end, as bullish investors look to the first post-Christmas trading sessions for signs of sustained vigour. One analyst said he expected to increased volatility in share prices this week as Wall Street gradually empties ahead of the Christmas holiday.Transport stocks led gainers on what is traditionally the busiest shipping day of the year. FedEx, the biggest express shipper, rose 0.4 per cent to $100.53, while rival UPS climbed 1 per cent to $86.48.Railroad shares rallied as Union Pacific, the country's biggest independent rail operator, raised its fourth-quarter outlook. Union Pacific shares jumped 5.5 per cent to $65.67. Shares in Norfolk Southern, the third-biggest rail operator by market capitalisation, were up 3 per cent at $36.21, while CSX, the rail freight group, rose 2 per cent to $39.82.Railroads have seen record shipping volumes this year, driven by a booming harvest in the midwest and soaring demand for US exports.Semiconductor stocks jumped as investors welcomed a report from Gartner saying that worldwide chipmaker revenue should grow by 23 per cent this year in spite of a slowdown in growth in the second half. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 0.7 per cent to 422.48. Intel, the world's biggest microchip company, received an additional boost following a Lehman Brothers upgrade. Intel's shares rose 3.5 per cent to $23.49. Intel's chief rival, Advanced Micro Devices, fell 0.5 per cent to $21.73.Pharmaceutical stocks remained in the spotlight after clinical studies raised new questions about the safety of two popular painkillers. Pfizer rebounded after falling more than 16 per cent following Friday's news that its Celebrex arthritis drug increased the risk of heart attacks in patients. Shares in the drugs group rose 2.8 per cent to $24.97 after US health regulators said that Alzheimer's patients taking Celebrex in a separate study did not show elevated cardiac risk. Merck, whose withdrawn Vioxx painkiller uses an active ingredient similar to the one in Celebrex, rose 1.5 per cent to $31.98.The US-listed shares of Bayer, the German drugs group, rose 0.5 per cent in spite of warnings that Naproxen, the active ingredient in Bayer's Aleve painkiller, had increased the risk of heart attacks in the same Alzheimer's trials.Elsewhere, IAC InterActivecorp, the media and travel group run by Barry Diller, jumped 5.9 per cent to $27.41 after it said it would spin off its Expedia online travel service.Investors were also focused on financial stocks on Tuesday after earnings reports by two big US investment banks. Morgan Stanley, the biggest US investment bank by volume, rose 1.6 per cent to $54.50 as earnings beat expectations. Bear Stearns gave up early gains to fall 1.7 per cent to $102.70 after it reported sharply higher quarterly profits.Energy stocks were the laggards among the S&P 500, with Sunoco shares down 0.1 per cent to $82.88. John Herrlin, vice president at Merrill Lynch, said petroleum prices were likely to remain volatile in the short term."
185;CSX;CSX Corp;2004-12-09T02:29:04Z;Dubai Ports wins bid for CSX assets;;Dubai Ports Authority announced on Thursday that it had signed an agreement with CSX Corporation to buy its international ports operations, after the FT revealed on Tuesday that it emerged as a surprise challenger to Singapore's PSA International and Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa over the coveted assets.It will pay the New York-listed company US$1.15bn for the ports, clinching a rare opportunity for foreign groups to buy into Hong Kong, the world's busiest container hub and one that is dominated by Hutchison.The offer valued the business at 17 times this year?s forecast earnings of US$67m before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation.The move by Dubai Ports International, DPA's overseas arm, highlights its aim of moving away from its Middle Eastern stronghold to take advantage of China's rising importance in global trade flows.The deal was a blow to PSA, which last week bought a majority stake in Asia Container Terminals, a smaller operator in Hong Kong, from local developer Sun Hung Kai Properties for HK$2.6bn (US$333m). The deal was believed to have made PSA a frontrunner for the CSX operation, which also owns a stake in ACT.Analysts said the main reason for Hutchison's interest in CSX was to keep arch-rival PSA out of Hong Kong.DPI, which has interests in India and Djibouti, will take over the control of CSX ports in Hong Kong, China, Australia, Germay, Dominican Republic and Venezuela in the first quarter of next year.
186;CSX;CSX Corp;2004-11-14T22:37:51Z;Freight prices expected to boost US rail industry;;North America's railway companies are likely to remain buoyed by higher rail freight prices as an acute driver shortage afflicts the trucking industry and as record demand for coal and agricultural shipments drives rail freight volumes.But the industry remains bedevilled by rail bottlenecks, high fuel prices and high employee attrition rates, posing difficulties for some of the less efficient operators.James Valentine, transportation analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report: “We have increased confidence that the recent pricing gains by the railroads are likely to persist into 2005, especially for those railroads that can provide strong service levels.”The four largest US-based companies recently reported generally higher than expected third-quarter earnings and record revenues amid strong demand for coal, chemicals and agricultural goods. The demand is being driven by an improving US economy and demand from China.With rail and trucking capacity forecast to remain under strain for at least the next 12 months, the current high pricing environment is likely to stay robust, analysts say.But not all railways have made equal progress overcoming network congestion and slowing train speeds a key measure of efficiency.Companies are also in the midst of hiring programmes after 2001 legislation allowing early retirement. Dave Dealy, vice president of transportation at Burlington Northern Sante Fe, told analysts on Friday: “We could possibly lose about half our current transportation employee base in the next five to six years.”BNSF, which operates a network in the western US, said third-quarter freight revenues were up 16 per cent year-on-year. Excluding a charge related to asbestos liability accounting, earnings per share were 77 cents, compared with 55 cents last time.Mr Valentine said BNSF's operating results were “impressive”.Union Pacific, which serves two-thirds of the US west of the Mississippi river, reported the same earnings per share. Gregory Burns, US air freight and surface transportation analyst at JP Morgan, said Union Pacific's third-quarter pricing growth was “lacklustre” and that margins contracted due to high fuel costs and network congestion.CSX Corporation, which operates the largest network in the eastern US, is in the midst of a turnround plan.While it reported earnings per share of 50 cents, excluding a restructuring charge, compared with a loss last year of minus 48 cents, Mr Valentine said: “We continue to believe that there is considerably more execution risk at CSX than its competitors, given the uncertainty surrounding the turnround of its operations.”
