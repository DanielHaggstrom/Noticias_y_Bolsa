0;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2019-01-31T18:45:11Z;Northrop Grumman, Raytheon latest defence groups with cautious 2019 views;;Northrop Grumman and Raytheon joined their peers in offering cautious 2019 profit forecasts on Thursday, despite robust weapons demand.Defense suppliers are poised to benefit from a proposal backed by President Donald Trump to boost the US defence budget to $750bn, from its current $716bn, though the funding needs congressional approval. In the meantime, industrial giants are facing headwinds from rising raw material costs and global trade tensions.Northrop Grumman chief executive Kathy Warden also warned that a defence spending cap could return in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 if Mr Trump and lawmakers can’t agree on a budget deal, she said during a conference call with analysts. Ms Warden added that Northrop Grumman has not seen a significant financial impact from the partial government shutdown that ended on Friday.Weaker than expected guidance from the pair of Pentagon contractors followed similar views from Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, who each issued earnings guidance that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations this week.Falls Church, Virginia-based Northrop Grumman, known for the B-2 stealth bomber and Global Hawk surveillance drones, expects to book sales of $34bn for the full year. While that implies 13 per cent growth year-over-year, the forecast missed Wall Street’s estimate of $34.2bn. The company also said it foresees earnings rising to between $18.50 and $19 per share, less than the $19.49 analysts estimated and also below adjusted earnings of $21.33 a share it achieved in 2018.Raytheon’s forecast calls for 2019 earnings of $11.40 to $11.60 a share, missing the average estimate of $11.78. The maker of Tomahawk and Patriot missiles said sales are on track to hit $28.6bn to $29.1bn. Analysts had estimated $29bn.Tax reform helped Raytheon more than double its fourth-quarter net income to $832m, or $2.93 a share. Sales grew 8.5 per cent to $7.36bn on strength in missiles and integrated defence systems.Northrop Grumman earned quarterly net income of $356m, or $2.06 a share, down from $672m, or $3.83 a share, in the year-ago period. Earnings were $4.93 a share on an adjusted basis. Revenue surged about 25 per cent to $8.16bn, partly due to growth in the company’s aerospace business that builds the centre fuselage for the F-35 fighter jet.Shares in Northrop Grumman shed earlier losses to trade 0.1 per cent higher on Thursday afternoon. Raytheon was down 2.9 per cent.
1;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2019-01-17T19:17:16Z;US defence stocks boosted by Trump missile plan;;Shares of top US defence contractors were fired up on Thursday after the Trump administration called for stronger missile defence capabilities.The new defence strategy, part of a Missile Defense Review, includes a plan to create a network of sensors in space that can quickly detect enemy missiles. In remarks at the Pentagon, President Donald Trump said the nation’s goal is to “ensure we can detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States — anywhere, anytime, anyplace.”The government’s report called North Korea an “extraordinary” threat to the US and cited other threats from Iran, Russia and China.Pentagon suppliers that work on missile technology soared as Mr Trump unveiled the plan.Northrop Grumman was the biggest winner in afternoon trading, with shares climbing 2.9 per cent. Lockheed Martin, the largest US defence contractor and the company behind the THAAD missile defence system, rallied 1.5 per cent. Raytheon, known for the Tomahawk and Patriot missiles, posted a 1.3 per cent gain. Boeing was up 1.1 per cent.Boeing won an additional $6.56bn contract from the US military early last year to continue supporting the ground-based midcourse defence system and build more domestic interceptors. In July, the Pentagon said Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon would receive a joint $4.1bn contract for anti-ballistic missile defence work.
2;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2018-10-24T11:43:47Z;US defence contractor Northrop Grumman lifts 2018 profit forecast;Stronger outlook comes as military equipment maker sees wider profit margins;Northrop Grumman on Wednesday lifted its full year profit outlook after the US defence group, which makes everything from autonomous aircraft to radar systems, posted sales rises last quarter in two of its biggest divisions.The Virginia-based company that derives the bulk of its business from contracts with the US government has significantly increased its profit outlook after previously boosting it in July of this year. It now sees earnings per diluted share of between $18.75 and $19, up from $16.60 to $16.85. Analysts had forecast $16.94, according to a FactSet survey.Northrop held steady its estimate for $30bn in 2018 revenues, but said it now expects operating profit margin in the mid-12 per cent range — an improvement from the high 11-percent forecast from July. Net interest expense is expected to be $500m, down from $520m previously, despite a rise in global interest rates.The group’s California-headquartered Aerospace Systems division, which is developing the next-generation long-range US bomber, logged a 5 per cent rise in third-quarter profits to $3.28bn. Mission Systems, which makes sensors, radar and other technology used by the military and intelligence communities, increased sales by 3 per cent to $2.91bn. Technology Services lagged behind, with revenues sinking 12 per cent to $1.04bn.Overall revenues jumped to $8.09bn, from $6.57bn during the same three-month period in 2017, slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates of $8bn. The figure was polished by revenues from Orbital, the specialist aviation and space contractor that Northrop bought in a $9.2bn deal this summer. The division, which has since been rebranded Innovation Systems, generated sales of $1.42bn.“Our third-quarter results demonstrated solid growth and strong performance from our operations, including the first full quarter of Innovation Systems, as we continue to position the company for long-term profitable growth,” said Wes Bush, chairman and chief executive officer of Northrop Grumman.Net profits climbed to $1.1bn, or $6.54 per diluted share, in the third quarter from $643m, or $3.67 per share, in the same quarter in 2017.Shares rose by just over 1 per cent in pre-market action in New York. They were down 0.91 per cent for the year to date as of Tuesday’s close, significantly worse than the S&P aerospace and defence index, which is up 5.4 per cent in 2018.
3;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2018-07-25T11:50:00Z;Orbital deal costs weigh on US defence group Northrop Grumman;;The $9.2bn acquisition of Orbital, a specialised aviation and space contractor, boosted sales at Northrop Grumman by around $400m in the three weeks after the deal closed, the US defence contractor said on Wednesday, but costs from the deal weighed on profits.Second-quarter sales across the combined group climbed by 10 per cent from the same time a year earlier, Northrop said, reaching $7.1bn in the three months to the end of June. That included sales of $400m for Orbital — now rebranded as “Innovation Systems” — for the period between June 7 and June 30.For the latest quarter, net earnings rose 24 per cent to $689m — $3.93 a share. While net profits included earnings from Innovation Systems since the deal closed, Northrop said they were “more than offset by a full quarter of net interest expense related to the acquisition and deal-related costs”.The acquisition, which was announced last September, formed part of a wave of consolidation in the aerospace sector as companies have sought scale. US defence stocks were significant beneficiaries in the wake of the election of Donald Trump as president, but Northrop’s shares have faltered since the start of 2018, up just 3 per cent year-to-date and down by nearly 5 per cent over the past three months, despite regular upgrades to its earnings guidance.On Wednesday Northrop also once again lifted its estimate for full-year diluted earnings per share, which are now expected to be in the range of $16.60 to $16.85, up from $16.20 to $16.45 at the time the Orbital deal closed in June. The company also said its effective tax rate would be “mid 16 per cent” rather than around 17 per cent, and free cash flow would be at the top half of its previously guided range.Operating income from its units also climbed, but by only 3 per cent. Higher sales were partially offset by slimmer margins in Northrop’s mission systems and technology services business, the company said, and lacked the benefit of a $54m claim related to costs incurred in earlier years that flattered the comparative. Including the effects of general corporate expenses — including £23m of one-off deal costs and the amortisation of $21m of acquired intangible assets — group operating income and margin fell to $832m and 11.6 per cent respectively, from $873m and 13.5 per cent a year earlier.“With this quarter’s addition of Innovation Systems to our portfolio, along with robust internal investment, we continue to strengthen our foundation for long-term profitable growth,” Northrop chairman and chief executive Wes Bush said.
4;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Northrop Grumman chief executive to step down at year’s end;;Northrop Grumman said on Thursday that its chief executive, Wes Bush, will step down at the end of 2018 after eight years in the US defence group’s top job.Mr Bush will be replaced by Kathy Warden, currently Northrop’s president and chief operating officer, the company said. Mr Bush will stand down from the chief executive post on January 1 and relinquish his role as chairman of the company’s board of directors in July 2019.Mr Bush has held a number of leadership roles at Northrop, including chief financial officer and chief operating officer. He took over as chief executive in 2010. His successor, Ms Warden, has been with Northrop since 2008, the company said.
5;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Defence stocks fall after Trump-Kim summit;;Defence stocks traded lower on Tuesday following the landmark summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that essentially averted military confrontation between the two nations.Suppliers of military hardware and related companies sometimes see their share prices jump as geopolitical concerns — such as North Korea’s missile tests last summer or US strikes on Syria this year — flare up.Messrs Trump and Kim concluded their first ever bilateral talks on June 12 in Singapore, with both pledging “lasting and robust peace regime” on the Korean Peninsula. Mr Kim vowed for complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula while Trump said Washington will pull out thousands of troops stationed in South Korea, ending fiery rhetoric that once brought the two leaders on the brink of an armed conflict.The thaw in Pyongyang-Washington relations has sent some defence stocks lower during morning trade in New York.Raytheon dipped 3.9 per cent to $206.31 per shareNorthrop Grumman slid 1.6 per cent to $328.53 per shareLockheed Martin dropped 1.6 per cent to $315.54 per shareHarris Corporation shed 1.2 per cent to $152.4 per shareThe broader S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent.A successful implementation of the agreement in Singapore could pave the way for an end of the Korean conflict.

6;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2018-04-25T11:28:20Z;Northrop Grumman posts upbeat results, lifts earnings outlook;;US defence contractor Northrop Grumman on Wednesday posted upbeat earnings aided by a lower tax rate and lifted its earnings outlook for the year.The Virginia-based company said its net income rose to $739m or $4.21 a share, compared with $650m or $3.69 a share in the year ago period.That topped analysts’ estimates for earnings of $3.61 a share, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.Profits were partly boosted by the US tax overhaul which saw Northrop’s tax rate slip to 15.2 per cent in the first quarter from 17.5 per cent in the year ago period.Sales rose 5 per cent from a year ago to $6.7bn, compared with forecasts for $6.6bn. That was driven by a 10 per cent rise in its aerospace systems because of higher demand for its manned aircraft and a 3 per cent increase in missions systems which were boosted by demand for sensors and processing programs. The gains in the two units that account for the bulk of Northrop’s sales was partially offset by a decline in its technology services unit.Following the upbeat first-quarter results, Northrop boosted its full-year earnings outlook to $15.40 to $15.65 a share, up from its previous expectation for $15 to $15.25 a share. The company maintained its outlook for sales of $27bn and free cash flow in the range of $2bn to $2.3bn.A failure by Lockheed Martin to raise its outlook for cash flow this year even as the US government boosts defence spending, had prompted a sell-off in defence stocks on Tuesday.After capital expenditures of about $305m Northrop on Wednesday announced a negative cash flow of $542m, compared with $655m in the year ago quarter. Northrop has previously said that its $9.2bn acquisition of Orbital ATK will prove accretive to free cash flow in the first full-year after the deal closes.Northrop shares, up 11 per cent year-to-date, rose 1.5 per cent in pre-market trading.
7;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2018-01-25T17:42:23Z;Upbeat guidance boosts Northrop Grumman;US defence contractor stands out after sales beat expectations;Northrop Grumman was among the top gainers on the S&P 500 on Thursday after the US defence contractor delivered upbeat guidance, higher-than-expected quarterly sales and raised its quarterly dividend.Shares in the Virginia-based company rose 3 per cent to $322.94 after it forecast expects 2018 sales of $27bn and earnings per share of between $15 to $15.25, ahead of analysts’ estimates for revenues of $26.9bn and earnings of $14.23 a shareNorthrop, which makes the B-21 Raider long-range bomber, and other defence contractors that derive the bulk of their revenues domestically are considered among the biggest winners of the overhaul that has cut the corporate tax rate to 21 per cent, from 35 per cent. Moreover, amid rising military budgets in Russia and China, as well as geopolitical concerns, Northrop and its peers are benefiting from higher demand for weapons.In the fourth quarter, Northrop said its sales increased 4 per cent to $6.6bn, ahead of analysts’ forecasts of $6.4bn, driven by aerospace and missions systems. Northrop also lifted its quarterly dividend by 10 per cent to $1.10 a share as part of a broader set of capital deployment moves.The advance came alongside a broader advance on Wall Street. By midday in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to 2,844.22, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 26,411.30. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 7,434.32.Elsewhere, shares in Newell Brands fell 22 per cent, hitting their lowest level since 2013, after the company behind everything from Sharpie pens to Rubbermaid customers lowered its forecast and unveiled plans to shed product lines and close factories.The New Jersey-based company announced that it will examining ways to speed up a planned transformation, boost its operations and improve shareholder returns. A key aspect of that will be to focus its portfolio on nine consumer-facing brands that comprise about $11bn in net sales and offer “attractive margins” and “growth potential”, the company said.As part of that, it has started exploring “strategic options” for some commercial-facing businesses. The goal is to reduce its global factory and warehouse footprint by about 50 per cent, halve its customer base and consolidate global sales, Newell said.The plan was unveiled alongside a downgraded forecast, with the company projecting core sales to 0.8 per cent growth. Normalised earnings per share are expected to come in between $2.72 and $2.76, versus previous guidance for $2.80-$2.85.
8;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2018-01-25T12:41:45Z;Northrop Grumman outlook bolstered by lower taxes;;US defence group Northrop Grumman on Thursday delivered upbeat guidance from a lower tax rate, higher-than-expected quarterly sales and raised its quarterly dividend.The Virginia-based company said it sees 2018 sales of $27bn and earnings per share of between $15 to $15.25. That is ahead of analysts’ estimates for revenues of $26.9bn and earnings of $14.23 a share. However, this doesn’t reflect the pending acquisition of Orbital ATK, which is expected to close in the first half of the year.Northrop which makes the B-21 Raider long-range bomber and makes parts for the F-35 combat jet, also said it projects capital expenditures of $1bn, up from $928m in 2017, as a result of benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act pushed through by Republicans in December.Indeed, defence contractors that derive the bulk of their revenues domestically are considered among the biggest winners of the overhaul that has lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 per cent, from 35 per cent previously. Moreover, amid growing military budgets in Russia and China and geopolitical concerns as a result of tensions with North Korea, Northrop and its peers are benefiting from higher demand for weapons.For the fourth quarter, Northrop said its sales increased 4 per cent to $6.6bn, ahead of analysts' expectations of $6.4bn.A breakdown showed that sales rose by 5 per cent in the aerospace systems division to $3bn driven by growth in manned aircraft and autonomous systems. Sales climbed by six per cent to $3.03bn in its mission systems unit but fell one per cent in its technology services arm.However, its net earnings fell to $178m or $1.01 a share, compared with $525m or $2.96 a share in the year ago period.Northrop became the latest US company to have its quarterly results muddied by the changes to the tax code. Higher tax expenses tied to the writedown of tax-deferred assets and a pre-tax pension contribution reduced net earnings by $317m or $1.81 a share. Adjusting for those one-time items, Northrop reported earnings of $2.82 a share, that was ahead of analysts’ estimates of $2.74 a share, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.Northrop also lifted its quarterly dividend by 10 per cent to $1.10 a share as part of a broader set of capital deployment moves announced by the company.Northrop’s shares have climbed 2 per cent so far this year.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
10;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2018-01-09T18:05:16Z;SpaceX defends rocket after reports of launch failure;Mystery surrounds fate of secret US government payload feared destroyed;SpaceX, the private space launch company owned by Elon Musk, says the rocket that carried a classified US government payload into orbit over the weekend performed normally, following reports that the launch ended in failure.Mystery surrounded the fate of the secret mission on Tuesday, but in a statement to the Financial Times, the president of SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell, defended the performance of its Falcon 9 rocket used for the launch.Late on Monday, the Wall Street Journal appeared to confirm an initial report by a space blogger that the unknown payload — known only as Zuma — had crashed back to Earth following the launch on Sunday, citing industry and government officials.The Zuma launch was only the third national security mission carried out by SpaceX. Success in delivering sensitive military payloads into orbit is a key part of the company’s strategy, after it broke a longstanding monopoly held by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, on putting Pentagon payloads into space.The report said the secret payload failed to separate as planned from the second stage of one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets and is believed to have been destroyed as it plunged back through the atmosphere. The FT has been unable to confirm the status of the mission but normal practice is for either SpaceX or the customer to confirm its success, which did not happen this time.If the mission has been a failure, however, apportioning responsibility will be a priority. Ms Shotwell said that SpaceX was satisfied its rocket performed correctly and saw no need to make any changes to its future launch schedule.“For clarity: after review of all data to date, Falcon 9 did everything correctly on Sunday night. If we or others find otherwise based on further review, we will report it immediately. Information published that is contrary to this statement is categorically false. Due to the classified nature of the payload, no further comment is possible,” Ms Shotwell said.The response from SpaceX is in stark contrast to that of Northrop Grumman, the US defence company, which is the prime contractor for the mysterious payload. In a statement Northrop said: “This is a classified mission. We cannot comment on classified missions.”The Pentagon also cited its policy of not commenting on classified missions, and referred questions about the launch vehicle to SpaceX.A report by the Verge, suggested that the reason SpaceX could claim success is that the mechanism designed to separate the space craft from the rocket was designed by Northrop and not SpaceX, citing an earlier report by Wired.Other reports speculated the payload may have separated but then failed to activate.Mr Musk’s space launch company was chosen by Northrop Grumman to launch Zuma. The level of secrecy around the mission goes beyond that of most classified US government launches, and it is unclear whether the payload was a satellite or some other hardware.Launches of most US spy satellites at the very least identify the government agency involved — usually the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) — but in the case of Zuma there are almost no details of the mission other than that the payload was due to be delivered into a low-earth orbit, typically used by both commercial telecommunications and weather satellites as well as military spy satellites.According to the North American Aerospace Defence Command, there are 1,700 operational satellites orbiting the earth. Nigel Bannister, associate professor at the University of Leicester’s physics and astronomy department, said that while it is possible to track and record the launch of a new satellite, it was impossible to know the purpose of each one.“There are a lot of satellites up there that are known and catalogued but their mission remit is heavily secured,” he said, adding: “All satellite systems are hugely complex. There are a huge number of things that can go wrong.”After getting approval from the Pentagon, SpaceX flew its first two military payloads into space last year. The first was a spy satellite for the NRO while the second was the X-37B, an experimental, robotic space shuttle, for the US air force.Ms Shotwell said that plans to test a new more powerful version of the Falcon 9 rocket, known as the Falcon Heavy, remained on schedule, as did the next schedule launch of a commercial satellite on the same version of the rocket involved in Sunday’s launch.This article has been amended since original publication to correct the number of operational satellites orbiting the earth.

12;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2017-10-25T16:03:45Z;Wall St falls from record levels as investors digest earnings;;US stocks retreated from record levels on Wednesday as investors digested a batch of disappointing earnings.The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 2,551.37 driven by a 2.2 per cent drop in the telecoms sector and 1.1 per cent slide in industrials. Each of the 11 major sectors on the S&P 500 and 84 per cent of stocks on the index were in the red.Meanwhile, the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 per cent to 23,335.83 after Boeing, the heaviest weighted component on the benchmark index, slid 2.3 per cent to $259.90 having posted disappointing results. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 6,527.90.Chipotle was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 after it posted disappointing quarterly results, raising concerns about a recovery at the burrito chain. AT&T weighed on telecoms after the company said its quarterly sales fell more than forecast and Advanced Micro Devices also took a hit after saying it expects revenues to fall in the current quarter.However the results weren’t all dire. Payments company Visa and defence group Northrop Grumman both advanced after their results topped expectations.Investors appeared to ignored upbeat durable goods data in the US and sales of newly built homes, which rose by the most since 1992 amid an increase in sales in the South that was battered by a string of hurricanes. They also await updates on who President Donald Trump may nominate to succeed Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair.Wednesday’s sell-off left the S&P 500 at risk of snapping a second consecutive “perfect week” of record closing highs. The move came amid a pick up in volatility with the Vix volatility index, Wall Street’s fear gauge which measures the short-term volatility implied by S&P 500 option prices, rose 14 per cent (1.67 points) to 12.74 and was up 27 per cent on the week.Elsewhere in markets, US Treasuries pared back their losses. The yield on the 10-year, which had fallen to a 7-month low was up 2 basis points to 2.439 per cent. Yields move inversely to price. Meanwhile, the dollar index, a gauge of the buck against a basket of peers, slid 0.1 per cent to 93.67.

The yield for the more policy sensitive 2-year note climbed to a new 9-year high of 1.6187 per cent while the 30-year Treasury yield was up nearly 4bps at 2.9730 per cent, putting it at a level last seen in May.The moves come as a run of strong earnings from large US industrial companies fuel optimism over the outlook for the US and global economy. Boeing and Northrop Grumman followed Caterpillar, United Technologies, General Motors and 3M to report earnings above analysts’ forecasts for the third quarter.The optimism was further reinforced by strong durable goods data, which rose by the most last month since June.Hopes that President Trump would be able to push through his tax reform plans along with unconfirmed reports that he is favoring policy hawk John Taylor as a possible successor to Fed chair Janet Yellen have also prompted investors to ramp up their rate hike bets.Interest rate expectations are also driving the dollar higher, with the DXY index up 0.1 per cent at 93.84. Gold, which offers no yield, fell for a second straight day, dropping 0.4 per cent to $1,271.23 per troy ounce.US stock futures slipped. Futures for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 are both down 0.2 per cent while those for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were trading 0.1 per cent lower.

Analysts had forecast earnings of $2.88 a share, according to Thomson Reuters data.Revenues rose 6 per cent to $6.5bn, above estimates of $6.3bn aided primarily by an 11 per cent increase in aerospace system sales — the company’s largest division — which includes its manned aircraft and space programmes.“All three of our businesses continue to execute well,” said chief executive Wes Bush. “Our third quarter operational performance in combination with strategic actions, such as the agreement to acquire Orbital ATK, continues to support our strategy to drive profitable growth over the long term.”Last month Northrop said it would pay $7.8bn in cash for rival Orbital ATK and assume $1.4bn in net debt amid a recent wave of consolidation in the aerospace industry.The company lifted its earnings outlook for the third time this year. It now expects earnings of between $12.90 and $13.10 a share, from its previous forecast of EPS between $12.10 to $12.40.US defence companies have enjoyed a boost since Donald Trump won the presidential election after he promised to invest heavily in the sector and amid tensions with North Korea, which has been conducting a string of missile tests.Northrop shares are up more than 25 per cent so far this year.

The threat posed by Kim Jong Un is alarming, but it is a boon to the US military industrial complex.On Monday, Northrop, one of America’s big defence contractors, bought specialised aviation and space contractor Orbital ATK at an enterprise value of $9.2bn, all in cash. The one-day premium to Orbital ATK’s stock price was a mediocre 22 per cent. Yet the purchase price is more than double where Orbital traded when it was formed less than three years ago.A united Republican government in the US along with an increasingly hostile world have sent defence stocks soaring. A consequence of those turbo-charged valuations is firepower for big, pricey takeovers. There is little overlap between Northrop and Orbital.Northrop’s strength is in fighter jets and electronics. Orbital is known for rocket launch vehicles, missile technology and satellites. Northrop says it can cut $150m out of $4bn in annual costs at Orbital. But Mr Bush conceded the deal premium has little to do with efficiencies, but rather the opportunities from upcoming contracts to upgrade the US nuclear arsenal.Northrop shares rose about 2 per cent to hover near their all-time high. The stock is up a fifth since the US presidential election. The Trump bump has created expectations that defence spending will rise in future without pushing up near-term profits.Earnings and free cash flow multiples are around 20 times, steep levels usually reserved for consumer staples. US bank stocks have pulled back from post-election highs as tax cuts and regulatory reform have stalled. Increased defence spending is equally log-jammed. A bet on defence stocks — or the success of a defence takeover — depends as much on heightened belligerence among Washington Republicans as it does on sabre-rattling by North Korea.

Orbital shareholders will receive $134.50 a share in cash under the tie-up that is expected to close in the first half of 2018. Shares in Orbital ended last week at $110.The takeover by Northrop is the fourth significant one in the aerospace sector this year and comes just weeks after United Technologies agreed to acquire Rockwell Collins for $30bn.Earlier this year Rockwell acquired B/E Aerospace, which specialises in cabin interior systems for aircraft such as seats, galleys and lavatories, for $8.6bn, and French aero-engine maker Safran acquired aerospace equipment maker Zodiac for €8.7bn including debt.The deal also comes at a time when shares in defence companies have enjoyed a boost from Donald Trump’s election as US president last year as the former New York businessman has vowed to invest heavily in the sector.A potential military conflict with North Korea, which has been carrying out missile launch tests, including over Japan, has also lifted the equity values of US defence companies.Northrop has recently increased its full-year earnings outlook for a second time this year as it said that strong aerospace system sales helped it deliver upbeat second-quarter revenue.In July the company boosted its earnings outlook to a range of $12.10 to $12.40 a share, up from $11.80 to $12.10 a share previously, lifting its earnings guidance for the second time.Northrop said it expects the deal to be beneficial to both earnings and free cash flow in the first full year after the transaction closes, and provide pre-tax cost savings of $150m by 2020. On a pro forma 2017 basis, Northrop forecast sales of about $30bn.Orbital, which generates annual revenues of about $4.5bn, sells items ranging from missile launchers to ammunition and satellites.“Through our combination, customers will benefit from expanded capabilities, accelerated innovation and greater competition in critical global security domains,” said Wes Bush, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Northrop.“Our complementary portfolios and technology-focused cultures will yield significant value creation through revenue synergies associated with new opportunities, cost savings, operational synergies, and enhanced growth.”Perella Weinberg Partners is acting as exclusive financial adviser to Northrop and Cravath, Swaine & Moore is providing it legal counsel.

19;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2017-07-26T11:15:08Z;Defence contractor Northrop Grumman lifts earnings outlook again;;Defence giant Northrop Grumman lifted its full-year earnings outlook again on Wednesday even as it said strong aerospace system sales helped it deliver upbeat second quarter revenue.The Virginia-based company boosted its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $12.10 to $12.40 a share, up from $11.80 to $12.10 a share previously — lifting their earnings guidance for the second time.Northrop’s profits in the second quarter rose to $522m in the second quarter from $517m in the year ago period. On a per share basis, earnings climbed to $3.15, from $2.85 in the same period a year ago. That eclipsed Wall Street estimates of $2.86.Revenues rose 6 per cent to $6.4bn, topping analysts’ estimates of $6.2bn and were driven primarily by a 14 per cent increase in sales of aerospace systems to $2.97bn. Revenues in its Mission Systems division climbed 3 per cent, while those in its technology services unit declined 3 per cent amid lower volumes across the sector.Shares in defense companies have received a boost since November, when Donald Trump won the presidential election, on hopes that the president would boost defense spending and as Saudi Arabia’s government inked deals with US during Mr Trump’s visit in May.In the second quarter, Northrop was awarded a US air force contract valued at up to $243.9m that is expected to run through January 2019. US government orders accounted for nearly half the company’s revenues last year.Northrop shares have climbed nearly 14 per cent so far this year.
20;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Northrop lifts full-year earnings outlook, aerospace helps boost sales;;Defense contractor Northrop Grumman on Wednesday lifted its full-year earnings outlook and posted upbeat first quarter results, boosted by sales of aerospace systems.The Virginia-based company lifted its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $11.80 to $12.10, from its previous estimates of $11.30 to $11.60. It continued to project sales of $25bn.“The boost to guidance was driven by a lower tax rate and higher pension income. The outlook for revenues and segment profitability is unchanged,” Howard Rubel, analyst at Jefferies, noted.In the first quarter, Northrop’s profits rose to $640m or $3.63 a share, compared with $556m or $3.03 a share in the year ago period. That eclipsed analyst estimates of $2.92 a share. Sales increased 5 per cent to $6.3bn above analysts estimates of $6.1bn.Aerospace system sales rose 13 per cent year-on-year to $2.9bn driven by higher demand for manned aircraft programmes, including increased F-35 deliveries. Space sales were comparable to the prior year period. Sales in its Mission Systems unit rose 1.7 per cent to $2.74bn.However, sales in its technology services division, the company’s smallest unit, fell 1.6 per cent to $1.2bn driven be weaker sales for system modernisation service programmes and advanced defense services programmes.Northrop shares are up 7 per cent so far this year and were up 0.8 per cent in pre-market trading.
21;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;US defence spending: guns or butter;Despite the social media rhetoric, contractors should do well from Trump’s policy;“We have to start winning wars again,” explained President Donald Trump on Monday. His plan for victory is to outspend the enemy. It has worked before. Mr Trump’s budget is slated to include a $54bn boost — about a tenth — to the Pentagon spending in fiscal 2018 as well as supplemental spending this year of $30bn. The president views US military might as “depleted”, even though current outlay is equal to that of the next seven highest-spending nations combined.He may have a point. The 2011 austerity law known as sequestration capped defence spending growth just as it did social programmes. Hawks, including Trump critic senator John McCain, have been itching to buy more ships and tanks.For US defence contractors, the occasional presidential tweet accusing them of profligacy is simply an annoyance. They may sell a warplane more cheaply from time to time to humour him. But they will recoup the discount via higher volumes.Lockheed Martin has already withstood a Twitter bombardment over its F-35 jet. The programme is set to cost more than a whopping $400bn overall, double its initial estimate in 2001. The latest F-35 order completed earlier this month is, however, $728m cheaper than the last order, on a unit basis.Mr Trump’s jawboning deserves little credit for this. Incremental orders typically become less expensive. The programme overall is supposed to deliver more than 2,000 jets and there is the chance for the Pentagon to ask for even more. Twitter threats to shift procurement to a rival fighter produced by Boeing are hollow. Weapons systems are complex, as are the legal contracts that frame their procurement.And for all the volatility occasioned by social media activity, Lockheed shares are up nearly a quarter in the last year. Other defence heavyweights such as Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics have made similar moves.To pay for the ramp up, Mr Trump says he favours spending cuts elsewhere while ringfencing social security and Medicare. Guns and butter, however, usually go together. To separate them, either in fiscal expansion or contraction, usually begets its own kind of political war.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
22;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2017-01-26T12:49:48Z;Northrop Grumman issues downbeat earnings outlook;;Higher sales in its aerospace and mission systems units helped Northrop Grumman drive fourth quarter sales but the US defence contractor issued a downbeat earnings outlook for the year.The Virginia-based company said profits rose to $525m or $2.96 a share, compared with $459m or $2.49 a share in the year ago period. Sales climbed more than 12 per cent to $6.4bn driven by a near 20 per cent year-on-year jump in aerospace system sales and 9 per cent growth in missions system sales — the company’s largest divisions.Analysts had forecast earnings of $2.48 a share, on sales of $5.9bn.However, the company said it expects to earn between $11.30 a share to $11.60 a share in fiscal 2017, below the $12.25 a share that analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast.“For 2017, our outlook calls for continued investment to drive growth and performance, as we strengthen the foundation for long-term profitable growth,” Wes Bush, chief executive, said.Northrop, which in 2015 beat Boeing and Lockheed Martin for a $80bn contract to build the US Air Force’s new stealth bombers, posted its results at a time when President Donald Trump has criticised the US government for wasteful spending on defence programmes but at a time when he has also promised to build up the American military.Northrop shares advanced more than 23 per cent last year and are down less than 1 per cent so far this year.
23;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2016-12-23T11:32:29Z;US defence sector learns to live with Trump’s tweets;Social media barrage aimed at political base falls far short of spending plans;America’s biggest defence contractors cannot decide whether to be thrilled or terrified by Donald Trump.The titans of the US defence establishment beat a path to Mr Trump’s Florida resort on Wednesday to hear the president-elect warn that the US government is spending too much money on wasteful, over-budget, out-of-control defence programmes.At the same time, however, Mr Trump has consistently promised a build-up in America’s military — including his ambiguous pledge on Thursday to expand nuclear capability — which is one reason why aerospace and defence sector stocks have risen since election day. For all the bluster, a Trump administration could turn out to be good for the industry.On Wednesday, Boeing and Lockheed Martin sent their chief executives to placate Mr Trump, who has attacked both companies publicly this month. He started by claiming that a project involving Boeing to develop a new version of Air Force One was too expensive. Then he complained on Twitter that the costs of the F-35 — the Pentagon’s next-generation stealth jet being developed by Lockheed Martin — were “out of control”.Then on Thursday, he set one against one the other, turning up the heat under Lockheed by tweeting that he had asked Boeing to price its F-18 Super Hornet combat aircraft as an alternative to the F-35. Boeing tweeted back “ready to work with @realDonaldTrump’s administration to affordably meet US military requirements”.The politics for the White House of taking on defence companies — which often have a broad constituency of support across the country — can be complicated. But if he decides to make an issue of waste, Mr Trump will have some important allies, including John McCain, the Republican who chairs the Senate armed services committee. Mr McCain is likely to oppose some aspects of Mr Trump’s foreign policy, most notably over Russia. However earlier this year he said the F-35 project has “has been both a scandal and a tragedy with respect to cost, schedule and performance”.But many defence industry analysts and insiders are sceptical that the new administration can cut costs as much as Mr Trump has promised. Its Democratic predecessor has already squeezed hard to eliminate waste.“There is nothing wrong in asking hard questions,” says Howard Rubel, defence industry analyst at Jefferies. But the new administration “needs to understand the nuances of the budget, to learn how it all works, like with the presidential aircraft, you learn there is a lot of work to do before you know whether it’s too expensive or not”.Loren Thompson, a consultant who has worked with Lockheed Martin and other defence contractors, argues that unnecessary regulation drives up costs. In the case of the F-35, almost 8,000 test flights are needed before approval. “Every single major weapons system developed by the Pentagon is enmeshed in a framework of regulation that drives up the cost by as much as 20 per cent,” he said.Mr Trump could focus his attention on other targets, too. “Realistically, any big programme is at risk because almost any big defence programme is over-cost or was underperforming at some point,” Jason Gursky, aerospace and defence analyst at Citigroup Investment Research, wrote in a recent note. Mr Gursky highlights risks to the share prices of General Dynamics or Lockheed if the Littoral Combat Ship programme, the subject of debate about cancellation, is targeted by a tweet. Northrop Grumman could sustain tweet damage too, he theorises, though “there is no evidence that any of NOC’s programmes are underperforming”.But Richard Aboulafia, aircraft industry analyst at Teal Group, doubts there is much political traction in going after lower-profile targets than F-35 or Air Force One. “F-35 is the biggest defence contract in history, Air Force One, but beyond that you lose the attention of the political base, which just wants red meat,” he said. “Go after that Blackhawk maintenance contract? Snore. You are serving them broccoli.” Several analysts believe a sustained Twitter campaign could have diminishing impact on stocks: “Paradoxically the more Trump tweets about weapons programmes, the less impact it will have. One tweet out of the blue is a shock, one tweet every week for a month and people start to lose their sensitivity,” says Mr Thompson.Mr Aboulafia points out that, for all the talk of slashing waste, Mr Trump also promises a big increase in overall defence spending, the central pillar of making America great again in the world. “The Trump administration promises great things for defence,” he said. “The only downside: having to suffer through the occasional Trump tweet, aimed at pandering to the base and convincing them that he’s not just going to throw tens of billions of dollars at defence contractors (which he will).”

Overall lifetime costs of the programme have ballooned to $1.4tn amid development difficulties.The UK has won support work on the highest-value components, such as the electronic systems used on the aircraft and ejection seats. It will be the regional repair centre for all European based F-35s on 51 of the 65 components from 2025.The UK Ministry of Defence said the deal could be worth up to £2bn to UK industry, although defence analysts said this significantly underestimated the value to UK contractors such as BAE.“Through the lifetime of the programme, the value will be substantially in excess of that,” said Howard Wheeldon, of Wheeldon Strategic Advisory group. “This is a really good day for the UK in terms of gaining what is, even at this initial stage of the award process, a very important foothold in both the medium- and long-term F-35 support programme.”However, other experts questioned whether the US might be using the prospect of support work to tempt potential customers, including the UK. Many countries have proved to be more reluctant than expected to sign contracts for big batches of the fighter jet.The US Joint Program Office, which manages the project, said the award did “not preclude the opportunity for other F-35 partners and . . . customers . . . to participate and be assigned additional future sustainment workload”.The contracts awarded on Monday account for just 8 per cent of the work available.“Two billion over 40 years isn’t much,” said Francis Tusa, editor of Defence Analysis. “We are in a spectacularly high stakes game of poker.”The US had deferred the purchase of several hundred aircraft itself and programme costs were proving more difficult than expected to bring down, he said.Europe accounts for some 440 of the 3,137 proposed orders for the aircraft. The rest of the European support work will go to the Netherlands, also an F-35 customer. For the Pacific Region, support work on 64 of the first 65 components was awarded to Australia.BAE, Northrop Grumman and the Ministry of Defence said the award was significant, the first component support deal to be concluded outside the US.“This establishes Britain as a hub for all European F-35s and is hugely positive news for our high-tech and innovative defence industry,” said Michael Fallon, defence secretary. “It . . . will help to create hundreds of high-end jobs, safeguard thousands more and be a substantial boost to UK exports,” he said.Ian King, BAE chief executive, said: “The selection of the UK and Australia to undertake this activity is recognition of the advanced military aircraft support skills and capabilities we have in these countries.”“The selection of the U.K. to undertake this work is a notable achievement and recognises the military aircraft support skills and capabilities that we have here in the UK,” said Andrew Tyler, chief executive of Northrop Grumman’s European arm.

That topped estimates for $10.99.Northrop also raised its sales outlook to between $23.9bn to $24.1bn, from $23.5bn to $24bn previously. That compared to Wall Street’s expectations for $23.8bn.The news came alongside better than expected third quarter results. Net earnings rose to $602m or $3.35 a share, compared with $516m or $2.75 a share in the year ago period. That eclipsed analysts’ expectations for $2.79 a share. The results reflected a federal tax benefit of $42m or 23 cents per diluted share.Sales climbed 3 per cent to $6.2bn, above forecasts.Sales at its missions systems business slid 1 per cent to $2.8bn, while sales in its second largest unit focused on aerospace systems, climbed 9 per cent to $2.7bn.Northrop won the race to build the US Air Force’s new stealth bomber, beating a consortium of Boeing and Lockheed Martin that had valued the program at $80bn.Northrop shares, which have advanced 16 per cent so far this year, rose 2 per cent in early trading.
26;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Royal Navy warships cannot take the heat, MPs told;Advanced Type 45 destroyers breaking down in warm waters of Gulf;The engines powering the Royal Navy’s cutting-edge fleet of Type 45 destroyers are unable to operate continuously in the warm waters of the Gulf, MPs were told on Tuesday.Executives from BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Northrop Grumman and General Electric were grilled by the defence select committee about the failures that have caused the UK’s newest and most advanced destroyers to break down repeatedly in recent years, leaving them without power for propulsion or weapons systems.Responding to questions about why the power systems failed in warmer waters than the UK, John Hudson, managing director of BAE Systems maritime, said the original specifications for the vessel had not required it to sustain extremes. “The operating profile at the time was that there would not be repeated or continuous operations in the Gulf,” he said.Tomas Leahy, of Rolls-Royce naval programmes, said the destroyer was now operating in “far more arduous conditions than envisaged in the specifications”.However, the Ministry of Defence denied that this was the case. “The Type 45 was designed for worldwide operations from sub-Arctic to extreme tropical environments and continues to operate effectively in the Gulf and South Atlantic all year round.”The six ships, which cost the taxpayer £1bn each, are the backbone of Britain’s combat force at sea and are among the most advanced missile destroyers in the world. They are the Royal Navy’s first all-electric ships and are driven by two Rolls-Royce WR21 gas turbines and two Wartsila diesel engines.The WR21 is designed to deliver significantly improved operating costs by using an intercooler recuperator, which recovers exhaust and recycles the gas into the engine.But, as a rule, power turbines slowed down in warm temperatures, MPs were told. This had not been recognised by the system, which continued to demand more power. Eventually the generators would come to a halt. “This is not the fault of the WR21,” said Mr Leahy. “It is the laws of physics.”MPs could hardly believe what they had heard. “I am absolutely stunned,” said Douglas Chapman, of the Scottish National party. “To have a £1bn asset that you put into a war zone and we don’t know if those people we put there can come out alive — I am just astounded.”It also emerged that some of the difficulties were rooted in late-stage design changes demanded by the US Navy, when it was leading development of the electric propulsion system. However, the US Navy pulled out of the programme in 2000, when it was taken over by the UK’s MoD. Mr Leahy said that only 1,900 hours of testing had been carried out on the system after the design change, while the problems only emerged after 4,000-5,000 hours of operation.To have a £1bn asset that you put into a war zone and we don’t know if those people we put there can come out alive — I am just astounded“With hindsight it would have been good to do another 4,000-5,000 hours of testing on it,” he said.The MoD is having to set aside tens of millions of pounds to fix the destroyers. The plan is to install two extra diesel engines which will require cutting a hole in the hull of the brand new destroyers.MPs expressed concerns that the costs of repairing the Type 45 were forcing a delay in the Type 26 frigate programme. Original plans were for the first steel to be cut on the frigates by the end of this year, but this is now not likely before December 2017.Former First Sea Lord Alan West warned that any delay on the Type 26 programme could threaten the UK’s defensive capability, and lead to a serious erosion of shipbuilding skills, which would prove far more costly to rebuild. The government had already weakened the Royal Navy’s capabilities by cutting the number of frigates that would be ordered from 13 to eight in last year’s strategic defence and security review, he said.“There is almost no money available this year and we are really strapped next year. The government aren’t coming clean about that,” he said. “We have run out of money effectively and they [MoD] have pushed this programme to the right and that is bloody dangerous.”

So-called core EPS, which strips out certain costs, of $1.74 a share missed analysts’ expectations for $1.84.The company took a $156m or 24 cent a share after-tax charge tied to the development of its KC-46 tanker program. “”On the tanker program, we are making the investments necessary to meet our customer commitments, deliver the initial production aircraft on schedule, and transition the program into full production,” chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, said.Revenues climbed 2 per cent to $22.6bn, ahead of estimates for $21.5bn.Sales of commercial airplanes, the company’s largest division, fell 6 per cent to $14.4bn, while deliveries fell 4 per cent to 176. Meanwhile the company’s smaller defence business saw revenues advance 19 per cent to $7.96bn.Boeing recently lost a contract to build the US’ new stealth bomber to rival Northrop Grumman, raising doubts about the future of its military aircraft business. Earlier this year Boeing appointed Leanne Caret, a 28-year company veteran, as the president and chief executive officer of the its Defense, Space & Security business. It has also been reported that the company is pushing into the airplane parts business.Boeing shares, which have declined 9 per cent so far this year, slid nearly 2 per cent in pre-market trade.
28;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2016-02-26T20:02:38Z;Boeing gives up on $80bn US stealth bomber;;Northrop Grumman is now certain to be the builder of the US’s new, $80bn stealth bomber after its only rivals for the work said they were giving up further appeals over the award.A consortium of Boeing and Lockheed Martin on February 16 lost an appeal to the US’s Government Audit Office but had been expected to continue action against the decision in court. The Pentagon announced last October that it was giving the work to Northrop Grumman, US industry correspondent Robert Wright reports.The consortium said they remained “firmly convinced” of the validity of the issues they had raised in the protest but had decided “not to pursue further challenges”. “This decision was taken, as always, with the best interests of our customer and the warfighter in mind,” the consortium said.The news clears the way for Northrop Grumman to continue with work on the top-secret aircraft, intended to be able to penetrate the sophisticated, long-range air defences of potential adversaries such as China.The work keeps Northrop in the top ranks of US military contractors and one of only two companies – alongside Lockheed Martin and Boeing – capable of the final assembly of a modern military aircraft.The decision raises questions, however, about whether Boeing will maintain that status. While the company continues to assemble existing fighter designs such as the EA-18G Growler, many of its future orders are likely to be for adapted versions of its commercial jets, such as the US military’s KC-46 tanker, adapted from the 767 airliner, rather than pure military aircraft.Northrop’s shares were down 0.2 per cent at $192.50, while Boeing’s rose 1.5 per cent to $118.55.

The bomber is expected to be the biggest US military contract awarded this decade and much of the spending on fighter aircraft is concentrated on Lockheed’s $392bn F-35 joint strike fighter programme.The GAO gave no public information either of the details of Boeing’s complaint nor of its reasons for rejecting it, given the secrecy surrounding the project.But it said: “In denying Boeing’s protest, GAO has concluded that the technical evaluation, and the evaluation of costs, was reasonable, consistent with the terms of the solicitation, and in accordance with procurement laws and regulations.”“We continue to believe that our offering represents the best solution for the Air Force and the nation, and that the government’s selection process was fundamentally and irreparably flawed,” Boeing said.“We will carefully review the GAO’s decision and decide upon our next steps with regard to the protest in the coming days.”The company could take the US Department of Defense to court if it believes it made serious legal errors.Northrop Grumman said it was “pleased”.“This confirms that the US Air Force conducted an extraordinarily thorough selection process and selected the most capable and affordable solution,” it said.The long-range strike bomber is one of the top priority military procurement projects for US military planners because it is considered vital to counter the improved air defences of possible US adversaries.Boeing’s shares were up 3.1 per cent in lunchtime trading, at $112.02, while Northrop’s shares 1.4 per cent at $183.80.

Lockheed Martin, one of the companies behind the F-22 fighter jet, jumped 3.5 per cent to $220.68, while Raytheon, which develops the Tomahawk cruise missile, rose 4.1 per cent to $122.11.On the other side of the spectrum, some travel-related stocks were under pressure on the day.Delta Air Lines fell 2.2 per cent to $47.93, American Airlines dropped 1.4 per cent to $42.83 and United Continental slipped 1.2 per cent to $58.08.In the travel-booking space, Priceline stumbled 2.4 per cent to $1,266.87 and Expedia fell 2.1 per cent to $122.53.France led the world with 83.7m international tourist arrivals last year, according to data from the UN World Tourism Organization. The country ranked fourth in the world by international tourism receipts, which totalled $55bn over the same period.Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a research report there could also be “an adverse impact on tourism in some European countries where people think attacks are most likely to occur — not just in France”.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, noted that, historically, the “US stock market has rebounded rather quickly from geopolitical events that have occurred outside America, including acts of terrorism”.Elsewhere, shares of Hyatt Hotels were in the green after Marriott revealed plans to buy Starwood Hotels in a deal worth about $12.2bn. Hyatt had been in advanced discussions over a potential tie-up with Starwood. Hyatt’s shares advanced 3.4 per cent to $51.22.Urban Outfitters, a clothes retailer, said it had bought the Vetri Family Group, a chain of Italian restaurants, including Pizzeria Vetri. Urban Outfitters shares sold off by 7.4 per cent to $22.67, extending the year-to-date loss to 35.5 per cent.The S&P 500 energy sector climbed 3 per cent after sliding 6 per cent last week. The rise came as the benchmark US oil contract advanced 3.2 per cent to $42.04 a barrel amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty sparked by the terror attacks in France and continued threats from Isis.Among the leaders in the sector was Noble Energy, an oil and gas exploration company, which rose 5.1 per cent to $37. ExxonMobil, the integrated energy heavyweight, rallied 3.6 per cent to $80.89.By close of trading, the S&P 500 advanced 1.5 per cent to 2,053.19, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4 per cent to 17,483.01 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.1 per cent to 4,984.62.
32;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2015-11-06T17:28:26Z;Boeing challenges award of $80bn contract by Department of Defence;Group seeks to overturn decision to give bomber work to Northrop Grumman;Boeing threw the future of the US long-range bomber programme into doubt on Friday when it announced an appeal against the “fundamentally flawed” decision to award the $80bn contract to a rival.The appeal to the Government Accountability Office marks the first time that Boeing has launched such an appeal over a military contract since it successfully challenged the award of the US air force’s air tanker programme to a competitor.The US Department of Defence announced on October 27 that it was awarding the contract to build 100 new stealth aircraft capable of evading enemy defences to Northrop Grumman, rather than a consortium involving Boeing and Lockheed Martin.The contract is much the biggest single block of work likely to be awarded by the US military this decade. The US air force regards the long-range bomber as strategically vital to counter new air and sea defences built by China and other countries.The award of the contract to Northrop raised questions about the future of Boeing’s military aircraft division. Without the long-range bomber work, the division looks set to rely mainly on building military versions of its commercial airliners.“Boeing and Lockheed Martin concluded the selection process for the Long Range Strike Bomber was fundamentally flawed,” said the companies in a joint statement.“That flawed evaluation led to the selection of Northrop Grumman over the industry-leading team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, whose proposal offers the government and the warfighter the best possible [long-range strike bomber.”Northrop mounted a strong campaign to secure the contract, arguing that its experience building the B-2 stealth bomber meant it was well qualified to build a new aircraft.Pentagon keeps mum on details of Northrop’s $80bn aircraft dealRead moreIn 2008, Boeing protested against the award of work on the US air force’s air tanker to a consortium of Europe’s EADS — now called Airbus — and Northrop Grumman. Boeing overturned the decision in 2011.Loren Thompson, analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Group who has done consulting work for Boeing and Lockheed, said the tanker decision suggested the two companies had a “good chance” of a successful appeal.“Boeing believes that the errors this time are similar to the errors the air force made in the tanker programme,” he said.The Government Accountability Office has 100 days to evaluate the appeal, however it is all but certain to seek an extension in such a complex case.The shares of all the companies involved were down in morning trading in New York — Northrop Grumman by 1.1 per cent to $184.39, Boeing by 1 per cent to $146.49 and Lockheed Martin by 1.1 per cent to $216.21.
33;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2015-10-28T18:44:29Z;Stealth bomber contract flies in the dark;Pentagon keeps mum on details of Northrop’s $80bn aircraft deal;After Deborah Lee James, the US air force secretary, said on Tuesday that Northrop Grumman had won the $80bn contract to build the US’s new strategic bomber, reporters started to ask questions.Who would build the engine for the long-range strike bomber? What name would the air force give the aircraft? With which other weapons systems was the bomber intended to co-ordinate? Yet nearly all received non-committal replies from Pentagon officials that reinforced the sense of mystery around the decision, the most important since the US awarded work on the F-35 joint strike fighter to Lockheed Martin in 2001.The project — to supply 100 bombers to replace ageing existing aircraft — promises to transform Northrop from a fading also-ran of the US’s military industries into a significant aircraft supplier. The award dents the ambitions of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which had formed a consortium to bid for the work and looked set to become the only two manufacturers capable of building whole aircraft for the US military.Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Virginia-based Teal Group, says some of the win’s implications are nevertheless obscure precisely because the project’s importance has prompted officials to shroud it in unusual secrecy. Among the aircraft the long-range strike bomber is to replace are 76 B-52s — an aircraft type designed for the early cold war that first flew in 1952. “What mattered was the design and the cost and risk associated with it,” he says. “That of course is, unlike the joint strike fighter, completely in the black, even after the award.”It is a certainty, however, according to Loren Thompson, an analyst at Lexington Institute, that the award transforms the prospects of the companies involved.Northrop — which built the B-2 stealth bombers in the 1980s — in particular will move from manufacturing only a handful of crewed aircraft annually to being the supplier of arguably the US’s most strategically significant weapons system. The bomber is intended to counter improvements in the air and sea defences of China, Russia and other potentially hostile powers that could keep US aircraft carriers out of bombing range of their territory.“If the award is sustained, then Northrop Grumman will be building fixed-wing military aircraft for the foreseeable future,” Mr Thompson says. “Boeing on the other hand may see its military aircraft business reduced to making militarised versions of jetliners.”One potential response for Boeing could be to buy Northrop’s military aircraft arm to win back the work. But that option looks implausible to many observers because of the Pentagon’s increasingly vocal unhappiness about consolidation among suppliers.Frank Kendall, the Pentagon’s top acquisition official, said last month that the defence department planned to ask Congress to create new rules to hinder mergers between military contractors. The move appeared to be motivated by unhappiness over the swift approval given to United Technologies’ $9bn sale of its Sikorsky helicopter business to Lockheed.Boeing’s best chance of rescuing its position may be to challenge the award — a tactic that won it work on the US Air Force’s $35bn air tankerproject after it was awarded to a consortium of Europe’s EADS — now Airbus — and Northrop. The tanker — based on the 767 commercial jet — and Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft — based on the 737 — are among the militarised commercial jets that are now set to form the mainstay of Boeing’s military production.The Boeing-Lockheed consortium hinted at a possible challenge in its response to the decision on Tuesday. “We will have further discussions with our customer before determining our next steps,” the pair said.The challenge for Northrop will be to produce the bomber for the price — $564m for production of each of the 100 aircraft, not including development costs — that it has promised. Past experience on other military aircraft — particularly the significantly over-budget F-35 — suggests that could be as much of a challenge as winning the work.However, Mr Aboulafia insists the project, for now, looks better conceived than the complex F-35, which has had to be engineered to fit multiple roles for three military services and international customers.“Here is a system that’s really designed to do one thing and has no other customers and participants,” he says. “I’m cautiously optimistic.”Asked about the striker’s engine on Wednesday, Lt Gen Arnold Bunch said: “We won’t go into any details relative to specific components or subcontractors due to classification and enhanced security.”And he gave nothing away when questioned about how many aircraft would be involved in the engineering, manufacturing and development phase. “Due to where we’re at in the programme, we’re not going to release that number.”
34;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2015-10-27T21:48:26Z;Northrop Grumman wins $80bn US stealth bomber contract;Coup over Boeing and Lockheed for nation’s most important military project in a decade;Northrop Grumman secured its future as an independent military contractor as it pulled off a surprise win over a consortium of Boeing and Lockheed Martin for a $80bn contract to supply the bomber designed to ensure the US can win a future war with China or Russia.The 100 Long-Range Strike Bombers are intended to replace a series of ageing existing bombers, including the remaining 76 B-52s — a cold war aircraft that first flew in 1952.The most important military contract likely to be awarded this decade calls for the production of an aircraft that is intended to be able to evade enemy radar in order to destroy air defence systems at the start of war.The project has gained urgency because of America’s recognition of the growing sophistication of the air defences of potential opponents such as Iran, China and Russia, which are designed to keep hostile forces at least 800 nautical miles away from their borders.Deborah Lee James, the US Air Force Secretary, told reporters at the Pentagon the new aircraft would give the US the flexibility and capability to launch strikes from the continental United States to anywhere in the world.She went on: “The threat environment that we face has evolved as a result of development of advanced air defence systems and much more capable surface to air systems that effectively push our older bombers farther and farther away from the fight.”The news sent Northrop’s shares up 5.8 per cent in after-market trading, to $191. Lockheed shares fell 1.9 per cent to $219, while Boeing shares fell 2 per cent to $145.50.General Robin Rand, commander of the Air Force’s Global Strike Command, said the Northrop Grumman proposal had been the “best for both the warfighter and taxpayer”.Advocates of the bomber successfully argued that it would be a more effective and cheaper means of achieving air superiority in battle than launching cruise missiles, which cost around $1.5m each.Northrop promised to provide each aircraft for $511m in 2010 dollars — well below the $550m limit that the Pentagon had announced. That translates to $564m in current dollars.Officials said Northrop would also be awarded $21.4bn worth of development in 2010 dollars, or $23.6bn in current dollars, to make for a total budget of $80bn. The aircraft is expected to achieve Initial Operational Capability — the stage it can first be considered for deployment — in 2025.It is one of the great ironies of recent US landmark military campaigns — in Iraq in 1991, Serbia in 1999 and Afghanistan in 2001 — that, amid the increasing deployment of the latest advanced weapons, a crucial aircraft involved in deploying them was much older than most of the personnel involved. The US continues to rely heavily for strike power on the vast, eight-engine B52 bomber, which first flew in 1952. Some of the 76 remaining B52s are expected to remain in service until 2044.Read moreNorthrop had been expected to lose to its competitors ever since the Pentagon opened bidding in 2011. Northrop has not handled a significant weapons procurement programme since it built the 20 B-2 stealth bombers in the late 1980s and the project has attracted significant criticism because each aircraft cost $2bn after the programme was cut back from 100 to 20 aircraft after the end of the cold war.Lockheed is the world’s largest manufacturer of military hardware and is in charge of building the $392bn F-35 joint-strike fighter, intended to be the future fighter for the US Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. Boeing, as well as being one of the duopoly that dominates the world commercial aircraft market, is building the US Air Force’s KC-46 air-to-air refuelling tanker.Northrop nevertheless fought a fierce campaign, arguing that its experience with the B-2 made it uniquely qualified to build a new bomber.Wes Bush, Northrop’s chief executive, said the air force had made the “right decision” for the US’s security.“As the company that developed and delivered the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, we look forward to providing the Air Force with a highly capable and affordable next-generation Long-Range Strike Bomber,” he said.Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Virginia-based Teal Group, said Northrop’s win was a “game-changing contract”.“It means Northrop Grumman is now set to be the second biggest military aircraft contractor in the US, and Boeing faces some very hard choices,” he said.Boeing could either bid for Northrop’s aircraft arm or revert to being a mainly commercial aircraft company, Mr Aboulafia said.

Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

It crashed during ascent when the co-pilot Michael Alsbury wrongly unlocked at 0.8 times the speed of sound (0.8 Mach) a “feathering”, or braking, mechanism, meant to slow the craft during descent. The stress of then passing the sound barrier during the “boost phase” pushed open the mechanism, causing the rocket to break up.The crew were meant to leave the mechanism locked until the craft reached Mach 1.4, then unlock it quickly before 1.8 Mach.The hearing in Washington was told that Scaled Composites, the arm of Northrop Grumman that designed the craft, had not considered the possibility that human error could lead to an early unlocking of the mechanism.While the Federal Aviation Administration recognised the shortcomings in Scaled’s hazards assessment, the court heard that the regulator issued the company a waiver from complying with the rules without Scaled’s asking for it.Katherine Wilson, one of the investigators, told the hearing that Scaled had not emphasised “human factors” during the design and had not considered building in safeguards to prevent early unlocking.“By not considering unlocking early in the boost phase, Scaled missed opportunities to include design and/or operational factors that could have mitigated the catastrophic consequences of this single human error,” Ms Wilson said.Mike Hauf, another investigator, said the FAA had recognised during a licence renewal process in May 2013 the risk of an early unlocking of the feather mechanism, noting that Scaled’s human hazards analysis did not comply with its rules. The FAA issued the waiver based on commitments made by Scaled about how it would act to mitigate the risks but failed to check that Scaled was fulfilling its commitments.Scaled said safety had always been a critical part of its culture. “As part of our constant and continuing efforts to enhance our processes, we have already made changes in the wake of the accident to further enhance safety,” it said. “We will continue to look for additional ways to do so.”Virgin Galactic said that, even before the crash, it had started a safety review in preparation for taking control of the flight test programme from Scaled, which it has now done. The company had introduced a mechanism to prevent premature unlocking of the feathering device and was now preparing for commercial service, it said.George Whitesides, Virgin Galactic’s chief executive, said the company remained “as humbled as ever” by the difficulty of its work and the challenges of space.“We are encouraged by the progress to date with our second spaceship, and we look to the future with hope and determination,” he said.The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
37;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2015-07-17T15:51:38Z;Boeing landed with extra $536m charge for tanker aircraft;Latest problems with KC-46 programme for US air force relate to spending on integrated fuel system;Boeing’s most important project outside its core commercial aircraft operations suffered a significant blow on Friday when it unveiled a $536m earnings charge for problems with its $35bn tanker programme for the US air force.The problems with the Boeing aircraft are the latest development in the complex history of the air force’s efforts to replace its ageing tanker aircraft fleet.Boeing said the charge reflected higher engineering and manufacturing costs to complete the KC-46 tanker’s development, certification and initial production.The post-tax charge of $536m, or 77 cents per share, will be contained in Boeing’s second-quarter results due to be announced on Wednesday. This follows a $272m post-tax charge relating to the KC-46 programme in the second quarter of last year.Boeing’s shares fell 1 per cent to $146.84 in New York.The US air force initially awarded a contract to Boeing for a new tanker aircraft but overturned the decision in 2004 amid corruption allegations.A new competition led to the programme’s award in 2008 to a consortium of Europe’s EADS, now renamed Airbus, and Northrop Grumman.That award was in turn overturned because of procedural complaints from Boeing and, after a new tender, a contract for the aircraft was awarded to Boeing in 2011.Boeing is due to supply the first 18 tankers to the air force by August 2017, and to complete delivery of all 179 aircraft by 2027.The latest problems with the KC-46 tanker programme come only just over two weeks after Dennis Muilenburg took over as Boeing’s chief executive from Jim McNerney.“While we are disappointed with this charge, we are investing the necessary resources to keep this vitally important programme on schedule for our customer,” said Mr Muilenburg.Extra spending was required mainly to resolve problems with the aircraft’s integrated fuel system, which feeds its engines and handles delivery of kerosene to other aircraft that the tanker is refuelling, said Boeing.“We have a clear understanding of the work to be done, and believe strongly that the long-term financial value of the KC-46 program will reward our additional investment,” Mr Muilenburg said.Boeing’s tanker is based on its civilian 767 wide-body passenger jet, and the latest earnings charge will be split between the group’s commercial airplanes division and its military aircraft unit.In contrast to many military procurement programmes where development costs are shared with the public sector, the tanker aircraft is a fixed-price contract, meaning Boeing will not be able to recover the increased costs.However, the company insisted it still expected to generate a profit on the programme during the production phase.Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Virginia-based Teal Group, attributed the extra costs to the aggressive pricing of Boeing’s bid, which was intended to keep Airbus out of the market.“Given the importance of keeping the US tanker market for itself, these losses were worth it to Boeing,” Mr Aboulafia said.It was clear, however, that Airbus’s tanker aircraft would take most of the international market, he added.

Western defence spending is one such certainty: it has been falling.Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, a think-tank, show that global real-terms defence spending fell in each of the past three years, led by the US. Only in Africa, Asia and the Middle East is spending increasing.But the share prices of major defence contractors betray little trace of this trend. Valuations have grown richer; back in 2012, defence contractors’ shares often traded below 10 times forecast earnings. Above 15 is now more common. True, multiple expansion without much earnings growth has been common in equity markets boosted by quantitative easing. Share buybacks have also played a part — Raytheon is spending $2bn buying its own stock. But the big groups have been operationally robust, too; over the past two years, most of the top quartile of defence contractors by market value have reported improved operating margins, according to S&P CapitalIQ.Exposure to the right programmes and niches is key. These include the $400bn F35 Joint Strike Fighter and the K-46 air tanker, anything related to submarines and — in the UK especially — aircraft carriers, along with cyber and electronic warfare. The ability to sell existing kit to export markets, or to adapt military technology for civilian applications, is another bonus.Governments are increasingly wary of “boots on the ground”, and the outlook for companies exposed to direct conflict is more challenging. Chemring, a UK maker of countermeasures and sensors, was forced to sell assets and part company with its chief executive after wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ended. On Tuesday it reported a first-half loss because of contract delays.But the broader recovery has only brought defence stock valuations level with the broader market. There are few reasons to think they will not remain there, barring unforeseen setbacks — or, in Rumsfeld-speak, “unknown unknowns”.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

This is partly because these previous events involved the launch of new versions of existing aircraft by Airbus and Boeing that attracted large orders.The anticipated slowdown in sales is unlikely to be a concern for the two companies. Bulging order books assembled over recent years have led both manufacturers to view ramping up production as the more significant looming challenge than winning new sales.There was still a flurry of deal activity at the Paris show, however.Garuda Indonesia, the Indonesian flag carrier, struck an agreement with Boeing to buy 60 aircraft — 30 long-range Dreamliners and 30 short-haul 737s — valued at $10.9bn at catalogue prices, although airlines usually secure significant discounts depending on the size of their orders.Garuda also signed a letter of intent with Airbus for 30 long-range A350s, in a deal that could be worth as much as $9bn.Airbus also signed up Saudi Arabian Airlines to be the launch customer of its new A330-300 regional aircraft, with the flag carrier buying 20 of these aircraft, plus 30 short-haul A320s, in a combined deal worth about $8.2bn.$10.9bnValue of order at catalogue prices by Garuda Indonesia for 60 Boeing jetsAirbus also secured a firm order from General Electric’s aviation leasing and financing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, for 60 A320s valued at $6.4bn.Meanwhile, Qatar Airways, the fast-growing Doha-based carrier, placed an order with Boeing for 10 long-range 777 passenger jets, and four 777 freighters, in a deal worth $4.8bn.With the global fleet of passenger and cargo aircraft forecast to double over the next 20 years, a wealth of opportunities and challenges are presenting themselvesContinue readingDespite the sales, analysts and insiders at Airbus and Boeing said the orders this week are likely to fall short of the $116bn worth of deals secured last year in Farnborough and the $135bn notched up in Paris in 2013.Long term, Airbus and Boeing are both bullish on sales. Airbus predicted demand for 32,600 new passenger jets worth nearly $5tn over the next 20 years, an increase of 1,200 jets on last year’s equivalent forecast.The Paris show was also notable for the absence of several key defence companies, with BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman and Saab missing from the line up. This comes as European defence budgets remain under significant pressure from government budget cuts.

Some of the 76 remaining B52s are expected to remain in service until 2044.The B52s’ extreme age and the growing sophistication of the enemy air defences that the vast, subsonic aircraft is likely to encounter have made progress on its replacement — a programme known as Long-Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) — the top outstanding procurement priority for the US Air Force.The military have been demanding a replacement that will, according to people familiar with the process, be less visible to enemy radar than any previous aircraft and hence more capable than ever of evading and then eliminating enemy air defences.Yet, for the companies involved in bidding, the issues involved are almost as pressing as those facing the military. A consortium of Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, and Boeing is the frontrunner, according to Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute think-tank. A win for the consortium would cement the two as the default suppliers of military aircraft to the US military.• How is the oil price collapse affecting civil aviation manufacturers and paying passengers?• How safe is air travel?

Does space exploration belong in the hands of government?• Combat drones are coming. How soon will they be waging war?Join us on June 15, at 15:00 BST using #FTaero to discussThe only challenger is Northrop Grumman, manufacturer of the B2 stealth bomber, the last bomber purchased by the US military. If it fails, Northrop looks likely to recede from the ranks of manufacturers that can handle the final assembly and integration of a large, complex military aircraft. The company currently assembles only a handful of aircraft each year, including its Global Hawk unmanned aircraft and turboprop airborne early warning aircraft.Mr Thompson, whose think-tank receives funding from Boeing and Lockheed, says Northrop’s modest production rates are a sign it has fallen far behind its competitors.Boeing and Lockheed Martin say they have teamed up to “deliver a flexible, credible, global precision strike capability to the air force” affordably.“We have the breadth and depth of proven technologies and talent, plus the infrastructure and scale that matches the importance of this mission,” they say. “We are the right team for the entire life of the programme.”Northrop nevertheless argues that it is well placed to win the work, because it built the US’s only long-range stealth bomber — the B2 — in the late 1980s. Having initially intended to buy 130 B2s, the US bought only 20 amid the changing strategic priorities of the end of the cold war, while Northrop fashioned a 21st by converting a prototype for active service. The Air Force currently has only 20 after one crashed on take-off in 2008.“With our breadth and depth of experience in long-range stealth platforms and the requisite electronics systems necessary, we feel that we are extremely well positioned for the US Air Force’s LRS-B programme,” the company says.The challenge for advocates of the bomber’s importance to the US military has been partly to explain why such an aircraft is still necessary. Aircraft such as the F-35 joint strike fighter— the biggest military procurement project in history, being built by Lockheed Martin — are well equipped to drop some munitions on opposing forces.The US also has a formidable arsenal of cruise missiles which, under some circumstances, have formidable powers to evade enemy radar and destroy hardened bunkers.However, advocates of a long-range bomber have successfully argued that only such an aircraft — expected to cost about $550m each — will be able to penetrate the air defences that Iran, China, Russia and other powers are constructing to keep US forces up to 800 nautical miles away from their borders. Only a large, long-range bomber, advocates argue, can hope to knock out enough of an opponent’s air defences to let other forces attack.Despite the high capital cost of each of the 100 planned aircraft, the option could prove far cheaper than firing multiple cruise missiles costing $1.5m each over the aircraft’s lifetime, one person involved says. “Only a bomber can impose our will on other countries,” the person says.For Northrop Grumman, meanwhile, the core challenge is to overcome what its backers say are misconceptions about the B2. Lobbyists for the rival bid have regularly quoted calculations that the aircraft requires 18 hours’ maintenance for every hour it flies — an argument that Northrop’s backers say is unfair, as long-range bombers fly rarely, but need to be kept constantly ready to do so.The aircraft is also often criticised for its high costs — which worked out at about $2bn per aircraft. Northrop’s backers attribute that to the US defence department’s having cancelled the programme far short of the 130 aircraft originally intended, meaning that each of the delivered aircraft’s share of the development costs was much higher that expected.Northrop’s backers say that the cost of the aircraft would fall sharply over its lifetime — and point out that the B2 has knocked out some of the most difficult targets in the US’s recent wars, including Serbia’s Danube bridges and reinforced concrete aircraft hangars in Libya.Yet one of the few certainties is that — as the long-range bomber is the only new US military aircraft likely to be procured this decade and the work building 100 aircraft will produce substantial revenue for the winner — competition will remain intense.There is a strong possibility that the losing bidder will mount a challenge after the decision is announced, probably in July.The decision will also have far more than commercial consequences. As the continued role of the B52 makes clear, the choice of long-range bomber could affect the US’s military capabilities for at least the remainder of this century.
41;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2015-02-15T15:00:05Z;Juggling chainsaws;;“The next two weeks will be the busiest weeks of your lives” – this was the warning given to cohort #20 by Thunderbird School of Global Management’s academic director during our first week on campus last year.My classmates on the Global MBA On Demand programme represent 17 countries and organisations, such as the US Navy, American Express, BP and global aerospace and defense technology company Northrop Grumman. Part of the cohort is on the 19-month track, while others are on a more conservative 28-month track. How has it been so far? Enriching to say the least, although we soon realised we needed to utilise or enhance our emotional intelligence (EI) in order to survive.Thunderbird’s Global MBA programme is a blended programme, designed for working professionals with an average of eight years work experience. About 75 per cent of the programme is delivered online with the remaining 25 per cent delivered on campus and during two international trips. This type of programme is best suited for mid-career professionals who seek to advance into upper management without sacrificing any years of work experience.At certain points, I have found myself studying up to nearly 40 hours a week. However, the most challenging part isn’t the coursework. It is knowing how to balance schoolwork with other commitments, such as relationships and professional matters – assisting kids through college, getting married, reaching for the next promotion.During our first week on campus, we were shown a video of a very skilled man juggling chainsaws (switched on). One mistake and he could have been dismembered. When the video stopped, we were told that throughout the programme we would figuratively be doing the same thing.Here is where the emotional intelligence is required. Can we handle the pressure of our commitments? Can we manage our time so that we don’t lose our relationships and/or jobs? Can we manage our emotions by finding a healthy work/life balance?Doing so requires the power to temper anxiety, overcome fear, channel stress and focus on performing amidst negative forces probing us from every direction. Arguably the most valuable part of the programme was the first week of class, where we bonded during six 16-hour days and many nights at the iconic Thunderbird Pub. Drinks and good company kick-started our solidarity to the point where we can now use our Facebook page to lift each other up and motivate one another. It has become a conduit for boosting our EI.Now at a stage of life where the classroom is no longer the mainstay, my colleagues and I have to choose to be fighters in the real world if we want to survive the programme and preserve our personal lives. We fight tirelessly to finish weekly case studies, quizzes, readings, exams and group projects. And then we fight to keep our careers and relationships alive. This, in essence, is what juggling chainsaws is all about. Name one successful Fortune 500 CEO who isn’t required to do it.Thunderbird understands those at the highest levels must master such skills, so they deliver a programme designed to train us for top positions as international managers. It is not the only one though. Many business schools do a fascinating job in preparing future business leaders.
42;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2015-01-12T19:04:07Z;When a moral machine is better than a flawed human being;Scrutiny of artificial intelligence must challenge ideas about our superiority, says Anjana Ahuja;It will be an interesting year for the X-47B. The new unmanned aircraft, developed by Northrop Grumman, will be put through its paces on a US warship to check it can do all the things existing aircraft can: take off and land safely, maintain a holding pattern, and “clear the deck” for the next aircraft in just 90 seconds.This uber-drone is perhaps the most advanced autonomous machine in existence, possibly outshining Google’s driverless car. Both examples of artificial intelligence will have spurred signatories to the open letter on AI just published by the Future of Life Institute, a collective of influential thinkers on the existential risks to humanity.Signed by scientists including Professor Stephen Hawking, as well as AI entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk, it warns that AI is marching so fast towards humanlike intelligence that we have not fully contemplated its potential for both good and ill. Along with an oblique exhortation to avoid “potential pitfalls”, the letter states: “AI systems must do what we want them to do.” A longer paper asks how citizens can flourish when many jobs, including in banking and finance, will be automated. Does the future promise unalloyed leisure — or just unemployment?The letter is timely, given that the technology is outpacing society’s ability to deal with it. Who, for example, is liable if a driverless car crashes? This is unclear, even though four US states have given the legal go-ahead for testing on public roads. The UK is likely to grant similar approval this year. Legal clarity is necessary for consumer confidence, on which a future industry depends.And what if a driverless car, in order to avoid a potentially fatal collision, has to mount the pavement? Should it be installed with ethics software so that, given the choice between mowing down an adult or a child, it opts for the adult?These are the longer-term, more challenging questions posed by AI, and society, rather than Silicon Valley investors, should dictate how quickly they are answered. If we are to give robots morality, then whose morals should be burnt into the machines? What about sabotage?The idea of a moral machine fascinates because in an age where machines can already do much of what humans can — drive, fly aircraft, run, recognise images, process speech and even translate — there are still capacities, such as moral reasoning, that elude them.The idea of a moral machine fascinates because in an age where machines can already do much of what humans can moral reasoning eludes themIndeed, as automation increases, that omission might itself be immoral. For example, if drones become our battlefield emissaries, they may have to make decisions that human operators cannot anticipate or code for. And those decisions might be “moral” ones, such as which one of two lives to save. Scientists at Bristol Robotics Laboratory showed last year that a robot trained to save a person (in reality another robot) from falling down a hole was perfectly able to save one but struggled when faced with two people heading holewards. It sometimes dithered so long that it saved neither. Surely a robot programmed to save one life is better than a perplexed robot that can save none?So artificial morality seems a natural, if controversial, next step. In fact, five universities, including Tufts and Yale, are researching whether robots can be taught right from wrong. But this is happening in a regulatory vacuum. Ryan Calo, law professor at Washington university, has proposed a Federal Robotics Commission to oversee developments.As the industry flourishes, we must have some means of holding researchers — many of them in rich, private corporations — to account. But any scrutiny should also challenge our assumptions about the superiority of human agency. Google Chauffeur might not instinctively avoid a pedestrian but it will not fall asleep at the wheel. A robot soldier, equipped with a moral code but devoid of emotion, will never pull the trigger in fear, anger or panic. A more automated world might, in a strange way, be a more humane one.The writer is a science commentator and regular FT contributor——————————————-Letter in response to this article:Positive emotions play balancing role in morality/ From Roger Steare
43;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2014-11-01T21:31:53Z;Branson’s familiar path offers limited clues into the future;Virgin Galactic founder shows a preference for industry partners;Although its activities might be eye-catchingly different from the group’s other enterprises, Virgin Galactic has followed a strikingly similar development path to other businesses in Sir Richard Branson’s diverse Virgin Group, where he has tended to work with experienced, long-term players within each businesses’ respective industry.Virgin has relied for the complex system to launch tourists into space on Scaled Composites, the Mojave-based company that ten years ago became the first private company to reach space from earth. Northrop Grumman, a significant military contractor, bought Scaled Composites in 2007.The arrangement, sealed when Virgin first reached agreement with Scaled Composites at Virgin Galactic’s founding in 2004, is similar to how Stagecoach Group provided the public transport expertise for the company’s Virgin Trains operation in the UK. Singapore Airlines held a 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic, the company’s long-haul airline, from 1999 to 2013 before selling it to Delta Air Lines.The company has also relied on private investment for financing, as the group has done for most of its enterprises since the Virgin Group’s brief but bruising experience as a London-listed company in the 1980s. Abu Dhabi’s Aabar Group in 2010 paid $280m for a 31.8 per cent stake in Galactic and has since increased its holding to 37.8 per cent.Yet, while Sir Richard insisted on Saturday that his company had always recognised the significant dangers involved in operating in space, it remains to be seen how the approach works when confronted with such a catastrophic crash.The closest previous parallel is the 2007 Grayrigg train crash, in which a Virgin Trains Pendolino travelling from London to Glasgow derailed at speed, killing one passenger and injuring many others. In that case, however, it was clear from the start that the crash was the fault of Network Rail, the UK rail infrastructure owner, rather than Virgin.Friday’s crash is likely to raise far more questions about safety practices at both Virgin and Scaled Composites – and to have a far more direct effect on Virgin Galactic’s business.Doug Messier – a space blogger who witnessed the crash on Friday and wrote he had previously been concerned about the operation’s culture – pointed out on Twitter that the co-pilot’s death followed the death in 2007 of three people at Scaled Composites’ Mojave factory. They died after an accident during testing of the engine for SpaceShipTwo, the spacecraft that exploded on Friday.The real question involves the competence of Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic, their safety culture and their procedures“The real question involves the competence of Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic, their safety culture and their procedures,” he wrote.Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute who consults for some of the biggest US aerospace companies, says the explosion is bound to concern Virgin Galactics’ customers, signed up and otherwise.“Every episode like this is likely to create sceptics among the likely customers for launch services, both public and private,” he says.The financial consequences both of any fall in public confidence in Virgin Galactic because of the crash and of further delays and redesign work to fix the problems could be significant. Galactic has promised to refund customers’ deposits at any time, while post-crash investigations could force the company fully to redesign the spacecraft’s propulsion systems if they turn out to be at fault.“Ten years into [the] SpaceShipTwo programme and they still don’t seem to have reliable and safe propulsion system,” Mr Messier wrote on his Twitter account, @spacecom. “Doesn’t bode well.”Yet Sir Richard on Saturday was able to provide to the venture one commodity of which he has never been short – optimism in the face of adversity. It remains to be seen whether that optimism is enough to pull the entrepreneur and his group through its first crisis on humankind’s last frontier.“We are determined to honour the bravery of the pilots and teams here by learning from this tragedy,” he told reporters gathered in Mojave, near the crash site. “Only then can we move forward, united behind a collective desire to push the boundaries of human endeavour.”

The maker of the F-35 jet fighter and the Global Hawk drones also raised its full-year earnings guidance.The gains by Northrop come after a similar gain on Tuesday by another company with large government contracts – Lockheed Martin, which was up another 1.5 per cent on Wednesday to $131.98.However, it has not all been good news for defence contractors. General Dynamics shares were off 2.2 per cent to $86.23 even though it beat earnings estimates.Boeing, a defence contractor that also produces civilian passenger jets including the 787 Dreamliner, gained 5.3 per cent to $129.02. The company raised its 2013 profit target and reported core earnings which beat expectations.Better than expected earnings from government contractors were unable to buoy the S&P 500, which fell 0.5 per cent to 1,746.38.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.4 per cent to 15,413.33, and the Nasdaq Composite was lower by 0.6 per cent to 3,907.07.The Dow was led lower by Caterpillar, the heavy machinery manufacturer, which fell 6.1 per cent to $83.76 after it cut its full-year profit forecast and logged a 44 per cent decline in third-quarter earnings.Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, noted particular weakness in Caterpillar’s mining equipment, which accounted for 75 per cent of the $11bn drop in sales.Grocery retailer Safeway moved 8.2 per cent higher to $35.58 on reports that it was the subject of interest from buyout groups. The company recently adopted a “poison pill” strategy after reports emerged in September that hedge fund Jana Partners had amassed a 6.2 per cent stake.US glass company Corning gained 14.1 per cent to $17.52 after it reached a deal to purchase the full ownership of its joint venture with Samsung Display.Netflix shares bounced back from Tuesday’s fall, up 2.4 per cent to $330.24, after activist investor Carl Icahn tweeted on Tuesday after market close that he had sold part of his sizeable stake in the internet content provider. Netflix dropped 9.2 per cent on Tuesday.JPMorgan Chase was hit by reports that it was in talks for another multibillion-dollar settlement over its mortgage-backed securities business.Shares in JPMorgan were off 1.6 per cent to $52.75 after news emerged that the bank was close to a $6bn settlement with investors. The agreement would come just days after the bank agreed to pay a total of $13bn to federal agencies.While the S&P 500 has rallied to set numerous record highs after the US government resolved its shutdown and debt ceiling debates, investors have taken a relatively defensive stance.Although all 10 sectors in the S&P 500 are higher in the past five days, the telecoms and utilities sectors – areas that tend to perform better in times of caution – have led, up 4.4 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.
45;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Northrop defies US defence cuts as drone sales fall;;Northrop Grumman boosted profit margins far more than expected amid US defence cuts as it announced an 8 per cent rise in third-quarter net earnings to $497m, despite declining demand for products including its Global Hawk drones.The company, which is a significant contributor to the F35 fighter, also increased its forecast for full-year earnings per share by around 5 per cent. The projection, which had been for a range of $7.60 to $7.80, was increased to $8.00 to $8.15.Northrop’s move came as General Dynamics, another significant Pentagon supplier, announced its third-quarter earnings were 8.5 per cent up on last year, at $651m, despite a 1.7 per cent decline in sales to $7.8bn.On Tuesday, Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, increased its full-year earnings forecast by 2 per cent.Most of the Pentagon’s big suppliers appear to be successfully increasing profit margins through cost savings. Across-the-board sequestration spending cuts have also been feeding through more slowly to the biggest procurement programmes than contractors had expected.Northrop’s sales declined 3 per cent to $6.1bn. Diluted earnings per share increased 14 per cent to $2.14, well above analysts’ consensus estimates of $1.82.Wes Bush, Northrop’s chief executive, said the third-quarter results reflected the company’s focus on “performance, affordability and innovation”.“During this difficult period for our government customers and our industry, our team has continued to demonstrate its commitment to the global security missions we support,” he said.Northrop’s biggest profit margin boost came in aerospace systems, where operating income increased 14.6 per cent to $330m even though sales fell 4.9 per cent to $2.5bn. The company said falling demand for the Global Hawk – which was heavily used in Afghanistan, where US forces are departing – and some of its manned aircraft programmes, had been partially offset by increasing space demand.The margin boost resulted from a $44m increase in “net favourable adjustments” – calculations of the amount the company is due under its Pentagon contracts – compared with last year’s third quarter.Sales for both information systems and technical services declined. Military contractors’ services and information technology divisions have suffered disproportionately from sequestration because they are funded from current-year budgets, while large equipment programmes use money allocated years in advance. The cuts took effect on March 1 this year.However, sales in electronic systems – which provides avionics for aircraft and other guidance and combat systems – increased 3.9 per cent to $1.8bn. The division’s operating income fell 2.2 per cent to $273m.Northrop’s shares rose 1 per cent in pre-market trading to $102.50.
46;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;US drone lobby’s power points to revived military-industrial complex;;Last year the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general wrote a scathing indictment of the department’s use of drones to patrol US borders.With its fleet of 10 Predator drones, the department’s border protection unit is one of the few arms of the US government that has permission to operate drones in American air space. According to the inspector general, the DHS had not allocated the resources to either operate the drones safely or to maintain them. As a result, the aircraft flew only one-third of the hours that had been expected.An industry worth a potential $12bn raises privacy fears● Interactive - types of droneYet when the Senate debated immigration legislation in July, the bill had a welcome surprise for the border patrol – an amendment that included $4.5bn in funds to buy more drones and other associated technologies to provide 24-hour surveillance of the border.The bipartisan amendment revealed a lot about the politics of immigration. The final resistance in the Senate was overcome not by arguments over demographics, but by a large new spending bill and the promise of a technological fix to the issue of illegal entry. (It has yet to pass the tougher hurdle in the House).But it also demonstrated the way that drones and their makers have become a central fixture of what critics still dub the “military-industrial complex”, the backroom process whereby congressional purse strings are loosened for big-ticket items, sometimes even over the objections of important parts of the bureaucracy.According to Tom Barry, a researcher at the Center for International Policy, demand for drones is being pushed by a mixture of “border hawks, immigration hardliners and congressional voices for the military contracting industry”, many of whom “hail from districts with drone industries or bases”.“This is the way that defence contractors have worked for decades, through lobbying, political contributions and close personal relationships with key figures in the bureaucracy,” says Mr Barry.Over the past decade, drones have partly replaced an important slice of the Pentagon’s industrial backbone. Since the end of the second world war, southern California had been the home of defence-related aerospace. However, with the Pentagon cuts of the 1990s as the Cold War wound down, more than 120,000 defence-related jobs were lost in the Los Angeles area alone.Yet in the early 2000s, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq convinced the Pentagon that drones could play a central role in modern warfighting, both for their ability to conduct surveillance over difficult terrain and for firing missiles at small groups of alleged terrorists. “It is clear the military does not have enough unmanned vehicles,” President George W Bush said in 2001.Most of the main manufacturers of drones for the military – including General Atomics, Northrop Grumman and Aerovironment – are based in Los Angeles or San Diego. With the help of a group of politicians from the state, drone sales have filled some of the gap left by the aerospace cuts a decade before.In the process, the drone industry has built itself the sort of political relationships that the defence sector has always relied on to keep the contracts flowing in Washington. In the House of Representatives, the bipartisan “drone caucus” has 50 members and describes its goal as pushing “further development and acquisition of more systems”. (It was renamed last year as the “Unmanned Systems Caucus”, a reflection of the language used by the industry).This is the way that defence contractors have worked for decades, through lobbying, political contributions and close personal relationships with key figures in the bureaucracyThe group is led by Buck McKeon, the Republican congressman from the Los Angeles area who is also chair of the House armed services committee, and Democrat Henry Cuellar from a border area of Texas who has been a major supporter of using drones to patrol the frontier with Mexico.In the 2012 election, Mr McKeon, who was the keynote speaker at the drone industry association’s annual conference that year, was the biggest recipient in the House of donations from General Atomics, the San Diego company that builds the Predator drone. Among his biggest donors was also Northrop Grumman, one of the other biggest manufacturers of drones.The most striking example of the sector’s political clout involved Northrop Grumman’s Global Hawk drones. In 2011, when the Pentagon unveiled a new round of budget cuts, one of the few programmes it cut was the Air Force’s use of a new Global Hawk model called Block 30. The Air Force said it would mothball the aircraft it had bought already and would keep using the U-2 spy plane to conduct the same surveillance operations, which it said would save $2.5bn over five years. Air Force officials said that the drones had registered a string of problems, including unreliability and cost overruns.Some of the types of UAV in production or development by the growing US drone industryHowever, despite public statements in support of the decision by Pentagon boss Chuck Hagel and chair of the joint chiefs of staff Martin Dempsey, the Air Force has been obliged to continue using the Global Hawk drones and to purchase new ones after coming under intense pressure from members of Congress, who reinstated funding for the drones into the Pentagon’s budget.In May, Mr McKeon and Jim Moran, a Democrat whose Virginia constituency includes Northrop Grumman’s headquarters, wrote a strongly worded letter to Mr Hagel urging him to comply with the budget passed by Congress which calls for the Air Force to buy three more of the drones. The service had been ignoring “unambiguous” instructions from Congress to purchase the aircraft, they said.The Global Hawk programme has operations in 22 states, with final assembly for the drones taking place in Palmdale, in Mr McKeon’s California district. Northrop Grumman says that it has employees in each of the 53 California congressional districts.“Congress has an oversight role and as a result it asks a lot of questions,” says Jim Zortman, one of Northrop Grumman’s senior executives for unmanned systems. “They are asking why the Air Force is parking new planes at the same time that it is sending money to refit 40- to 50-year-old aircraft.”
47;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-09-16T14:57:30Z;Defence contractors face changes to long-term government ties;;"At a dinner in the autumn of 1993 now known as “the last supper”, the US deputy secretary of defence told industry executives that budget cuts meant there would no longer be room at the table for all of them.The speech set off a wave of consolidation that created today’s defence industry, dominated by a handful of big US players, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman.By the end of the decade the merger wave had reached the other side of the Atlantic, where BAE Systems and EADS rose to dominate the defence and aerospace market.The cuts in US military spending in this downturn are expected to be as aggressive as those that accompanied the end of the cold war. But defence executives at last week’s DSEI, the big industry show in the UK, are far less in concert when it comes to forecasting whether that would again lead to profound change within the industry.Cash-strapped Nato governments, which have already slashed their defence budgets by $120bn in the past three years, face a difficult choice: push the industry to become more efficient so defence departments can procure military equipment more cheaply and quickly or protect the industry– together with its jobs and skills – by favouring local production.“On the one hand [governments] want competitive products; on the other hand they want to buy from companies that create jobs in their own countries,” said Jean-Bernard Lévy, chairman and chief executive of Thales, the French defence electronics group. “You cannot have the best of both worlds; it just does not work.”Håkan Buskhe, president and chief executive of Saab, Sweden’s biggest defence contractor, expects to see significant change.“The fact is that we are running out of money,” he said. “And that, in other types of business, without the influence in politicians, normally restricts the business and I think that is the way it should be done.”Signs across Europe and in the US suggest governments agree with Mr Buskhe.The UK has said it wants to buy off the shelf where possible. It also decided – despite much industry lobbying – to exclude the employment or tax benefits of buying from nationally-based contractors in its “value for money” equation.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence – under pressure from parliament – is seeking to renegotiate contracts that it can no longer afford. These contracts have helped retain jobs and engineering skills by keeping shipyards and factories open even during a lag in orders.In August, the French government hit Dassault Aviation by cutting its orders for the Rafale fighter jet in half just as the group was battling to clinch a contract with India, its only export partner. Meanwhile, Paris reduced its stake in EADS, the pan-European aerospace and defence company.In the US – despite dire warnings from top military leaders and defence company chief executives – politicians unleashed automatic, across-the-board cuts on the defence budget amid a March battle to reduce the national deficit. The Pentagon is pushing for supply contracts that shift more of the endemic risk of cost overruns and delays to its contractors.On the one hand [governments] want competitive products; on the other hand they want to buy from companies that create jobs in their own countries. You cannot have the best of both worlds; it just does not workBut among all the examples of governments getting tough with their military suppliers, there are also signs that governments are resisting more radical change, at least for now.The UK’s secretary of defence last week at DSEI promised to oppose efforts by the European Commission to streamline the industry.Meanwhile, Paris has resisted calls by TCI, an activist investor, to get rid of overlap in the shareholdings of its big defence companies.But the biggest barrier to European consolidation stands in Berlin, which last year vetoed the €36bn tie-up of EADS and BAE Systems.The Pentagon also appears in no mood for big industry consolidation, even as its procurement budget is set to halve over the coming decade.Analysts say the more likely victims this time will be the smaller companies further down the supply chain, especially those that make the kinds of products – land vehicles and night vision goggles, for example – whose need has diminished with the end of major deployment to Afghanistan.In an industry that cannot make any major moves without the blessing of its governments, the political message appears to be: deal with the cuts but steer clear of radical solutions.But that could change over the coming three to five years as work ends on big existing domestic programmes, such as the UK’s aircraft carriers, and exports fail to pick up the slack. If that happens, employment and companies’ bottom lines may suffer enough to warrant a more profound reform of the industry.For years, analysts, politicians and defence executives have highlighted the inefficiencies and duplications of Europe’s defence industry and argued that significant reforms were needed, writes Carola Hoyos.In France, there are large overlaps in ownership of the big defence contractors, some of which fiercely compete with each other.France, Germany and Spain have stakes in EADS, while EADS owns 46.3 per cent of Dassault Aviation, with the majority of the remaining stake owned by the Dassault family.Thales, meanwhile, is part owned by the French state, with Dassault Aviation holding the other sizeable stake.More than a quarter of Safran, the engine maker, is owned by the French state, with another 15 per cent owned by its employees.The overlap between EADS, Dassault and Thales is particularly interesting when one considers that the biggest competitor of Dassault’s Rafale fighter jet is Eurofighter’s Typhoon, of which EADS is the biggest stakeholder.Meanwhile, Thales provides electronics systems for both.These ownership overlaps force EADS, Dassault, Thales and the French government to compete against each other in some of the world’s biggest international tenders for military equipment."

It also sold non-core assets including its defence services business to Northrop Grumman for $80m.Pre-tax profit for the group doubled to $192m on last year and revenue climbed 1 per cent to $15.9bn.Market conditions had been challenging, Qantas said. The airline had faced high fuel costs and intense international competition. There was excess capacity in its domestic market and it had had to defend itself against a scaled up challenge from rival Virgin Australia.Slowing growth in the mining industry could also take its toll on domestic contracts to fly workers to remote sites.“A lot of these customers have been very profitable because they’ve been paying big prices on tickets to fly to these regional and sub-regional areas,” Akshay Chopra, an analyst at Karara Capital in Melbourne, told Reuters. “As some of those slow, that’s clearly going to have an impact.”The airline is likely to be operating in a climate of weak economic growth forecast for Australia over the next year.“The market is very tough,” Mr Joyce said, warning that the outlook was volatile. “But we are focused on the elements we can control. We have Australia’s leading airlines and loyalty business – and we have a clear strategy to build an even stronger business for the future.”
49;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Only investment can bring long-term profits cheer;Positive data are a relief but companies must start spending;"Corporate earnings announcements this week confirmed the good news – economies in the west are indeed picking up. On Wednesday Boeing, Ford and Northrop Grumman all increased their guidance for full-year profits. In the eurozone recent business surveys suggest an improvement in sentiment as well as economic activity in the region. And gross domestic product numbers released on Thursday showed that Britain’s economic recovery gained momentum in the second quarter.The positive data are a welcome relief after the volatility and recession that investors have endured since the onset of the financial crisis five years ago. But do they point to a sustained recovery in corporate profits?A recent report by Standard & Poor’s, which surveyed 2,000 non-financial companies, suggests that the world’s big businesses are holding back on capital expenditure, the underpinning of sustained future growth, despite the general improvement in the macroeconomic environment in the west.It found that companies’ average capex, adjusted for inflation, rose at 6 per cent last year compared with 8 per cent in 2011. This year capex is expected to fall by 1.5 per cent and next year by an estimated 5 per cent in real terms. This despite the fact that many companies have apparently healthy cash balances and are benefiting from declining effective corporate tax rates.In part, this outlook is explained by lower investment in the energy sector, as the global commodity “super cycle” slows. The sector accounted for nearly half of capital investment in the past decade and, although capex in North America, fuelled by the shale gas boom, is still expected to be strong, elsewhere a stuttering Chinese economy is damping demand. Indeed, S&P expects investment by China’s companies to decline by 4 per cent this year, and 6 per cent next.For US companies, experts struggle to explain why investment is so low, as Robin Harding of the Financial Times pointed out this week. Companies are still catching up from the effects of the crisis, it is argued; investment is discouraged by new and excessive regulation; advances in information technology make it less necessary to invest heavily; profit growth is a result of some companies’ monopoly power, which means they can raise revenues without increasing investment.One of the most persuasive explanations is also one of the most worrying for investors; that markets’ persistent focus on quarterly earnings numbers, and the practice of rewarding managers via stock options discourages long-term investment in favour of chasing short-term revenue gains.Sadly, the explanation for low investment in the eurozone does not require sophisticated analysis. Western Europe’s share of global capital expenditure has fallen from a third in 2003 to a quarter in 2013. Capex has not returned to pre-crisis levels, and the region’s uncertain growth prospects mean that, although investment is picking up, a growing proportion is being directed outside Europe.The message for investors is clear. Unless companies start putting their hands in their pockets to pay for something other than debt service or share buybacks, the recent economic optimism will not translate into robust sustainable growth."
50;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-07-24T21:55:38Z;US military contractors: what sequestration?;The effect of austerity on weapons makers has been mild;Austerity is, in principle, a bad thing for the big weapons makers that serve the US military. So far, though, austerity has mostly stayed at the level of principle.Lockheed Martin reported financial results on Tuesday that might make one forget that sequestration – the indiscriminate spending cuts meant to trim a tenth from every line in the Pentagon’s budget – went into effect in March. Revenue in the last quarter fell a bit but margins expanded and earnings per share rose 11 per cent. Profit targets for the year were bumped up. On Wednesday, General Dynamics reported flat revenue and earnings – a better result than Wall Street had projected – and gave its earnings targets an upward nudge. Also on Wednesday, Northrop Grumman reported flat sales and earnings up 9 per cent. It inched targets up, too.Budget strains did show up here and there. Products with shorter delivery cycles, such as information technology and consulting, are being hit. Lockheed’s and Northrup’s information systems segments both saw sales drop. The wind-down of the war in Afghanistan may be having an effect too. General Dynamics’s combat systems division, which makes tanks and vehicles, saw revenue fall by a quarter. But most products with long cycles – aircraft, ships – are doing fine.Over the past six months or so the three companies’ shares have risen in lockstep and their valuations have reached roughly 12 times forward earnings – post-crisis highs. It is an open question, however, how much of that has to do with the fact that austerity turns out, in the military’s case, to be a slow process and how much of it has to do with the shrinking risk premiums for equities in general. It is at the very least possible that the fate of investors in military contractors depends less on the Department of Defence than on the Federal Reserve.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
51;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-07-24T18:09:53Z;Industrials upgrades mark strength of US economic recovery;;Some of the US’s biggest industrial companies have provided further evidence of how a domestic economic recovery and continued federal spending are underpinning corporate earnings.On Wednesday, Boeing, Ford and Northrop Grumman all increased their guidance for full-year profits.Ford raised its forecasts, saying that it expected to “equal or exceed” last year’s $8bn net earnings this year, rather than merely matching it, while Boeing increased its earnings guidance by 2 per cent – to a range of $5.10 to $5.30 per share.But it was Northrop Grumman, the US’s second-biggest pure military contractor by sales, that announced the biggest forecast earnings increase, raising its guidance by 10 per cent, to a range of $7.60 to $7.80 per share.The figures suggested a sharp turnround in the relative fortunes of the US economy, and the economies of formerly fast-growing emerging markets.Caterpillar, the maker of earthmoving and construction equipment, and one of the US industrial companies most exposed to emerging markets, cut its full-year forecast for the second successive quarter, by 7 per cent, to $6.50 per share. It said it had suffered from a winding down of dealers’ inventories and the continuing mining slump.Bob Shanks, CFO of Ford, the most obvious beneficiary of the US’s economic rebound, said he expected North America to continue to be a “strong performer” for the company.Ford’s North American pre-tax profits – which were boosted by the US’s fast-rising car demand – were 16 per cent up on last year’s second quarter, at $2.3bn.Mr Shanks said: “Our big opportunity is to take the operations outside of North America and get them contributing fairly, if you will, to the overall business.”Boeing benefited from the strength of worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft, including the problematic 787 Dreamliner. The company delivered 13 per cent more aircraft in the second quarter than in the same quarter of 2012 to airlines worldwide.The continuing strength of worldwide aircraft demand also helped General Dynamics – the maker of Gulfstream corporate jets – improve the operating profits in its aerospace division by 51 per cent, to $389m.Boeing also benefited from the continuing strength of demand from the US’s defence department, which helped the group’s operating profit rise 4 per cent to $776m on revenue that was flat at $8.2bn.Northrop Grumman reported still stronger demand from the Pentagon, particularly from the ramp-up in production of Lockheed Martin’s F35 fighter, to which it contributes many components. Demand for many of its unmanned aircraft was also strong.Jim McNerney, Boeing’s chief executive, said the effects of across-the-board sequestration cuts in defence spending had not yet made themselves felt.Caterpillar, meanwhile, continued to suffer from the slump in emerging markets’ once-booming mining industries. Operating profits in its resource industries division fell 61 per cent to $550m.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Not a recovery from where I’m sitting / From Mr William Dunkelberg
52;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-07-24T15:42:46Z;Biggest military contractors lift forecasts;Northrop and GD confirm defence industry strength;Northrop Grumman confirmed the robust health of the US’s biggest military contractors with better-than-expected net profits for the second quarter and a 10 per cent increase in its full-year earnings forecast.The lift in Northrop Grumman’s earnings guidance – from an earnings per share range of $6.85 to $7.15 to a $7.60 to $7.80 range – follows a smaller increase in full-year forecast reported on Tuesday by Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence contractor by revenues.General Dynamics, the US’s fourth-biggest military supplier by revenues, reinforced the strong industry trend as it reported on Wednesday that second quarter net earnings were 1 per cent higher at $640m.The military suppliers are benefiting from the lag effect as the biggest, most complex military programmes continue to spend money allocated up to eight years ago, long before across-the-board “sequestration” spending cuts started to take effect. Some may also be benefiting from the Pentagon’s apparent determination to safeguard some of the biggest, most strategically important military items from the cuts’ effects.Under the sequestration legislation – which was passed to end the 2011 stand-off over the US’s debt ceiling and came into force from March 1 this year – spending on nearly every US defence budget item is meant to be cut by 10 per cent.Northrop Grumman benefited particularly from strong demand for some unmanned systems – one of its specialities – and demand for Lockheed Martin’s F35 fighter, to which Northrop Grumman is a significant contributor. The two factors combined to push up the aerospace division’s operating income by 15 per cent to $336m, on sales which were up 8.7 per cent to $2.61bn.Net income at the electronic systems division rose 17 per cent to $322m on sales up 1.5 per cent to $1.77bn. The company attributed the growth to higher international sales and sales of sensing equipment and for space programmes.Northrop suffered the effects of sequestration in its information systems and technical services divisions. Such short-term businesses, which are funded from current year budgets, have been faster to experience sequestration’s effects than longer-term programmes. Information systems’ operating income fell 30 per cent to $141m, while technical services’ operating income fell 6.8 per cent to $69m.Wes Bush, chief executive, said Northrop would remain focused on maintaining its programmes’ performance and effective cash deployment.General Dynamics’ net income improved because of a 51 per cent increase to $389m in earnings in its aerospace division, which makes Gulfstream corporate jets. However, net income in its combat systems division, which mostly makes ground combat vehicles, fell 32 per cent to $218m.Northrop’s shares were up 3.8 per cent at lunchtime in New York, at $92.14, while GD’s were up 2.89 per cent at $86.46.
53;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-07-23T13:00:59Z;Defence contractors hopeful that big US programmes are safe;;"Contractors involved in some of the US military’s most sensitive and high-profile procurement projects are growing increasingly optimistic that some programmes could escape largely unscathed from sequestration spending cuts.The spared programmes would include those so complex, long-term or strategically important that it could prove nearly impossible to impose the spending cuts, introduced on March 1, meant to cut nearly every US defence budget item by around 10 per cent.Among the items that look likely to survive relatively unscathed are programmes to build nuclear-powered aircraft carriers at Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News Shipbuilding yard in Virginia, Boeing’s KC46A air tanker refuelling aircraft and Lockheed Martin’s F35 joint strike fighter.However, because many of the most complex items are paid for out of funds committed years in advance, it may take years for Defence Department policy in the area to become clear.Some further clarity may emerge this week when five big military contractors – Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon – all report second-quarter figures.Mike Petters, Huntington Ingalls’ chief executive, said sequestration’s near-term impact on his business was “fairly neutral” – but he accepted programmes might later be delayed slightly.“The intermediate impact is scheduling of future programmes could start to be impacted,” he said. “I think aircraft carriers, submarines and destroyers are the priorities. Everything else is in the mix of, ‘What can we do for the money we have left?’”Mr Petters’ view echoes that expressed by Phebe Novakovic, General Dynamics’ chief executive, at a Deutsche Bank conference in June.She said that in a “budget-constrained environment” mature, established “programmes of record” – those already fully established and properly funded – tended to do better than “high-risk, developmental programmes”.About 10 miles south of the long line of aircraft carriers along Newport News Shipbuilding’s piers sits another flat-topped US warship. But, while Newport News undertakes the glamorous work of building the navy’s biggest vessels from scratch, the facility in the Elizabeth River, by the naval port of Norfolk, plays a different role. The yard – owned by the US arm of the UK’s BAE Systems – carries out repairs and refurbishment work on naval vessels; in this case, a large deck amphibious assault ship, sitting in its floating Titan dry dock.Continue reading“So, to the extent that the department has some discretion in how they apply their reductions, you’re likely to see the programmes of record doing better and booking rates should be unaffected,” she said.Another figure in the sector pointed out that Pentagon officials had recently made supportive statements about the F35.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst for the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said it was “quite possibly true” that Huntington Ingalls’ key aircraft carrier and nuclear attack submarine programmes would largely escape cuts.Mr Thompson also predicted the F35, the DDG-51 destroyer, the air tanker and Boeing’s MV-22 Osprey rotorcraft would largely escape cuts, thanks to their strategic importance and the costs of modifying the programmes.Several defence contractors have already warned they expect sequestration to hit this year’s revenues at their services arms. Unlike long-term procurement programmes, for which funds are allocated years in advance, services tend to be paid for out of present-year budgets.Light armoured vehicles of the kind used heavily in Afghanistan are expected to become a far lower priority, following the US military drawdown there.F-35: Lockheed MartinThree branches of the US military – the marines, air force and navy – plan to buy some of the 2,443 F35s on order from Lockheed Martin, in a programme whose total cost is now expected to reach $1.5tn. The aircraft’s centrality to the US’s future defence plans, and the challenges in further adjusting it, are expected to leave it largely intact.KC-46A Tanker: BoeingThe tanker aircraft, being built by Boeing and based on its 767-200 commercial aircraft, is critical to replace the air force’s existing tanker fleet and preserve the reach of the air force’s other aircraft.Gerald Ford class aircraft carriers: Huntington IngallsIt takes around 11 years to build each $5bn aircraft carrier, from first steel-cutting to entry into service. US legislation also requires the navy have 11 operational at any one time, although only 10 are currently available. The carriers’ vital role in securing the US’s strategic position – and the complexity of altering the order – makes it likely the programme will survive with only some slowing.Virginia-class attack submarines: Huntington Ingalls and General DynamicsThe nuclear-powered attack submarines have a vital strategic role.DDG51 Destroyers: Huntington Ingalls and General DynamicsThe destroyers are expected to play a vital role in missile defence and other key strategic initiatives.MV22 Osprey rotorcraft: BoeingThe MV22 is considered vital to the marines’ ability to airlift troops over long distances. Equipped with two large rotors and wings, it operates like a helicopter when taking off or landing but swivels its rotors and converts itself into a faster, more fuel-efficient fixed-wing aircraft when travelling long distances.Programmes expected to sufferAbrams Tank: General DynamicsThe US Army, which is currently parking some tanks currently not needed, wants to stop production of the tank but has so far been ordered by Congress to keep building the vehicles.Bradley Fighting Vehicle: BAE SystemsThe programme is also threatened because of the number of vehicles already in service.Joint Light Tactical Vehicle: manufacturer not yet selectedThere has been speculation that the JLTV – intended to replace the Humvee as a battlefield vehicle – could be cancelled because of sequestration and the need to focus on other priorities."
54;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-07-23T12:36:53Z;Long-term work shields Newport News shipyard from US defence cuts;;"It is hard, when visiting the Newport News shipyard, in the Virginia town of the same name, to square the scene with the gloom widely predicted for military contractors following the start of deep, indiscriminate defence spending cuts earlier this year.The streets in the shipyard – so big it has its own railway, fire brigade and road names – teem with vehicles and workers going to and from the scores of buildings. The site, owned by Huntington Ingalls, remains Virginia’s biggest industrial employer, with 22,000 workers, well above its post cold war lows.But, from the office of Mike Petters, Huntington Ingalls’ chief executive, overlooking the yard, it becomes clear why the company and a handful of other key US military contractors are relatively unconcerned about the effects of sequestration, which mandates that nearly all US defence budget items must be cut by about 10 per cent.At one end of the yard, employees are still working on an aircraft carrier – the USS Gerald R Ford – on which work started in 2005. Further down, work is under way to “inactivate” the 52-year-old USS Enterprise, the country’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which needs its nuclear reactor and other sensitive equipment removed. Next to it, work is under way to overhaul and refuel the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a Nimitz class aircraft carrier built in 1986.The long planning horizons for such work mean that Huntington Ingalls and a few other key companies on big, sophisticated, long-term projects are still working with money set aside by the US Congress as much as eight years ago.“It’s not a this year effect,” Mr Petters says of sequestration. “It’s not even a this year or next couple of years effect. It’s more of a medium to long-term effect.”However, the question that looms over Huntington Ingalls as surely as the vast crane over the Gerald Ford is whether the tougher budget environment will eventually catch up with its work. It remains unclear whether military services will seek to make cuts solely in less high-profile programmes and spare aircraft carriers and other key programmes – or cut 10 per cent from all procurement programmes across the board.“The question is, ‘How does the navy buy 90 per cent of a ship?’” Mr Petters says.Even before sequestration, spending was falling following the US’s withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan, which many analysts expect to hit sales of some types of ground-fighting vehicles – a speciality of BAE Systems and General Dynamics. Some programmes might, however, be boosted by the US’s shift in strategic focus towards being able to fight a war in the Pacific, which is expected to ensure continued demand for the warships that Huntington Ingalls, General Dynamics’ Bath Iron Works and others manufacture.All the decisions, meanwhile, are being taken against the background of continued political disagreements over budgets in Washington. Arrival at Newport News of the Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft carrier due to undergo $2.6bn of refit and refuelling work, was delayed because of Congress’s initial failure to agree a federal budget for 2013, which meant the money for the project was at first unavailable.About 10 miles south of the long line of aircraft carriers along Newport News Shipbuilding’s piers sits another flat-topped US warship. But, while Newport News undertakes the glamorous work of building the navy’s biggest vessels from scratch, the facility in the Elizabeth River, by the naval port of Norfolk, plays a different role. The yard – owned by the US arm of the UK’s BAE Systems – carries out repairs and refurbishment work on naval vessels; in this case, a large deck amphibious assault ship, sitting in its floating Titan dry dock.Continue reading“We did find ourselves in a predicament,” says Mr Petters, who adds that the stand-off was eventually resolved – and the vessel delivered – in time for the issue not to affect the shipyard’s revenue for the year.The key to understanding the future impact of the myriad budget changes under way is that sequestration – introduced in legislation that ended the crisis over the US’s debt ceiling – was intended to be so irrational that all involved would find an alternative means of putting the US’s public finances back into order.The Pentagon is consequently faced with trying to make rational procurement choices based on a law intended to be irrational.“There continues to be a great deal of uncertainty around US defence spending and the impacts of sequestration,” says Northrop Grumman, another significant contractor, which declines to speculate on how its programmes might be affected.Huntington Ingalls executives expect the Pentagon to protect the key programmes and relegate other equipment to what it calls “the scrum” of less strategically important equipment. Huntington Ingalls could suffer from cuts to programmes to build amphibious assault ships, which it makes at the second of its two shipyards in Mississippi. But continued protection for the most strategically sensitive ships would leave it in an unusually strong position compared with rivals.It is “quite possibly true” that the company will continue to evade serious cuts in its biggest programmes, says Loren Thompson, defence analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.“Huntington Ingalls is the only major defence contractor that’s currently talking about margin expansion,” he says.However, Mr Thompson predicts there will, if sequestration continues, eventually be slowdowns even to the highest-profile programmes. Mr Petters agrees there could be slippage.“Sequestration might cause a programme to move from 2014 to 2015 or 2015 to 2016,” Mr Petters says.For the moment, however, the flow of work for the yard looks likely to remain strong.Next to the Gerald Ford’s dry dock, cut steel and other early components for the USS John F Kennedy, its sister ship, lie waiting. Work on that vessel started, with congressional funding, in 2011, even though no formal contract has yet been signed. Once the contract is signed, Newport News workers are expected to be busy with that vessel until at least 2021."
55;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-06-16T21:15:21Z;Drones: Delay over ground rules hampers civilian progress;Big potential for non-military use means the race is on for a workable flight-safety certification process for UAVs, writes Carola Hoyos;One of the UK army’s earliest modern drones was so notorious for not returning from its missions in Kosovo in the early 1990s that its handlers nicknamed it “Bugger off”.Since then, its successor aircraft have become far more reliable. Their crash statistics have improved dramatically as they have spent thousands of hours gathering intelligence from the skies of Iraq and Afghanistan while their pilots have sat in bunkers firmly rooted to the ground.But the reputation of unmanned aerial systems or vehicles (UAS or UAVs) – as the industry calls them – has stuck, contributing to a bottleneck costing billions of dollars, pounds and euros.Until now, large UAVs have mainly served in war zones or been tested in military airspace far out at sea. Because they were being rushed to the battlefields of Afghanistan there was no time or need for them to undergo the rigorous certification and testing to which their civilian counterparts are subjected.But now that the troops are preparing to return home from central Asia and businessmen are lobbying lawmakers about UAVs’ huge potential for non-military use, regulators are coming under increasing pressure to develop a strict process of certifying that they are safe for flight in civil airspace.Ideas for their potential deployment include fighting and monitoring forest fires, tending to large areas of crops, searching for victims of natural disasters, such as tornadoes and earthquakes and monitoring oil and gas pipelines and wells.The fear of unmanned aircraft colliding with jetliners and crashing into densely populated towns and cities, however, has led US and European authorities to move slowly and the delay is starting to be costly.A recent setback came last month when Germany cancelled its order of four Euro Hawks made by Northrop Grumman of the US and EADS, the pan-European aerospace and defence company. German officials cited the escalating costs of getting the UAVs’ airworthiness certification as the primary reason for the cancellation.“We are at a stage a bit like in the very first days of the development of the motor car when a man would have to walk ahead of it with a flag and the coroner’s report from the first accident stated that something like, ‘this should never happen again’,” says Fiona Lewinton, head of UAS at Qinetiq, the UK defence contractor that tests and evaluates drones for the UK and has flown them for the Dutch and Polish armies in Afghanistan.The US has a similar problem even though Congress has tried to hurry the debate along by mandating that the Federal Aviation Authority come up with its rules and procedures for unmanned aircraft by 2015.That date is almost certainly unrealistically optimistic, especially as the US has an additional hurdle to overcome. Several states have already enacted prohibitive laws pushed for by those who fear spying UAVs would violate US citizens’ civil liberties and privacy.Stephen McKeever, Oklahoma’s secretary of state for science and technology, says the privacy issue has delayed until the end of this year the federal decision over which states will get the coveted right to open slivers of their airspace to test UAVs. Oklahoma is one of those vying for the chance.“The safest way to not have an unmanned aerial vehicle crash with a manned aircraft is not to have UAVs fly at all. Regulators want to sleep at night and the easiest way to do that is to say no, not yes,” he says.That is making the barrier to entry prohibitively high, with only the biggest military and engineering companies, most notably BAE Systems, Dassault Aviation, Thales and EADS of Europe, Lockheed Martin, General Atomic and Northrop Grumman of the US and Israeli firms Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries, able to afford to develop complex drones and test them over military airspace.Eventually authorities in the US, Europe and beyond will have to relent, industry executives and politicians say. Though even the most impatient supporter of UAVs agrees that there is a need for regulators and the industry developing the relevant safety technology to get it right lest the industry be killed in its infancy by a deadly crash, the pressure is great, especially in these austere times.The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a US lobby group, believes integrating UAVs would have an economic effect worth more than $13.6bn and create upward of 70,000 jobs in the first three years. It forecasts that by 2025 those numbers could grow to $82bn and 100,000 respectively.Unmanned passenger planes may be difficult to imagine at the moment even for the most ardent supporter. But their ability to spend long hours aloft without putting at danger pilot and crew, their relative cost advantage over piloted planes and the many different shapes and sizes they come in (from as small as a dragon fly to as big as a jet fighter), have prompted much excitement over their potential use. All that will only be possible once they are allowed to fly in civil airspace. For countries and companies interested in capturing the market, the race to be the first to sort out certification and the relevant technology is on.
56;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Aerospace trio campaigns for European drone programme;;Three of Europe’s biggest defence contractors have called on governments to launch a European drone programme to compete with the US and Israeli companies that dominate the sector.Pan-European EADS, Italy’s Finmeccanica and France’s Dassault want governments to secure jobs, technical knowhow and European militaries’ ability to maintain sovereign independence over the intelligence that medium-altitude long-endurance drones are designed to collect.The group, which made its statement on the eve of this year’s Paris Air Show, which opens on Monday, notably omits the UK’s BAE Systems, Europe’s biggest defence contractor.France and the UK, through BAE and Dassault, are already pursuing a joint drone programme. But the Anglo/French effort remains in its infancy and could be threatened by a second European effort because the continent’s market for military drones is too small – especially in today’s austere financial climate – to support multiple efforts.Large military aerospace projects are almost always financed by governments, though companies also usually take a significant degree of the financial risk.Last month, the German government pulled out of the Euro Hawk drone programme with EADS and Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor, blaming the escalation in costs to get the aircraft certified for flight.Berlin said it would cost more than €500m to win airworthiness for the drone, adding that it would not spend more on the programme than the €250m already allocated. The decision to scrap the deal leaves the German military with the question of how to replace the older Breguet Atlantic reconnaissance aeroplane, which is being retired.Drones will share hostile skies with crewed military aircraft for decades. But industry insiders believe they are the future, with some even believing the last manned fighter jet is already being built.But the German decision was a serious blow not only for military drones. Regulators in Europe and the US are coming under increasing pressure to come up with standards that would allow drones to fly in civilian airspace so that they could be further developed for use outside the military.In their statement, Finmeccanica, EADS and Dassault raised the issue as one of the most vexing problems of developing drones – or unmanned aerial vehicles as the industry calls them – noting: “With a new development, critical requirements around the certification of drones, allowing their safe passage and operation in European air space, would inherently be built into the programme from the onset.”At present UAVs are neither certified nor do they have the safety record of manned civilian aircraft. Supporters believe their uses could include monitoring oil pipelines and rigs, helping in rescue operations after natural disasters and fighting forest fires.
57;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-06-05T16:55:17Z;German minister defends ditching of drone deal;;Germany cancelled its €660m contract last month to develop reconnaissance drones based on US technology because of a “fundamental misunderstanding” over certification requirements, the German defence minister said on Wednesday.The process of gaining certification to fly the unmanned aircraft in European air space would have practically doubled the cost of the contract, said Thomas de Maizière.In the face of demands for his resignation, Mr de Maizière gave a staunch defence of his government’s decision to terminate the deal for five Euro Hawk drones with Northrop Grumman, the US defence manufacturer, and Cassidian, the defence arm of the European aerospace combine EADS.He spelt out a whole series of miscalculations and renegotiations that had bedevilled the Euro Hawk project and raised its price since the original €371m contract was signed in 2007. But he said that money spent developing a new reconnaissance system called ISIS as part of the deal would not be wasted.He defended his own position on the grounds that he had not been fully informed about the certification problem until early May, when he decided to abort the programme. But he hinted at possible resignations in the ranks of the embattled German defence ministry.The core of the problem, Mr de Maizière told parliamentarians, was that “both sides had different conceptions about the standards that were necessary for the Euro Hawk to be allowed to fly in German air space”. The manufacturers had been “over-optimistic” in assuming that US certification merely had to be “adjusted” to meet German requirements.Although the manufacturers disputed the estimate, he added, his ministry calculated that proper certification would cost up to €600m in additional costs. Moreover, the prototype Global Hawk on which the Euro Hawk was based was already being phased out in the US.Mr de Maizière’s self-defence was not enough to silence opposition calls for him to take personal responsibility for the affair.Carsten Schneider, budget spokesman for the Social Democratic party, said it was “simply not imaginable” that the minister had not been informed in good time about such fundamental problems with a vital arms contract. If he had not known about it, he should have found out.“He cannot simply offer a pawn in sacrifice for the mistakes of his ministry and his personal negligence,” he said. “Mr de Maizière must take political responsibility himself and resign.”Mr de Maizière is one of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s closest allies in the present centre-right government, and his resignation would be a severe blow for her Christian Democratic Union, facing a general election on September 22.Until Wednesday, he had refused to answer opposition criticism that he had known about the problems with the Euro Hawk since early 2012, and should have cancelled the project much sooner.Speaking behind closed doors to the Bundestag defence committee and budget committee, he said it would have been more expensive to cancel the project sooner, because the ISIS reconnaissance system could not have been properly tested. The government would now choose a new aircraft “platform” to carry the reconnaissance system.“The Bundeswehr urgently needs the capacity for an airborne reconnaissance system” to monitor radio and radar signals, he added. “By the end of 2013, all suitable options will be investigated.” The money spent on developing the ISIS system would not be wasted, and unspent money in the Euro Hawk contract could be used to buy alternative aircraft.Mr de Maizière would not say precisely how much money was lost in the abortive contract, because he said development costs of the drones and the reconnaissance system could not be clearly split. But he estimated the cost of developing and testing the reconnaissance system at €360m.
58;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;EADS raises guidance for new orders;;EADS, parent of Airbus, raised its guidance for new orders this year by more than 100 passenger jets amid strong demand in the commercial aviation sector.Tom Enders, EADS’ chief executive, told the aerospace and defence company’s annual meeting that it is expecting Airbus to secure “comfortably above” 800 gross orders – a figure that does not include contract cancellations – in 2013, compared with previous guidance of “around” 700.His statement backed up EADS’ guidance for revenue growth this year, in spite of the company’s defence businesses being hit by spending cutbacks by European governments.Mr Enders highlighted how Airbus had booked orders for 514 jets between January and April, led by a contract for 234 narrow-body aircraft placed by Lion Air, the Indonesian low-cost carrier, worth $24bn at catalogue prices – making it one of the biggest deals in the company’s history.The annual meeting in Amsterdam was EADS’ first since undergoing sweeping reform of its shareholder and governance structure, in changes that should reduce the amount of day-to-day influence wielded by the French and German governments at the company.The reform followed the collapse of a proposed tie-up last year between EADS and BAE Systems, the UK defence company, principally because of objections by the German government.The failure of the tie-up has prompted EADS to embark on a wide-ranging strategic review, partly focused on what its future defence activities should be.This review gained new relevance this week after the German government cancelled its contract with EADS and Northrop Grumman for five military drones. The companies are negotiating to convince Germany to reinstate the order.Mr Enders bemoaned the slowness of European governments to order unmanned aircraft or to develop joint programmes to do so, saying Europe had “wasted, probably, the last 10 years” in drone development. “This is why, in other countries, other companies are more advanced,” he added.EADS proposed a dividend of €0.60 per share, based on its earnings per share after one-offs of €1.50 in 2012.Mr Enders said that Airbus’ planned new wide-body jet, the A350, was on track, although the delivery of the first aircraft to a customer has been put back to the second half of next year.He implicitly contrasted the rollout of the first A350 test aircraft from the Airbus paint shop in Toulouse this month with Boeing’s wide-body 787, which was temporarily grounded in January because of significant problems with its lithium-ion batteries.“The aircraft we rolled out a couple of weeks ago didn’t have rivets from Walmart, like the ones our competitors had at the time of their rollout,” joked Mr Enders. “It’s a real aircraft.”
59;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-05-27T21:33:15Z;Northrop and EADS in rescue call for Euro Hawk;;The companies behind the Euro Hawk reconnaissance drones said they hoped the German government would reconsider its decision to scrap its order for the aircraft over costs.The German armed forces have one prototype Euro Hawk, which are built by Northrop Grumman and EADS, and are considering buying four more.But Berlin said this month that it would not go ahead with the deal because winning airworthiness certification for the drone would cost more than €500m.It said it would not spend more on the programme than the €250m already allocated.The decision to scrap the deal still leaves the German military with the question of how to replace the older Breguet Atlantic spy plane, which is being retired.Euro Hawk, which is designed to collect enemy communications and radar signals, is a modified version of the Global Hawk unmanned aircraft used by the US Air Force. EADS, which teamed up with Northrop in 2000, provides the sensor payload.Northrop on Monday said that it and EADS remained “fully committed” to the Euro Hawk programme and the “critical capabilities the system would provide the German armed forces and its allies”. It said the aircraft had “performed flawlessly and safely” throughout its flight test programme. Reports of problems with its flight control system and excessive costs related to completing its airworthiness certification were “inaccurate”.Northrop said the company had still not received formal notification that the contract had been cancelled and it was confident that the Euro Hawk programme could be preserved.The company said the Euro Hawk partners would continue to work with Germany “to address any concerns they may have with the system” and “provide an affordable and achievable plan to complete flight testing of the initial asset” as well as production of the four additional planes.A person close to the company said the real cost of completing airworthiness certification was closer to €250m than the €500m that has been reported.
60;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Northrop Grumman maintains outlook amid US budget constraints;;Northrop Grumman is standing by its projections for 2013 earnings and sales despite delays in contract negotiations and uncertainty over future spending brought on by US government budget cuts.Wes Bush was speaking as Northrop, manufacturer of the B2 stealth bomber and other high-profile military hardware, announced first-quarter net earnings down 3.4 per cent to $489m compared with the same quarter last year, on sales down 1 per cent to $6.1bn.“All of this is creating a high degree of turmoil as our customers navigate these budget cross-currents,” Mr Bush said. “We share the concerns of the Pentagon leadership that damage to national security may be irreversible if sequestration is long-term.”Northrop Grumman is the Pentagon’s third-biggest supplier by sales, after Lockheed Martin and Boeing.General Dynamics, the fourth-biggest supplier, also stood by its projections for the year on Wednesday as it announced first-quarter net income up 1 per cent to $571m. However, it took significant write-offs in January partly as a result of the expected effect of military spending cuts on its business’s value.Both companies’ earnings highlighted how sequestration – which came into effect from March 1 – is having only a gradual impact on the US’s biggest military contractors. Most of the biggest military procurement programmes are paid for over several years from budgets allocated as much as five years before.Contractors are consequently expected to see the cuts’ results first in short-term contracts, such as those to supply information technology and other services, and to see the impact in items such as naval shipbuilding only in years to come.Northrop said it still expected 2013 earnings in a range between $6.85 and $7.15 per share and full-year sales about $24bn.Mr Bush said Northrop was taking a number of steps to withstand the effects of sequestration, including setting up “centres of excellence” in key areas such as manned and unmanned aviation. These would enable the company to retain expertise in key areas even as it reorganised manufacturing.Segment operating income at Northrop’s information systems division showed the biggest falls against last year’s first quarter, declining 17 per cent to $171m, on sales down 9 per cent to $1.67bn. Segment operating income at technical services fell 7 per cent to $65m, on sales down 4 per cent to $717m.Operating income in information systems fell 3 per cent to $296m, on flat sales of $1.72bn, while segment operating income in the core aerospace business fell 3 per cent to $270m, on sales up 4 per cent to $2.48bn. Aerospace volumes benefited from higher deliveries of the F35 joint strike fighter, to which Northrop Grumman contributes.The two big contractors issued their figures a day after Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, said it expected sequestration – which reduced nearly all Pentagon budgets by 9 per cent – to cut its sales this year by $825m.Northrop shares closed up 3.2 per cent to $73.77, while General Dynamics was up 6.9 per cent to $71.73.
61;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
62;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-03-27T15:18:48Z;EADS: ready for take-off;Chief executive of European aerospace and defence group given new freedom;"If Tom Enders ever decides to quit EADS, could somebody offer him a job in Brussels? Anyone who can persuade France and Germany to agree to so many things so quickly deserves a shot at running Europe. Shareholders backed a governance overhaul at the aerospace and defence group on Wednesday that should give the chief executive the operational and strategic freedom he clearly lacked in the BAE Systems affair. The question now is what Mr Enders intends to do with all that hard-won independence.He is unlikely to test his room for manoeuvre early. EADS claims to have put the BAE affair behind it and is concentrating on reaping the rewards of the boom in commercial aerospace. Airbus accounted for almost all of total group new orders of just over €100bn last year; the A350 is still to come; and operating margins are starting to improve. The defence division is very bitty, which is why Mr Enders wanted to acquire BAE. There are enough ex-defence industry figures on the new EADS board put in place yesterday to ensure that he has the heavyweight backing to start turning it round.The board certainly does not want for gravitas. There is Jean-Claude Trichet, late of the European Central Bank; Denis Ranque, former chief executive of Thales (and likely new chairman of EADS); former Northrop Grumman executive Ralph Crosby; and Daimler chairman Manfred Bischoff. It has been put together as part of a series of moves involving the exit of Daimler and Lagardère as investors and the reshuffling of the stakes held by Germany, France and Spain. It is stretching things, though, to imagine that this board, stuffed as it is with establishment figures, would have given the nod to a move as far-reaching as the acquisition of BAE. Mr Enders has achieved a lot of what he wants at EADS. But he may still be the only radical in the room at the next board meeting.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

Even if we adjust for sequester, we still consider the market to be overly negative,” the note said.The rest of the US equity markets recovered from early losses and moved closer to multiyear highs on the first day of trading after fiscal sequestration came into effect on Friday night. Investors last week brushed off the potential impact, with indices trading near cyclical peaks.Analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote that equity markets have “depoliticised”, at a time when political rancour has hit a crescendo, and returned to fundamentals.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent higher on Monday at 1,525.20 with investors favouring defensive sectors stocks such as utilities and telecoms, while shunning energy, industrials and materials.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 per cent to 14,127.82, less than 40 points away from an all-time high last reached in October 2007.Still, shares in miners and metal producers were hit after a report by Deutsche Bank said iron ore prices may slump 24 per cent by the end of this year as supply expands.In a research note, they wrote that low steel demand from China and an abundance of scrap metal were key threats to prices.Shares in Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore producer, fell 5.8 per cent to $23.78, making it the worst performing stock on the S&P 500 index. Shares in Allegheny Technologies dropped 1.6 per cent to $29.82, while United States Steel lost 1.3 per cent to $20.05.Hess shares climbed after the oil and gas company said it would quit its retail, energy marketing and energy trading businesses and increase dividends. The company was responding to pressure from its third-largest shareholder, Elliott Management, which has long been lobbying for spinning off some of its assets. The shares rose 3.5 per cent to $68.84.JC Penney shares fell 5.6 per cent to $15.75 in extended-hours trading following a 5.4 per cent drop during the day, after CNBC reported that Deutsche Bank is offering 10m block of shares for sale.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 3,182.03.Shares in Apple, the largest component of the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq, fell 2.5 per cent to $419.57. The iPhone maker has lost more than 40 per cent of its market value since peaking last September.Netflix dropped 4.3 per cent to $181.21. The shares had gained more than 95 per cent since the start of the year.Yahoo shares rallied 3.5 per cent to $22.70 after analysts at Barclays upgraded the stock to “overweight”, saying minority stakes in businesses such as Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan have not been fully priced in.“The value of the company’s underlying Asian assets, namely Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan, have appreciated and the full value of these assets is not being ascribed to Yahoo shares,” the note said
64;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-03-01T20:51:21Z;US sequestration: drama, comedy, horror;A collective case of shock fatigue suggests we have reached mid-series malaise;Think of recent US fiscal policy as a film franchise – part drama, part comedy, part horror. The opening instalment was the summer 2011 blockbuster, Debt Ceiling. The downgrade of US debt after the default brinkmanship made our jaws drop, but was followed by a clever plot twist: Treasuries rallied to all-time lows. And the brilliant producers, President Barack Obama and Speaker John Boehner, planted the seeds for a string of sequels. The winter showdown, Fiscal Cliff, ended with a feel-good (if temporary) holiday compromise.But with Friday’s release of Sequestration, featuring $85bn in automatic spending cuts slated for 2013 (the first of $1.2tn over a decade), we have reached mid-series malaise. The collective yawn from all involved indicate that this edition is one big plot hole. Mr Obama has hit the talk show circuit to vainly stoke up fervour among ordinary Americans. However his golf vacation, along with meaningless negotiations with Republicans, betray that Washington is resting up for its next project.What movie is the market watching instead? The reliable if dry Earnings Season is playing alongside the remake of Merger Mania (not as thrilling as the 2007 version) and with this double feature, the Dow is closing in on its all-time high of 14,164.That said, the defence names are indeed hitting the theatres for Sequestration. Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, and Lockheed Martin are down as much as 5 per cent this year. The smaller defence companies that are more geared towards services could be harder hit. The government and military consultant, Booz Allen Hamilton is down nearly a tenth.The next contribution, Government Shutdown (an homage to the 1996 classic starring Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich) is only weeks away as Uncle Sam needs to fund its future operations. And Debt Ceiling III: Dirty Barry is slated for this summer, though these next two could mercifully be wrapped into one grand (bargain) finale.Movies are, ultimately, an escape. The reality remains weak gross domestic product growth and 8 per cent unemployment. And it may be a fantasy to think Washington could star in a movie about fixing that.
65;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-02-17T18:02:13Z;Vodafone and BAE in security tie-up;Focus on safeguarding mobile devices;Vodafone has teamed up with BAE Systems on the defence contractor’s push to expand its cyber security offering, signing a five-year partnership that will focus on the development of safeguards for mobile devices.BAE currently derives about 7 per cent of both revenues and profits from its cybersecurity arm but is hoping to increase margins by moving from a focus on consulting to developing products.The partnership’s first joint offering is set to be a “threat manager” that uses cloud computing to protect a company by screening its mobile network rather than applying certain security standards to every device – be it smart phone or tablet computer – in the system.While the two companies have worked together on security products before, this will mark the first time they bring one to market as a partnership.BAE declined to give the financial terms of the deal but said revenues would be split on a “per user basis”.The defence contractor and its peers have been keen to expand their civil sales, including from cyber security work, to make up for falling defence revenues as cash-strapped governments look for cuts in their defence budgets and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars wind down.But cyber security products can also win customers in traditional defence sectors, with Nato recently signing contracts with Italy’s Finmeccanica and the US’s Northrup Grumman to secure its network.Vodafone is, in common with other telecoms groups, trying to wring extra revenues out of security and cloud offerings as sales from phone calls and texts sink – hit by both Europe’s troubled economy and structural shifts to communication via the internet.Revenues at the telecoms operator fell 7 per cent last year, while impairments on its southern European business helped produce a pre-tax loss of £492m, down from an £8bn profit a year earlier.BAE and Vodafone are aiming to eventually offer a range of security systems through their partnership, including those to protect “machine to machine” interactions, such as people using their mobile phones to adjust their gas meters.“As a new generation of mobile-centric security risks begins to emerge, our customers are lookign for our help,” said Vittorio Colao, Vodafone’s chief executive.Ian King, BAE’s chief executive, said: “These technologies are subject to the vulnerabilities of cyber space and we can provide the mobile marketplace with protection against today’s threats and the advanced threats of the future.”The US government recently cited cyber spying by China and Russia as “ a significant and growing threat”, both to companies and national security.

EADS on Tuesday proposed a 12-member board for approval by the investor meeting next month, including Mr Ranque and Mr Crosby.“The nominations are based on the balance of skills and range of experience of the nominees,” said EADS, parent of Airbus, the passenger jet manufacturer.Mr Crosby is a former head of EADS’ North American business, and the company is seeking further inroads into the US market by building a factory in Alabama that will make Airbus passenger jets.Tom Enders, EADS’ chief executive, is aiming to reduce the amount of political meddling at the company, which is currently controlled by the French and German governments through a special shareholder pact.After the investor meeting next month, this pact is due to be dissolved. State ownership of EADS will increase under the changes, but the governments’ special rights should reduce.Paris and Berlin are expected to end up with stakes of 12 per cent each in EADS, with Madrid holding a further 4 per cent.On the new board, there will be four French people and four Germans. Two of these French people – Anne Lauvergeon and Jean-Claude Trichet – have been endorsed by Paris because they will also sit on an EADS subsidiary supervising sensitive military assets.Two of the Germans – Manfred Bischoff and Hans-Peter Kietel – have been backed by Berlin, because they will also sit on another EADS subsidiary covering military assets.The French government pressed for Ms Lauvergeon to become chairman of EADS, but the company’s nomination committee favours Mr Ranque because it wanted to secure a candidate with significant experience in the aerospace and defence industry.Ms Lauvergeon is, however, due to be the first woman to serve on the EADS board.Other proposed members of the EADS board include Sir John Parker, chairman of Anglo American; Lakshmi Mittal, chief executive of ArcelorMittal; and Josep Piqué i Camps, chairman of Vueling."
67;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-01-30T19:38:08Z;Northrop results lifted by drone demand;;Northrop Grumman became the latest military contractor to report stronger-than-expected results on Wednesday when continuing demand for its drones helped it to produce 2012 net income of $1.98bn.The earnings figure – down 6.6 per cent from last year’s $2.12bn – reflected the better-than-expected operating profit margin, which held steady at 12.4 per cent. Revenues fell 4.5 per cent to $25.2bn. The company also forecast earnings per share from continuing operations – which in 2012 were $7.81 – would be in a range of $6.85 to $7.15.Observers have watched military contractors’ results carefully for signs of their expectations about the US’s military spending over the coming year. Big, across-the-board spending cuts could still come into force starting in March if there is no political agreement on resolving the US’s public finance problems. Such cuts would slash about 10 per cent from nearly all military spending programmes.Northrop Grumman, like most other big contractors, based its 2013 forecasts on the basis that there would be no big new spending cuts during the year and that spending would proceed on the basis of President Obama’s budget request for the year.Wes Bush, chief executive, said the results both for the year and 2012’s fourth quarter – when the company reported net earnings down 3 per cent to $533m on revenue down 0.5 per cent to $6.48bn – had been “outstanding”.“As we look ahead, we expect challenges, but we are confident in our team’s ability to address those challenges and continue to create value for all our stakeholders,” Mr Bush said.Segment operating income for aerospace systems – the biggest segment by sales – held steady at $1.22bn, on sales up 7 per cent to $9.98bn. The company put the increased sales down to increased demand for its unmanned systems, particularly the Advanced Ground Surveillance system it produces for the Nato military alliance and its Fire Scout unmanned helicopter.Sales in electronic systems fell 5.7 per cent to $6.95bn as demand for equipment to protect against certain kinds of infrared attacks and targeting systems fell. However, operating income improved 10.9 per cent to $1.19bn as the division earned better bonuses for its performance on a number of contracts, including some combat avionics systems.However, the company was the latest of several contractors to report declining sales for information systems– which, because they are ordered to tight deadlines, are more vulnerable than other programmes to spending cuts. The division’s operating income fell 0.7 per cent to $761m, on sales down 7.1 per cent to $7.36bn.Northrop’s shares rose 0.27 per cent to $66.95.
68;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2013-01-03T17:30:16Z;The women piloting an industry;Several US defence companies have appointed female leaders;"For a few days now, three of the US’s six biggest defence companies have had women at the helm. Both Marillyn Hewson at Lockheed Martin, the country’s biggest defence contractor by revenue, and Phebe Novakovic at General Dynamics, its fourth largest defence supplier, took on the chief executive role at their respective companies on January 1. In doing so, they are following in the footsteps of Linda Hudson, who was the US defence sector’s first female chief in 2009 when she became head of BAE Inc, US subsidiary of the UK defence group.But that is not all. In an industry where senior management teams have traditionally been led by men, women are also filling many positions just below the rank of CEO. When Boeing Defence late last year reshuffled its executive ranks and created seven new leadership roles, five were filled by women; six of the 14 members of Northrop Grumman’s senior management team are women. Back at Lockheed Martin, three of seven of the top leadership roles are held by women.Some observers believe the impact could be significant: “If there’s only 10 per cent of women in your executive ranks they tend to echo the opinion of the majority. Once that gets up to 30 per cent or more they are very much able to voice a wider set of goals and ambitions in the workplace,” says Sylvia Ann Hewlett, founder of think-tank the Cen­ter for Talent Innovation.Loren Thompson, defence analyst and chief operating officer at the Lexington Institute, another think-tank, says the US defence industry is in the middle of “a revolutionary demogra­phic shift that may soon make women the dominant gender among senior executives”. But Mr Thompson does not expect it to initiate any significant change: “To be successful in the defence industry, women must conform with the same numbers-driven performance criteria that men face.”The appointments come at a time when defence companies are being forced to change how they operate as deep budget cuts and stringent new contract terms take effect.Ms Hewson attributes her success to a willingness to take risks and remain open to new ideas. Mr Thompson notes in particular that her humility will serve her well in mending Lockheed’s relationship with its biggest customer, the Pentagon – which analysts who cover the company say is a top priority. Relations became strained after delays and cost overruns at Lockheed’s Joint Strike Fighter programme, the most expensive military procurement proj­ect ever.Her appointment late last year was a surprise – even to her. It came after the heir-apparent resigned because of an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate.The National Science Foundation, an independent US government agency responsible for promoting science and engineering through res­earch programmes and education projects, notes that the momentum in recruiting more women has stalled and some of the gains even reversed.One reason may be that a growing number of potential leaders are balking at the sacrifice their predecessors made, as Anne-Marie Slaughter noted in an article for The Atlantic magazine entitled: “Why Women Still Can’t Have it All.” She explained her decision to give up a high-powered position in the US State Department to spend more time with her children. Ms Hewson has moved her family eight times during her career.A second threat to whether the emergence of more female leaders in defence will be judged a success in years to come may arise precisely from the challenges that made their elevation possible. Michelle Ryan and Alex Has­lam, professors at Exeter University, studied the UK’s biggest 100 listed companies in 2004, and concluded that women are more like­ly to be appointed to leadership positions that are associated with an inc­reased risk of criticism and failure.The situation could hardly be more precarious for the women newly in leadership positions in defence companies. Congress this week managed to avoid the feared $500bn automatic defence and security spending cuts that would have gone into effect at midnight on January 1 – Ms Hewson and Ms Novakovic’s first day as CEOs – had they failed to agree a last-minute fiscal budget deal. But many defence experts and executives believe the pain has merely been delayed and that deep cuts remain on the horizon given the US’s high debt and the large proportion of defence spending within the US’s discretionary budget. Some predict total US spending on defence procurement and research and development – the sections of the budget most pertinent to the big military contractors – to fall by as much as 40-50 per cent from their peak during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.As Robert Stevens, Lockheed’s former chief, and his peers ease into retirement, the new leaner reality presents the single biggest challenge to those who are getting their first chance to lead."
69;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-12-22T00:06:36Z;Defence cuts likely to hurt service providers;;The effect of defence spending reductions under the fiscal cliff package of cuts would fall more quickly on providers of services to the Pentagon than on weapons makers, analysts have said.Any cuts for big weapons makers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman would probably be only about 2-3 per cent next year, said Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defence analyst.However, companies that offer day-to-day services to the Pentagon such as data processing would be more likely to see more immediate cuts, according to Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute.The men spoke as the Aerospace Industries Association, a lobbyist for military contractors, called for defence spending to be split from negotiations over the fiscal cliff mixture of tax increases and spending cuts that are set to come in on January 1.The Pentagon’s budget accounts for about half of the government’s discretionary expenditure – spending that is not mandated under fixed government programmes. As a result, defence budgets are set to fall 9.1 per cent next year, across all programmes, if the automatic spending cuts come into force.The complexities of the Pentagon’s $550bn annual budget mean that different programmes would be affected differently. The main division is between companies whose earnings come from Pentagon procurement budgets and those paid from short-term operational budgets. Procurement budgets set up for individual programmes tend to be set up to disburse funds over three years as weapons are ordered and manufactured.As a result, programmes such as Lockheed Martin’s F35 joint strike fighter are likely to feel the effect of the sequestration cuts only after three years, according to Mr McAleese.For naval shipbuilding, each procurement budget can be spent over as long as five years. That had “major application” for General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, two of the biggest operators of naval shipyards, Mr McAleese said.“It will be 2015 before they actually begin to feel the effects of a sequester,” Mr McAleese said.However, companies paid from “short-cycle budgets” – such as CACI, the information technology provider based in Virginia – would feel the cuts far more quickly. “Companies providing services such as data processing, logistics and accounting will feel a significant impact in the first year,” he said.The only operational budgets exempt from the sequestration cuts would be those that pay for continuing deployments such as in Afghanistan.Despite the exemption, Marion Blakey, chief executive of the AIA, attacked plans to implement the sequestering of defence spending.“Risking American lives and livelihoods for political leverage is wrong,” she said.She demanded that defence spending be decoupled from the other tax and spending issues under negotiation between the two political sides.“The victims of this political gamesmanship will be the warfighters who risk their lives to protect our country and the American workers who will start losing their jobs when this game implodes on January 2, 2013,” Ms Blakey said.
70;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-10-25T13:38:04Z;Raytheon raises guidance amid uncertainty;;Raytheon, the manufacturer of missiles and other military systems, became the third big US defence contractor in two days to raise earnings guidance for the full year despite looming budget uncertainty as it announced its third-quarter results.Raytheon increased its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings per share – earnings from continuing operations excluding certain pension factors – to a range of $5.85 to $5.95, from $5.70 to $5.85 previously. It trimmed its net sales forecast from $24.5bn to $25bn previously to $24.3bn to $24.7bn.Raytheon nevertheless warned that scheduled swingeing military spending cuts– known as sequestration – in the new year could have a “significant impact” on the US defence industry as a whole. It remains uncertain if sequestration will take place, however.Sequestration is one of the terms of last year’s Budget Control Act, introduced to head off a crisis over the US debt ceiling, and would involve automatic cuts of about 10 per cent in nearly all US military spending programmes.“We believe that Raytheon’s large international market presence, portfolio of programmes, technology and focus on high priority areas should help to mitigate some of the potential overall impact,” the company said.Raytheon’s upgrade for the present year and warning about sequestration’s potential consequences follows similar statements on Wednesday from Lockheed Martin, maker of the F35 fighter, and Northrop Grumman, maker of the B2 Stealth bomber.Those companies also stressed, like Raytheon, a determination to prove their products offered good value and to expand their international businesses. Most observers believe that, even if politicians hammer out a deal to prevent sequestration, the US faces significant defence spending cuts in the coming years.Raytheon’s third-quarter net income was $500m, marginally down on the previous year’s third quarter $501m, on revenue 1 per cent lower at $6.05bn. Diluted earnings per share rose 4.9 per cent to $1.50.Operating income at the core integrated defence systems division rose 18 per cent to $204m, on net sales up 8.4 per cent to $1.28bn.Operating income in missile systems rose 6.2 per cent to $189m, while space and airborne systems operating income was up 11 per cent to $190m.“Overall, the businesses performed well in the quarter,” William Swanson, chief executive, said.The shares rose 0.85 per cent to $55.62.
71;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-10-24T18:55:39Z;US defence companies – cliff ahead;It has been a good year but investors must tread carefully;If anyone is standing on the edge of the fiscal cliff, it is the defence industry. Unless co-operation unexpectedly breaks out in Congress, automatic spending reductions will kick in at the start of 2013, including cuts of about 10 per cent on most military spending programmes. This year, however, the industry has beaten Wall Street expectations, raised guidance and seen their stocks outperform.Lockheed Martin’s third-quarter earnings, released on Wednesday, beat analysts’ estimates and the company raised its guidance for 2012 earnings per share by about 4 per cent. Northrop Grumman nudged its full year target up on Wednesday as well. Shares of Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon (which reports quarterly earnings on Thursday) have all outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year. All three, while short of their pre-crisis peaks, are at or near multiyear highs.Boeing, which gets 40 per cent of revenue from defence and space, also increased its full-year guidance on Wednesday. An increase this year in deliveries of commercial aeroplanes is underpinning the outlook, but the company also expects slightly higher revenues from defence, space and security this year.While the defence stocks do not look terribly expensive, trading at 10 to 12 times forward earnings while generating strong cash flows, the sector has traditionally traded at a discount to the wider market. The unavoidable conclusion is that investors either: (a) do not believe the cuts will come to pass: (b) think Congress will act to mitigate its effects on the military or: (c) have been hypnotised by the defence companies’ recent outperformance.All of these attitudes are dangerous. While raising this year’s guidance, Lockheed simultaneously warned of falling revenues next year, cliff or no cliff. Investors need to adopt the same realistic approach.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
72;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-10-24T17:45:33Z;Defence contractors face budget fears;;Two of the US’s biggest military contractors raised their full-year guidance as they predicted strong ends to the year, despite the looming threat of across-the-board defence budget cuts in January.Lockheed Martin, maker of the F35 and other combat aircraft, said it expected earnings per share from continuing operations for the current year of $8.20 to $8.40 per share, from $7.90 to $8.10 previously. Northrop Grumman, maker of the B-2 Stealth bomber, upgraded its earnings estimate from $7.05 to $7.25 a share to between $7.35 and $7.40.The upgrades came after both companies announced third-quarter profits significantly better than analysts’ expectations.Lockheed’s net earnings improved to $727m, from $700m for the same period last year including $35m from discontinued operations, on a 2 per cent decline in net sales to $11.9bn. Earnings per share rose 5 per cent to $2.21.Northrop Grumman’s net earnings fell 12 per cent to $459m, on revenue down 5 per cent to $6.27bn. Earnings per share fell 4 per cent to $1.82.However, General Dynamics, which makes warships, military vehicles and corporate jets, fell short of analysts’ expectations, producing net earnings down 8 per cent to $600m, on revenue up 1 per cent to $7.93bn. On a per-share basis, earnings fell 5.5 per cent to $1.71.Bob Stevens, Lockheed Martin chief executive, said the “strong operating results“ were a reflection of several factors, including its focus on affordability and programme execution.“We also have a strategy that is aligned with our customers, a proven portfolio of products and technologies, and a team that is talented and dedicated, even with the uncertainties that lie ahead,” he said.Wes Bush, Northrop Grumman chief executive, attributed the results to his company’s focus on “performance, effective cash deployment, and portfolio alignment”.However, all US military contractors face the risk that the programme of across-the-board cuts– knows as “sequestration” – could cut nearly every part of the military budget by about 10 per cent in the new year.They also face the possibility that even if politicians agree an alternative to sequestration, there would still be severe spending cuts. Lockheed Martin said its sales would decline next year even without sequestration.Mr Stevens said the company had been very clear for a long period of time about its concerns over the possibility of sequestration.“It’s really not an effective way to reduce spending, particularly when it will not align with the strategy and commitments that our country has made,” he said.Lockheed Martin based its projections for next year on President Barack Obama’s defence plan for the second half of the 2013 fiscal year, and on the assumption that sequestration would be avoided. Under that assumption, the company said its net sales would fall next year in the “low single-digits”.Mr Bush said Northrop Grumman was working closely with its customers to bring innovative, affordable solutions to support their needs in “today’s fiscally constrained environment”.
73;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;US attitude to contractor mergers unclear;;The collapse of merger talks between EADS and the UK’s BAE Systems has left a significant question hanging not only unanswered but unasked: namely what would be the attitude of the US Department of Defense to mergers between its suppliers?Following the abandonment of EADS’s tie-up with BAE, the sixth-biggest US military contractor by annual revenues, US defence companies still do not know whether falling defence spending has made the Pentagon relax its opposition to further consolidation among its big suppliers.After the end of the cold war some US industrial companies – such as Chrysler, General Motors and Ford decided to spin out or sell off military subsidiaries as defence spending fell. The Pentagon then encouraged a wave of consolidation in the 1990s: Northrop and Grumman merged in 1994 to form Northrop Grumman, Lockheed and Martin Marietta merged in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin and Boeing in 1997 took over McDonnell Douglas.Some similar fragmentation has already taken place during this defence slowdown: Northrop Grumman spun out its shipbuilding operations in March last year, for example, while SAIC, a provider of sophisticated professional services to the military, decided in August to split itself in two. However, so far the Pentagon has said it is reluctant to see mergers of big suppliers – but stressed it would still treat each deal on a case-by-case basis.“The reality of those kinds of policy pronouncements is that they can always change,” says Pierre Chao, managing partner of Renaissance Strategic Advisors. “In some ways, they’re also administration personality-specific.”Behind much of the current confusion about the industry’s future shape lies uncertainty about the Department of Defense’s budget. Military programmes could face 9.4 per cent across-the-board cuts from January if legislators are unable to agree before then on an alternative programme to close the US budget deficit.Wes Bush, chief executive of Northrop Grumman, one of the top five suppliers, said last month that such cuts could prompt the Pentagon to reassess its opposition to mergers among its biggest suppliers.There has been speculation that, in such a scenario, Lockheed Martin, the military aircraft maker, and General Dynamics, the armoured vehicle maker, might team up to take over BAE together. However, people familiar with the thinking of the two companies – both of which are in the midst of leadership changes – pour cold water on the suggestions.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, says that while the Pentagon and other regulators encouraged the mergers that gave the industry its current shape, the mood now is very different.“The policy makers at the Pentagon now believe that there was too much concentration back then,” Mr Thompson says. “So they’re not going to permit major combinations.”That means, Mr Thompson and Mr Chao suggest, that corporate activity among military contractors in the foreseeable future is likely to consist mainly of groupings amid smaller operations. Following the collapse of the planned BAE-EADS merger, there is very little to prompt other big contractors into action, says Mr Thompson. “They’re waiting to see who wins the White House,” he says.
74;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-10-10T19:16:37Z;BAE left to take care of deal fallout;;"For BAE Systems and its management, the only development more dramatic than their proposed €36bn union with EADS may turn out to be the deal’s failure.Many analysts and industry executives believe BAE is not only out of good options but that its attempt to tie up with EADS has left it dangerously exposed and facing the wrath of its investors – and its most important customer, the US.Ian King and Dick Olver, respectively BAE’s chief executive and its chairman, have also been tarnished because of their inability to persuade even BAE’s most loyal shareholders of the wisdom of the deal. Many investors and analysts now believe both men’s jobs are on the line.For BAE, the future looks dimmer than it did before news of the proposed deal surfaced.“We think that BAE’s willingness to do such a deal now implies a lower degree of confidence in the company’s ability to achieve all of its large export opportunities in the reasonable timeframe expected by many investors,” says Sash Tusa at Echelon, the independent analyst.Mr Olver on Wednesday insisted there was no reason to change BAE’s management team, and investors are unlikely to want to further destabilise the company by pushing too quickly for a change of leadership.But investors have already called for a review of BAE’s strategy – a move Mr King says is not necessary.“What’s next is Plan A, that we deliver on our strategy that we articulated before,” Mr King told the Financial Times on Wednesday, disputing any need to change tack.Many analysts and investors believe BAE might now just have to ride out alone the storm of the economic downturn, the end of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the cuts in US and European defence spending.The most extreme change in strategy could involve the company being broken up into pieces; its important US arm, source of 43 per cent of its revenue, being spun off or sold; and the rest of the company – businesses in the UK, Australia and Saudi Arabia – left to limp along.The emergence of a new suitor for BAE from among the big US defence companies is another possibility some have noted, arguing that the deal’s collapse leaves BAE vulnerable.One senior UK official said BAE would remain “in play”, noting: “The risk for BAE is it has made clear that it does not have a long-term future without some kind of tie-up.”Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics are said to have already approached the Pentagon to see whether such a proposal would be acceptable. Few people who have closely followed the defence industry believe it would be. The US defence department’s long-held view has been that the number of its biggest suppliers has shrunk enough after the consolidation of the late 1990s that created Lockheed and Boeing, the country’s largest defence contractors.A person close to Lockheed on Wednesday said it would not be interested in bidding for BAE. “We’re looking at focusing on our customers and our cost-reduction issues,” he said.The US government’s opposition to further consolidation in the US defence market may have eased somewhat as spending cuts have prompted companies to begin lay-offs, but BAE’s size – it is the world’s second largest defence company after Lockheed and a top 10 supplier to the US government – remains an insurmountable hurdle, say analysts.“The Pentagon has warned against consolidation and we would not expect a potential bid from any other US competitors,” says Ed Salvesen, analyst at Brewin Dolphin Investment Management.The UK government is also unlikely to sanction such a deal because a US owner would not guarantee that some of BAE’s most sensitive UK projects – such as nuclear submarine building – would remain in the UK. Bankers say they have for years tried to make a transatlantic union work and BAE has looked at, and dismissed, a tie-up with Boeing and, more recently, with Northrop Grumman.Mr King says he does not expect another suitor and that none has so far approached him. But people close to the deal say EADS could spend the next three months – with the blessing of BAE – lobbying the German government and then have another go at BAE early next year, especially given that most of the non-political details of the deal have already been agreed.For now Mr King will have to articulate a convincing strategy to his customers – particularly the US and UK governments – and his investors.“They will be under enormous pressure to explain what Plan B is and they’ll be punished if they don’t,” says Guy Anderson of IHS Jane’s, the defence industry analysts.Many fellow industry executives and analysts sympathetically note that decisions made by Mike Turner, Mr King’s predecessor, meant that the BAE chief “found himself completely exposed to two defence markets [the US and UK] just before they went belly up,” as Mr Anderson puts it.They argue BAE does not need to throw in the towel at what may be the bottom of the defence cycle, nor that its future without a deal looks as grim as Mr Turner and others have argued.Even BAE’s closest competitors envy its broad international portfolio, its ability to generate cash and a loyal following of investors drawn to the steady dividend.For all the criticism of BAE that the EADS deal has unleashed, many investors, industry executives and analysts believe that, rather than a dramatic change in direction, the company needs a management that is better at articulating its strategy.Additional reporting by Robert Wright and Anousha Sakoui"

The US group, which had been gaining market share following product launches, said it did not know whether the slowdown was company-specific or sectorwide.Analysts noted that Biomet’s US sales growth had unexpectedly stalled. A resilient US market had been expected to compensate for budget cuts in Europe, which provides a third of S&N’s sales.S&N, which was trading ex-interim dividend, closed 2.6 per cent lower at 655p. “Sell” advice from Société Générale also weighed against the stock.With S&N finance officer Adrian Hennah due to leave at the end of the year, any decision on acquisitions or a share buyback was likely to be pushed back to 2014, SocGen said.The broker also dismissed persistent speculation that S&N could be a bid target.Competition hurdles ruled out Johnson & Johnson, as it would have to sell too much of S&N’s business, while Medtronic would not be able to extract enough cost savings, SocGen said. It also reckoned Biomet’s private equity owners could not afford S&N, and that shareholders would not back a bid in the opposite direction given S&N management’s poor acquisition record.The wider market drifted lower for a third straight day, with the FTSE 100 losing 0.6 per cent or 33.54 points at 5776.71.Aggreko slid 1.3 per cent to £22.11 after the second profit warning in as many quarters from US engine maker Cummins, one of its biggest suppliers. Cummins cited weak international power generation markets, as well as poor sales in China and disappointing North American heavy duty truck demand.The warning also hit engineers, with GKN down 0.5 per cent at 214.1p, Bodycote sliding 3.1 per cent to 372.9p and IMI down 2.5 per cent to 920p.Croda slipped 2.3 per cent to £22.21 after EMS-Chemie, the polymer maker, talked of a “clear downturn” in demand in all its markets.Cautious guidance from Alcoa weighed against the miners, with Vedanta Resources sliding 2.8 per cent to £10.60. Iron ore pellet maker Ferrexpo slid 4.7 per cent to 193.1p even after an in-line quarterly production report.Talvivaara lost 3.8 per cent to 151.2p, with Goldman Sachs cutting its target to 158p in a note that was critical of the nickel miner’s quality of assets.Banks outperformed on news that the Financial Services Authority had relaxed capital rules to boost UK lending. Lloyds Banking Group added 4 per cent to 38.5p and Royal Bank of Scotland was up 2.1 per cent to 262.7p.Man Group climbed 3.8 per cent to 93.4p, a five-month high, after press reports reheated takeover speculation.The bid theories helped distract from another weekly decline for Man’s key AHL fund and uncertainty about a trading update next week, which analysts say was likely to show a fifth consecutive quarter of net outflows. RBC forecast Man’s outflows to have accelerated to $2.5bn for the third quarter.Meanwhile, the traders who were pushing Man as a bid target on Tuesday had moved on to United Utilities. The water group rose 1.6 per cent to 729p on familiar speculation of interest from infrastructure investors and sovereign wealth funds.Imagination Technologies slid 9.4 per cent to 455.5p after Credit Suisse started coverage of the graphics chipmaker with an “underperform” rating and 247p valuation. It argued that the stock, at 21 times 2014 earnings, was not pricing in competitive threats.“We see Arm Holdings increasing its relevance as a competitor in this space with a full complement of graphics capabilities at half the price,” said Credit Suisse. “Of Imagination’s four key customers, Samsung this year moved to Arm graphics, Texas Instruments is exiting the wireless business and MediaTek could, in our view, try Arm graphics in its smartphone chips as it already uses its graphics in feature phones and TV.”Arm lost 2.9 per cent to 578.5p, with Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Cazenove saying the stock looked expensive.Domino’s Pizza lost 2.1 per cent to 519p after directors Stephen Hemsley and Nigel Wray raised £5.2m each by selling stock.
76;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-10-02T14:15:14Z;EADS seeks north America scale;;Some time in 2016, at a former US airforce supply centre on the edge of Mobile, Alabama, the first of many A320 aircraft will emerge from a new production facility being constructed by Airbus, the commercial aerospace arm of EADS.The start of production at the facility will mark the culmination of the latest of several attempts by the European company to establish a large-scale, long-term industrial presence in the US.The plant had originally been planned as the manufacturing plant for airborne tankers to be built under Airbus’s joint bid with the US’s Northrop Grumman to build tankers for the US Air Force – a contract that the pair lost in 2008 after protests from Boeing, their rival.“It was part of the strategy of Airbus always to have an industrial presence in the US at some point,” says Allan McArtor, chairman of Airbus Americas.The heart of EADS’s current US defence operations – which operate, such as BAE Systems’ north American operations, under a Special Security Agreement with the Pentagon – are helicopter manufacturing plants in Mississippi and Texas.The US Army, the largest single customer, operates the company’s UH-72A helicopter as a light utility helicopter, ferrying soldiers and equipment around war zones. US customs, border security and other government agencies operate other versions of the helicopter.The Mobile site, as well as housing an Airbus design centre, also offers servicing for C212 and CN235 fixed-wing turboprop transport aircraft used by the US Coast Guard, other wings of the US government and commercial operators.Until the Mobile factory’s completion, however, EADS is destined to remain a far more modest presence in the US than BAE Systems, with which it is seeking to merge. Only $1.2bn of the group’s €49.1bn 2011 revenue came from its operations in north America.
77;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-09-19T17:32:45Z;Warning on fallout from US defence cuts;;Military contractors could force the cost of US defence equipment to rise sharply if a law cutting spending from January took force, the chairman of the US aerospace industry’s main trade group has warned, amid a campaign to avert the cuts.David Hess, chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association, also told the Financial Times that the US defence department would struggle to administer the sudden cuts to hundreds of complex programmes.Mr Hess, president of Pratt & Whitney, the aero engine maker owned by United Technologies, pointed out that many companies’ contracts with the US Department of Defence entitled them to recover certain overall costs for programmes, whatever their size. The cost for each aircraft or other item would consequently rise as the number of items purchased fell.“To the extent that they make these cuts and either reduce, stretch out or terminate programmes, there are programme termination costs that need to be considered,” said Mr Hess. “Because volumes are going down, the price per unit goes up. None of that has been considered.”The Pentagon would struggle to manage the sheer volume of work involved, he added. “I don’t know administratively how they could possibly administer sequestration or how the supply business would respond.”The threat of the cuts stems from the deal that ended last year’s crisis over the extension of the US’s national debt ceiling. The deal mandated $100bn in annual spending cuts for a series of government budget items if no other deficit-reduction agreement was reached by December 31 this year.Companies that depend heavily on US military procurement could suffer particularly severely. RBC Capital Markets in June said the full programme of cuts would cut earnings per share for 2013 at Northrop Grumman, the maker of military aircraft and electronic warfare systems, and L-3, a maker of command and control systems, by 15 per cent. EPS for Lockheed Martin, the military aircraft manufacturer, would fall 12 per cent.Lockheed Martin has announced plans to send out lay-off notices to all potentially affected workers two months before the budget cuts would come into force on November 2, immediately before the presidential election.Many analysts believe impending falls in US defence spending have also played a role in encouraging the merger talks between the UK’s BAE Systems and Europe’s EADS.
78;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;US defence groups reassess strategies;;US defence groups are scrambling to evaluate their strategic options after the news of the proposed €38bn merger between EADS and BAE Systems.While they have not ruled out the possibility of trying to scuttle the biggest ever aerospace deal by bidding for BAE themselves, large US military suppliers including Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Boeing are unlikely to make a move, according to people familiar with the matter.Defence companies are facing a difficult outlook because of political uncertainty and the squeeze on budgets in the US and are reluctant to take on the additional challenge of a large international takeover, these people say.However, a takeover of BAE by EADS could accelerate the consolidation of the US defence industry in other ways, by encouraging companies to look for acquisitions both at home and in Europe.For the moment the US defence industry is preoccupied with the threat of sequestration: the deep cuts in government spending that will take effect on January 1, if Congress fails to agree on reducing the budget deficit, under a deal reached last year. The administration’s Office of Management and Budget reported on Friday that sequestration would cut 9.4 per cent from most military programmes.Yair Reiner, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said the lack of clarity about the outlook would make it difficult to do deals.“If a chief executive of a defence company were to go with a takeover idea to the board, the response would be ‘don’t we have our hands full with much more immediate issues? We should be focused on saving the business we have, not acquiring a new one’.”The presidential election in November is another source of uncertainty. President Barack Obama has pledged to reduce military spending if he is re-elected for a second term, while Republican challenger Mitt Romney has said he would increase the Pentagon’s budget.Once those immediate issues are resolved, though, the expected long-term squeeze on the US defence budget could justify further rationalisation: certainly acquisitions of smaller companies by the leading contractors, and possibly even mergers among the big five.After a wave of mergers in the 1990s, the US government signalled that it would frown on any attempted deals between the five large “tier one” defence contractors: Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, General Dynamics and Raytheon. While consolidation can help cut costs, the Pentagon has said it does not want competition between suppliers to be eroded further.Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed, has suggested that the government’s veto of deals between the large suppliers might not last forever, and at a conference on Friday he suggested that a BAE-EADS deal would be a test of the Pentagon’s view.“I think they would both be perceived as large systems providers in the Department of Defence’s point of view, and it might be an early test of whether the unfavorability of consolidation of that tier would in fact be changing,” he said.“Right now, by policy, I don’t see the prospects for any consolidation opportunities at the top tier, but if the future were to suggest demand were declining, I’d certainly think that would be revisited.”Key metrics behind the attempted combination and a brief history of European defence consolidationOther industry executives question whether EADS, which was the 83rd largest contractor to the Pentagon last year according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, can really be seen as a tier-one supplier.Nevertheless, US groups might try to use the deal as leverage to push through acquisitions of their own that might previously have been rejected on antitrust grounds, arguing that they will need to scale up to compete with an enlarged EADS.A merged BAE-EADS, a European champion in the defence industry, could be a more effective competitor in the US and international markets, with greater financial strength, a wider range of technologies, and broader contacts with politicians and officials. EADS’s plan to build an Airbus factory in Alabama will also increase its political clout.Smaller defence companies are also set to take advantage of the proposed deal, with a slew of potential targets poised to put themselves up for sale as larger groups seek to expand through acquisitions.US groups might also turn their attention to other European defence assets, with potential targets including Finmeccanica, the Italian aerospace group, Meggitt, the UK defence group, and Safran, the French aerospace group, according to people familiar with the proposed BAE-EADS deal.Not every defence company is likely to be a buyer. Boeing probably has more attractive places to deploy capital in its thriving civil aircraft business, analysts say.Lockheed, which earns 82 per cent of its revenues from the US government, is already so closely tied to the Pentagon that it has no effective alternative to making its defence business work.A BAE-EADS agreement could also throw up opportunities for other deals. With US government approval needed for the takeover to go through, US rivals to EADS and BAE are considering what conditions they could ask regulators to impose.Concessions could include the need for BAE to dispose of particularly sensitive units that are vital to US national security, which could provide US groups with the opportunity to snatch prized assets.If it is concerned enough about the French and German governments’ stakes in EADS, the US could even encourage an American company to step in with a bid for BAE.Guy Ben-Ari, deputy director of the defence industries group at the CSIS, argues that such a move is unlikely, and that the US government will probably be satisfied with remedies short of that, including a restructuring of BAE’s US business to strengthen the “firewall” around its sensitive military technology.However, he adds, given the extent of political influence over the defence industry, such an intervention in the proposed deal would not be impossible.“When the Pentagon deems it necessary for the industry to change, it can influence private contractors to nudge the industry to move in its desired direction,” he said.
79;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-09-16T18:23:08Z;BAE/EADS – weak leap forward;BAE is making its great leap forward from a weak position;"Between 2008 and today, BAE Systems has made no acquisition bigger than about £500m. It has made no significant disposal in the past 12 years apart from the 2006 sale of its stake in Airbus. For a company whose goal is to be “the premier global defence, aerospace and security company”, that is a timid record. It makes last week’s €38bn merger proposal with EADS all the more problematic. The move would reverse its exit from Airbus, add little in the way of additional defence revenues, and do nothing to address its strategic US dilemma.BAE is making its great leap forward from a weak position. It is fifth in PwC’s ranking of aerospace and defence contractors by revenue globally for 2011. But it posted the steepest annual sales drop among the top 10 – of 13 per cent – compared to a rise of 7 per cent for Boeing and 13 per cent for EADS. Its operating cash flow has shrunk by more than half to under £1bn in the past five years; at Northrop Grumman the number is broadly unchanged at over $2bn. And its US sales of big bits of military kit fell by a third between 2009 and 2011.BAE’s big bet on the US with its purchases of United Defence (Bradley tanks) in 2005 and Armor Holdings (bulletproof vests and armour for Humvees) in 2007 (for a combined $9bn) lifted sales there to nearly half the group’s annual total. Yet the push into the market looks half-finished. BAE’s basic underlying earnings per share have risen by nearly half in the past five years. But its shares trade on a multiple of under 9 times forward earnings, compared to 15 for Boeing. Its multiple is more in line with pure-play defence contractors like Northrop, suggesting that adding commercial aerospace would help it close the valuation gap.But such a move does not address its growing US weakness. BAE says the US is its big success story. That claim looks half justified. Merging with EADS will not strengthen it.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
80;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Bernard Jenkin voices BAE-EADS concerns of Tory right;;Bernard Jenkin, a former defence spokesman for the Conservative party, has become the most senior figure in Westminster to voice concerns about the impact of the BAE-EADS merger on relations between Britain and the US.Mr Jenkin, a respected figure on the right of the party, said he did not want the Americans to “call the shots” over the British defence industry but they ought to be its “partner of choice”.“My instincts are that this will create significant difficulties if we want to have bilateral defence programmes with the Americans in future,” he told the FT. “When we operate with them we get by far the best support.”Mr Jenkin and other Tory MPs believe that a counter-offer is likely to emerge from a major US defence company such as Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman.Amid a growing mood of unease about the deal on the Tory back benches, Philip Hammond, defence secretary, said the government would only approve the deal if it was in the UK’s national interest.“We will want to be reassured not just about the security implications but about the implications for the future allocation of work to the UK,” he said. Mr Hammond said he was realistic, however, that BAE Systems faced major challenges as a standalone company.Mr Jenkin said the paramount concern was Britain’s “onshore capability”, the ability to get hold of essential equipment and spare parts at short notice.The deal would have to be closely watched to ensure that Britain retained control over BAE’s technology in key areas, he said. “We have an enormous amount of intellectual property in the defence sphere, global leadership, and we need to retain that,” he said.Ben Wallace, another Tory MP, called for caution over the deal, warning that EADS was making a “grab” for BAE’s US business but could make deep cuts to its UK workforce.It was essential to clarify whether Britain’s “very important defence relationship with the US” was threatened or strengthened by the merger, said Mr Wallce.“When they start identifying overlaps, what I don’t want to see is the French sweeping in and saying we will just get rid of the British workforce – such as my constituents – because it is easier to do.”Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former defence secretary, struck a more supportive note by saying that Britain would retain considerable sway in the merged company – whereas a US takeover of BAE could see it absorbed without trace.“I would be very supportive of a US-UK relationship, that is our natural partner, but in this area I would be concerned because of the disparate size of the two parties,” he told the FT. “EADS is bigger than BAE but not that much bigger.”Sir Malcolm also pointed out that France and the UK had strong shared interests in the defence arena despite the “occasional rhetoric”.The Unite union has criticised a lack of consultation and is pressing for a full study of the social and economic implications of the deal.

82;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-09-13T22:04:41Z;BAE warns on political influence in EADS;;BAE Systems has insisted it will walk away from talks with EADS unless the combined European champion in aerospace and defence was allowed to operate as a normal company without political interference.BAE is also insisting that the combined entity’s defence business would have to be based in the UK if the plan, news of which was leaked on Wednesday before the structure was finalised, is to go ahead.The management of EADS has indicated it would be willing to de-politicise the company, but it remains far from certain that Paris, in particular, and Berlin would agree to give up their strategic stakes.The uncertainty over the fate of the deal as well as the lack of clarity on possible cost-savings and strategy prompted deep investor scepticism. Shares in EADS fell 10.2 per cent to €25.2 and BAE dropped 7.3 per cent to 337.1p.In hastily arranged conference calls, several major BAE investors expressed concerns over the tie-up. They warned that they would become sellers if BAE was unable to shed more light on its long-term dividend policy and the degree of French and German influence over the merged entity.People close to BAE said the company would give up on the deal if it did not create a commercial company, with a balanced board, free of political influence. The UK-based company’s talks with EADS which started in March came after BAE considered a combination with Northrop Grumman of the US or a tie-up with engine maker Rolls-Royce. Neither however was as attractive as a deal with EADS, which would give BAE a strong balance sheet and a diversified portfolio in defence and civil aerospace, one person close to BAE said.BAE and many analysts see the French government as the biggest potential obstacle in the way of the deal. However, both companies, believe Francois Hollande, the socialist president, could be more amenable to a deal than his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, a close ally of Dassault, BAE’s and EADS’s fiercest French competitor.Tom Enders, who became chief executive of EADS in May, wants to use the deal to reduce the level of political influence of the French and German governments, whose involvement has lost EADS contracts and dictated key executive appointments, said people close to the company.The French and German governments each effectively control 22.5 per cent of EADS, but Mr Enders wants their shareholdings in the combined entity to fall below 10 per cent.EADS is proposing that the French, German and UK governments would each have a golden share, allowing them to block hostile takeovers but no additional veto rights.Additional reporting by James Boxell and Gerrit Wiesmann
83;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-09-13T16:21:27Z;Doubts grow over EADS and BAE tie-up;;Governments and shareholders have reacted with caution and scepticism to a plan by EADS and BAE Systems to create a $48bn European defence and aerospace group to rival Lockheed Martin and Boeing of the US.EADS shares closed down 10.2 per cent at €25.15 in Paris on Thursday while shares in BAE, which had risen sharply following confirmation of the talks, fell 7.3 per cent to 337.1p in London.One top 20 BAE shareholder said: “In theory, this tie-up makes sense as it will give Europe a company that can take on the might of Boeing. But big job losses could cause political problems and uncertainty that could hit share performance and the long-term worth of holding the company’s stock.”EADS suffered a bruising defeat to Boeing last year when it lost out on an order to build 179 refuelling aircraft for the US Air Force. BAE has made the US its main focus since it sold its share in EADS’s Airbus aircraft business in 2006.Under UK takeover rules, the groups have until October 10 to seal the deal or walk away. The German and French governments each control through direct and indirect holdings a 22.5 per cent stake in EADS. The UK holds a “golden share” in BAE.Media company Lagardère, a French shareholder that holds the EADS chairmanship, suggested it was not yet convinced of the terms of the deal, even though shares in Lagardère jumped 5.7 per cent.“The Lagardère group intends to ensure that all consequences associated with the proposed EADS-BAE Systems merger are taken into consideration in determining the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction before it consents to the deal,” it said, noting the proposal had not yet been submitted to board members for their approval.In Germany, the deal was welcomed by one of EADS’s key shareholders that has long wanted to withdraw from the group. Daimler, which controls 22.5 per cent of EADS, said: “Since the planned transaction would also be linked to a possible dissolution of the [French and German] shareholder pact, all options would be open to us in principle – including the possibility of selling our stake on the open market.”In the face of a deal that would, if completed, mark the culmination of at least 15 years of efforts to fashion a European defence champion, other shareholders, subsidiaries and unions at the groups moved swiftly to declare that they would protect their interests.The German government wants to reduce direct or indirect state involvement in EADS, but the proposed merger has set off alarm bells about the potential relocation of manufacturing and jobs, especially to the UK or France.“[German] government approval is by no means a done deal,” one official told the Financial Times. “There is a huge bundle of questions which we still have to answer – or want answers for.”One person briefed on talks between EADS, BAE and the European governments involved said Berlin was betraying “an almost irrational fear” that any merger could see France assert its dominance in the civil aircraft business and the UK its dominance in the arms business.Fabrice Brégier, chief executive of Airbus, the aircraft subsidiary that accounts for two-thirds of EADS revenues, told staff in an internal memo on Thursday that the proposed deal “is not expected to affect Airbus and its employees in daily operations”. Mr Brégier is expected to remain as head of Airbus under the deal.In the UK, the government said it saw the commercial sense of the deal, but Unite, the country’s biggest trade union, has called for an urgent meeting with ministers, fearing job losses and noting a combined EADS-BAE would become Britain’s biggest manufacturer.Nick Cunningham, analyst at Agency Partners, said that while BAE may struggle to secure approval from the US government, the company could find it even harder to get the backing of its shareholders. “This could be the toughest sell of all,” he added.He raised the possibility that a US defence company, such as Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman, could counter bid for BAE.Jeremy Bragg, analyst at Citi, said it could be hard for EADS to extract significant synergies from a deal with BAE, as some operations would need to be ringfenced for the deal to secure regulatory approval.The proposed tie-up – which would probably see Tom Enders, EADS chief executive, take the helm – would create a company with sales of €72bn, employing 220,000 people worldwide. It would give EADS access to BAE’s defence portfolio and significant presence in the US market, allowing it for the first time to take on Boeing.BAE hopes a tie-up with EADS would allow it to go on an acquisition drive in growing segments of the defence and security industry, such as communications and cyber technology.Reporting by Carola Hoyos, Andrew Parker, David Oakley, Anousha Sakoui and Tom Burgis in London, James Boxell in Paris and Gerrit Wiesmann in Berlin
84;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-09-03T10:26:34Z;US military contractors – war horses;A tough battle that will not be won by financial engineers;The past decade or so has been a good time to be a contractor working for the US military or intelligence agencies. Between 2000 and 2010 the military budget grew 9 per cent a year, to about $690bn, faster than the budget as a whole or any of the big budget items besides Medicare. The Department of Homeland Security had a fiscal 2010 budget of $55bn, $15bn more than five years before.More recent years have been tougher. In 2010 both the secretary of defence and the CIA director went on record in the Washington Post voicing serious concerns about how many key jobs were being filled by contract employees. But the debate is not just over who should fight wars or collect intelligence. It is about how many soldiers and spies the country can afford. Hence the 2011 Budget Control Act and its threat of sequestration. If Congress is unable to agree to cut the federal budget by $1.2tn over 10 years, automatic cuts kick in next year with the axe falling heaviest on the military.Shares in the largest contractors that make the fanciest weapons systems – Raytheon, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin – have held up over the past few years. Smaller contractors that specialise in providing personnel and technical support have had a tougher time. L-3, SAIC, ManTech and CACI International have all lagged behind the wider market badly. SAIC announced last week that, in an effort to create shareholder value, it would separate its low-margin IT and services arm from its higher-margin technology solutions business. This follows two other separations of lower-value divisions by Northrop Grumman (it spun off Huntington Ingalls) and L-3 (Engility). Neither of the earlier moves has generated much in the way of outsize returns, as a recent Credit Suisse analysis shows. This industry faces a tough battle, one that will not be won by financial engineers.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
85;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-08-28T17:46:20Z;US fiscal cliff – heading for a showdown;Dividend-paying stocks will not be immune if dire predictions are borne out;An old Wall Street adage says the market climbs a “wall of worry”. This year it is a cliff. Unless the factions in Congress can come to an agreement on alternatives for tackling the deficit, a series of tax hikes and spending cuts kicks in automatically at the beginning of 2013 – the “fiscal cliff”. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the US trips over the edge, the deficit will drop to $640bn from $1.1tn, and the US will plunge into recession, with output shrinking 0.5 per cent in 2013.If these dire predictions are correct, interest rates presumably would fall, benefiting holders of US Treasuries. It does not bode well for stocks, however. Included in the spending cuts are $500bn from the Defense Department’s 10-year plans on top of previously mandated cuts of $490bn during nearly the same period. A Barclays index of defence companies, including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, shows an average trailing price to earnings multiple of about nine times. That looks cheap versus the last decade when these stocks traded upwards of 25 times amid two US wars. But it is in line with the post-recession multiple in the early 1990s when the industry also faced cuts.With rates falling, dividend-paying stocks have been a popular source of income. The dividend aristocrats index has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 3 percentage points on an annualised basis in the past three years. Looming tax increases affect these payouts. A special tax rate of 15 per cent on dividends, implemented by the Bush administration and extended after the financial crisis, is set to expire. That means dividends will again be taxed at ordinary income rates of as much as 39.6 per cent. The taxes to pay for Obamacare could push the rate north of 40 per cent.Most prognosticators are wagering (and wishing) that compromise is possible. But the divisive political climate means it will not happen without a frightening showdown. Uncertainty – another Wall Street favourite.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

The Alpine state is due to submit details to its parliament for scrutiny this autumn. Once political agreement has been reached, a final contract with Saab can be signed.Saab declined to comment.Saab’s shares edged down 0.9 per cent to SEK110.50.

Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
88;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;BAE Systems – death by a thousand cuts;Reduced US defence spending means tougher times ahead;"Most industries faced with a potential $500bn of spending cuts over the next decade would pack up and go home. Defence is not just any old industry, however: the big defence contractors deal only in the big numbers and they have feasted at the Pentagon’s trough for more than a decade. That party is over.The US defence budget has already been shaved by $487bn over the next 10 years. The question is whether a further $500bn could be forthcoming (Washington will decide next year). Half-year figures from BAE Systems on Thursday give a glimpse of what life is like in tougher times.BAE’s numbers were not, in fact, half bad. Sales were down 10 per cent at £8.3bn, but basic earnings per share were unchanged year-on-year and the group operating margin was steady at 11 per cent. The figures chime with results from General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman last week: the industry’s margin is generally 11-12 per cent, though it varies widely depending on what is being produced. For example, BAE’s UK platforms and services division saw its operating margin jump by half in the first six months of this year, to nearly 16 per cent.That is good: margins will be important as contractors look to cut costs and increase productivity. The additional $500bn of cuts to the US defence budget (10 per cent of total US defence spending) are likely to fall primarily on hardware rather than personnel or the institutional structure of the US military. The US accounts for 40 per cent of BAE’s business; its US revenues could face a 10 per cent hit. The US defence contractors could be hit even more.Thank goodness for order backlogs. BAE’s is $60bn, compared with $40bn at Northrop and General Dynamics. And for other markets. As BAE’s haggling with Saudi Arabia over the re-pricing of its Typhoon aircraft contract shows, though, nothing in defence is quite what it seems.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
89;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-07-25T19:05:37Z;Defence earnings fall as US cuts loom;;Three of the biggest US defence contractors have reported falling earnings and warned of more trouble ahead as a looming automatic $500bn defence budget cut early next year clouds their outlook.Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and the defence division of Boeing were all hit in the second quarter of this year. Like much of the industry, they are making deep cost and staff cuts.The outlook is decidedly mixed, with General Dynamics cutting its full-year earnings per share estimates, while Northrop Grumman took a bullish approach, noting a “robust level of new business capture, the increase in total backlog and strong cash generation” as it increased its full-year forecast.There is growing frustration in the US defence establishment over US lawmakers’ inability to hatch a new government budget, which means the threat of the $500bn automatic defence cut edges ever closer.Unless lawmakers come up with a budget or agree to postpone the fall of the axe – which comes on top of approximately $490bn cuts already made – the additional reduction will take effect on January 2.Worse, say executives, is the fact that the cut would be indiscriminate, meaning they have no guidance on which projects to curtail and which would remain important to the evolving US defence strategy.Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, the largest US defence contractor, which announced robust earnings earlier this week, said the company was adapting to the difficult climate by cutting costs, consolidating work, reducing its workforce and lobbying lawmakers.“We’ve petitioned Congress and the administration to find an alternative method …to reduce costs and lower the debt, but if sequestration [automatic spending reduction] is going to occur, then we need more detailed information as to how to properly plan and execute our responsibilities,” he said.Northrop Grumman’s profit fell to $480m in the second quarter, down $40m from a year earlier. Revenue dropped to $6.27bn from $6.56bn. But the company managed to boost earnings per share to $1.88 from $1.81 by reducing outstanding shares.General Dynamics’ second-quarter net profit fell to $634m from $653m a year before, while sales edged up to $7.92bn from $7.88bn. Earnings per share were $1.79, compared to $1.77.Boeing was helped by the fact that more than half its revenue comes from civil aerospace, where the market is far more favourable as high oil prices prompt airlines to order new, more fuel-efficient aircraft.Revenues at Boeing’s defence, space and security division were $8.2bn, up 7 per cent, though earnings from operations slipped 6 per cent to $748m.James McNerney, chief executive of Boeing, the second-largest US defence contractor by sales, said: “While the threat of budget sequestration and future US defence cuts continue to create uncertainty, international markets continue to offer a broad set of sales opportunities.”
90;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-06-17T13:41:27Z;Boom time over for military service groups;;The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have been a boon to US contractors. The US has used so many of them in the conflicts that at times they outnumbered the military they supported. But the boom times are coming to an end and military service companies in particular are being squeezed.Moody’s, the rating agency, expects revenue and margin pressure on defence service companies to become visible soon as the US Department of Defence, the world’s biggest military spender, negotiates tougher terms for contractors, reduces spending on them and brings its troops home from Afghanistan in time to meet the end 2014 deadline set by President Barack Obama.In Iraq and Afghanistan the top contractor was Kellog, Brown & Root, the engineering and construction services company. It earned $40.8bn during the past decade, while Agility, the logistics company, and DynCorp, which specialises in security, earned $9bn and $7.4bn respectively, according to a US government report.For the next few quarters companies may still be able to paint a rosy picture as they continue to benefit from legacy contracts signed under more favourable conditions.But analysts warn that things have already turned for the worse. For example, the operational and maintenance portion of the Department of Defence’s 2013 budget is down 4 per cent from the past fiscal year and service companies are being pushed to accept fixed-price contracts, which force them to pay for any cost overruns.Moody’s expects service contractors to report annual revenue declines of 2-3 per cent in 2013, with steeper drops expected after US troops leave Afghanistan.If annual defence outlays decline by 5 per cent or more – a real possibility – the credit worthiness of many defence service companies “could meaningfully diminish and many could be at risk of a downgrade,” Moody’s said in a recent report.“This mounting pressure on margins will be credit negative for service contractors as it constricts cash flow and their ability to service debt – a particular concern for companies that have taken on additional debt during the last few years,” it added, noting the most exposed companies included ManTech International, and DynCorp, while highly leveraged companies less resilient to declining margins include Alion Science and Technology, TASC, The SI Organization and SRA International.European companies are expected to be less effected by the end of the war, given their lower exposure to the kinds of work US companies are doing in Afghanistan.Babcock, Capita, Serco and Qinetiq are exposed to defence services, but they are in fact benefiting from austerity as the UK’s ministry of defence engages them to cut costs by outsourcing jobs such as equipment support.Roger Johnston, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said the UK government used service companies differently to the Pentagon. European service companies felt far less of the benefit of the wars as European militaries outsourced less. In fact, outsourcing by the British armed forces is just now gathering momentum as the army’s numbers are slashed and the MoD says it will rely more on contractors for logistics and other tasks.“With a desire in the UK to reduce the cost at the centre there are actually increasing opportunities for trusted companies to approach government with proposals to take cost out by doing things a different way,” Mr Johnston says.Many large prime contractors also have big services programmes. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, and the UK’s BAE Systems, best known for fighter jets, frigates and armoured vehicles, have increased their service portfolios over the past years. Thales of France and Italy’s Finmeccanica are also players.Though many of these companies are caught in the eurozone crisis and the resulting deep cuts in European military spending, they benefit from being more diversified by region and segment than the purer service companies, analysts said. Even within the services sub-sector they span a wider set of markets that include cyber security, intelligence and other areas expected to continue to grow in importance for their governmental customers.The situation is not all doom and gloom for defence service companies. Governments are increasingly looking for service providers that can help them lower their costs and help integrate their many systems.SRA, for instance, says it is benefiting from the increased need for cost savings across the government. “We continue to see new opportunities driven by the need for federal cost savings that can be gleaned through organisational change management, and driving efficiencies in IT infrastructure and program execution,” it says.Yet after a decade of unrivalled prosperity thanks to war and a booming global economy the defence service sector will have to work harder through innovation, as well as lean and well-focused management, to prosper.
91;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-05-30T18:12:14Z;Canada looks to patrol Arctic with drone;;Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor, is developing an ultra-modern unmanned spy aircraft to allow Canada to defend its vast Arctic territory against incursions from other countries with claims to the region, which is believed to hold the world’s last giant undiscovered oil and gas reserves.Canada’s interest in the aircraft raises the stakes in the contest over the Arctic, where countries are using their military presence to assert their sovereignty over the resource-rich and strategically valuable terrain.Northrop Grumman, the US’s second largest defence contractor by military sales, has joined L-3 MAS, which supplies Canada’s government with aircraft support services, to build the aircraft that will allow Canada for the first time to fully survey its Arctic territory.At present Canada has very limited ability to assert its sovereignty over a region fiercely contested by several countries.It sends its Aurora CP 140, a manned maritime surveillance aircraft introduced in 1980, to the Arctic a few times a year and otherwise relies on a Polar satellite that takes a very narrow picture of the territory – and thus needs three weeks to collect information on the entire area.So far Denmark, Norway, Canada, Russia and the US, all of which lay claim to parts of the Arctic, have taken a relatively diplomatic approach, though there has been some notable flexing of military muscles. Canada felt severely threatened in 2007 when Russia sent a submarine to plant its flag 4km beneath the ice at the North Pole. At the time Stephen Harper, prime minister, responded by announcing that the Nanisivik mine, on the northern tip of the Baffin Island, would house a deepwater docking facility, adding to Canada’s military presence in the region. He added that Canada knew it had to “use or lose” the Arctic.The Polar Hawk, a derivative of the Northrop Grumman’s Global Hawk, produced in the US, is able to take a picture of the entire North West passage four times in the course of one mission. The aircraft, which is robotically operated, with human oversight, can fly at 60,000ft and stay aloft for missions that usually range between 24 hours and 35 hours. The US operates a similar aircraft over its own Arctic territory.The cost of such aircraft varies, but the US aircraft cost from $30m-$50m, with through life costs adding significantly to the price. Canada would need three such aircraft to maintain 24-hour surveillance.As the ice caps melt, opening up more travel, trade and industry in the region, the aircraft would allow Canada to better assert its sovereignty by ensuring it knows what occurs on its terrain, from passing ships to contestable mining projects, industry analysts said.Duke Dufresne, vice-president and general manager for Northrop Grumman’s unmanned systems business, said the deal for the Polar Hawk Aircraft was part of Canada’s First Defence Strategy. He said Polar Hawk would allow Canada to “extend its reach to patrol large geographical areas, keeping constant vigil over the nation’s vast Arctic region from coast to coast in a single mission”.Canada has a policy to acquire drones, both for combat and surveillance. But even drones that do not carry weapons are controversial because of procurement costs and global concerns over the use of the aircraft to infringe on other countries’ sovereignty. Canada had considered buying patrol vessels to fly the flag in the Arctic but they may now no longer be needed, said Denis Stairs, senior research fellow at the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute, the think tank.Canada’s department of national defence was not immediately available for comment.
92;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-05-21T17:00:38Z;Northrop signs $1.7bn Nato drone deal;;Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor, at the weekend signed a long-coveted $1.7bn deal to supply Nato with its first unmanned surveillance aircraft.Individual member countries have operated UAVs – also known as drones – during Nato operations but this is the first procurement of an unmanned aircraft by the alliance itself. Unmanned aircraft – even when not carrying weapons – are controversial because countries view them as spy planes that secretly invade sovereign airspace.The contract between Nato and Northrop Grumman, as prime contractor, includes the purchase, initial operation and maintenance of five Block 40 Global Hawk aircraft equipped with advanced ground surveillance radar sensors. The ground surveillance system is to become an important real-time data source for the military alliance’s intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations.Under the Northrop contract, European companies – including Cassidian, a subsidiary of pan-European EADS, Norway’s Kongsberg and Italian Selex Galileo, a Finmeccanica company – will develop mobile and remote ground stations providing real-time data, intelligence and target identification to commanders.The contract was signed at Nato’s summit in Chicago after years of debate and significant scaling back because of budgetary pressures plaguing almost all the alliance’s members. Some politicians had hoped to push the number of aircraft to as few as three, but commanders warned this would be too few to provide constant surveillance.The system will be fully operational in 2017.The radar system is the most modern available, being able to track small, moving objects across large swaths of territory and present them with greater clarity than past systems. Europe lags significantly behind the US in developing this so-called active electronically scanned array radar.One recent sign of how much governments covet the technology was India’s decision to choose its new fleet of jet fighters in large part because of its radar, according to military analysts. For political reasons India was unwilling to go with a US contractor, but chose France’s Rafale over the pan-European Typhoon because Dassault, maker of the Rafale, was more advanced in integrating the radar into its jet than Eurofighter was.The Nato contract for the radar and the Global Hawks is a significant order for Northrop Grumman, which last year had turnover of $26.4bn and operating income of $3.3bn and is trying to market its UAVs to governments in the Middle East and Asia Pacific.Wes Bush, Northrop Grumman’s chief executive, said: “It was our collective goal from the start to ensure an affordable and robust capability that will meet the alliance’s need for persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance to ground, maritime and air commanders, anytime and anywhere in the world.”Thirteen nations, including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and the US, are expected to participate in the system’s acquisition, with the US footing the majority of the bill. All 28 Nato members are to participate in the long-term support of the programme.The US Air Force has already ordered several Global Hawks, allowing Nato in this contract to piggy back off the research and development costs paid by the US department of defence to develop the aircraft.
93;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Defence groups move to cybersecurity;;The end of a decade of war and prosperity is proving transformative for the weapons trade as cash-strapped governments are cutting military budgets while defence contractors are shedding jobs and warning of shrinking revenues.So it is with fortuitous timing – at least for defence companies – that a new enemy is emerging on the world’s stage.Cyber attacks by well-resourced, highly capable and relentless, usually state-sponsored attackers – so called advanced persistent threats – are growing.The best known example is Stuxnet, which was aimed at Iran’s nuclear centrifuges and is widely believed to have been developed by the US or Israel, neither of which have confirmed their involvement.But dozens of similarly specifically targeted attacks have infiltrated the systems of a growing number of government agencies and companies, including defence contractors Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and L-3 Communications, and natural resource companies, such as BHP Billiton.The F-35 jet fighter programme was infiltrated in 2009. Defence contractors, including BAE Systems, say they are targets of constant attacks and, in fact, use that as a marketing point when selling their cyberdefence services.Collecting precise data on such attacks is difficult because governments and companies are reticent to admit they have been compromised.Financial regulators have yet to force companies to disclose their vulnerabilities despite their huge potential financial and reputational harm.“Never before has there been such a time in IT where there was such pressure to adopt new technology practices whilst trying to deal with such a significantly sized security issue,” James Lyne, director of technology strategy at Sophos, the UK’s largest cyber security company, said in a recent speech.China is seen as the major sponsor of high-level cybercrime involving the theft of sensitive commercial and government information. Last week a US Congressional report by Northrop Grumman, the defence contractor, noted China’s cyber prowess also posed a military threat.Jamie Shea, Nato’s deputy assistant secretary-general for emerging security challenges, said: “Clearly in the future all conflicts are going to involve people trying to disrupt the information technology systems, which are not only necessary for communication, but also for the operation of highly sophisticated weapons systems, most of which these days are computer driven.”To address that new frontier, Nato last week signed one of the most ambitious cyberdefence contracts ever to secure its network across 50 sites and 28 member countries.Robert Lentz, former deputy US assistant secretary of defense for cyber, identity and information assurance, says defence companies’ access to sensitive contracts such as that of Nato – won by Finmeccanica and Northrop Grumman – gives them a vaunted position in a market that is growing in the public and private sector.“Defence ministries are the pacesetters to implement the visions and showcase capabilities that work,” he says. “Often times they can become the trusted adviser of the entire public sector and then at the same time the public sector and the critical infrastructure sectors are communicating and collaborating more than they ever have.”By now almost all the major defence contractors have a cyber element.Much of the mergers and acquisitions activity over recent years has involved defence companies buying knowhow or the access to new markets. Jane’s Defence calculates that about 14 per cent of defence acquisitions had cyber as their target last year.In Europe, BAE Systems, Ultra Electronics and Qinetiq have the highest cyber exposure but for most of the group the per cent of revenue they get from cyber remains solidly in the low single-digits.As their understanding of the market matures, defence companies are beginning to specialise their offering and spread out from their traditional defence customers to other government departments and industry.Nevertheless, cyber is not the cure for all the defence companies’ traditional ills.Even Lawrence Prior, executive vice-president at BAE, cautions against breathless excitement.“There is so much hyperbole around the market. It’s a good market. There’s real growth. But it’s high single-digit, low double-digit growth depending on how you segment the market. It’s not triple-digits growth. This isn’t venture-backed, light-your-hair-on-fire growth.”Meanwhile, cyber margins are usually well below those companies make for building and servicing defence equipment and parts.To improve on them, companies such as BAE’s Detica are moving increasingly into offering products, rather than acting largely as consultants.In doing so, they will have to adapt to a faster moving, more dynamic business than they are used to, says William Beer, PwC’s director of the information and cybersecurity practice.But, he added: “If they [defence contractors] make the jump into the private sector, they stand a good chance of shaking things up and really, really enhancing everything we do.”
94;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-03-08T23:04:56Z;General Dynamics lays plans for succession;;The board of General Dynamics, the second-biggest US defence company by revenues, has appointed Phebe Novakovic president and chief operating officer, positioning her as the likely successor to Jay Johnson, chief executive.GD said that Ms Novakovic, 54, who heads up the Marine Systems division and was previously a senior vice-president of planning and development, will start in her new roles on May 2. Mr Johnson, 65, will continue as chairman and chief executive.Mr Johnson said that Ms Novakovic had “performed well” in her present and prior jobs and was “more than ready to assume a larger role in the corporation”. Ms Novakovic, he said, would assist in managing GD’s business groups and its headquarters operations.Rob Stallard, with RBC Capital Markets, said: “GD has effectively anointed Phebe as Jay’s successor, and at some point in the next few years we expect her to be promoted to the chief executive role if everything goes smoothly.”In recent years it has become common practice for contractors to test out future leaders as chief operating officers before further promotion. For example, Northrop Grumman appointed Wes Bush to the role in 2007 before bumping him up to the top job in 2010.Mr Stallard added that he did not expect any significant changes in GD’s strategy as a result of the moves: “We see this as a positive step … Ms Novakovic has a good reputation with investors and this clarifies GD’s management succession plans.”GD shares, which have climbed about 8 per cent over the year to date, rose about 1 per cent to close at $72.01.GD had revenues of $32.7bn in 2011 and employs about 95,100 people worldwide. The contractor makes everything from nuclear submarines to battle tanks and also owns Gulfstream, the manufacturer of business aircraft.
95;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-02-28T23:03:01Z;Nato to begin cyber security drive;;Nato is set to award the biggest cyber defence contract ever agreed outside the US on Wednesday, a move expected to prompt the alliance’s 28-member countries to follow suit and roll out their own cyber security systems.The contract will see Finmeccanica, Italy’s defence contractor and Northrop Grumman, of the US, design and implement a project that allows Nato to detect and respond to cyber security threats by the end of this year.The contract to secure the systems at Nato headquarters and 50 sites within 28 countries was fiercely contested even though it is initially worth only €50m.Defence companies believe it will set a technological benchmark for the contracts individual Nato members seek to protect their own systems and Nato says it is merely the beginning of its own engagement on this new front.Paul MacGregor, head of Finmeccanica’s cyber solutions, called the contract the “Willy Wonka’s golden ticket of cyber.” “Nato is creating a capability that is going to become the template within cyber defence, certainly within Nato nations and probably within a lot of people that are observing this solution.”Nato countries would spend at least €1.4-5-2bn on securing their defence systems in the coming two to three years, Finmeccanica said.“We ourselves as an alliance are only as secure as each of our 28 allies is secure,” said Nato. “We want to be more agile in responding to attacks and help our allies become more responsive. There are much larger figures budgeted for cyber defence down track and this will mean far more investment.”The UK, behind the US, is one of Nato’s most sophisticated figures in cyber defence. It earmarked an additional £650m for cyber security in its 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, making cyber one of the few areas not to suffer deep budgetary cuts.But so far, outside US cyber command, most governments – including the UK – had not yet spent the money on outside help securing their systems, said Mr MacGregor, of Finmeccanica“This contract is the tipping point, particularly in the defence sector, because we have been talking about cyber for two to three years. people have been investing in it, we’ve been going to conferences, we’ve been marketing, we’ve been developing capability, but the market hasn’t really come to us until this point,” he said.Thomas Valasek, of the Centre for European Reform, the think-tank, said: “This shows that countries outside the US are now taking cyber seriously.”He added that Nato had suffered security breaches in the past and that it needed to protect itself. “It is an obvious target as it is a military alliance included in a shooting war in Afghanistan and has peace building operations in Kosovo and off the coast of Somalia. One has to assume bad guys are after it,” he said.Additional reporting by James Blitz
96;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Pension liabilities to hit earnings of US blue-chips;;US blue-chip companies face a hit to earnings from greater pension contributions, with charges related to rising liabilities pushing groups such as Verizon and US Steel into losses during the fourth quarter.The funding gap for pension plans of S&P 500 companies almost doubled in 2011, analysts say, to around $450bn, as bond yields dropped, causing the size of future liabilities to grow. Stock market performance has also failed to keep up with rising liabilities.“In addition to higher contributions this year, it looks like pension funding may become more of an ongoing drain on cash than it has been in the past,” said David Zion, head of accounting research for Credit Suisse. He estimates that S&P 500 companies will have to contribute $90bn to their pension plans in 2012, a rise of 74 per cent on planned contributions for 2011.The bank has identified seven companies where pension contributions are estimated to be more than half of average annual cash flow from operations over the past five years: AK Steel, Goodyear Tire, Weyerhaeuser, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and US Steel.In the current earnings season, four companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average have said that pension contributions will be at least triple those made in 2011, with large industrial companies that have a history of generous benefits and shrinking workforces particularly affected.Boeing’s workforce, for example, has shrunk from around 238,000 in 1998 to under 162,000. The aerospace company has an almost fully funded pension plan, but will make a $1.5bn contribution this year, as a matter of prudence, after not adding cash to the plan for two years. Pension expense will eat into 2012 earnings by around $2.21 per share, bringing expected profits down by a third.Last month Verizon said that its 2012 cash contribution will be an all-time high of $1.3bn. Alcoa expects to make a record cash contribution of $650m in 2012. Its 2011 contribution of almost $1bn was higher, but the aluminium manufacturer provided $600m of that total in the company’s own stock. Honeywell expects to contribute up to $1bn this year, following a $1.65bn contribution in 2011.Some argue pension underfunding and the requirement to increase contributions are a temporary result of artificially low rates. “Any time you evaluate a long-term obligation like a pension with a snapshot point in time you will get a skewed and very misleading picture – either positively or negatively,” said James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, which represents corporate plan sponsors.But others say greater transparency and focus on corporate pensions is long overdue.“If you go back a few years, most US large-caps did not spend much time discussing pension costs in earnings releases,” said Jonathan Barry, a partner in the retirement risk practice at Mercer, “I think investors and the market in general are now more attuned to deficits when assessing a company’s financials.”Additional reporting by Hal Weitzman
97;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-02-01T14:47:02Z;US defence cuts sink Northrop outlook;;Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor, on Wednesday reported another drop in quarterly sales, reduced its estimated order backlog and forecast lower than expected earnings for 2012, pointing to continued US government spending restraints.For the three months to the end of December, revenues slipped to $6.5bn from $6.8bn in the same period a year earlier. Over the full year, sales dropped about 6 per cent to about $26.4bn.Between the end of December 2010 and the end of December 2011, Northrop’s order backlog dropped from $46.8bn to $39.5bn, as it adjusted its order measurement criteria to acknowledge that certain expected sales would not now occur.In recent years, defence contractors such as Northrop and Lockheed Martin have been struggling to cope with an increasingly tough market as their largest customer, the US defence department, cuts its spending in order to help bring down the US budget deficit.Last week, the Pentagon gave its first detailed insights into how it intends to trim about $500bn from its budget plans over the next decade, indicating that it would cancel one version of Northrop’s Global Hawk, an unmanned aerial vehicle.Northrop has been particularly aggressive in reshaping its business in response. In 2011, it spun off its shipbuilding division as Huntington Ingalls Industries and the company said it had also cut back on volumes in its underperforming and non-core units.At the same time, it has worked to cut costs and improve productivity. Operating income from continuing operations rose about 18 per cent to $799m in the fourth quarter and margins increased in three of its four units.Net income rose 46 per cent to $548m, giving earnings per share of about $2.09, although the results were flattered by certain charges relating to debt redemption in the prior year.“Fourth-quarter and full-year results demonstrate our progress in achieving superior operating performance and effective cash deployment. Our businesses drove higher operating income, earnings, cash and a strong book-to-bill ratio for the quarter,” Wes Bush, chief executive of Northrop, said in a statement.Mr Bush said that in 2012 the company expected to achieve profit from continuing operations of between $6.40 and $6.70 a share on sales of between $24.7bn and $25.4bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of $6.82 a share on sales of about $26.1bn.“Our 2012 guidance reflects our continued commitment to performance, affordability for our customers and strong cash generation. While we are in a challenging environment, we believe that we can continue to create value,” Mr Bush said.“The pattern continues – defence revenues light, defence margins strong,“ Rob Stallard, with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients. “With volumes heading down and the customer tightening the terms, we shall see how long this situation can last.”Northrop shares, which have lost about 14 per cent of their value in the past year, were up 1 per cent to $58.65 on Wednesday morning in New York.
98;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2012-01-25T17:21:55Z;Defence industry braced for era of austerity;;Defence industry executives are bracing themselves for dramatic spending cuts as the Pentagon, the world’s biggest buyer of military equipment and services, prepares to release its budget proposal for the coming fiscal year.Later on Thursday, Leon Panetta, US defence secretary, is expected to provide new details of cuts to procurement programmes and troop numbers as his department attempts to make good on promises to trim about $500bn from its plans over the next decade.For companies such as Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems, the 2013 fiscal year defence budget proposal, and the longer-range forecasts that accompany it, is the latest reminder that the decade-long boom the sector has enjoyed on the back of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is now drawing to a close.Analysts expect the scale of the cuts to put pressure on revenues and profits across the board. JPMorgan expects organic revenues at the largest contractors to decline about 5 per cent in 2012, and another 5 per cent in 2013.Eventually, the cuts could lead to a reorganisation of the sector, with companies shedding their poorer performing assets and new entrants from Israel to the UK providing the fighting equipment of the future – advanced computer-driven programmes, such as UAVs (drones), cyber security, surveillance and autonomous systems (robots).Traditional defence contractors will have to find “the courage to shrink” by cleaning up their portfolios, said John Dowdy of McKinsey. Indeed, Northrop Grumman spinning off its shipbuilding business last March has been cited as one example of that future trend.In the past 12 years “the rising tide lifted all boats”, Mr Dowdy said. That is no longer the case and some are going to run out of new orders quickly in this tougher market. But he saw little room left for big mergers after the consolidation of the 1990s that left the top 10 companies controlling 60 per cent of the market.Many of the cuts that the US military will have to make are expected to come at the expense of the army and marines as Washington turns from fighting ground wars to relying on its navy and air force to spread its influence, particularly in Asia.This could lead to fewer vehicles, munitions, radios and ground-based electro-optical equipment, hitting companies such as BAE, General Dynamics and L-3 Communications that generate between 15 and 35 per cent of their revenues from sales to the US army alone.New projects are also at risk and even the F-35 fighter jet may not entirely avoid the cuts due to its long-running development problems and sheer scale.Rob Stallard, with RBC Capital, estimates that up to 175 jets could be cut from the plan over five years. That would hit Lockheed, Northrop and BAE, the main companies involved, and also defence departments from London to Tokyo for whom the average cost of an F-35 would subsequently rise.In many respects, however, the 2013 fiscal year budget is but a prelude to a more painful fight. With the failure of the supercommittee to agree a deficit reduction deal, the Pentagon faces a further $500bn of automatic cuts over the next decade starting in January 2013.Many observers believe it may not come to such drastic measures but they say political inaction could lead to delays in defence procurement as officials become cautious about making expensive purchases for which they risk later being criticised.For companies, that means less clarity in an industry that relies on programmes which often cost billions of dollars and take decades to complete. From an operational point of view, company executives say they will be left with the uncomfortable decision of whether to maintain a workforce in case an order comes through eventually, or to let it go and risk losing any competitive edge in that area.One issue, however, provides a glimmer of hope. Heidi Wood, with Morgan Stanley, argues the budget crisis is so acute, that politicians may finally be forced to address the biggest cost concerns within the military – medical coverage and pensions – and that could free up cash for equipment programmes.
99;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-12-20T20:04:09Z;Relief for Lockheed Martin after awkward year;;The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter’s win in Japan means Lockheed Martin can let out a deep sigh of relief. The year has been an uncomfortable one in the limelight for its Joint Strike Fighter programme.JSF is Lockheed’s most important venture and also one of its most ambitious. For the US, the $382bn programme is not only the biggest military procurement project, but also the one that will define its air defence strategy for a generation. In the US and UK, the JSF’s two lead partners, the programme supports more than 150,000 jobs by Lockheed’s estimate.BAE Systems, the main UK defence contractor on the project, describes the F-35 as the world’s most advanced combat aircraft and “the first and only stealthy, supersonic, multi-role fighter”.But that ambition has come at a price. The project’s technical setbacks have pushed it far behind schedule and well beyond its initial cost projections. The fact that Japan has declared itself willing to buy 42 aircraft is in itself a leap of faith, says Robert Hewson, analyst at IHS Jane’s Defence.“This is where the promises of the F-35 crash into hard reality,” he says.For the F-35, winning the Japanese tender – the first competitive tender it has entered – comes at a critical time for the programme.In India, an important new growth area for defence contractors, the F-35 this year was not picked to compete in the $20bn tender. And among Lockheed’s traditional western customers, emaciated budgets mean big defence spenders, such as the US and UK, are having to limit and delay their purchases.The US initially anticipated buying more than 2,400 F-35s but that number is now expected to shrink. This makes many companies and governments nervous because any reduction or delay in US orders will increase the price of the aircraft for everyone else. And as fewer nations see the F-35 as an affordable option, the risk is that the JSF programme falls into a spiral from which it will be hard to extricate itself.For Lockheed Martin and its partners, which include Northrop Grumman, United Technologies’s Pratt & Whitney, BAE and others, this would mean lower revenue growth and slimmer margins.Lockheed Martin puts the average cost of the three types of F-35 jet at $65m-$85m. But that assumes a lot of them will be sold. The US has calculated the per fighter cost of an F-35 at $133m, while other estimates are higher than $200m.Those price projections may well be revised upwards in the near future, with vice-admiral David Venlet, the US official in charge of the programme, remarking that the likely future costs of fixing recently unearthed problems with the F-35 “sucks the wind out of my lungs”.At the end of last month, US defence department found a long list of flaws with the JSF. The troubles, which include the helmet-mounted display system not functioning properly, part of the fuel dump system posing a fire hazard, and the frame giving out earlier than had been expected, led the department to raise doubts about the entire structure of the F-35 programme.Revelations such as these have led to political ire, with Senator John McCain, the top Republican on the US Senate’s armed services committee, calling the programme “a scandal and a tragedy”. Meanwhile, in its most recent defence budget, the US tightened the screws on the F-35 programme by forcing Lockheed Martin to absorb all of the cost overruns beyond a certain point, rather than sharing them.Lockheed Martin, however, says the technical problems are not game changers and that this year the programme is ahead of schedule. Paul Livingston, aeronautics director for the UK, says the Japan win underscores the progress the F35 has made.“It is a strong endorsement of where we’ve got to in our actual operational tests and the progress the programme has made in the past 18 months, which is just phenomenal,” he says.Additional reporting by Geoff Dyer in Washington and Jeremy Lemer in New York
100;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Wikileaks names 160 mass spyware vendors;;WikiLeaks has named 160 companies, including large corporations such as Alcatel-Lucent, Northrop Grumman and Siemens, that it claims are selling mass surveillance technologies, some of which are being used by repressive regimes in the Middle East.The publication is part of a new campaign launched by the whistle-blowing organisation, together with Privacy International, the pressure group, and media organisations from six countries, to expose the extent of spyware being used against civilian populations.Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, said mass surveillance had now become a multibillion-dollar business for western intelligence contractors, working on behalf of governments around the world. At least some of these, he claimed, were knowingly selling equipment to regimes, which were using them to persecute political opponents.“Who here has an iPhone? Who here has a BlackBerry? Who uses Gmail? Well, you’re all screwed,” Mr Assange told a press conference in London. “Intelligence contractors have surveillance systems for all those right now,” he said.“In the last 10 years, systems for indiscriminate, mass surveillance have become the norm,” WikiLeaks claimed on The Spy Files, a subsidiary website launched on Thursday. “Intelligence companies such as VASTech secretly sell equipment to permanently record the phone calls of entire nations. Others record the location of every mobile phone in a city, down to 50 metres. Systems to infect every Facebook user, or smartphone owner of an entire population group are on the intelligence market.”Mr Assange said these security concerns were partly the reason the company delayed launching a new, long-expected online submissions system allowing whistle-blowers to pass secrets to the website.The publication of this information by WikiLeaks follows recent allegations that equipment made by Trovicor, a former subsidiary of Nokia Siemens Networks, was used to monitor the communications of Bahraini citizens. Nokia Siemens Networks said it sold the Trovicor business in 2009 after “issues were raised about potential misuse of the technology, which were of concern to the company”.Three US Senators have asked the Obama Administration to investigate how the Syrian government obtained equipment from California-based NetApp and Blue Coat Systems. The companies have denied selling directly to Syria.Wikileaks released 287 documents on Thursday, which appeared to be mainly brochures and marketing documents related to surveillance equipment. However, Owni, the French media outlet working with WikiLeaks, revealed a page of a manual from Amesys, the French surveillance company, which apparently showed the pseudonyms of 40 tracked figures. Owni claimed that these pseudonyms corresponded to political dissidents that Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi had sought to jail or kill.Sophos, a UK-based IT security company named in the WikiLeaks files, said the whistle-blowing organisation had misunderstood the nature of its technology, which is used to help telecoms companies comply with tracking requests from police forces.“We actively ensure that our products comply with EU export restrictions and UN sanctions,” said Steve Munford, chief executive of Sophos.However, Eric King, human rights and technology advisor with Privacy International, said the problem was that surveillance technology was not included in most countries’ export restrictions.“Governments need to make sure that companies are no longer allowed to sell these products,” he said.Alcatel-Lucent, Northrop Grumman, Siemens, VASTech and Amesys were unavailable for comment.
101;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-11-30T19:08:56Z;Saab lifted as Swiss choose the Gripen;;The Swiss government has chosen to buy the Gripen fighter jet, rather than the Eurofighter or France’s Rafale, giving a much needed boost to Saab of Sweden.The decision to purchase 22 Gripen fighters to replace the Swiss air force’s antiquated Northrop Grumman F-5s will be a huge disappointment to the European consortium behind the Eurofighter and an even bigger blow to Dassault, manufacturer of the Rafale. The Rafale, one of a handful of fighters being considered by India, has so far failed to win any export orders.The Gripen is already in service in the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa and Thailand, apart from its native Sweden, but Håkan Buskhe, Saab’s chief executive, admitted that the victory was “a little bit of a surprise for us”.“The Swiss …selection confirms that Saab is a market leader in the defence and security industry and that Gripen is a world-class fighter system that provides the best value for money,” Mr Buskhe said.All three aircraft have been under exhaustive tests for a number of years, and the Swiss air force is known to be particularly exacting. Moreover, Switzerland is seen as a market in which political factors, although never negligible, are secondary to pure performance and economic considerations.Given that Switzerland is known globally for applying highest procurement standards and requesting state-of-the-art technologies, Saab is both proud and delighted that Gripen has been chosen as the Swiss air force’s future multirole fighter aircraft, Saab said in a statement.The Swiss government said all three aircraft had clearly met their technical requirements, and could have been purchased. But the Gripen – which is single rather than double-engined and therefore lighter – was not just the cheapest of the trio, but also the jet with the lowest expected running costs over its lifespan.Bern said the cost factor was particularly important in the context of extremely tight military spending. The Swiss parliament has acknowledged the need for constraints, but simultaneously pushed for a 100,000-strong army and improvements to various weapons programmes.“Financial considerations played a decisive role in the selection decision,” said the government in a statement.All three manufacturers also offered Switzerland extensive offset agreements, allowing Swiss companies significant work on the project.The Swiss defence ministry will now open talks with Saab on how the contract can be further refined, before Bern puts the proposal to parliament early next year.
102;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-10-12T18:01:20Z;BAE warns of uncertainty over US contracts;;BAE Systems warned of “significant uncertainty” over future levels of US military spending but the defence equipment manufacturer said it remained confident of winning orders in spite of constraints on government expenditure in many of its principal markets.The FTSE 100 company, which last month confirmed that it was planning to lay off 3,000 from its UK workforce of 40,000 in response to slackening demand for military aircraft, said it remained on track to deliver underlying earnings a share for the full year that would be “broadly similar” to 2010.BAE, in a trading update covering the period from July to October, said it would continue to implement big cost reductions to “address changes in customer priorities and, in some areas, reduced business activity”.BAE – the UK’s biggest manufacturer by sales and the world’s second-largest military equipment maker – has already cut 15,000 jobs globally in the past two years.Though BAE made delivery of the first of 24 Typhoon aircraft to the Royal Saudi Air Force during the period, an overall slowdown in government orders for the fighter jet was partly blamed for the job cuts at the company’s UK plants.The uncertainty in the US over the future commissioning of defence equipment programmes is weighing most heavily on the company. Protracted political divisions in Congress over the authorisation of US government spending was also unwelcome, it said.“Some near-term disruption to trading is anticipated as the US administration again operates federal budgets under a Continuing Resolution,” it added.The company generated 43 per cent of its turnover in the US in the first six months of the year, followed by the UK on 27 per cent. Saudi Arabia was the company’s next largest market, accounting for 12 per cent of BAE’s sales, followed by Australia on 6 per cent.In spite of spending cuts in its main markets, BAE insisted it was well placed in pursuing “significant new business opportunities”.In August, BAE along with Northrop Grumman was awarded a $450m contract working on an armoured vehicle project for the US army. The award is being disputed by rival SAIC. The award of a $850m contract to operate an army ammunition plant in the US to BAE in May is also being disputed by the incumbent contractor.BAE added that it remained in discussions over the possible sale of Typhoon fighters to Oman while India was also considering buying the aircraft.The company, which is in the middle of a £500m share repurchase programme, added it planned to bring forward £157m of pension deficit funding in the final quarter of the year. Revised deficit funding agreements are expected to be finalised by the end of the year following triennial funding valuations on two of its largest UK pension schemes.The burden on a revised agreement could be exacerbated by recent falls in yields on UK government gilts that last month saw the aggregate shortfall of British corporate pension schemes near record levels.BAE shares, down 22 per cent over the year, fell 4.4p to 276.7p in early trading on Wednesday.
103;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Chinese military mobilises cybermilitias;;Nanhao Group is, in many ways, an ordinary technology company. Its staff make online scoring systems, exam-mark scanners and other educational hardware and software.But many of its 500 employees in Hengshui, just south-west of Beijing, have a second job. Since 2005 Nanhao has been home to a cybermilitia unit organised by the People’s Liberation Army.“All staff under the age of 30 belong to the unit,” said Bai Guoliang, Nanhao vice-president. It is unclear what exactly the unit does, but according to a local government announcement when it was set up, it consisted of two groups tasked with cyberattack and cyberdefence.The Nanhao operation is one of thousands set up by the Chinese military over the past decade in technology companies and universities around the country. These units form the backbone of the country’s internet warfare forces, increasingly seen as a serious threat at a time of escalating global cybertensions.Governments, companies and internet security experts around the world have blamed China for many of the past year’s global hacking attacks. US officials point to the Chinese government or its supporters for the theft of neutron bomb designs, the defence secretary’s emails and private sector intellectual property worth many billions of dollars.Western cybersecurity analysts look to matching patterns between malware which played a role in intrusions and codes discussed on Chinese hacker forums as evidence of Chinese involvement. US investigators say attacks on Google and other American companies originated from computers at Lanxiang, a vocational school in the Chinese province of Shandong, and Jiaotong University in Shanghai.Major military contractors have been expanding into cybersecurity by acquiring smaller, specialist firms. This graphic highlights the deals shaping the emerging cyber-industrial complexAttacks on companies have “a level of sophistication and are clearly supported by a level of resources that can only be a nation state entity,” said Mike Rogers, chairman of the House permanent select committee on intelligence, last week.Mr Rogers describes these corporate attacks as “a massive and sustained intelligence effort by a government to blatantly steal commercial data and intellectual property”. Several US state department cables obtained by WikiLeaks and marked as secret elaborate on these theories.Even if attacks clearly originate in China, it is much harder to prove that they were sponsored by the Chinese government or military. Beijing insists the state does not sponsor hacking and its cyberwarfare strategy is purely defensive.“China is a victim of cyberattack,” Senior Colonel Geng Yansheng, spokesman of the ministry of national defence, said in May when announcing the PLA had set up a “cyber blue team” to “better safeguard the internet security of the armed forces”.But the PLA’s actions over the past decade deliver a different message. As early as 1999, senior PLA officers argued that China should use electronic techniques to attack adversaries. Since 2002, the PLA has been searching for external talent to put that strategy into practice.“The PLA is reaching out across a wide swath of the Chinese civilian sector to meet the intensive personnel requirements necessary to support its burgeoning information warfare capabilities,” said a 2009 report by Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor, on China’s cyberwarfare capabilities.A co-ordinated cyberattack on the US electrical grid is high up the list of concerns for defence and intelligence officialsThe most concrete result of this search for talent was the creation of specialised units – such as the one in Nanhao – in China’s 8m-strong militia, which is part of the PLA’s reserve force.“[These militia] should preferably be set up in the telecom sector, in the electronics and internet industries and in institutions of scientific research,” said a paper by three officers from the Jiangsu provincial PLA command’s mobilisation department.The paper was published in National Defense, the magazine of the Academy of Military Sciences (AMS). The cybermilitia’s tasks include “stealing, changing and erasing data” on enemy networks and their intrusion with the goal of “deception, jamming, disruption, throttling and paralysis”, the paper said.Nanhao’s Mr Bai confirmed that its cybermilitia unit was led by the local PLA command and has “regular exchanges” with it, training PLA officers. Asked whether the group would carry out cyberattacks, he said: “That has nothing to do with you.”This push to create cybermilitias could mean that even some of China’s largest and best-known technology companies could become part of the information warfare complex. An employee of China Telecom in the coastal province of Jiangsu said the state-owned carrier’s local affiliate had a cybermilitia unit and he believed similar groups had been set up in other provinces.The PLA’s efforts to tap and foster civilian cyberwarfare talent also reach beyond the corporate sector.The military sponsors hacking competitions in universities and information warfare research in academia. Tang Zuoqi, a lecturer at the College of Computer Science and Information at Guizhou University, secured his job after winning prizes in a 2005 internet warfare competition held by the Chengdu military command, according to his biography on the university’s website.China already has a thriving hacking scene. Tightly knit groups of young hackers, mostly men, discuss code on online bulletin boards or even meet in offline classes, sometimes advertised on streets.“Hacking for criminal purposes in China is growing, it is getting more professional and more organised,” says Liu Deliang, a professor at Beijing Normal University and one of China’s leading experts on cybercrime.Although the Northrop Grumman report said it was difficult to establish firm links between the PLA and this criminal community, the military is trying to forge those links. The AMS paper says: “[We must] recruit experts who research internet technology, especially those who are good at ‘hacking’ attacks and virus technology.”Additional reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco
104;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-10-10T16:43:12Z;Defence groups turn to cybersecurity;FT series: Sector shifts to resist online threat;Inside the Silicon Valley offices of Narus, an obscure internet traffic analysis business, Greg Oslan is plotting the future for Boeing.Boeing bought Mr Oslan’s small company last year, attracted by Narus technology that can detect malicious internet traffic in an ocean of data. This may seem far afield for Boeing, known primarily for building aircraft. But through Narus, the 95-year-old aerospace company gained a piece of the hottest area of the defence industry: cybersecurity.The internet is turning the defence industry on its head, just as it transformed media, retail and other sectors before it.“We have moved from hackers having fun, to a wave of organised crime, to more sophisticated ‘malware’ being used as a threat to a country’s way of life,” says Mr Oslan, who also runs Boeing’s cybersecurity business.For decades, Boeing and rivals such as Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin built the aircraft and heavy equipment needed to fight wars – making the companies charter members of what former US president Dwight Eisenhower famously referred to as the “military-industrial complex”.Today, those same companies are investing heavily to create a cyber-industrial complex, a development likely to have vast consequences for the future of the internet.Major military contractors have been expanding into cybersecurity by acquiring smaller, specialist firms. This graphic highlights the deals shaping the emerging cyber-war industrial complexThe market for cyberarms is thriving in the wake of high-profile attacks, such as Russia’s alleged attack on Estonian government websites in 2007 and the Stuxnet attack last year on Iran’s nuclear programme. An array of companies now sell software to the US government that can break into and degrade or destroy an enemy’s computer network, as well as programmes aimed at blocking such attacks.“There is a feeding frenzy right now to provide products and services to meet the demands of governments, law enforcement and the military,” says Ron Deibert, a University of Toronto expert on internet freedom and director of the Canada Centre for Global Security Studies.Boeing and its rivals are expanding largely through acquisition. More than a dozen buy-outs of cybercompanies have been announced this year, according to the advisers ERG Partners – double the number than in 2010. These companies have sold for as much as $1.8bn, the price paid by private investment firm Providence Equity Partners for SRA International, a defence consulting company. SRA employs 1,000 people in its cybersecurity arm and its customers include the US army, navy and air force.SRA says it “offers everything that’s required to build a strong defence against the cyberthreat”, including Cybergami, a tool for visualising where data are moving on a network.Most of the companies getting snapped up are smaller than SRA, but still attract premiums. ERG calculates that because of the demand they typically fetch 20 per cent more for their cash flow than other private intelligence industry companies.Join the conversation: Put your questions on #cyber warfare to the FT’s @josephmenn on Tues at 3pm UK time (10am EST)“Cybersecurity will remain a key focus area” for acquirers because it supports “key national security priorities,” ERG said in September.Hundreds of specialist firms have popped up outside Washington, in the state of Maryland, home to the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command. The spate of start-ups is pushing overall information technology employment in the greater Washington area to more than 280,000 – more than in Silicon Valley or New York City.“We see a tremendous boom,” says J. Thomas Sadowski, chief executive of the Economic Alliance of Greater Baltimore. Most of the new companies have fewer than 100 employees and many team up for government deals with big defence contractors, which sometimes buy them outright.Clustered in bland office parks near the defence agencies, some firms are created by reformed prankster hackers and others by military veterans. Outwardly, they tout their ability to protect networks from attack, while also quietly offering tools to penetrate the networks of others.The companies are all hoping to get a piece of the growing US budget for cyberarms. US defence, intelligence and homeland security agencies spend $10bn annually on cybersecurity, Deltek estimates. That remains a small fraction of the Pentagon’s annual budget of $600bn, but the figure is expected to climb by at least 9 per cent annually – even as the White House seeks $40bn in annual defence cuts. The Pentagon will have 10,000 people at Cyber Command when fully staffed and far more are employed through outsourcing.“The Obama administration has committed half a billion dollars to develop advanced defensive technologies, including novel approaches to improving network security,” wrote William Lynn, the outgoing deputy secretary of defence, last month in Foreign Affairs. “But much remains to be done, and the window for doing it is short.”Add in what private companies are spending and the cyberarms market is more like $100bn in the US alone, says Kent Schneider, a former army officer and Northrop executive who leads the non-profit Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association.That figure includes goods sold to ward off cybercrime gangs that try to steal financial data, as well as goods to protect or attack nations. But the work of gangs, spies and soldiers is increasingly intertwined.“Criminals are in a lot of places that the nation states might want to go,” says Ashar Aziz, founder of Silicon Valley security company FireEye, which has seen “collusion” between criminal gangs and nation states in programs designed to steal defence industry secrets.At Northrop, cybersecurity sales account for $1.1bn of its $27bn annual revenue, but the company expects that to rise.“We’ve identified cyber as one of our four key areas for growth for the next five years,” says Tim McKnight, vice-president at Northrop’s intelligence systems division.The US spends far more than any other country on its military and other nations have followed its lead in cyberinvestment. Since Cybercom became operational last year, the UK, France and more than a dozen others have moved to set up similar commands.“Any country with a credible military is doing something like this,” says James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has advised US leaders and participated in semi-official cyberarms talks with rival China.This increased spending on defence may be designed to protect the US from cyberattack, but the fact that as much as 85 per cent of the internet is under the control of private companies leaves it vulnerable to assault on infrastructure.The companies that control the US electric grid and transport network lack a business need to invest in safer infrastructure, experts say, and an attack on either could devastate the US economy. The White House and Congress have yet to agree on how to share information about new cyberthreats with the private sector, let alone who should pay to protect it.This quandary is one of the problems for an industry that is otherwise surging ahead in the near-absence of export controls and global rules limiting cyberaggression. Unlike fighter aircraft, most cybermonitoring and exploitation software can be sold to any country with which the US has relations.Like many of its rivals, Narus sells its non-classified gear anywhere it can find a legal market, including China and pre-revolution Egypt.All governments deserve help in preventing malicious software from spreading, Mr Oslan says. “We’re in the infancy, on a global basis, [of being able to discover the source of attacks], which is a very difficult and expensive proposition.”The rules of cyberwar, along with the privacy issues it raises, will be debated in the years ahead. But for now they are taking a back seat to the industriousness found in Maryland’s office parks.“The market is dominated, obviously, by the government,” says Mr Sadowski of the Baltimore economic development group.And right now, the government is bulking up on cyberarms.
105;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-08-18T21:52:01Z;Industry feels the sting of US defence cuts;;Faced with the prospect of substantial reductions in US military spending, leading defence contractors, analysts and investors are all dialling back their expectations for the sector even as the industry ramps up its lobbying efforts to forestall bigger cuts.“I don’t think it’s any secret that the defence budget is a very difficult one right now,” Jim Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes and a former head of Boeing’s $32bn defence unit, told investors at a conference in New York last week.“The Department of Defense is going to have to take out between $800bn and $1,000bn over the next 10 years. There are not a lot of discretionary knobs that they can turn … It’s going to be a tough marketplace for a while to come without question,” he said.“Defence budgets are, and will continue to be, under pressure and this is a minus that few defence contractors will avoid,” Charles Mathis, chief financial officer of Force Protection, a maker of armoured vehicles, told the same conference.British defence companies – which have invested $20bn in a US expansion drive over the past decade – are also experiencing falling sales and scaling back growth expectations. Rolls-Royce has already been directly affected by the cuts, after the US Congress decided it would stop funding an alternative engine Rolls was developing for the new F-35 fighter aeroplane.Behind the uptick in concern lies the recent congressional deal over the federal debt ceiling. Under that agreement the Pentagon will be hit by about $350bn of cuts over the next decade in the first wave of action – roughly in line with previous expectations.Honeywell, which sells aircraft engines and other kit to the military, expects the base budget to decline about 1 to 2 per cent a year over the next decade, resulting in a 2 per cent to 4 per cent annual decline in revenues for its defence unit for three years.But as part of the jury-rigged compromise, the DoD could also be subject to a further round of about $500bn in automatic cuts if a panel of politicians fails to agree on substantial spending reductions designed to shrink the federal deficit.“[The deal] could trim the nation’s defence budget by more than 10 per cent over the next decade. We expect these budget cuts to affect the large prime contractors and to ripple across the supply chain to smaller, specialised providers,” analysts at Moody’s wrote.The rating agency expects average defence margins to fall below 10 per cent as companies compete more aggressively for a “smaller pie” which could pressure earnings and cash flow and “eventually lead to ratings downgrades for some contractors”.Doug Harned, with Bernstein Research, argues that any automatic cuts could be particularly painful because they would probably be evenly distributed between 2013 and 2021. Normally defence cuts are backloaded giving the Pentagon plenty of wiggle room.In response to the elevated risks, defence stock prices have fallen faster than the market. Over the past month, aerospace and defence shares in the S&P500, including companies such as Raytheon, Boeing and Northrop Grumman, have tumbled about 18 per cent, while the broader index has dropped about 13 per cent.Industry lobby groups are still fighting the cuts. The Aerospace Industries Association has stepped up its efforts to “educate” congressmen about the importance of defence spending to national security and the economy.In September, it will officially launch a website called secondtonone.org that argues “American leadership in aerospace and defence is being threatened by forces in Congress and the administration.”Still, while acknowledging the more difficult outlook, executives from Boeing, Honeywell and other defence companies insist that their businesses will hold up thanks to advantages such as exposure to priority parts of the budget and international growth.Michael Madsen, president of Honeywell’s defence and space unit, expects to see increased demand from countries such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, while Mr Albaugh says Boeing aims to generate 25 per cent of its defence sales abroad within a decade.Moreover, somewhat counter-intuitively, the share slide may be a positive for certain investors, argues Rob Stallard, of RBC Capital Markets. “Many value investors are wondering if the 10-year defence downcycle is pretty much priced in,” he wrote to clients recently.“The dividend yield on some defence companies is now over 4 per cent. And so with limited downside in the stocks, and a healthy coupon, this could be seen as appealing to those with an income slant.”
106;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-08-01T21:01:42Z;Wall Street erases gains after weak data;;US stocks closed slightly lower after a turbulent session that saw the session open with shares sharply higher on the US debt agreement and then tumble after weak manufacturing figures damped sentiment.Leading defence companies came under pressure on worries that fiscal retrenchment in the wake of the debt deal will hit the Pentagon’s defence budget.Lockheed Martinlost 1.7 per cent to $74.46, Boeingfell 2 per cent to $70.33 and Northrop Grummanwas down 1.5 per cent to $59.60.The broader aerospace and defence sector, which is still undervalued according to Citigroup analysts, was lower.About $350bn of cuts over 10 years are expected in the Pentagon’s defence budget. Although Citi analysts said this was not as bad as the industry had expected, the cuts were not yet final and could increase.Citi said it expected “there to continue to be some overhang on defence names until a deal gets done”, but the key details of defence spending would probably be released in the strategic review due in September.After the bell, the S&P 500 index fell 0.4 per cent to 1,286.95, the Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.4 per cent to 2,744.61, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 12,132.49.Last week, the S&P 500 registered its worst weekly performance in a year and markets fluctuated on the news of the negotiations and the growing possibility of default.The indices were also hit by weaker-than-expected Institute of Supply Management figures indicating that the pace of US manufacturing growth was slowing.Some analysts saw some hope, at least over the short term, for bulls.“Over the near term, a solution to raising the debt limit will probably result in a strong rally, given stocks are deeply oversold and near support, which is at 1,250 to 1,270 using the S&P 500,” said Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Baird. “But the ramifications of GDP growth of less than 1 per cent for the first six months of the year will linger.“Looking further out, the question now becomes whether the weak economy can endure the austerity programmes planned for the second half of the year,” he said.Healthcare facilities were some of the biggest losers after Friday’s after-market news that nursing homes lost a lobbying fight with Medicare that will cost the industry more than $3.8bn next year. The federal government’s healthcare programme for the elderly is cutting its payment rate by 11.1 per cent to help compensate for overbilling.Sun Healthcare Group lost 52.14 per cent to $3.35, Skilled Healthcare Group fell to $5.06, a 42.5 per cent drop, and The Ensign Group slid 22.2 per cent to $22.09.US insurers slipped on news that the US department of health and human services had signed off on recommendations to include contraception in preventive care.While not slated to go into effect until next year, analysts said it would force insurance companies to increase premiums. The S&P healthcare sector was down 1.71 per cent.Concerns that some of the spending cuts from the debt deal will affect Medicare and other healthcare services also hit the sector.Among health insurers to fall were Cigna, down 4.3 per cent to $47.63, Aetna, off 2.9 per cent to $40.29, and United Healthcare, 3.2 per cent lower at $48.02.Humana, the US health insurer, also fell despite forecast-beating results. It reported a second-quarter profit and raised its earnings forecast by more than 10 per cent but shares fell to $72.36, a 2.9 per cent loss.The company would have raised its full-year guidance further, Citi analysts said, but plans to increase non-production spending in the second half could have an impact on results.Allstate, the home and car insurer, reported a second-quarter net loss of $620m after a spring of tornadoes, flooding and other natural disasters, but the loss was less than markets had anticipated. In the quarter, losses from catastrophes reached more than $2bn, the most disclosed by any publicly traded US insurer. Its shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.34.Shares in Ford Motor rose despite news that the US car company was recalling 1.1m pick-up trucks because of a risk of the gas tank falling off and causing fires. Shares were up 1.1 per cent to $12.35.Late on Sunday, HSBC agreed to sell 195 branches in upstate New York to First Niagara, the Buffalo-based bank, for $1bn in cash. Shares in the regional bank, which merged with NewAlliance Bancshares for $1.5bn last year, fell 2.7 per cent to $11.92.Loews, the US insurance and property group, was hit by higher catastrophe losses and lower income from its biggest holding, CNA Financial.Missing market expectations, it reported earnings per share of $0.62 versus an expected $0.74. Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $39.11.
107;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-07-28T18:49:06Z;L-3 plans spin-off of units to boost growth;Defence group under pressure from activist investors;L-3 Communications, the US defence electronics and services company, is to spin-off its consulting and training units to shareholders in the latest move by a contractor to shed slow growing segments amid declining military budgets.The spin-off comes in response to a weak performance in 2010, characterised by contract losses and a falling stock price, and pressure from activist shareholders which have urged management to aggressively pursue divestments or even to split the company up.In June, Relational Investors, an activist investment fund run by Ralph Whitworth, revealed a 6 per cent stake in L-3 and said it had spoken to senior executives about the company’s underperforming stock price and “suboptimal business mix”.Michael Strianese, L-3 chief executive, said the spin-off was the best option because it would improve the growth rate of the remainder of the company, end conflicts of interest between offering consulting services and selling products and it is likely it would be tax-free.A number of defence companies have spun off or sold divisions in recent months as they rejig their portfolios to cope with the stark prospect of declining US defence budgets, and demands for cheaper products and services from the Pentagon.In 2009 Northrop Grumman sold its consulting unit to two private equity companies for about $1.7bn in cash and earlier this year it spun off its shipbuilding business to shareholders as Huntington Ingalls Industries.“We are creating two very strong companies and shareholder value will follow that” Mr Strianese told the Financial Times, dismissing suggestions that the plans were too timid after a year-long review. “The market reaction has been very positive.”L-3 shares, which have climbed about 12 per cent over the year to date, rose about 4 per cent to $82. When the spin-off completes in the first half of 2012 L-3 expects to receive a dividend of up to $650m from the sale by adding debt to the new entity.The divestments will leave L-3 with revenues of about $13.5bn and four main divisions, providing aircraft modernization and maintenance, electronic systems, intelligence and surveillance systems, and cyber security services to federal agencies.But growth for the company remains ellusive. On Thursday, L-3 reported second quarter results showing a 5 per cent decline in sales to $3.8bn as contract losses in 2010 and contract delays in 2011 took their toll. Profit rose 6 per cent after certain tax benefits.Engility – as the new company will be known – also faces an uphill struggle. It will have about 10,000 employees, sales of about $2bn and operating income of about $179m, but its revenues are declining as the US military withdraws from Iraq and Afghanistan.Engility provides linguistic services, defence-related training and software development to the US military. Executives in its operations argue that as an independent entity it will be able to bid for “hundreds of millions of dollars” of work that it is currently barred from by conflicts of interest within L-3.L-3 has a long history as a buyer and seller of companies. It was built in the 1990s and early 2000s by the late Frank Lanza, a former top Lockheed Martin executive, who scooped up dozens of niche defence companies orphaned by a wave of mega-mergers in the sector.Since Mr Lanza’s death in 2006, however, the rate of acquisitions has fallen dramatically, although it remained a favourite with investors until a difficult year in 2010, when the company was hit by the drawdown in Iraq and Afghanistan and its stock fell about 19 per cent.
108;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-07-27T13:17:11Z;Boeing chiefs defend upgrade of 737;;Boeing executives on Wednesday defended their decision to upgrade rather than redesign their best-selling family of narrow-body aircraft as the company reported higher second-quarter sales and profits and raised its outlook for the full year.Jim McNerney, chief executive, said that while “uncertainties” such as unrest in the Middle East, rising oil prices and the US debt discussion continue to dog the aviation industry, “fundamentals remain sound”.The company is still smarting from a setback last week, when American Airlines, a traditionally stalwart customer, split a large order for narrow-body aircraft between Boeing and its rival Airbus.To win that deal and push back against Airbus, Boeing also announced that it would develop a short-term upgrade for its 737 family of aircraft rather than an all-new jet for the medium term.On Wednesday, Boeing executives defended the move. “This didn’t [just] occur to us a week before the American Airlines competition,” Mr McNerney said. “The American Airlines deal [was] part of a much broader voice of the marketplace that is very highly valuing [fuel] efficiency today, versus more [fuel] efficiency tomorrow.”In a call with analysts, Boeing said that its flagship 787 Dreamliner aircraft, which has been much delayed, is on track for first deliveries to begin in the third quarter, although it now expects to deliver fewer 787 and 747-8 aircraft this year.During the quarter, Boeing paused production for 20 days to allow some suppliers to catch up with the production schedule. Mr McNerney said that even if another pause was necessary, the 787 would still meet its delivery dates.For the three months to the end of June, net income rose about 20 per cent to $941m against the same period last year, generating $1.25 earnings per share, up from $1.06 per share in 2010. Sales climbed about 6 per cent to $16.5bn.Boeing now expects to generate between $3.90 and $4.10 of earnings per share in 2011, up from its previous estimate of between $3.80 and $4.00 per share. The company expects sales of between $68bn and $71bn and has a backlog of about $323bn.In midday trading, Boeing shares, which have added about 11 per cent over the year to date, climbed about 4 per cent to $72.65.Boeing delivered 118 civil aircraft during the quarter, four more than in the same period in 2010, helping to drive sales up 19 per cent to $8.8bn at the commercial aircraft unit. Margins at the unit also increased by 1.2 points to 10.4 per cent.● On Wednesday, Northrop Grumman reported a 27 per cent drop in June quarter net income to $520m as sales fell 10 per cent to $6.6bn. But margins increased and the company raised its 2011 forecasts.
109;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-07-10T15:38:23Z;Suppliers switch tactics to hold on to customers;;Small US industrial companies that supply components for some of the world’s biggest manufacturers have turned to a range of new customer-service techniques – from cutting the time they take to complete an order to communicating with customers via Facebook and Twitter – amid intensifying competition in the manufacturing supply chain.Although thousands of small industrial suppliers went out of business during the downturn, many of those that survived did so by expanding into new sectors and winning new customers, increasing competition for business as suppliers diversified into each others’ traditional territories.Lingering worries that the companies they supply could go bankrupt and increasing competition are the top concerns of small and medium-sized US industrial groups, according to a survey of 3,400 companies due to be released on Tuesday by ThomasNet, a website for researching industrial suppliers.“The competition is the fiercest I’ve ever seen it,” said Nancy Simmons, president of Aero Industries, a metals distributor based in Orlando that has nine employees and whose customers include Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Nasa.In response, Aero has sought to differentiate itself by offering its customers a range of business consulting services. It has drawn on its own experience – expanding exports from 1 per cent of revenues three years ago to one-fifth now – to advise on export opportunities, giving help on logistics, markets and legal issues.“There’s been consolidation among industrial suppliers, so we’re seeing bigger, more aggressive competitors, while at the same time the customer base has been shrinking,” said Richard Rubin, president of Maxi Container, a Detroit-based maker of industrial packaging with 20 employees, whose customers include Campbell Soup, BASF and Ford.To win and retain customers, Maxi has begun blogging, and is using social media such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Mr Rubin said such strategies helped him win a new contract with Akzo Nobel, the Dutch paint and chemicals group. Mr Rubin has also instituted a “customer of the month” award.Perfection Spring and Stamping, a family-owned business in Mount Prospect, Illinois, that makes metal components for companies including Continental, Bosch and Whirlpool, recently increased its sales team’s travel budget by $50,000, overhauled its website and upgraded its sales tracking and reporting system.“We’ve added 13 new customers that came through the website – half of them multinational companies and eight from sectors we’ve never served before,” said David Kahn, chief executive.For large manufacturers, the intensifying competition among suppliers has helped drive down costs and lead times. “The big manufacturers are really beating us up on price, delivery time and quality,” said Ms Simmons.“A lot of former automotive suppliers have transferred over to the medical equipment market,” said Mr Kahn. “They’re bringing auto-industry ideas – such as annual cost reductions – with them.”
110;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-04-27T20:56:04Z;US markets cheer Fed decision;;Amazon led the gains on Wall Street after investors responded positively to its first-quarter earnings, while in the wider markets the Nasdaq Composite index hit a 10-year high after the Federal Reserve’s latest statement on monetary policy and the subsequent press briefing by Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed.Shares in the world’s largest online retailer jumped 7.9 per cent to $169.63, an all-time high, after the company reported a 38 per cent jump in sales.This increase in revenues, however, was accompanies by a 33 per cent fall in net income for the quarter as new investments in data storage and distribution eclipsed the rise in sales.But investors had already braced themselves for a drop in earnings and some analysts appeared to be convinced by a letter from Jeff Bezos, the chief executive officer, justifying the revenue focused strategy.This helped the S&P retail sector add 1.6 per cent and helped boost the Nasdaq Composite up 0.8 per cent to 2,869.88, a 10-year high.The S&P 500 was flat for much of the day, but jumped higher after the statements by Mr Bernanke and the Fed. The benchmark index closed up 0.6 at 1,355.66, a multi-year high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.8 per cent at 12,690.96.The Fed held rates steady at 0 to 0.25 per cent but tweaked its statement on growth, reducing its outlook from a “firmer footing” for the recovery to a “moderate” pace of growth. The central bank also said that it would end its $600bn “QE2” quantitative easing programme and Mr Bernanke suggested that the pace of stimulus might slow.Sentiment in the wider markets was also helped by data showing that US durable goods orders had jumped last month, with orders rising 2.5 per cent in March after a revised 0.7 per cent rise in February.In the previous session, the S&P 500 reached its highest level since June 2008, indicating that the markets have now recovered from sharp losses following the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa and the natural disaster in Japan.Much of the recent gains in the S&P have been driven by a strong start to the earnings season. Of the 197 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 77 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations compared with 73 per cent last quarter. Before the season started, analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that there would be a 65 per cent surprise rate overall.Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, said that momentum in the markets would continue to tick higher from here over the year, but there was likely to be more volatility.Boeing’s profits in the first quarter exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, and the stock advanced 0.8 per cent to $76.12. The world’s second-biggest aircraft maker by revenue made a net profit of $586m, or 78 cents per share, up from $519m, or 70 cents per share, in the same period last year and ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about 72 cents per share.Northrop Grummanreported a 21 per cent rise in earnings, beating estimates, while also raising its full-year guidance. Stock in the defence and aerospace group put on 0.7 per cent to $62.90.Rockwell Automation, the maker of factory automation equipment and software, saw one of the sharpest losses of the session, falling 8.7 per cent to $89.33 after reporting only a modest profit and a small increase to its 2011 earnings forecast.Elsewhere in the sector Parker Hannifin, another industrial supplier, also disappointed with its earnings and the stock declined 5.1 per cent to $93.48.Disappointing earnings reports from ConocoPhillips and National Oilwell Varco weighed on the energy sector.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company, reported a 43 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings, but missed its production and refining targets, leaving the stock down 1.7 per cent at $79.83.The decline in production was due to civil unrest in Libya, a supply vessel collision with a company platform, natural field decline and the temporary shutdown of the trans-Alaska pipeline system.Elsewhere in the sector, National Oilwell fell 4.6 per cent to $76.88 after the US oilfield equipment maker reported a 4 per cent drop in quarterly profit amid restructuring charges and Libya-related writedowns.
111;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-04-27T18:20:03Z;Northrop Grumman earnings beat estimates;;Northrop Grumman’s first-quarter earnings beat estimates and the company raised its guidance, saying it is confident about the future in spite of the looming threat of Pentagon cutbacks.The defence and aerospace group reported a solid quarter with a 13 per cent rise in net income in the first three months of 2011 as higher margins offset a decline in sales.The company also expressed confidence about the future, boosting its annual earnings per share outlook to $6.50 -$6.70 from $6.40-$6.60 and raising its quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, a 6.4 per cent increase from the previous quarterly dividend.Net income for the quarter came in at $530m, or $1.67 per diluted share. This was up from $469m, or $1.34 per diluted share in the same period last year and ahead of the $1.56 expected by analysts, leaving shares up 0.7 per cent to $62.95.Northrop completed the spin-off of its shipbuilding unit Huntington Ingalls Industries in the quarter, which helped earnings due to the $1.4bn received by Northrop as a result of the move.“This was a very productive quarter. We completed the shipbuilding spin-off and our newly aligned portfolio generated solid financial results,” said Wes Bush, chief executive officer and president.Sales were in line with market expectations but were down $200m to $6.7bn from the same period a year ago. Revenues were hit by the company’s reduced participation in the Nevada National Security Site joint venture and the US government’s continuing resolution funding.The Nevada National Security Site is a test site used to determine the viability of the United States’ nuclear arsenal. It is run as part of a joint venture between Northrop Grumman, Aecom, CH2M Hill and Nuclear Fuel Services.Operating margins climbed to 12 per cent from 9.8, helping to offset the decline in sales. The group also announced a $4bn share repurchasing programme.“Northrop had a respectable quarter with margin improvements on lower revenues,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets, adding that the stock was trading a forward price to earnings ratio of around 8.9 times, which is below the average multiple of 9.2 times for the sector.Cash provided by continuing operations in the quarter totalled $112m compared with $452m in the first quarter of 2010.New business awards for the 2011 first quarter totalled $5.3bn, bringing total backlog to $43.7bn as of March 31, 2011. Total backlog also included a $1.7bn reduction due to the reduced participation in the Nevada National Security Site joint venture.
112;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-03-15T22:16:00Z;Northrop nears spin-off of shipbuilding arm;;Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor, moved a step closer on Tuesday to spinning off its shipbuilding unit after the board approved the transaction and set a deadline of the end of the month to complete the deal.Stockholders will receive one share in the new company, Huntington Ingalls Industries, for every six Northrop shares they own. The standalone company could have an enterprise value of about $2.5bn, according to Barclays.Northrop faces concerns about the deal from its main customer, the US Navy. The service said it was still reviewing the spin-off.Admiral Gary Roughead, chief of naval operations, earlier this month said he wanted to be sure that the “financial foundations” of the new entity were solid in order to minimise any risk that it might not be able to deliver on contracts.“I need stability in shipbuilding,” he said. “We are a very fragile industrial base when it comes to shipbuilding and so how [the spin-off] plays out is of paramount importance.”The Navy has no formal oversight but its influence as the main buyer is considerable.To fund the spin-off, and a $1.4bn payment to Northrop to cover outstanding inter-company loans and the loss of future earnings, Huntington has taken on about $1.9bn of debt.Analysts at Barclays estimate that Huntington’s equity could be worth between $800m and $1bn, but they note that the company has no publicly traded shipbuilding peers, which could hurt valuations.Northrop began to explore strategic alternatives for its shipbuilding unit last July, following a strategic review by Wes Bush – who took over as chief executive at the start of 2010 – in which he decided to dispose of less profitable businesses.Without the yards, Northrop will look much more like its rival, Lockheed Martin. It will generate much of its $28bn revenues from aerospace programmes, such as the F-35 fighter jet, and the rest from electronics, information systems and intelligence work.Northrop shares, which have climbed about 13 per cent in the past six months and outperformed the rest of the industry for much of the past year, slipped about 1 per cent to $65.87 in midday trading.As a standalone shipbuilder Huntington will have $6.7bn of sales and a backlog of $17.3bn. The unit is the sole supplier of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers to the Navy, including the USS George HW Bush, the last of the big Nimitz-class ships, and one of only two US makers of submarines.But Huntington faces considerable challenges. The unit is closing its yard in Avondale, Louisiana, due to poor performance and a lack of future work, and the Navy’s shipbuilding budget is under pressure.
113;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-03-06T19:44:53Z;Defence: A question of scale;Pentagon spending is under rare scrutiny – but substantial cuts would have a wide impact;"High above the Pacific en route to Beijing in January, Robert Gates let slip he was travelling to China bearing gifts – not for the country’s rulers, with whom he soon squared off, but for US commanders in the region.Mr Gates’ staff soon fleshed out details of the plans – a new nuclear-capable bomber able to reach east Asia from the US, modernised radar for the F-15 fighter jet, a launch vehicle for sending satellites into space, and seaborne drone aircraft – aimed at countering China’s own military advances.All this – in parallel with $185bn to modernise America’s nuclear weapons systems over 10 years, increased spending on missile defence and more investments tailored for Afghanistan – forms part of President Barack Obama’s defence spending plans.Over the past decade, grand US defence budgets have faced little opposition, passed by Congress as part of the price for global leadership and the prosecution of the war on terror. But with Washington in a fever over the country’s record budget deficit and weary of foreign wars, Pentagon spending is now causing deep fissures across the political spectrum.Prominent conservatives, long a bastion of support for military spending, have joined forces in recent weeks with left-leaning opponents to back cuts to the Pentagon budget and even voted to cancel entire programmes. The war against the Taliban is gradually being framed by its opponents as a fiscal issue.So vast is the Pentagon’s budget – one in five government dollars goes on defence – that the impact of any cuts will reverberate around the world, influencing everything from a possible pull-out of US troops from Europe to the response to China’s rise and whether to invest in 20th-century equipment such as aircraft carriers or 21st-century cyberwar technology.More profoundly, the debate over the military is a symbol of the evolving new world order, in which US power is enfeebled at home by deficits and checked abroad by rising rivals. Two decades after historian Paul Kennedy coined the phrase “imperial overstretch” to describe a superpower committed beyond its means, the theory is fast approaching reality.“In 2000, we were responsible for one-third of the global economy and one-third of defence spending. Now, we have a quarter of global GDP [gross domestic product] and 46 per cent of defence spending,” says Loren Thompson, of the Lexington Institute, a Washington think-tank.US defence spending has almost doubled since the attacks of September 11 2001 and the invasions of Afgh-anistan then Iraq – even as the budget deficit rose under President George W. Bush then soared in the wake of the financial crisis. The Pentagon is seeking $540bn in the still-unresolved budget for the current fiscal year, in addition to $159bn on the two wars and the $7bn being spent by the Department of Energy on nuclear weapons.The Pentagon’s spending on health alone, which rose from $19bn in 2001 to a budgeted $53bn for 2012, amounts to the sixth-largest military budget in the world, just behind Russia and ahead of Germany. But rather than take on the system, Mr Obama has entrenched it, spending more on defence than Mr Bush did.The president has cast his decisions in terms of the nation’s safety – not least by boosting US troops to Afghanistan to 100,000. But many see domestic politics at work, as Mr Obama seeks to rebut criticism that he is soft on defence. The result, in the eyes of many policymakers, is a national security apparatus that favours military solutions over diplomacy – exactly the “military-industrial complex” decried by Dwight Eisenhower when president 50 years ago. “The country’s posture is gridlocked,” says Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser. “It’s like this great ship where the captain can only change course by one degree.”Mr Gates warns deep cuts would be “calamitous”. Others argue that they simply reflect a new economic reality and the constraints under which the US now operates. To keep the government running, the US has to borrow 40 cents in every dollar it spends.Mr Gates depicts past defence cuts, such as those overseen by the Bill Clinton administration in the 1990s, as mistakes that had to be rectified at great cost. A 10 per cent cut in defence would save $50bn compared with a federal budget shortfall of $1,645bn, meaning “you haven’t gotten very far toward dealing with the deficit”, he told the House armed services committee last month.…Mr Gates has tried to get ahead of the budget axe by ordering the Pentagon’s bureaucracy to find $100bn of efficiencies to invest in forces in the field. After prodding by the White House, he also agreed to cut planned spending by a further $78bn over five years, which would mean the Pentagon budget levelling off in 2015 and 2016. But that is as far as he wants to go.“With the exception of the late 1990s and the early 2000s, at 18.9 per cent, it is the lowest level of federal percentage of outlays since before world war two,” he says of the defence budget. “We still live in a very dangerous and often unstable world. We shrink from our global security responsibilities at our peril.”Indeed, many of his future savings are predicated on reductions in the size of the army in 2015, a decision the Pentagon will revisit if circumstances – notably in Afghanistan – dictate.But the debate is starting to leave defenders of the military budget behind. The fiscal crisis, and a large dose of war-weariness seeping through the system, is changing the calculus in Washington. “It is simply not credible to describe a reduction of even perhaps $23bn from the 2011 defence budget as the end of the world – it is about 3 per cent of the department’s resources last year,” says Gordon Adams, of the American University in Washington.Any conservative who questioned defence spending might once have been labelled unpatriotic. But efforts by some Republicans to quarantine the Pentagon from budget cuts have been swept aside by the party’s increasingly ascendant fiscal hawks. “I think it is now a settled issue on the right. The defence budget should be on the table, as should the entire budget,” says Grover Norquist, of Americans for Tax Reform. “There was an effort by a couple of people to say that that shouldn’t be the case but with hundreds of billions of dollars being spent, that’s just silly to say.”Thomas Donnelly, of the American Enterprise Institute, a strong supporter of defence spending, points to the new Republican-controlled House of Representatives as a big factor, with scores of new members having little exposure to national security issues. “I think the landscape is pretty clear – that in the budget, defence is just going to be treated as first among equals,” he said. “It may be nothing more than a new generation coming to grips with reality. But the fact that American strength and power require constant investment is not deeply appreciated.”Part of the culture shock for members of Congress is the inscrutability of the Pentagon’s accounts. In spite – or perhaps because – of the scale of its budget, the Pentagon does not file fully audited financial statements. Senators such as John McCain complain bitterly about the lack of competition for big defence contracts.Contractor fraud remains a big concern; an internal January report revealed that $270bn in contracts had been awarded over three years to 91 companies involved in civil fraud cases. James Amos, commandant of the US Marine Corps, says the focus on the Iraq war created a “culture of plenty”, which he is trying to overcome by getting back to his service’s “frugal roots”. Gen Amos says: “You needed something, you got it, you didn’t have to sit around and barter and say: ‘What’s more important, A or B?’ …For the last six years we’ve been able to get A and B.”Like most efforts to reduce budgets, cutting the Pentagon’s domestic and global footprint is a lot easier said than done. Mr Gates, for example said this year that “it is clear we have excess force structure in Europe”. Yet he himself halted a 2005 decision by Donald Rumsfeld, his predecessor, to bring home two of the four US brigade combat teams in Europe, which each number about 4,000 troops. Washington is now looking at the decision again and officials say one likely outcome is to withdraw just one brigade – because of the importance of reassuring European allies of American commitment – and that nothing will happen before 2015.…Numerous officials as well as outside experts say the US needs to increase its presence in Asia, to balance China’s growing influence, after 10 years in which resources were diverted to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. That was the conclusion of a commission headed last year by Steve Hadley, former national security adviser, and William Perry, a former defence secretary, which also called for a larger air force and navy.They argue that such steps are necessary because of cuts that brought the number of naval ships down from 570 in 1990 to 266 today and that they need to be financed by cutting personnel costs and, if necessary, more spending. “The problem isn’t spending on areas like defence; it’s entitlements,” says Mr Hadley, arguing that the key to getting the ballooning deficit under control is reforming bigger-ticket items such as Social Security and Medicare, the federal retirement and health schemes.All the same, those are arguments that are unlikely to satisfy the new Republicans, nor perhaps those Democrats who have always been wary of big increases in defence spending. In January, Republican members of the House of Representatives united with Democrats to vote down $450m in 2011 spending for a second engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, even though it was supported by John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House.Opponents including Mr Gates had been trying to kill the second engine programme for a decade. But powerful members of Congress on both sides of the aisle had kept it alive, to protect jobs in their constituencies.For the first time in more than a decade, the language of defence cuts – rather than just “savings” – is being spoken in Washington. After a decade of war, even Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, regularly says that America’s biggest national security challenge is its national debt.Some longtime observers of the Pentagon and its far-flung web of valuable interests, however, are sceptical that lessons have been learnt from the costly military build-up of the last decade. “The US is the opposite of the Balkans,” says the Lexington Institute’s Mr Thompson. “No one remembers anything.”……………………………………….Industry implicationsDefence contractors blatten down the hatches and survive the worstWhen the Pentagon said in January that it would cut $78bn from its five-year budget plan and cancelled a series of procurement projects as part of a separate $100bn efficiency drive, for defence contractors the news came as something of a relief, writes Jeremy Lemer.On the day, defence stocks rallied as much as 3 per cent, against a slight decline in the broader market. Since the start of the year, shares in Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, the sector’s big three, have climbed 5-16 per cent.The reaction reflects the poor investor sentiment that had surrounded defence groups, which compete for about $400bn of the Pentagon’s $700bn-plus annual budget. Shareholders were preparing for the worst. Over the past two years, the stocks have slid amid concerns that US military spending is set to decline as the “war on terror” winds down and the war on deficits ramps up.Relative to prospective earnings, the hit has been even harder, with defence companies trading at levels not seen since the 1990s, when the Pentagon slashed spending by more than 30 per cent in the wake of the cold war.Publicly, defence contractors have taken heart from assurances by Robert Gates, defence secretary, that internal efficiency measures and better prioritisation can free up enough cash to keep raising investment on crucial equipment. High-profile casualties, such as a $15bn “swimming tank” designed by General Dynamics for use by the marine corps in taking enemy beaches, have been offset in part by extra money for other areas such as unmanned aerial vehicles.Still, the industry outlook remains uncertain at best. Analysts note that the government’s long-term spending plans have usually been far too optimistic, and that the various reform initiatives could put pressure on contractors’ margins. At the same time, companies complain that the lack of an official 2011 defence budget – due to the fight about how to reduce the deficit – is delaying projects and hurting their businesses.Contractors have found themselves in the unfamiliar position of cutting costs and shrinking their business. Lockheed has reduced executive headcount and BAE Systems, the UK defence company, has shed thousands of workers. Northrop is spinning off its shipbuilding unit.Dave Melcher, president of ITT’s defence unit, says that his company has been preparing for more than a year. It has cut costs, diversified into non-military federal work and faster-growing niches, and expanded its services business.Mr Melcher notes that instability in the Middle East and security threats elsewhere will limit Congress’s ability to make big cuts. But even so, he expects ITT’s defence revenues will decline by about 2 per cent this year from some $5.9bn in 2010."
114;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Boeing beats EADS to $35bn US tanker prize;;Boeing has clinched a fiercely contested contract to supply the US Air Force with refuelling aircraft, beating rival EADS, the European aerospace and defence company, to win the $35bn prize.The victory caps a decade of false starts, political controversy and international intrigue over which of the two dominant global aerospace companies would eventually build a new fleet of “flying petrol stations” for the US military.For Boeing, the win marks an unlikely reversal of fortunes. In 2004, a deal to rent tankers from the US company fell apart following a procurement scandal and in 2008, it lost out to a team from Northrop Grumman-EADS team but was able to contest the decision.On Thursday, the Pentagon said Boeing was the “clear winner” in the contest and awarded it a $3.5bn development contract to deliver the first 18 tankers by 2017. The move effectively guarantees it the right to build a total of at least 179 aircraft worth $35bn. Follow-on orders could bring the total contract value to more than $100bn.“We’re honoured to be given the opportunity to build the Air Force’s next tanker,” said Jim McNerney, chief executive of Boeing, in a statement that emphasised the 50,000 US jobs the award would support.But the saga is not over. In the past, European officials have complained loudly about US protectionism with regard to the tanker contest and are likely to pressurise the government to revisit the decision.EADS remains part-owned by Spanish and French governments and by proxies for the German government and politicians there have taken a close interest in the programme.EADS refused to rule out the possibility that it might protest the award, saying that it was disappointed and concerned by the decision to select Boeing’s “high-risk, concept aircraft” and looked forward to discussing the move with the Air Force.But just last week, Ralph Crosby, chairman of EADS North America, said it would only challenge an award if the Pentagon had made an “egregious error” in the selection.Overturning the contract could prove difficult. Pentagon officials reduced the bid criteria to 372 mandatory requirements plus modest adjustments for things like life-cycle fuel costs to make it “protest proof”.The deal undercuts EADS’s long cherished ambitions to penetrate the US defence market and establish a US dollar-based manufacturing footprint that would allow it to mitigate the currency fluctuations that have crimped its profits.William Lynn, deputy secretary of defence, said that the “clear and transparent” procurement process offered little “grounds for protest” adding that starting on the much needed replacement programme for the ageing fleet of tankers was “long overdue”.Dennis Muilenburg, head of Boeing’s defence unit, stressed that the air force had awarded his company the contract based on affordability, taking into consideration “total life cycle costs”.Mr Muilenburg noted that 70 per cent of programme costs were incurred in the operational phase. Particularly important, he said, was fuel burn, which the air force considered over 40 years, rather than the 25-year cycle in the original specifications.

115;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-02-23T01:19:03Z;Lockheed sells Pacific Architects and Engineers;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence contractor by sales, has agreed to sell its Pacific Architects and Engineers unit to Lindsay Goldberg, the private equity group, for an undisclosed sum.In a statement, Lockheed said that the deal was expected to close in the second quarter of 2011, subject to certain conditions, and added that it would not have a material effect on the company.Late in 2010, Reuters reported that Lockheed was looking to sell PAE for about $500m and that a number of private equity groups and engineering services companies were interested.Lockheed put the unit up for sale in June alongside its Enterprise Integration Group as part of efforts to streamline its portfolio and remove concerns about conflicts of interest between defence companies that sell products and consulting services to the military.EIG, which provides engineering consulting services to the Pentagon, was sold Veritas Capital for $815m in October while a deal for PAE, which provides peacekeeping, infrastructure support and other services, has taken longer to complete.Lockheed bought PAE in 2006 for about $700m and until recently had high hopes for the business, noting early in 2010 that, thanks in part to the unit, it was well positioned to take advantage of the growing interest in “soft power”.But over the summer the company said that its plans for PAE had not worked out and that rather than providing access to lucrative IT and systems integration contracts, customers had wanted Lockheed to combine construction work and physical security services.In the last year or so, a number of defence contractors have begun to reshape their businesses as the US military has come under pressure to cut its spending by politicians concerned about the federal deficit.Last year, Northrop Grumman announced that it would sell or spin off its shipbuilding business while other companies have looked to acquisitions to bulk up faster growing areas of the budget such cybersecurity.At the same time, contractors have started to cut costs in order to protect their profit margins. Lockheed has undertaken a number of efficiency exercises announcing an extensive voluntary redundancy programme for executives in September.In after hours trading, Lockheed shares were flat at about $80.20. Since the start of the year the stock has rallied about 15 per cent. Lockheed’s leading products include the F-35 fighter jet and the C-130 transport aircraft.
116;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-02-09T23:24:26Z;Pentagon will not support big defence mergers;;The Pentagon will not support mergers between the largest US defense contractors and will carefully examine any divestments that create “weaker standalone” companies, as the industry adjusts to a new era of flat spending, according to the top procurement official.Speaking at an investor conference in New York on Wednesday, Ashton Carter, under-secretary of defence for acquisition, outlined the Pentagon’s approach to a broadly anticipated wave of deals.The policy sets the department of defence on a very different course from the one it charted in the 1990s when its budget fell after the cold war ended. Back then, the secretary of defense urged the industry to consolidate at a dinner, known as “the last supper”, leading to a rush of mergers.While Mr Carter acknowledged the parallels and that defense spending is again under pressure, he said things were different this time and that preserving competition remained a priority for the department and the Obama administration.The DoD he said, was “not likely to support further consolidation of our principal weapons system prime contractors” and would carefully scrutinize all deals to make sure that they were in the long-term interests of the “taxpayer and warfighter”.Still, Mr Carter emphasized that the Pentagon both expected, and welcomed, smaller deals and would for the most part “rely on normal market forces to make the most efficient adjustments to the defense industrial base.”Mr Carter also took aim at portfolio restructuring by major contractors in what appeared to be a sideswipe at Northrop Grumman, the contractor which on Wednesday confirmed that it was moving ahead with plans to spin off its shipbuilding business.In cases where spin-offs might lead to “weaker standalone firms less likely to thrive without the necessary capital structure that their larger parent company is able to provide”, the Pentagon would demand particular transparency, he said.In 2010 Northrop said that it would divest its shipbuilding unit, built up through a series of acquisitions earlier in the decade, after concluding that it no longer fit with its core businesses, building planes and electronic systems.The company has already registered a “spinco” under the name Huntington Ingalls Industries, with the stock ticker, HII, although discussions with the Navy continue and a final move requires board approval.On Wednesday Northrop reported fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations of $376m, or $1.27 a share, compared with $413m, or $1.31 a share, in 2009. Sales slipped 3 per cent to $8.6bn and Northrop said revenues would be flat in 2011, excluding shipbuilding.Over the last two years the Pentagon has grappled with the prospect of flattening and possibly declining budgets as politicians look to rein in the federal deficit, cancelling a number of programmes and developing a $100bn efficiency drive.For their part, defence companies have been bracing for slower revenue growth and further contract delays – an environment that analysts see as likely to spur deal making. Acquisition activity picked up in 2010 and Fitch, the ratings agency, expects more deals and more portfolio reshaping in 2011.
117;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2011-02-08T00:35:34Z;US Congress warned over defence bill delays;;Manufacturing jobs are being threatened and the defence industry disrupted by Congress’s failure to pass a comprehensive defence spending bill, senior executives have warned.The warning, in a letter from more than a dozen defence industry executives, comes only weeks after Robert Gates, US defence secretary, warned that his department faced a “crisis” over funding, with a shortfall of more than $20bn that could “hollow out” the military.The Pentagon is unable to start fresh defence projects or increase production rates on old programmes because of Congress’s reluctance to approve the defence appropriations budget proposed by Barack Obama, US president.Instead, the defence department has been operating under a resolution which capped funding at last year’s levels, leaving a wide gap between the $548bn or so the Pentagon has budgeted for and the $530bn it is able to spend.In the letter, 14 industry leaders, including the chief executives of Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, threw their weight behind Mr Gates, urging Congress to pass an omnibus national security appropriations bill.“Failure to address funding decisions for individual national security programmes on a full-year basis will lead to programme dislocations, funding interruptions and adverse consequences on US employment . . . for many years to come,” they said.The letter was sent to John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, as well as Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the Senate, and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House minority leader.In a companion letter, sent last week, a handful of industry associations wrote that a failure to pass a proper bill would lead to “a series of costly schedule delays” that would increase overall costs and “could adversely affect our war fighters”.Defence companies are walking a tight line. Cutting the defence budget, which makes up about a fifth of federal spending, has steadily moved up the political agenda as both parties have sought to trim the deficit.The Pentagon laid out plans for a $100bn efficiency drive last year and supplemented them with proposals in January to cut acquisition spending, troop levels and departmental head office costs by $78bn over the next five fiscal years.While the cuts have provoked debate, Mr Gates and his supporters have made a strong case for an orderly approach to the funding debate.
118;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-12-09T20:22:18Z;Premier Inn and Costa concerns hit Whitbread;;Whitbread slipped back from a three-year high on Thursday even as the London market crept higher.Shares in Whitbread were down 2.4 per cent to £17.67 ahead of a trading statement next week. The update is expected to show slowing growth at its Premier Inn and Costa businesses because of tougher year-on-year comparatives.A downgrade from HSBC also encouraged profit-taking in Whitbread shares.HSBC argued that Premier Inns’ recent growth has been driven by promotions, and the next challenge will be to raise prices. However, even assuming a 1 per cent price rise in the next 12 months, the broker did not see enough potential upside to retain its “overweight” rating.Financial stocks underpinned the wider market, with the FTSE 100 edging higher by 0.2 per cent, or 13.43 points, to 5,807.96. Barclays, a recent underperformer, bounced 4.5 per cent to 276p and Royal Bank of Scotland was up 3.3 per cent to 42¼p.But Standard Chartered dropped 3.6 per cent to £18.10 after a pre-close trading update from the bank disappointed on weaker revenues and rising costs. Smith & Nephew weakened to profit-taking, having been lifted by a revival of takeover speculation over the previous two days.“Given antitrust, financing and strategic issues, potential acquirers of Smith & Nephew are not obvious,” said MF Global, which downgraded the stock to “sell”. MF also argued that consensus forecasts for S&N are too high as, with sales growth remaining weak, future cost savings will need to be reinvested.Cobham was the day’s loudest takeover rumour, with shares rallying 3.7 per cent to 203½p following their relegation from the Footsie earlier this week. Northrop Grumman was suggested among the potential bidders for the defence engineer, whose shares have dropped by about 20 per cent this year.Icap, the interdealer broker, rose 0.4 per cent to 524p even after news that 10 banks were working on a competing trading platform for foreign exchange. Spot currency trading currently provides about a 10th of Icap’s earnings, though any loss of market share is unlikely to be too significant, analysts said.BG Group gained 3.6 per cent to £13.33 after giving an update on the cost of drilling pre-salt fields in the Santos Basin offshore in Brazil.RBS said the guidance confirmed that “cash flow break-even levels for BG’s current crop of projects in the pre-salt will be low, despite their frontier, deepwater character”.Vague takeover rumours helped the mid-cap oil stocks, with Cnooc and Petronas once again rumoured to be taking an interest in the sector. Premier Oil edged higher by 0.4 per cent to £19.19, while Heritage Oil was up 4.1 per cent to 427p.Ashtead led the mid-cap risers, up 10 per cent to 158p, after its interim earnings beat expectations.Mothercare took on 5.1 per cent to 627½p on the back of an analyst visit to India, where the retailer set out a target of £1bn international sales by 2014.Numis Securities said Mothercare’s international operations could represent two-thirds of the group within three years, providing earnings per share of 54p.That would put the stock on 11 times earnings, which “is far too low given the quality of the operations and visibility of the forward growth story”, it said.Other retailers retreated after HMV reported poor trading in recent weeks. Debenhams was down 3.9 per cent to 71p and WH Smith declined by 2.1 per cent to 505p.Kesa Electricals, recently the subject of stake building by an activist investor, dropped 4.5 per cent to 162p after Wednesday’s results led SocGen to downgrade to “sell”. Dealers also blamed a programme trade for the steepness of the decline.Chemical makers were under pressure after DuPont tempered earnings guidance for 2011, with Croda slipping 2.8 per cent to £15.07.Colt Group was weaker by 2 per cent to 126¼p after a downgrade to “equal weight” from house broker Morgan Stanley, which cited disappointing cash flow generation.There was heavy trading in Nyota Minerals, up 16.9 per cent to 26p, following a positive update from its Tulu Kapi gold project in Ethiopia. “This is a significant discovery as it is a strong indication that the Tulu is part of a large magmatic gold bearing system and therefore offers potential for further discoveries and expansion,” the company said.HMV dropped 16.6 per cent to 36½p as analysts cut forecasts sharply in the wake of disappointing half-year results, which showed there had been no pick-up in trading since the beginning of September. “We are reducing our 2010-11 pre-tax profit from £65.8m to £55m, taking earnings per share down from 11.5p to 9.6p,” said Seymour Pierce.Encore Oil eased 0.8 per cent to 126½p even though the North Sea exploration company confirmed the Transocean Galaxy II drilling rig had left Dundee for four exploration targets.Cenkos Securities added 9.2 per cent to 107p after an overhang was cleared at a premium. The stockbroker said founder Andy Stewart had sold nearly 8m shares at 107½p.Aurum Mining, unchanged at 3p, was in focus as traders noted that David Williams, the businessman who launched Marwyn Capital Investors, had amassed a 19.4 per cent stake in the shell company.Blinkx, the video search engine spun out of Autonomy, rose 9.4 per cent to 87¼p following the successful flotation of Youku, a Chinese online broadcaster. Youku has jumped 169 per cent on its market debut.Syndicate Asset Management eased 1.8 per cent to 1.7p even after a block of 90m shares, about 5 per cent of the company, changed hands at 2p, a significant premium to the prevailing share price.Air Partner, one of the few listed aircraft charter brokers in the world, added 1 per cent to 434¼p after a trading update and news that property investor WS Yeates had taken a holding of 3 per cent.
119;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-10-21T15:45:16Z;Arabic’s intricasies prove a boon for Sakhr Software;;With its varied dialects, unwritten vowels and little punctuation, Arabic is a tough language to learn, and even harder to master, yet demand for Arabic translators continues to rise across the world.This has proved a boon to Sakhr Software, a small, privately owned language software specialist in Kuwait. Its “natural language processing” technology, which surmounts some of the idiosyncrasies of Arabic, has allowed it to develop a suite of software and hardware translation applications.“Our technology helps bring down language barriers,” says Fahad Al Sharekh, Sakhr’s chief executive since 2005.Yet even Sakhr’s niche industry has felt the effects of the financial crisis. Revenues fell by almost 60 per cent to $7.5m last year, and net profits shrank by more than two-thirds to $3.5m, making it one of the worst years in the company’s history. “Pretty much all the regional demand is from the public sector, not the private sector, and IT wasn’t a priority for the Gulf governments when the crisis hit,” Mr Sharekh says.Most of Sakhr’s revenues are still generated in the Middle East, but the Gulf slowdown has spurred the company to expand more aggressively into the US. “The US market is a challenge, but we see big potential for growth,” Mr Sharekh says. “We had to do it at some point, and we chose 2009 to be the take-off point. As the economy recovered and demand emerged, we wanted to be ready.”Sakhr’s customers already include the World Bank, the US departments of defence, homeland security and justice, and defence contractors such as Northrop Grumman and Raytheon.To broaden its product offering, the company bought Dial Directions, a Silicon Valley start-up that specialises in mobile voice applications, in mid-2009 for an undisclosed sum. Dial Directions primarily allows users to speak travel enquiries into their phone and receive directions by text, but its technology has allowed Sakhr to develop a real-time voice translation service for mobile devices.Arabic Language Buddy, Sakhr’s speech translation application for BlackBerrys and iPhones, has now been downloaded more than 70,000 times, mostly by Arabic language students in the US.Sakhr also wants to diversify its US client base into the business sector, targeting companies that wish to operate in its domestic region. “Given the Middle East’s current and expected future economic growth rate, Sakhr represents an ideal catalyst for corporate America’s expansion in the region,” Mr Sharekh says.Growth in the US and a tentative rebound in IT projects in the Gulf have ensured that revenues and profits in the first half of 2010 already outpaced the company’s full-year results in 2009, he says.The company says it has no debts on its books, and funds its expansion through profits, but is open to selling a stake to industrial or financial investors. Previous talks with private equity funds stalled when the crisis hit, but could now be reopened.“We are more interested in added value capital, since we are cash-flow positive,” Mr Sharekh says. “We would be interested to see growth for the company inorganically along with a strategic or financial ‘smart’ capital.”
120;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Winners and losers emerge in defence cuts;;As defence companies digest this week’s UK military budget cuts, winners and losers are beginning to materialise.Those active in cyber security and in supplying special forces equipment such as communications devices are expected to fare better than those who rely on making equipment for the handful of large programmes that are being scaled down significantly.Though this will benefit UK companies such as BAE’s Detica, Ultra Electronics and Cobham, it will also provide new opportunities for foreign companies. One example is Northrop Grumman, which has 30 years’ experience in cyber security in the US and will on Friday open the UK’s only sophisticated cyber ‘test range’ outside that of GCHQ.Ironically, many of the big UK military programmes that had been under threat but were saved will benefit big foreign companies. EADS, for example, is the lead partner in AirTanker, which will supply the UK with up to 14 aircraft capable of refuelling jet fighters in mid-air and transporting troops. The company also makes the A400M transport aircraft, which, together with the C-17, its bigger rival manufactured by Boeing of the US, was also spared.In terms of land-based vehicles, while the UK is cutting the number of its heavy tanks, maintained by BAE, it is going ahead with the Scout reconnaissance vehicles and, further down the line, the Fres, delighting General Dynamics of the US.But, like many other defence companies, General Dynamics is still far from reassured about the volumes the Ministry of Defence will now acquire, especially given the double whammy of financial constraints and general cutbacks in the sizes of all three of its military services.One of the biggest concerns is over how many Joint Strike Fighters the UK will now order given the change in the configuration of its carriers. Lockheed Martin, BAE, Pratt & Whitney and smaller providers are keenly awaiting better clarity.Meanwhile, surprisingly little has been said in the review about cost savings the MoD could make by outsourcing some of its work. So sure was Peter Rogers, chief executive of UK-based Babcock International, about the prospect of outsourcing that even before the review he predicted he would have to hire more staff and that the whole exercise would be a net positive for his company. Serco is also widely expected to benefit from outsourcing, while formerly government-owned Qinetiq is seen as one of the bigger losers, especially after having to make a £37m writedown because of the cancellation of a big training programme.“The overall challenge is a very big one. There is still a lot of significant detail to work through, not least, where precisely will the manpower reduction come from?” says Tony Poulter, partner at PwC.But clarity is expected to take months to materialise.“There’ll be continued uncertainty at least until the defence industrial strategy review in early 2011, given that the SDSR did not specify by how much it would be cutting some programmes, such as the JSF, or explain to what extent it would be renegotiating contracts and changing the way it will agree new ones,” said Jeremy Bragg, analyst at Citi.Executives fear that just cutting the numbers of MoD procurement staff, without a complete revamp, would further slow the process, rather than fix it.
121;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Lockheed to sell advisory unit for $815m;;"Lockheed Martin has agreed to sell a division that advises governments on purchasing military hardware as the company responds to new US laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest between contractors and consultancy units.The world’s largest defence company by revenues said the Enterprise Integration Group unit had been bought for $815m in cash by Veritas Capital, a New York-based private equity company specialising in defence and government service investments.Lockheed put the unit up for sale in June in the wake of
Pentagon rules passed in 2009 as part of the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act, a move to shake up the way the US purchases major weapons systems.The sale also forms part of a wider effort to reshuffle the company to cope with what Bob Stevens, Lockheed’s chief executive, has called the “new reality” facing defence companies – a cash-strapped but increasingly demanding US customer.In June, Lockheed also said that by the end of the year it would sell its Pacific Architects and Engineers unit, bought in 2006 for $700m, which builds military bases and provides training. Other defence companies have been confronting similar challenges. Last November, Northrop Grumman agreed to sell TASC, its advisory services division, for about $1.7bn to a group including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.Since then, the company has said it will sell or spin off its shipbuilding division. Northrop argues the $6.2bn division has never produced the expected synergies with its electronics units but analysts point out that naval spending is under pressure due to spiralling costs.Lockheed has disclosed few details about the EIG unit but Veritas said the business has about 1,800 employees and generated $626m of revenues in the twelve months ended June 30, 2010. The deal is subject to regulatory review.For Veritas the acquisition marks a foray into familiar territory. The group has a long track record in the defence and government services sectors including its sale of DynCorp International to Cerberus Capital Management in April for $1.5bn.Rob Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said that defence companies could turn to acquisitions as they seek to outgrow the defence budget. He estimated they could raise $60bn for deals if they took on more debt. But big deals are hard to find for companies such as Lockheed, which had revenues of $45.2bn in 2009.Lockheed shares were up about 1 per cent to $71.18 in afetrnoon trading. They are down about 6 per cent over the year to date on fears that US military spending could fall substantially."
122;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-10-12T19:28:18Z;Defence M&A;Too big to combine, maybe it’s time to split up;"Forget being lean and mean; for two decades the defence industry has championed size when it comes to building killing machines. To handle multibillion-dollar programmes, contractors merged and acquired their way to greater stature: 16 years ago, the main bits of today’s five largest US defence suppliers were owned by 30 different companies. The problem, as growth in US defence spending finally moderates, is what to do next.Big purchases are out. For a start, few options large enough to make a difference remain. Boeing could perhaps buy Northrop Grumman, leapfrogging Lockheed Martin to become the largest contractor with a combined $66bn in annual defence revenues. But even if antitrust issues could be overcome, it would be hard to generate the cost savings to justify a takeover premium (say about $800m annually for a 30 per cent premium) and both Boeing and Northrop already have the scale they require. Cross-border ownership issues make the UK’s BAE Systems an unlikely target.Furthermore, greater consolidation is unlikely to be favoured by a Pentagon already trying to tackle a bloated contracting system. In most competitive bidding situations there already tends to be one company that clearly has the best capabilities, making aggressive pricing unlikely. Diversification also seems an unlikely route for an industry that has largely proved unsuccessful at selling to the private sector.An alternative is to shrink. Northrop already intends to sell its shipbuilding assets, and Lockheed has two small services businesses on the block. The latter in particular appear vulnerable as Robert Gates, secretary of defence, looks for back-office savings to fund operational spending. Ditching low-returning businesses and ploughing the cash back to shareholders might also start to rehabilitate a sector trading on historically low multiples.

123;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-09-28T23:21:09Z;Defence industry braced for mauling on home front;;As ministers hammer out the role the armed forces should play over the coming decades, executives of defence contractors are bracing for deep spending cuts they believe will reshape the UK’s sizeable defence industry.BAE Systems, the UK and Europe’s largest defence contractor, Babcock, one of the armed services’ biggest providers of training, refitting and decommissioning, and QinetiQ, the formerly state-owned defence technology group, are the three UK companies likely to bear the brunt of the cuts due to be announced by the end of October.From the aircraft carrier orders that may be dropped, through the fate of the submarine fleet, to the fighter jets being curtailed, BAE is involved in almost every area at risk of falling under the government’s austerity axe.The company has already had to make tough decisions. This month, BAE cut 740 jobs at its UK-based Military Air Solutions on top of the 3,300 jobs it has already shed this year.But investors have grown jittery. BAE trades at a 25 per cent discount to US rivals, such as Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, which are less exposed to the UK. Two years ago, that discount was only 5 per cent.Several analysts say shareholders have over­reacted because they have failed to acknowledge how “un-British” BAE has become since its merger with Marconi Electronic Systems in 1999.The UK accounts for less than 30 per cent of BAE’s revenue, with the largest individual programme, the Typhoon fighter aircraft, making up 7 per cent, notes Roger Johnston, an analyst at Edison Investment Research. “BAE is an important part of the UK defence industry but there is much more to BAE than UK defence,” he says.BAE is not alone in having shrunk its UK footprint by moving to the US, the world’s largest defence market, and more recently to fast-developing countries such as Brazil and India.UK-based Cobham derives only 9 per cent of its revenue from Britain compared with 60 per cent from the US. India and the Middle East, are its next growth markets, but Andy Stevens, Cobham’s chief executive, is already looking further east.Within two months of taking the reins at Cobham, Mr Stevens took his executive team to Singapore to meet government and university officials. “There is life beyond Europe and the US,” he said. “They got excited, I can assure you.”Diversification also stands UK-based Rolls-Royce, the manufacturer of engines for civil and military aircraft, in good stead. The company gleans less than 5 per cent of its overall revenue from the UK.In contrast, 80 per cent of Babcock’s revenues come from the UK, and like BAE, it is active in many of the areas under threat from government cuts. For example, it owns the Rosyth dockyard in Fife, Scotland, where BAE is building the aircraft carriers that could be cut.But there is a silver lining for Babcock. If the government decides to save money by further outsourcing activities such as training, procurement and managing bases, the company is well positioned to win new business, according to analysts.QinetiQ, meanwhile, on Tuesday issued a trading update in which it warned investors: “The outlook remains extremely uncertain particularly against the backdrop of the UK’s Strategic Defence and Security Review.”Behind BAE, Babcock and QinetiQ is a long tail of smaller companies that supply the defence industry.In total, there are more small UK companies contributing to defence than there are in all of Spain, Germany, France and Italy combined. They contribute to an industry that employs more than 300,000 people in the UK, almost 20 per cent of whose work is exported.ADS, the industry trade group, calculates that one in every 10 of those jobs would be at risk if the UK military was forced to cut 16 per cent of its equipment budget.Many of the jobs to be lost would come from smaller, less diversified companies, or from those businesses whose balance sheets are not able to withstand cuts and contract delays.For Richard Martin, the chairman of Kembrey Wiring Systems, whose 210 employees in Swindon manufacture the electronics used in civil and defence aircraft and other vehicles, the biggest threat comes from the indecision and delays that often accompany big changes in government spending.Mr Martin says putting together teams and developing equipment only to hear the contract is delayed is a cost most small companies can ill-afford.It is the collective capability of the engineers working for smaller companies and those from which big companies are willing to source from overseas, that defence executives say the government must consider when it makes its cuts.As Ian King, BAE’s chief executive, warns: “You cannot take capability holidays and then say we will come back to it.”
124;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-09-13T07:06:50Z;BAE prepares to streamline US business;;BAE Systems, Europe’s biggest defence contractor, has confirmed it plans to sell parts of its US commercial businesses in a house-cleaning sale that could yield as much as $2bn (£1.3bn).“The company regularly reviews its portfolio to ensure it is delivering the best value for shareholders and customers,” BAE said in a statement on Monday.The sale comes as BAE and its competitors look to rationalise their businesses as they prepare to deal with the consequences of defence budget cuts in the UK coupled with Washington’s drive to slow military spending as the administration aims to save $100bn over the next five years.BAE last week announced it was shedding almost 1,000 jobs, mainly in its UK military aircraft division. The news followed job cut announcements by Boeing and Lockheed Martin of the US.People close to the BAE sale said the two units up for grabs included the company’s business that sells aircraft engine controls for General Electric and one that builds hybrid propulsion systems for vehicles, such as buses and lorries.Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase are BAE’s advisers on the deal, but declined to comment.Commercial aerospace companies, as well as private equity groups, are thought to be the most likely potential buyers.In the US, BAE has grown by acquisition, increasing its position in the world’s largest defence market and one that is seen as more robust than that of the UK and some other European countries.But even in the US, the defence budget is coming under pressure and BAE is competing to redeploy funds into areas considered likely to prove government priorities and therefore offer higher growth.In May, BAE acquired Atlantic Marine, a privately-held vessel maintenance, repair, overhaul and conversion company, for $352m in cash. The deal “demonstrates that defence acquisitions can continue to be made at sensible multiples,” analysts at JP Morgan said in a recent note. “Current interest rates make most acquisitions accretive relative to holding cash in the bank,” they added.BAE has increasingly moved into the support and security business and away from merely supplying the big platforms, such as aircraft and ships. Support now accounts for almost half of BAE’s revenue. Ian King, BAE’s chief executive, has said the company would continue to move in that direction.Even before the news of the sale of some of its US units, analysts estimated BAE had the scope to undertake £1bn-£2bn of further acquisitions.In recent months, Northrop Grumman has said it may sell or spin off its naval shipbuilding business, while Lockheed Martin has put two of its units on the market.Many companies have sought to boost their capabilities in communications, cyber and intelligence, which they believe will continue to be well funded areas by governments and others potential customers.Boeing in June beat competition from rivals, including Raytheon and BAE itself, agreeing to buy ArgonST for $775m.US government rules related to perceived conflicts of interest within big defence companies have also helped motivate some sales.
125;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-08-10T22:10:48Z;Profile: Sean O’Keefe of EADS;;Sean O’Keefe, the chief executive of EADS North America who survived a plane crash in Alaska on Monday night, joined the company in November.The European aerospace and defence group that owns aircraft maker Airbus hired the US government veteran to replace Ralph Crosby as EADS was competing against Boeing for a contract to replace the US Air Force’s ageing fleet of air-refuelling tankers.Speaking after Northrop Grumman, its long time partner, finally pulled out of the multi-billion dollar competition, Mr O’Keefe sought to put a brave face on the setback amid expectations the company would have to scale back its US activities.Coworkers credited him for ultimately driving through the company’s surprising solo bid for the tanker contract.Mr O’Keefe, 54, has spent much of his career in public service, working as acting Secretary of the Navy, as the defence comptroller and in a variety of management and accounting roles, but his most prominent position was as the tenth Nasa administrator.When Mr O’Keefe took the job in 2001 it was supposed to be a “bean-counting” position focused on controlling the agency’s finances after almost $5bn of overruns on the International Space Station programme.But his tenure was overtaken by a tragedy that rocked the space agency. On February 1, 2003, just 14 months after taking the helm, the Columbia shuttle blew up during re-entry into Earths atmosphere, killing all seven crew members.Struggling to hold back tears, Mr O’Keefe told the press that “this is indeed a tragic day for the Nasa family, for the families of the astronauts,” adding that it was “likewise, tragic for the nation.”A report later criticised Nasa for its lax safety controls and placed some blame on Mr O’Keefe, noting that the tough deadlines he imposed had encouraged staff to cut corners and delay fixes to foam insulation that eventually caused the Columbia disaster.When resigned at the end of 2004 to pursue a more lucrative job as Chancellor of Louisiana State University, many praised Mr O’Keefe for raising morale at NASA but others concluded that the work of rebuilding the agency and stabilising its finances was only partially complete.Mr O’Keefe’s decision to suspend shuttle missions to repair the aging Hubble telescope, one of Nasa’s most successful ventures, also prompted criticism. Mr O’Keefe’s successor eventually restored the missions.Mr O’Keefe graduated from Wheeler High School in North Stonington, Connecticut in 1973 and received his Bachelor of Arts from Loyola University in New Orleans in 1977 and his Master of Public Administration from the Maxwell School of Syracuse University in 1978.He started his career in public service that same year when he was selected as a Presidential Management Intern. Later he served on the Senate Committee on Appropriations staff for eight years where he was close to Senator Ted Stevens, who died in the plane crash on Monday night.From 1989 he served as Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer of the Department of Defense and in 1992 he became the 69th Secretary of the Navy, appointed by President George H. W. Bush.His appointment came in the wake of another disaster - the Tailhook sexual harassment scandal in which dozens of naval officers verbally and physically molested women at an aviatiors’ convention.“We get it,” Mr O’Keefe said at the time, acknowledging that the Navy had to remove outdated attitudes towards women. He won plaudits for imposing tough punishments, forcing retirements and increasing the authority of investigators.Between 1993 and 1996 Mr O’Keefe was professor of business administration at the Pennsylvania State University. From 1996 to 2001 he was a professor at the Syracuse University.In 2008, he left academia for the private sector, joining General Electric as a vice president in its Washington operations. A year later, he became chief executive of EADS North America, part of the European aerospace and defence conglomerate.
126;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-07-27T15:28:33Z;Lockheed reports rise in profits;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor by revenues, on Tuesday reported second-quarter results that beat analysts’ earnings estimates but fell slightly short of forecasts for revenues.In recent months, defence stocks have slumped on fears that the growing fiscal deficit in the US will force the government to sharply cut defence spending, and efforts to reform the Department of Defense will cut into contractor margins.In response, Lockheed executives have attempted to prepare the company, and its shareholders, for what Bob Stevens, chief executive, has described as the “new reality of escalating demands and increasing constraints on resources”.Last month the company said it would sell two of its non-core business units and reorganise two others in an effort to reshape its portfolio to prepare for tougher contracting rules and tighter defence budgets.Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer, said the company had received dozens of expressions of interest from private equity and strategic buyers but was now looking at spinning off rather than selling one of the units for tax reasons.Lockheed said it would hold on to Enterprise Integration Group, which offers systems engineering services to the US defence department, until “we either conclude that a sale is probable or close a spin-off transaction”.In the three months to the end of June, net profits rose to $825m, from $724 in the same period in 2009. Earnings per share from continuing operations climbed to $2.22, up from $1.88 in 2009, thanks to about $782m of share buy backs.Sales rose 3 per cent to $11.4bn but analysts were expecting earnings per share of about $1.78 on sales of about $11.5bn.The company’s backlog of work fell to $72.8bn from $77.5bn in the same period in 2009 but Mr Tanner said that was largely because of the timing of certain contract awards and forecast that the backlog would be up to about $78bn by the end of the year.Beneath the headline numbers the results were mixed. At Lockheed’s key aeronautics unit operating profits fell 7 per cent to $372m as it received fewer favourable performance awards on legacy programmes such as the F-22 fighter jet after a strong year in 2009.Mr Tanner said that contract negotiations for the fourth production lot of the F-35 fighter jet, which is the DoD’s largest ever procurement project and Lockheed’s biggest programme, were also taking longer than expected.In an effort to head off concerns about escalating costs and poor performance, Lockheed has agreed to a fixed price contract for the batch of aircraft, but Mr Tanner noted that this had added “complexity” to the negotiating process.Lockheed’s outlook for the year remained essentially unchanged although the headline revenue forecast dipped by about $750m to take into account the planned sale of Pacific Architects and Engineers, a defence and infrastructure services company.For the full year, Lockheed expects sales of $46.3bn-$47.3bn and earnings per share of $7.15-$7.35, slightly higher than previously forecast on the back of more extensive share repurchases than originally planned.Lockheed shares, which have fallen 13 per cent in the past three months, were unchanged in early trading. General Dynamics, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman all report later in the week.
127;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-07-20T19:19:27Z;Northrop gets ready to deliver performance;;Northrop Grumman’s shipbuilding operations could have a viable future as a standalone business, according to Wes Bush, the company’s new chief executive.Mr Bush surprised the defence industry earlier this month when he announced that Northrop, which together with General Dynamics, dominates the shipbuilding market for the US Navy, was exploring “strategic alternatives” for the business.He said the company would “conduct a process where both financial buyers and strategic buyers will be considered”.“It is a substantial business with $6bn in annual sales. There are quite a few defence names in our industry that are smaller than that,” he told the Financial Times at the Farnborough Air Show.The decision to reconsider the company’s investment in shipbuilding is the latest high-profile move by Mr Bush since he took over as chief executive of the defence contractor in January.He has already announced that the company’s headquarters is moving from Los Angeles to Washington, DC – closer to the Pentagon, and pulled out of the contest to supply refuelling tankers to the US Air Force. The moves have been widely seen by industry watchers as a sign that Mr Bush is looking to reinvigorate the company and focus on shareholder returns over revenue growth.Earlier this year, he laid out an ambitious plan to increase margins across all of its business units this year. According to Mr Bush, these moves are simply the next steps in the evolution of the defence group.Northrop was built up through acquisitions by Kent Kresa, he notes, and Ron Sugar (who Mr Bush succeeded) then went on to integrate those purchases. The next step for the company, he said, was to “really drive performance”.For shareholders, he said, increased performance would translate into “improved profitability” as well as “decreased volatility”.“Over the last set of years we have had a set of programme charges that reflected [that volatility].”For government customers, meanwhile, driving performance would translate into “programme performance”, which is key in the current environment where budgets are tighter and affordability is critical.Given the flattening budgets, he said, companies would have to respond and address their cost structures.The decision to consider alternatives for the shipbuilding business has been driven by “what we see to be the demand”.With demand for new ships from the government slowing, there is simply too much capacity around. Would he find a buyer for it given the market pressures? He insisted it was a good business with “a very long transparency in terms of the order book”.Northrop’s other four areas of focus – aerospace, electronics, information systems and technical services – all “work together intimately, exchange ideas” and are able to create value that way. Shipbuilding is not a part of that, he said.The US government has already warned that the “gusher” of military spending has been turned off. Against this backdrop, like most of his peers, Mr Bush is targeting key growth areas.He expects future growth will come from intelligence and security, cybersecurity, unmanned systems (the company makes the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle) and logistics.Northrop will look at potential acquisitions in those areas, although, “We feel pretty good about the portfolio … We don’t feel we have a strategic gap that we have to address.”
128;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Tankers: Battle for US contract enters final phase;;Take the train, turn on the TV or tune in the radio in Washington DC these days and the chances are you will come across ads from Boeing and Airbus crowing about the virtues of their military aircraft.More precisely, you will see them shouting about their competitor.“Get Real” reads the headline of one of the ads by EADS, Airbus’ parent company, making a jibe that Boeing’s proposed aircraft has yet to emerge from the design stages.“Obviously the facts got lost in translation” a Boeing campaign fires back, noting “Not one A330 tanker has ever been delivered to any customer anywhere” and arguing the Airbus will largely be built in Europe – implicitly at the cost of US jobs.The outsized claims and dubious counterclaims indicate that a decade of effort to replace the US Air Force’s ageing fleet of air-to-air refuelling tankers is entering its final phase.On July 9, the teams submitted final bids, joined by a last-minute entry from Antonov, the Ukrainian aircraft maker, and a US partner, and will undergo question and answer sessions before the contract is awarded.“The bid is the primary way for companies to communicate with the customer, but the broader ad campaigns ensure that if you do win, people understand why you won and, if you don’t win, people wonder why you did not,” says one industry insider.For Airbus, the contract is a chance to achieve a long sought-after strategic goal of building a big presence in the largest defence market in the world and a base for commercial sales.For Boeing, the tanker deal is a lucrative contract (follow-on purchases could bring the total value of the project to more than $100bn) that would give its military business substantial workflow at when other programmes are being cut.But the rhetoric has raised concerns. “European contractors will certainly be watching the contest with great interest, especially because a number of members of Congress have attempted to turn this into a protectionist issue,” says one analyst.In May, Boeing sent out cards to Congressmen portraying EADS as a potential national security threat because it is not subject to some US laws and because it might withhold spares, should European governments disagree with US policy.In Congress, Boeing’s supporters have been blunt. Todd Tiahrt, a Republican congressman from Kansas, where the company has a significant presence, said recently it was “outrageous” to consider outsourcing jobs when the US unemployment rate was so high.“We need an American tanker built by an American company with American workers,” said Mr Tiahrt after passing an amendment that attempted to force the Pentagon to penalise EADS for the subsidies it has received over several decades.“If you expect to be welcome because you are competing with Boeing in the US, forget it,” Louis Gallois, EADS chief executive, said this year.EADS has more fundamental challenges than political rhetoric. This year, its long-time team mate, Northrop Grumman, withdrew from the contest, saying it was too risky and the team had little chance of winning.Undercut by its partner, the EADS bid looked dead, but the company regrouped and launched an unexpected solo offer, securing the necessary permissions from the US Department of Defense to act as a prime contractor and signing up partners. The move turned the contest on its head, forcing EADS to ditch its long standing complaint that it would be unable to compete with Boeing because the rules emphasise price – favouring its rival’s smaller so less costly aircraft.Making a virtue of a vice, EADS quickly found a new argument, suggesting it would be able to win – in part because it would no longer have to pay a margin to Northrop to act as the prime contractor.Then too, Ralph Crosby, chairman of the board of EADS North America, argues that EADS will benefit from the fact that its tanker, unlike Boeing’s, is almost identical to one already in production. “Our risk is small because our development is advanced,” he said recently, meaning that the company could offer a lower price compared with Boeing, which “hasn’t fully defined its airplane, let alone started to build it” – something Boeing disputes.It says that it has delivered more than 2,000 767-based tankers over the last 60 years.Still, Scott Hamilton, an independent aviation consultant who has followed the contest closely, says the bid is a “long shot” – although EADS might be able to compete on the basic bid price, its bigger aircraft uses a lot of fuel, so increasing its total lifecycle costs.However, some point out that winning the contract could potentially be as problematic as losing, because it is a fixed price – placing all the risk of overruns on the contractor.
129;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-07-14T20:47:07Z;Weak retail sales data leave Wall St flat;;US stocks closed mostly flat on Wednesday after a six-day winning streak, in spite of a relatively strong start to the earnings season, as a report showed that retail sales had fallen more than expected last month.Headline retail sales fell 0.5 per as car sales dropped 2.3 per cent, the second consecutive month of declines. However, core retail sales, which exclude petrol, building materials and cars, increased by 0.2 per cent, the first gain since March.There has been a steady decline in bullish sentiment on the sell-side, said John Horcher, director of sell-side sales at First Coverage, a research group that tracks market sentiment. “We are seeing the sell-side get a little more scared of the market as it’s been rising recently. Sentiment is trending downward.”After a choppy morning, the S&P 500 closed flat at 1,095.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also flat, at 10,366.72, while the Nasdaq Composite had risen 0.4 per cent to 2,249.84.Yum Brands, a fast-food chain operator that owns Taco Bell among others, was 1.2 per cent lower at $41 following the release of its second-quarter results after the market’s close on Tuesday.The company said it expected to earn $2.43 per share this year, below the average analyst estimate of $2.48.However, its earnings for the past quarter beat expectations, coming in at 58 cents per share compared with the average estimate of 54 cents.Intel added 1.7 per cent to $21.36 after reporting the best quarter in its history. Its corporate customers increased information technology spending, boosting hopes that businesses are engaged in a long-awaited “refresh” of both hardware and software in the aftermath of the financial crisis.Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices fell 1.1 per cent to $7.44.But the disappointing retail sales data weighed on retailers. Department store chain JC Penney fell 0.9 per cent to $22.99, rival Dillard’s was down 1.3 per cent at $22.11 and Macy’s dropped 0.5 per cent to $18.38.However, a number of thrift stores inched upward. Dollar Tree added 1 per cent to $42.06, Family Dollar Stores was up 1.5 per cent to $37.08 and Dollar General advanced 1.9 per cent to $28.23.Homebuilders were among the day’s laggards as the sector was downgraded from “attractive” to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs, who cited a lack of immediate catalysts to boost the stocks’ performance. A rise in new home sales last month was smaller than the analysts at the brokerage had expected.Lennar Corp led the sector lower as it dropped 4.3 per cent to $14.59. Pulte was down 3 per cent at $8.54, Toll Brothers fell 2.3 per cent to $17.16 and DR Horton dropped 0.9 per cent to $10.34.Annaly Capital Management announced a common stock offering of 60m shares, sending its shares down 4.1 per cent to $17.52. The mortgage real estate investment trust said it expected gross proceeds of $1.1bn from the offering.RadioShack, a consumer electronics goods retailer, was one of the session’s worst performers, as it fell 5.5 per cent to $21.17, on reports that an ongoing “soft” auction for its sale had seen a fall in interest from potential buyers.Northrop Grumman, a global security company, rallied 3.1 per cent to $56.99 after it said it was considering a possible sale or spin-off of its ship unit, in a deal that could be worth as much as $4.5bn.Caterpillar inched down 0.1 per cent to $66.70 even as estimates for its second-quarter and full-year earnings were revised upwards at RBC Capital Markets, citing evidence suggesting better than expected end-markets. The broker sees earnings per share in the quarter of 85 cents, up from its prior estimate of 72 cents. Caterpillar will report its second-quarter earnings on July 22 before the open.JPMorgan Chase lost 0.3 per cent to $40.35 a day before its second-quarter earnings release. Analysts’ average earnings per share estimate is 71 cents per share.Marriott International, due to report earnings on Wednesday after the market’s close, rose 0.9 per cent to $32.16. Analysts on average expect earnings per share of 29 cents from the hotels group.
130;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-07-14T20:08:33Z;Austerity cruises on to Farnborough’s radar;;Captains of industry, military top brass and government ministers will this weekend gather for the biennial jamboree that is the UK’s Farnborough air show.This year, however, one big name is missing from the usual line-up of executives: Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed Martin. The world’s biggest defence company is sending about half as many people as usual to the show in recognition of what Mr Stevens has described as “a new reality” facing contractors.That reality is one of sluggish economies, tighter defence budgets and governments demanding more value for money.In the US, the world’s biggest single defence market, the Pentagon is looking for $100bn of savings from personnel and procurement over the next five years. In the UK, Europe’s largest market, the government is in the midst of a review that is examining cuts to its capital budget of up to 20 per cent.Companies have already seen lucrative equipment programmes cut: last year Robert Gates, US defence secretary, cancelled 30 programmes. Investors have responded, selling their shares and sending company valuations down.“It is obvious the defence budget has plateaued,” said Heidi Wood, aerospace and defence analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. “The consensus on Wall Street is that defence won’t provide attractive returns. However, while defence valuations have fallen and the plateauing has been priced in, the question is, is it a value trap? The industry group as a whole is cheap but could it get cheaper – there is no obvious catalyst for an upturn.”Executives insist that things have been worse, noting that today’s downturn is different from the 1990s when defence spending dropped sharply after the cold war ended.This time round, argues Mark Newman, chief executive of DRS Technologies, a defence electronics company owned by Italy’s Finmeccanica, global security threats remain and the military has a pressing need to replace worn-out kit.“The Department of Defense’s first focus is in managing overheads as opposed to cutting programmes indiscriminately. First, they are trying to become more austere within the department and second they have gone to industry and asked them to become more competitive,” he said.Contractors, however, know they need to adjust. Operationally, most have reduced workforces. Northrop Grumman, the US Navy’s largest shipbuilder, this week announced it is consolidating its Gulf Coast facilities and exploring strategic alternatives for its shipbuilding business.“The consolidation will reduce future costs, increase efficiency, and address shipbuilding overcapacity,” said Wes Bush, Northrop chief executive.In terms of new business, contractors are focusing on winning exports to emerging markets with rising spending. They are also moving into adjacent areas such as cybersecurity.Finmeccanica is targeting Brazil, Libya, Algeria and the Middle East as near-term targets in areas including helicopters, security and transport.Ian King, chief executive of BAE Systems, Europe’s largest defence contractor, said this week that increased exports of aircraft such as the Eurofighter Typhoon would help offset the slowdown in spending in the UK. BAE also plans to increase its support and services revenues which are characterised by multiyear contracts.At Lockheed, despite Mr Stevens’ absence from Farnborough, executives expect it will fare well under most scenarios thanks to its involvement in key programmes such as the F-35 fighter jet.Bob Trice, senior vice-president of corporate strategy, said last month that Lockheed is “going to be OK …We just want to make sure that we don’t compromise the bottom line by doing anything silly.”That means focusing on executing existing contracts to time and budget, and avoiding the ill-judged adventures in the commercial arena that many companies pursued in previous years.Acquisitions are also on the agenda as organic growth slows and companies look to deploy large cash piles. According to Jane’s, the defence analyst, a total of 64 deals were announced between January 1 and June 1, an 18 per cent upswing compared with the same period last year.Some even predict the time is right for more radical action. Denis Bovin, co-chairman and co-chief executive of Stone Key Partners, the advisory investment bank, earlier this year said the environment was ripe for a large contractor to go private.With very few new programmes for companies to bid on, the industry would “haemorrhage cash over the next two to four years”, he said.“If they are restrained from doing mergers and acquisitions of size, then there’s only a limit to the amount of stock or debt that they can buy back. And the question is, where does that capital go?” he said at a forum by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
131;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-07-08T20:47:54Z;EADS offers solo US tanker bid;;EADS, the European aerospace and defence group, on Thursday submitted a solo bid to supply refuelling tankers to the US Air Force, throwing down the gauntlet to US rival Boeing.“We’re proud of our offering, which is the only one in this competition that is flying and refuelling the full array of receiver aircraft,” said Ralph Crosby, EADS North America chairman, adding that “we are confident in the superior capabilities” of its tanker.To underscore that confidence, EADS said that it was moving its 150 strong programme team to Mobile, Alabama where it plans to build the tankers, in order to be ready to work on the contact should it win.The submission concludes a remarkable turnround for EADS which was rocked in March when its long time partner, Northrop Grumman pulled out of the contest arguing the team could not win because the rules favoured Boeing’s smaller aircraft.Boeing is expected to submit an offer by Friday, the closing date for bids in the long-running contest.Still EADS, and its airpcraft manufacturing subsidiary Airbus, suffered a setback after the World Trade Organisation delayed its initial findings on a European Union challenge to the US over aircraft subsidies.EADS had hoped that the report would counterbalance criticism from US Congressional leaders who have argued that years of state subsidies for EADS have allowed it to undercut Boeing on price in the tanker contest.The trade panel had been expected to issue its confidential interim report on an EU countersuit over US aid to Boeing on July 16, two weeks after the WTO ruled that Airbus had received illegal aid from European governments.Airbus responded with dismay. Tom Enders, Airbus president and chief executive said he was “surprised and disappointed”.The tanker bids potentially open the final chapter in what has been a bitter and protracted process to replace the USAF’s aging fleet of “flying petrol stations”, as the tankers are sometimes known.In 2004, Boeing was awarded a $20bn contract to supply the tankers, but that contract was rescinded after an ethics scandal which led to jail time for a leading Boeing executive.The competition was re-tendered and unexpectedly won by Northrop-EADS in 2008, only for Boeing to successfully protest by raising concerns about US protectionism. One more bid process also fell to pieces at the early stages, before the current round.EADS described its bid as volumnious. The teams are required to submit six sets of documents, and EADS said each set had over 8,000 pages and weighs about 100 pounds.For the companies involved the stakes are high. The contract could be worth up to $50bn to supply an initial 179 refuelling tankers. Follow on deals could bring the total contract value to more than $100bn.Moreover strategic considerations add to the deals significance. EADS has long desired a manufacturing foothold in the world’s largest defense market, while Boeing is eager to retain a prestigious contract and keep out a major rival.In submitting its final bid, EADS on Thursday revealed a list of its key suppliers for the first time. They include GE, Rockwell Collins and Honeywell.Earlier in the year, leading executives had said they were reluctant to identify their partners for fear that they would be subject to undue political pressures – an indication of the heightened sensitivities involved.Indeed, in recent weeks the rhetoric from both sides has heated up considerably, with the companies running advertising campaigns in Washington DC and key congressional districts in the hope of winning political support for their bids.Despite professing respect for the government officials responsible for chosing the winning bidder, both sides have emphasised the flaws of their opponents models above the virtues of their own aircraft.EADS is offering a modified version of its A330 aircraft while Boeing is set to offer a version of its 767.Department of defense officials will now subject the two parties to detailed question and answer sessions and consultations before awarding the contract some time in the autumn, possibly on November 12.
132;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-06-09T21:42:17Z;US defence chief seeks ‘fair’ tanker contest;;Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, on Tuesday expressed his “disappointment” at Congressmen attempting to “discourage” European-led bids for the $40bn Pentagon air refuelling tanker contract, in a sign of frustrations over protectionist pressures from Capitol Hill.In a forthright rebuke to those warning US companies against working with EADS, the European aerospace and defence group, Mr Gates stressed the Pentagon wants a “fair and open” competition, adding that “frankly efforts to discourage participants in the competition do not help us”.“I was very disappointed to hear some of the comments that were made,” he told reporters in London.Mr Gates’s statement will be seen as directed at Norm Dicks, chair of the House of Representatives subcommittee that controls the defence budget, who has urged US companies not to team up with EADS against Boeing, whose main assembly plants are in his home state of Washington.“If they ask me, I am surely going to tell them what I think about it. I would hope that they wouldn’t” partner with EADS, Mr Dicks said in April.His comments were recently cited as a reason by Louis Gallois, EADS chief executive, for keeping secret the identity of a new US partner.“We are not giving the name because we don’t want to put them under pressure,” Mr Gallois told reporters in London earlier this month, adding that the decision to name an earlier potential US partner which then withdrew had probably been “a mistake”.EADS had been talking to L-3 Communications, a leading US defence contractor, but the company decided “it didn’t want to work with us”, Mr Gallois said.“We perhaps made a mistake to announce L-3. Putting it on the radar screen was not very good. This time we prefer to be more quiet.“You read what Norm Dicks said. It’s public. He said, ‘I hope that US suppliers will not go with EADS.’ I think it’s a kind of pressure.”The protracted contest between EADS and US rival Boeing for the contract to supply refuelling aircraft tankers to the US air force has become more heated ahead of a deadline for final bids next month.EADS and US group Northrop Grumman won an earlier contest to supply refuelling tankers in 2008, but the Pentagon scrapped the contract after complaints from Boeing were upheld.Northrop Grumman withdrew from a second contest in March this year, claiming the rules were rigged in favour of Boeing.EADS is now making a solo bid but needs a US supplier for sensitive technical equipment.
133;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-06-03T02:07:30Z;UK and France in talks on air tanker cost;;The UK is in talks with France to share the cost of a multibillion-pound deal to provide refuelling tankers for the Royal Air Force in the most tangible sign yet of closer defence co-operation between the nations.Under the proposal, the UK would offload some of the 14 tankers it is buying to France, the head of Europe’s largest aerospace and defence group said on Wednesday.Louis Gallois, chief executive of EADS, the lead company in the consortium providing the aircraft, said there is “contact with France” which is looking to renew its own tanker fleet.“We understand they are discussing this,” he said, noting that a deal could help the UK cut the cost of leasing the aircraft under the current private finance initiative.The much-delayed £10.5bn ($15bn) programme to provide tankers has come under fire for being too expensive. Under the 27-year PFI contract, the AirTanker consortium will lease the aircraft, specifically Airbus A330-200s, to the Ministry of Defence.Mr Gallois declined to give details but one option could be for the UK to take fewer aircraft, with France leasing the balance. Another could be for the two countries to have a combined tanker fleet.The MoD said: “The MoD maintains regular dialogue with Nato allies, including France, on a variety of defence issues. All options to enhance value for money will be considered as part of the strategic defence and security review.”Separately, Mr Gallois said EADS would keep secret the identity of a new US partner for the upcoming US tanker competition because political pressure could force the unknown company to pull out.“We are not giving the name because we don’t want to put them under pressure,” he said.The protracted contest between EADS and Boeing of the US for the $40bn contract to supply tankers to the US Air Force has become more heated ahead of a July deadline to submit final bids. Influential Boeing backers in Congress, such as Norm Dicks, chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee that controls the defence budget, urged US companies not to team up with EADS against Boeing, whose main assembly plants are based in his home state of Washington.EADS and Northrop Grumman of the US won a 2008 contest but the Pentagon scrapped the contract after complaints from Boeing were upheld. Northrop Grumman withdrew from a second contest in March this year, saying it was rigged in Boeing’s favour.EADS is now making a solo bid but still needs a US supplier for sensitive technical equipment on the aircraft, and had been talking to L-3 Communications.

He said, ‘I hope that US suppliers will not go with EADS.’ I think it’s a kind of pressure.”Mr Gallois said he was confident EADS could win the tanker contract, and Boeing’s “nervousness” was evidence that it knew how strong EADS’s position was.“If you expect to be welcome because you are competing with Boeing in the US, forget it,” he said.
135;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-05-28T05:49:59Z;US Congress deals blow to EADS over tankers;;The US House of Representatives on Thursday night adopted a measure to force the Pentagon to consider the role of illegal subsidies in the multibillion-dollar contest between Boeing and EADS to sell refuelling aircraft to the US Air Force.The decision deals a potential blow to EADS, the European aerospace and defence conglomerate. A recent decision by the World Trade Organisation in a dispute over large aircraft found that the European company had received subsidies.Under the congressional measure, the Pentagon may have to adjust EADS’s bid to account for any funds it received in violation of trade treaties, which could give its rival Boeing an edge in the competition.However, the measure must pass several other steps, including reconciliation with a companion defence bill in the Senate, before it becomes law.The defence department has strenuously resisted efforts to insert international trade disputes into its procurement process, noting that under trade rules it was not allowed to penalise EADS for receiving alleged subsidies.The amendment will further politicise an already fraught acquisition process that has dragged on for a decade, gone through three iterations and been marred by international political spats and serial accusations about US protectionism.In 2008, EADS and Northrop Grumman, its US partner, won a competition to supply an initial 179 tankers, but the Pentagon cancelled the contract after complaints by Boeing were upheld. The decision led to criticism from European politicians.Then in March this year, Northrop Grumman withdrew from the contest after claiming that the rules were rigged in favour of Boeing. European politicians again criticised US authorities. The Pentagon eventually extended a key deadline allowing EADS to launch a solo bid.The amendment was sponsored by a number of US congressmen from states where Boeing has a strong presence, including Kansas and Washington. It passed by 410-8 votes after EADS supporters secured last-minute changes that would allow the Pentagon to consider a parallel case proceeding at the WTO in which the US and Boeing are accused of using illegal subsidies.Jo Bonner, a Republican from Alabama, where EADS plans to build a factory if it wins the contest, said that the amendment now applied in an “even-handed way to both competitors.”Todd Tiahrt, a Republican congressman from Kansas, said it was “outrageous to even consider outsourcing thousands of jobs to a foreign company” when the unemployment rate was close to 10 per cent.“We need an American tanker built by an American company with American workers,” said Mr Tiahrt.Boeing said it was “entirely appropriate” that Congress take steps to “prevent the US defence industrial base from suffering the same fate as the commercial aircraft industry, where illegal subsidies have contributed to the loss of tens of thousands of US aerospace jobs.”EADS said it believed that the Pentagon “should be allowed to run the fair and open competition to which it is committed. We leave it to the department to comment on the extent to which this or any legislation impacts that objective.”Separately on Thursday night, another European defence contractor, Rolls Royce, received some mixed news from Congress.Politicians voted to continue to fund a second engine for the F-35 fighter jet that is made by Rolls and General Electric. But the Senate armed services committee left the programme out of its version of the 2011 defence spending bill.Robert Gates, US defence secretary, has repeatedly tried to cut the programme as part of an effort to restrain spending on weapons systems, only for Congress to include the funding in defence spending bills.
136;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
137;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-04-27T18:28:27Z;BAE aims to expand US ship repair operations;;BAE Systems has stepped up plans to expand its ship repair operations in the US and recently held talks to buy Atlantic Marine, a business owned by JF Lehman, the private equity group.A deal, which could be worth between $200m and $400m, would add Atlantic Marine’s four shipyards along the US Gulf coast and east coast to BAE’s operations.Europe’s largest defence contractor is the US’s leading provider of non-nuclear ship repair, conversion and overhaul for government and commercial customers. It has made no secret of its aim to expand operations.BAE’s interest in Atlantic Marine goes back several years. It is understood to have been among potential buyers two years ago when JF Lehman unsuccessfully conducted a formal sales process.Industry sources familiar with the situation said that although there was no formal process under way, BAE had held discussions with JF Lehman but that price remained an issue.However, an agreement could still happen. BAE has ample headroom for bolt-on acquisitions. It ended 2009 with net cash of £403m ($615m) and although it has launched a £500m share buy-back, its business is very cash-generative.Jim McAleese, a defence consultant, said ship repair was a growth area in the US as operations placed greater strain on ships and the navy took on new roles such as missile defence.At the same time the navy is set to shrink in size in line with a more moderate procurement programme set out by a cost-conscious Pentagon that focuses less on expensive new ships and more on legacy designs.Large-scale naval projects such as the CG(X) next generation cruiser initiative have been cancelled in favour of legacy hulls.In recent years, BAE has won a large chunk of US Navy ship repair work. Earlier this year, it won a contract worth up to $500m to modernise 11 Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers.Some analysts believe BAE might at some point also be keen to add a shipbuilding capacity in the US.Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics currently dominate the market and there has been speculation BAE was interested in buying Northrop’s shipyards.JF Lehman, which was founded by John Lehman, a former US Navy secretary in the Reagan administration of the 1980s, bought Atlantic Marine in 2006 from a private owner in a deal said to have valued it at about $170m. JF Lehman has since completed two bolt-on acquisitions.BAE and JF Lehman both declined to comment.
138;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-04-21T19:42:04Z;EADS goes on US air tanker ride once again;It is hard to understand the aerospace group’s optimism;There seems no end to the punishment EADS is prepared to take from the US administration.Last month, the Franco-German aerospace champion pulled out – together with its US partner Northrop Grumman – from the contest to supply $50bn worth of new tanker refuelling aircraft to the US Air Force. It claimed the competition was rigged in favour of its US rival Boeing and that the Europeans had been taken for a ride by the Americans. This week EADS announced it was willing to go on the same ride all over again.So what has changed in the past few weeks to persuade the European group that its chances of winning this highly political and significant contest have now improved? On the face of it, quite a lot. After President Nicolas Sarkozy together with other leading European politicians accused the US government of rampant protectionism, President Barack Obama intervened and persuaded the Pentagon to extend the bid deadline to allow EADS to return and continue challenging Boeing.The US also indicated that the Europeans could act as prime contractor to the Department of Defense which, for a contract of this magnitude, represents something of a breakthrough for EADS. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic felt they had scored a diplomatic victory. By banging their fist on the table, the Europeans believed they had managed to make the US administration bend. Washington, for its part, was able to save face and argue it was not protectionist after all.In substance, however, little seems to have changed. For unless the US is prepared to modify the current terms of the tender – and so far there are no signs they have been revamped – the Europeans have little hope of winning the prize. EADS and its Airbus affiliate believe they have the better and bigger tanker with their modified version of the A330 that has already been chosen by Australia, the UK, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. But the problem is that it is about 35 per cent more expensive than Boeing’s smaller modified 767 that seems tailormade for the current tender.“The Americans,” as one aerospace analyst noted on Wednesday, “seem to want to buy a garden shed and not the three-storey house the Europeans are proposing.” Then there is the powerful US defence lobby rooting for Boeing. Although EADS can now act as prime contractor, it still needs US partners to strengthen its hand. Northrop is no longer interested. A few weeks ago, L-3 Communications emerged as a potential partner but its interest in joining the EADS bid has been waning of late.Other US defence groups also seem reluctant. Not surprisingly, after Democratic congressman Norm Dicks, chairman of the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, was recently quoted saying he hoped American companies would not team up with EADS. In turn, this prompted Republican senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, where EADS would assemble the new tankers, to accuse his rival politician of “political intimidation”.EADS still believes the US tanker competition offers the Europeans “a hell of an opportunity”. It is hard to see why if after spending even more money and other resources putting together a revised bid the result – barring a miracle – already appears a foregone conclusion. For it is difficult to see how EADS can match the lower price of the 767 without simply giving away the aircraft to the US Air Force. The Americans would then doubtless accuse the Europeans of dumping, while EADS’ shareholders would also question the financial rationale.Perhaps there are other good reasons to accept being taken on another American ride. It is one way for EADS to show it remains America’s friend, that it is committed to developing its presence in the US defence market, and that it may make Washington more supportive if and when it decides to make a move to acquire a US defence company.Back off SergioSergio Marchionne had his big day in Turin on Wednesday. The Fiat and Chrysler chairman outlined his long awaited strategy and made all the usual noises about the need for consolidation.Meanwhile, the PSA Peugeot-Citroën car group quietly announced a larger than expected rise in first-half sales and a significant recovery in underlying profitability. After failing to acquire GM’s European operations, Mr Marchionne recently put the pressure on PSA by suggesting the next big merger would take place in France. Unlike Fiat’s Agnelli family, the Peugeots have no wish to dilute their control.

Memory chipmakers have somehow got through the recession but because there are so many, there will not be enough water when the drought returns.On Wednesday Elpida Memory of Japan, the world’s third-largest maker of dynamic random access memory chips, said that it made a net profit of Y2bn ($21.4m) in the year to March 2010. That deserves some celebration – it is Elpida’s first profit for three years – yet it takes the grand total of Elpida’s net profits in the six years since it went public to minus Y144bn.The D-Ram chip industry is notoriously cyclical: Elpida and its rivals race to invest when demand and prices are strong, only to suffer when ever demand falls because of their high fixed costs. Yet somehow, in spite of the losses, there is always a full complement of competitors to fight the next round.This recession caused only one fatality: the German D-Ram maker Qimonda. Elpida and a number of Taiwanese D-Ram chip makers went to the brink, but thanks to government support, friendly shareholders and the curious generosity of capital markets they all survived.Now comes a short period of plenty for the D-Ram makers but in this most brutal of industries, do not expect it to last.world.view@ft.com
140;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Boeing lowers outlook for 2010;;Boeing, the world’s second biggest aircraft-maker, lowered its outlook for 2010 on Wednesday as it reported earnings for the first quarter of the year ahead of Wall Street’s expectations.The manufacturer said it would earn between $3.50 and $3.80 per share this year, reflecting a 20 cent-per-share charge for the higher costs the company expects to bear as a result of the US’s recently approved healthcare reforms.It maintained its full-year delivery guidance of 460 to 465 aircraft, saying those were all sold. Revenues would be $31bn-$32bn.Boeing said it expected revenues to increase in 2011, chiefly as a result of increased deliveries of 787 Dreamliners and 747-8 models. “Our outlook remains attractive,” said Jim McNerney, chief executive.Boeing’s net income for the first three months of the year was $519m or 70 cents per share, down from $610m or 86 cents per share in the same period last year. However, the results – which included the healthcare charge – were above most analysts’ expectations of about 66 cents per share.“The key is for Boeing to keep executing to this forecast, particularly on the 787, and enjoy the improving macro backdrop for global airlines (post-volcano),” wrote Rob Stallard at Macquarie Securities in a research note.As well as the considerable challenges for the recession-hit commercial aircraft sector, Boeing’s defence unit faces a renewed competition to replace the US Air Force’s ageing fleet of refuelling tankers, a contract that could be worth up to $50bn.Northrop Grumman pulled out of the contest last month, arguing that it was too risky and that the team had little chance of winning. However, EADS, parent company of Airbus, the world’s biggest aircraft-maker and Northrop’s erstwhile partner, said on Tuesday it would compete alone against Boeing.Referring to a confidential WTO ruling last month that Boeing said vindicated its claim that Airbus had received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies, the US company said it was “deeply concerned about the ability of a heavily subsidised Airbus/EADS to accept levels of financial risk that a commercial company such as Boeing cannot”.“We regret that these concerns will not be addressed in the bid evaluation, even when the US government has proven in a world court that those subsidies are illegal and directly distort competition between Airbus and Boeing,” the company added.Boeing shares were up by 0.5 per cent at $71.77 in pre-market trading.
141;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;EADS to make solo bid for US tanker contract;;EADS, parent company of the aircraft maker Airbus, will compete alone against Boeing for a contract to replace the US air force’s ageing fleet of refuelling tankers that could be worth up to $50bn.The European aerospace and defence conglomerate has been considering a solo bid since early March when its partner, Northrop Grumman, pulled out of the contest arguing that it was too risky and that the team had little chance of winning.At the time, European politicians attacked the US for rigging the contest to suit its domestic champion, Boeing. In response, the US department of defence offered to extend the deadline for final bids by 60 days to July 9.For DoD officials, the decision revives what had appeared to be a defunct competition and offers a welcome respite from accusations that they had mishandled the third attempt in 10 years to let the vital contract.Insiders noted that for EADS the chance to achieve a long sought-after goal of building a substantial presence in the largest defence market in the world was too tempting to leave on the table.“The US is a big market and the game is not over,” said a source close to EADS.But even putting a bid together will be challenging for EADS. Although it has numerous suppliers, such as GE, it has not yet found a US partner to undertake some of the more sensitive work that the contract requires.EADS said it was “progressing in discussions with potential US partners”, although talks with L-3 Communications, considered the most likely candidate, are understood to have cooled.At the same time it has to catch up on a series of technical briefings and data. Such detailed information was previously channelled through Northrop Grumman, the original lead contractor, rather than EADS.And winning the contest may be even harder. When Northrop walked away from the deal, its executives argued that the current rules for the tanker contest favoured Boeing’s smaller, less expensive 767-based aircraft.EADS said on Tuesday it would again offer a modified version of its A330 commercial freighter, which would be built in Mobile, Alabama. The project would “create and support tens of thousands of high-value American jobs”, it said.The contract is to supply an initial 179 tanker aircraft to the USAF. With follow-on deals, the project could be worth a total of more than $100bn.
142;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-04-07T23:34:41Z;EADS eyes US air force;;EADS, the Franco-German aerospace and defence group, is sounding out potential US suppliers as it nears a decision on whether to re-enter the multibillion-dollar competition to supply air-to-air refuelling tankers to the US air force.The company, which has been told by the Pentagon it could front a new bid, has been talking to companies including L-3 Communications, the defence electronics group, about coming on board as key suppliers. A decision on whether to go ahead could come as early as next week, according to industry sources.L-3 has expertise as a systems integrator, specialising in areas such as security and communications networks. The US group is already prime contractor on the Pentagon’s Joint Cargo Aircraft, the C-27J, where it is partnered with Italy’s Finmeccanica. L-3 on Wednesday declined to comment.EADS is in talks with the Pentagon about the details of the competition. The defence department’s decision to allow a foreign company to act as a prime contractor on the $40bn contest to replace 179 of the air force’s ageing refuelling tankers came after the Pentagon’s handling of the competition was widely criticised in Europe.EADS and Northrop Grumman, its US partner, pulled out of the contest last month claiming the rules were skewed in favour of a rival bid from Boeing of the US. The Pentagon subsequently offered an olive branch to EADS when it said it would consider it as a prime contractor – a role normally reserved for US defence companies.The department last week confirmed it would give EADS an extra 60 days to submit its tender if it agreed to bid. EADS had asked for an extra 90 days. Boeing accused EADS of trying to delay the competition and said it was reviewing its options.The European group is seriously weighing the possibility of re-entering the race. People close to the company said the offer of prime contractor status had changed the dynamics of a bid. The company would now control all aspects of the offer, from pricing to margins and the choice of suppliers, which could give it a better chance to rival Boeing’s bid.Nonetheless, a prime contractor role may not be enough to entice EADS. The company must assess that it stands a viable chance of winning the contest and that the terms and conditions do not favour Boeing’s smaller 767 aircraft over its own Airbus A330.The recent developments are the latest twists in a long-running saga to replace the air tanker fleet that began in 2001.Boeing was originally awarded the contract, until a congressional investigation found the company conspired with the US air force to inflate the deal’s value. After a re-bidding process in 2008, EADS and Northrop were awarded the contract, but the decision was declared void after the Pentagon said the competition was flawed.The contract is now expected to be awarded by the end of the year.
143;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Pentagon set to extend tanker contract deadline;;The US Department of Defence gave EADS, the European conglomerate, a chance to overcome Boeing in a contest for a $50bn air tanker contract by announcing on Wednesday a probable two-month extension to the tender.The move came a day after Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, who had previously denounced the Pentagon’s bidding process as unfair and protectionist, discussed the tanker deal with President Barack Obama in the White House.Geoff Morrell, Pentagon spokesman, said: “The defence department in-formed both EADS and Boeing that if we receive formal notification from EADS of their intention to make an offer we will extend the deadline from May 10 to July 9.”Boeing, which did not respond immediately to press enquiries, is likely to be disappointed at the move.Mr Morrell said the aircraft’s requirements and the terms of the tender would not be altered, although the Pentagon would speed up its decision-making so as to keep closely to the schedule of awarding the contract in early autumn.“There are those who have suggested that politics, both local and international, have somehow influenced this process,” he said. “Nothing could be further from the truth. We have been and continue to make decisions on this critical programme based solely on the law of the land and the needs of our war fighters.”Some officials in the Obama administration have been keen to mend ties with Washington’s traditional European allies, who have complained at US conduct over issues ranging from climate change to the president’s decision not to attend an European Union summit this year.The contest for the aerial refuelling tankers has been a sore point. EADS and Northrop Grumman, its US partner, won a tender in 2008 but the Pentagon cancelled the contract after complaints by Boeing were upheld.Northrop last month pulled out of the current bidding process, which it said favoured Boeing. EADS told the Pentagon it would need three months to put together a new bid. Gordon Brown, the UK prime minister, joined Mr Sarkozy in denouncing the tender rules.In his remarks at the White House this week, the French president said: “If you say to me that the request for proposals, the call for tenders will be free, fair and transparent, then we say EADS will bid and we trust you.”Mr Obama replied: “The process will be free and fair and the trust is justified.”
144;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-03-19T21:16:44Z;US considering new options for EADS;;Washington has offered an olive branch to Europe by indicating it will consider EADS, the Franco-German aerospace group, as a prime contractor if it decides to re-enter the multibillion-dollar competition to supply air tankers to the US air force.EADS confirmed on Friday the Pentagon had indicated it would welcome the company fronting a bid, describing it as “a significant development” which it was assessing. It cautioned that while “a positive sign” the development did not address the company’s underlying concerns that the bidding rules favour “a smaller, less capable aircraft and that the additional combat capability offered by our system may not be fully valued”.“In the end, the company will only submit a proposal if there is a fair chance to win, after evaluating all relevant factors,” it added.Nevertheless, the move by the Pentagon is significant. Defence insiders had previously deemed it impossible for a foreign company to act as prime contractor on the $50bn contest to replace 179 of the the US air force’s ageing refuelling tankers given its size and political sensitivity.Although EADS already holds prime contractor status in the US for military helicopters, fronting such a bid would represent a huge boost to the group’s ambitions to break into the US defence market. Prime contractor status – in effect the main supplier to the US government – on such a big contract could open up other large tenders that have previously been out of reach.Nonetheless, a prime contractor role may not be enough to entice EADS to re-enter the bid on its own. It will still hold out for a revision of the terms and conditions, which it believes favour Boeing’s smaller 767 aircraft over its own converted A330.Any revision would impose a delay on a tender that has already lasted several years, and so would present difficulties to the Pentagon.But US authorities are trying to find ways to respond to the anger in Europe over the terms of the competition after EADS and its US partner Northrop Grumman decided to pull out alleging that the rules had been biased in favour of Boeing.France, Germany and the UK have criticised Washington’s handling of the bid process, won by EADS and Northrop Grumman in 2008 but revoked after complaints from Boeing, and said they would discuss with European partners the possible “implications”.Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, intends to raise the issue on a visit to Washington this month.EADS executives were due on Friday to meet Pentagon officials to discuss the terms of any bid extension. “It has got to be more than just another 30 days,” said a person close to the situation.
145;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-03-18T21:56:12Z;EADS likely to scale back US strategy;;EADS, the European aerospace and defence conglomerate, is likely to have to scale back its US strategy after pulling out of a multibillion-dollar military tanker competition earlier this month, according to the chief executive.Louis Gallois said previous plans to boost revenues from its US subsidiary to about $10bn by 2020 would probably be reduced after the company reviewed the outlook in the next few months.“We want to extend our footprint in this country but it is clear that [the tanker] is not good news for this strategy,” Mr Gallois said ahead of an investor conference in New York on Thursday.At the start of March, EADS and its partner Northrop Grumman pulled out of a $50bn contest to replace the US Air Force’s fleet of ageing refuelling tankers, after concluding that it could not win the competition against US rival Boeing.The move was a blow to EADS and Mr Gallois, who had made the tanker the centrepiece of his long-term strategy to rebalance EADS from volatile civil markets towards more stable non-civil arenas such as defence and security.Although unlikely, a reprieve is still possible, as late last night the Pentagon said it would consider a “reasonable extension” to its May bid deadline, creating some room for EADS to find a new partner or prepare an independent bid.Mr Gallois noted that while the company would have to be “less ambitious”, it was still committed to growing in the US.“Perhaps we can take more time to achieve the same targets,” he said.He added that EADS would resurrect its search for US acquisitions, looking for deals worth “hundreds of millions of dollars” in the defence, security and service areas to achieve growth. “If we want to be in the US I think we have to buy companies in this country,” Mr Gallois said.In 2008, EADS considered purchasing DRS, the defence electronics company.But the board found it too expensive and DRS was eventually snapped up by Finmeccanica, the Italian industrial conglomerate, for more than $5bn.Since then EADS has largely steered clear of acquisitions, building up almost €10bn ($13.6bn) of net cash to buffer technical problems with its A400m and A380 aircraft.Mr Gallois said with those issues easing, the board was willing to make purchases.Speaking alongside Mr Gallois, Sean O’Keefe, chief executive of EADS North America, which has annual revenues of about $1.4bn, said that there was also significant room for organic growth in the US.EADS is already a substantial supplier of helicopters to the US military and plans to bid on the army’s armed helicopter programme, which could be worth up to $6bn for about 350 helicopters.At the same time Mr O’Keefe said the company would aggressively target the military aftermarket for sales and services, by offering to maintain and upgrade the EADS products currently in use with the navy, the coastguard and other units.
146;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-03-17T22:56:14Z;Space: The pull of gravity;Parlous US finances are halting manned missions;"Three elderly American heroes have been touring US military bases in Europe and Asia this month, telling inspiring tales of space adventures that took place before most people in the audience were born.But the Apollo astronauts – Neil Armstrong, Gene Cernan and Jim Lovell – were not just living on past glories. They looked at the future of manned space flight and lamented President Barack Obama’s decision last month to cancel the Constellation programme under which Nasa would have taken Americans back to the moon by 2020.“We will go back to the moon, notwithstanding our president and his outlook for the future of space,” said Mr Cernan at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The man who in 1972 was the last to walk on the lunar surface added: “Under the president’s proposed budget, it is a mission to nowhere.”The astronauts’ intervention is part of a growing backlash against the plans of Mr Obama, who argues that the US cannot afford to build the Ares rockets and Orion crew vehicle that make up Constellation and needs a nimbler development programme led by private companies. His opponents, from both political parties, say the decision jeopardises national security, prestige and commercial interests at a time when other countries are boosting their own space programmes.When Mr Obama announced the death of Constellation in his 2011 federal budget last month, after the agency had already spent $9bn (£5.9bn, €6.5bn) on it, the political and industrial reaction was initially subdued. “People were so taken aback at the scale of the changes that they were left almost speechless,” says Elliot Pulham, chief executive of the Space Foundation, an organisation representing all sectors of the space industry. “But now there is uproar.”Mr Obama did propose a $6bn increase in Nasa’s funding over five years, with a new emphasis on paying the private sector to develop spacecraft to carry people and materials into orbit. The administration says this could provide a good service to the International Space Station, which orbits 340km above the Earth, more cheaply than Constellation. Funds are to be transferred from Nasa’s in-house facilities and its traditional contractors including Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Boeing to newer space companies such as SpaceX, Orbital Science and Blue Origin.Charlie Bolden, a former astronaut recruited by Mr Obama to run Nasa, proclaimed “a bold and ambitious effort to explore new worlds, develop more innovative technologies, foster new industries and increase our understanding of the Earth, our solar system and the universe”. But Mr Pulham calls the vision “a dim, lethargic, uninspired view of the future. The administration proposes to strip Nasa of meaningful human exploration goals, and instead turn the agency into a space technology hobby shop with a charter To Boldly Go Where Ever,” he says.At a time of growing polarisation in US politics, space remains a relatively bipartisan issue. In the southern states, notably Florida, Alabama, Texas and California, where Nasa and its contractors are big employers – and high-technology status symbols – Republicans and Democrats are combining to defend their interests.Florida, the home of manned space flight, probably has most at stake, with 40,000 jobs and $2bn in private income depending on Nasa. The state’s entire congressional delegation, Democrat and Republican, has written to Mr Obama expressing concern about his proposal. “This leaves the future of US human space flight in serious doubt, and the highly skilled workforce with the prospect of a major upheaval from which it and our space programme will not have the hope of recovery for many years,” the Florida politicians say. They are expected to propose legislation that would preserve a domestic US capability to carry astronauts into orbit.Such reactions are pushing space up the White House political agenda. Next month Mr Obama will address a “space summit” in Florida, conscious that his plans for Nasa could have a significant impact on the state’s delicate political balance.As things stand, the retirement of Nasa’s Shuttle fleet at the end of September will leave Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft, based on an ultra-reliable Soviet design from the 1960s, as the only means of conveying people between Earth and the Space Station.Mr Bolden, the Nasa administrator, says a privately developed US “crew taxi” could be ready by 2016 but many regard his timescale as optimistic. In another “save Constellation” letter, sent to the president this week, the Utah congressional delegation writes: “Since private businesses have never previously developed a low Earth orbit system to transport humans to the International Space Station, one can naturally hypothesise lengthy delays and expensive cost overruns for this novel venture.”While Russia may now be a US ally – at least in space exploration – many Americans with memories of the cold war remain suspicious of the country. They worry too about the rapid progress being made by China and India in space. “There is a direct link between our national defence capabilities and our role as global leaders in space exploration,” says Rob Bishop, a Republican congressman from Utah. “Destroy one and we stand to lose our global dominance in the other.”Such comments illustrate the uncertainties about the real point of manned space flight. Its promoters have mixed motivations, some expressed more clearly than others.One is the human imperative to explore – and conquer. Just as the 19th-century American pioneers believed it was their “manifest destiny” to push west to the Pacific Ocean, Nasa was founded partly on the faith that human destiny calls us to move beyond Earth, first to the moon and then into the solar system and eventually through the galaxy.This view may be heard less in the early 21st century but is still a powerful lure for some. Linked to it is the more fashionable argument that space exploration is one of the most effective ways of inspiring young people to study and then pursue careers in science and engineering.National glory and military might were also powerful considerations from the start. They fuelled the original space race between the US and the Soviet Union; since the latter’s collapse Nasa has found it harder to command federal dollars.Then there are commercial and industrial benefits. Space is a large global industry with a worldwide turnover of $257bn, according to the Space Foundation’s 2009 Space Report. While a lot of the technology originated in manned space programmes, the commercial space industry today is based largely on building, launching and operating satellites for communications, broadcasting and Earth observation. Space tourism is unlikely to become a significant business for several years.Scientific curiosity is the final driver of the space programme. But many scientists maintain that unmanned missions offer better value for money. Martin Rees, the cosmologist who heads Britain’s Royal Society, supports Mr Obama’s decision not to send people back to the moon. “It is very important we pursue science in space,” says Lord Rees, “but the case for sending people into space is getting weaker with every advance in robotics and miniaturisation.”In the long run there is a role for people in space, Lord Rees says, but no point in going back to the moon 50 years after Apollo. “If people want to go to Mars, that should be a high-risk, low-cost adventure, not an extremely expensive Nasa-style programme.”While some scientists complain that the huge cost of manned space flight sucks funding from wider space research – pointing out for example that no probes to the outer solar system are currently under construction – industry advocates say that is the wrong way to look at the issue. They argue that the US should increase spending on all space activities, manned and unmanned.Nasa’s spending, at around $19bn a year, accounts for 0.5 per cent of the total federal budget – down from almost 5 per cent at the peak of the Apollo programme. In 1966 the government spent more on Nasa than on health and human services; this year the health and services budget will be almost 50 times greater than Nasa’s. While not even the wildest enthusiast advocates a return to expenditure on the Apollo scale, Mr Pulham argues that the US should be willing to devote 1 per cent of the budget to Nasa, as it did in the early 1990s.That would permit the agency to resume development of Constellation, while encouraging innovative private companies to enter the field.In reality, given the budgetary constraints, the Obama administration is not going to give the industry the money it wants. But the political pressure on the president may lead to some concessions when he speaks in Florida on April 15. One possibility is to keep the Shuttle fleet flying beyond September. More likely, because the main costs will lie well in the future, is a more specific and inspiring long-term destination in space than Mr Obama has offered so far. This might be Mars or one of the Martian moons.One day, Americans will probably walk again on a celestial body beyond Earth. But it is unlikely that any of the first group of Apollo astronauts will still be around to celebrate their achievement."
147;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;US faces united front on aircraft tender;;Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel on Tuesday presented a united Franco-German front against Washington’s handling of a $50bn military tender, saying they would discuss “possible implications” with European partners.“The chancellor and the president of the Republic, together with the European Commission and the European partners concerned, will examine the implications of future developments in this affair,” a joint statement said.It comes just days after France and the UK issued a similarly forthright joint statement on a visit to London by Mr Sarkozy, the French president.The growing campaign is likely to exacerbate further trade relations with the US, already stretched by a proposed European clampdown on hedge funds.European countries were outraged last week after EADS, the Franco-German aerospace and defence group, decided to pull out of the tender for 179 air refuelling tankers for the US Air Force, alleging foul play.It was one of the world’s biggest defence contracts on offer, with a potential value of up to $100bn (€72.7bn, £65.7bn). EADS and Northrup Grumman, its US partner, won the contract in 2008 but their victory was successfully challenged by Boeing, the US rival, and the tender was relaunched. The group and Northrup said that revised tender rules favoured Boeing, now the sole bidder in the race.People close to both governments said the statement had been issued to show that feelings were still running high in Europe.However, they dismissed the suggestion that Europe was preparing any form of trade sanctions against the US. “We have no intention at this stage to go beyond the declaration,” a French official said. “They are expressing their common concerns about the procedure and it is a message that they hope the process can be conducted in a fair manner.”However, it is unlikely that either EADS or Northrup would be interested in returning to the fray unless the rules change. The failed bid has already cost both companies significant amounts of money and man hours.
148;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Sarkozy and Brown hit at US on air tender;;Nicolas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown joined forces on Friday to attack the US for alleged protectionism in its handling of a $50bn military tender that looks likely to be awarded to Boeing.The French president believes the rules of the tender to provide refuelling tankers to the US air force were skewed against EADS, the Franco-German aerospace and defence group. He said: “I did not appreciate this decision. This is not the right way to behave.”Speaking in Downing Street after talks with the British prime minister, Mr Sarkozy accused the US of double standards. “If they want to be heard in the fight against protectionism, they should not set the example of protectionism.”Mr Brown was also unusually forthright in his criticism of the US. “I too am disappointed by the American decision and we have made our views known.”EADS, parent company of Airbus, withdrew this week from the long-running competition. It was jointly bidding for the contract with Northrop Grumman, a US defence contractor.The tensions come at a difficult time for transatlantic trade relations, with the US accusing the Europeans of erecting barriers to hedge funds – including those based in New York – operating in the European Union.Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, aired his concerns in a letter this month to Michel Barnier, EU internal market commissioner. Mr Brown sympathises with Mr Geithner’s concerns but said he was convinced that Britain and France – which favours tougher regulation – could reach a deal that avoids excessive new burdens.
149;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-03-09T23:21:36Z;Insults fly as tanker contract hopes die;;The politicians were happily slinging insults back and forth across the Atlantic on Tuesday about the collapse of the competitive $50bn tender to provide refuelling tankers to the US Air Force, but EADS’s chief executive, Louis Gallois, known as the monk, was content to take a rather more diplomatic line.Mr Gallois insisted that the real loser was not his group but the American taxpayer and the US military. “What is the consequence?” he said at the group’s results meeting. “The US Air Force will not have the most modern aircraft in the world …for the next 45 years.”But behind the smile lay real disappointment. The tanker contract was to have set the seal on the vision unveiled by Mr Gallois three years ago, to have a group evenly balanced between civil and non-civil activities such as defence, security and space, and one with a real presence in the US defence market. In effect to create a structure similar to that of his arch-rival, Boeing.Vision 2020 was in part about lessening the volatility and the weight of EADS’s commercial aircraft division Airbus, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of revenues.But it was also about helping the European-based group to reduce its punishing currency disadvantage by boosting its presence in the dollar zone. In its results EADS not only reported a reversal into loss – from net profits of €1.6bn ($2.1bn) to a deficit of €763m – but it also revealed a crippling €2.5bn charge from adverse currency movements in 2009. It was a stark reminder of the pain inflicted by a production structure designed to meet political rather than economic criteria.EADS had hoped that by setting up its first North American production line in Alabama for the A330 tanker it would gain greater dollar hedging and a foothold in a strategic market for the longer-term future.In the end, it was not to be and the anger was patent within the ranks of EADS. “It is pure protectionism,” said one senior executive.Mr Gallois himself admitted that some of 2020’s targets would have to be revised, but he gave no details. Clearly his plans to boost production in dollar zones and to become a big presence in the US market will take longer to realise than planned, especially with no potential acquisitions on the horizon.Remarkably, however, this week’s setback has been taken harder by the company than it has by the market. Some analysts were largely unperturbed by the decision to pull out of the contract. The group had “far more obvious fish to fry” closer to home, said Sandy Morris, aerospace analyst at RBS in London.In particular it will have to manage better the large complex aircraft programmes that helped to push it into loss last year and, for the A380 superjumbo at least, threaten to weigh on profits again in 2010. It will also have to recover some of the slippage already evident in the newest programme, the A350 wide-bodied aircraft.Others, however, were less sanguine. Nick Cunningham at Evolution Securities, said: “[The decision not to bid] is a loss in itself. It would have meant significant volume for Airbus and would have given them some continuity. Remember, it is not just a loss but also likely to be your sole competitor’s gain”.“It shuts the door to dollarising the final assembly part of your supply chain,” he adds.On Tuesday, Mr Gallois was determined not to succumb to fatalism. Perhaps that is why despite the disappointments in the US and continuing uncertainty in the global aircraft market the group decided to step up production of its A320 single aisle range – the group’s real cash cow. And he pointed to EADS’s strong cash performance, with a net €9.8bn still in the bank.And there were even some analysts on Tuesday who suggested that the US story was far from over. The A400m, which has proved so costly for EADS after a total €4.2bn in provisions, could one day be exported to North America. “I strongly suspect it will be a product the US military will want to take a hard look at,” said Mr Morris. “EADS can crack the US market. They just need to keep at it.”
150;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:27+0000;Washington has taken Airbus for a four-year ride;;The US defence and aerospace industry has traditionally had three sanctuaries. One is Israel’s flag carrier El Al, which continues to operate an all-Boeing fleet of commercial aircraft.The second is Japan, whose airlines are all mainly equipped with Boeing aircraft even though Airbus has managed to place a few of its planes with JAL and ANA. The third, of course, is the mighty US defence market.For the past four years, Airbus and its parent EADS believed they were finally cracking the US defence market in a significant way with a multibillion-dollar contract to supply the US Air Force with its new fleet of tanker refuelling aircraft. Indeed, after teaming up with Northrop Grumman in 2007, the Europeans seemed to have got their big break when the US Air Force the following year awarded them the tanker contract for their modified version of the Airbus A330, preferring it to Boeing’s smaller 767 tanker version.The A330 tanker version has also beaten Boeing in several other competitions, including in the UK, Saudi Arabia and Australia. The European aircraft is generally considered more competitive and better value, if more expensive, than the Boeing variant by about 20 per cent.Boeing subsequently challenged the decision by successfully appealing to the Government Accountability Office – the investigative arm of the US Congress – and the contract was cancelled.The US then launched a new competition and issued last month what is known in the jargon as a new “request for proposal”, which the Northrop-EADS partnership felt was heavily slanted in favour of Boeing’s proposed offering.By putting the overall emphasis on price, Northrop and EADS argued this gave the smaller and hence cheaper Boeing aircraft an obvious advantage and failed to recognise the added value of the enhanced capabilities of their larger tanker.So Northrop decided this week it was pointless competing and wasting more money on contract specifications that, in its own words, “dramatically favour” Boeing’s smaller tanker. Both EADS and Airbus came to the same conclusion and pulled out on Tuesday from the competition.In any case, it would have made no economic sense for the Europeans to go it alone in the US. As Tom Enders, the Airbus chief executive, pointedly put it on Tuesday, if Northrop has thrown in the towel it presumably knows what the rules of the game are and what is possible in the US and what is not. The conclusion is obvious, he added. This is nothing to do with which aircraft is the best tanker and nothing to do with fair competition.But then, was it ever going to be fair? And was it ever conceivable that the US would hand over to a foreign supplier responsibility for such a strategic defence programme? Was it conceivable even if an American company was heading the partnership and that it would have involved a new assembly plant in Alabama as well as securing thousands of aerospace jobs in the Los Angeles area? The US, as French President Nicolas Sarkozy never ceases to remind everybody, is if anything more protectionist than the most protectionist of European states.Under the circumstances, the Europeans were probably a bit naive to think they would end up clinching the tanker deal.That said, they will still need to keep a watchful eye on Boeing and on the outcome of the contract. For as sole bidder, Boeing could well be tempted to extract a higher price than it would have otherwise received. Worse, it could use its position of strength to propose eventually to the US Air Force a modified version of its bigger 777 aircraft, rather than the smaller 767 whose commercial production has now been stopped.That would give the 777 an additional lease of life, enable Boeing to make pots of money that could then be channelled to support and intensify its marketing campaign for its latest commercial offering, the new 787 Dreamliner. That would be totally unacceptable to the Europeans. But that does not mean it will not happen.Postmodern PTTThe French Post Office has just been transformed into a publicly owned limited company ahead of European liberalisation next year. Already it is seeking new ways to generate growth to offset the expected decline in its traditional business.Indeed, it is considering becoming a virtual mobile telephone operator next year, offering its own services using the network of an established operator. The target is to attract up to 2m subscribers over the next four years. If the Post Office’s board gives the go ahead later this week, it would be a bit like going back to its old PTT (Post, Telephone and Telegraph) roots.european.view@ft.com
151;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-03-09T20:39:45Z;Europe cries foul over US defence tender;;"European countries have accused Washington of foul play after the continent’s largest aerospace and defence company pulled out of a multibillion-dollar race to supply the US ­military, alleging unfair ­competition.Ministers in the UK, France and Germany, as well as the European Commission, hinted at possible repercussions from the collapse of the $50bn (£33bn) tender to supply the US Air Force with 179 air refuelling tankers.EADS and its US partner Northrop Grumman decided late on Monday night to pull out of the tender after concluding that, under current rules, their larger A330 tanker could not win.The decision is likely to raise transatlantic trade tensions further. Relations between America and Europe on trade are already stretched by the on­going row between Boeing and Airbus over government subsidies for aircraft programmes.The French foreign ministry said it would, with the European Commission, “examine the new development and its possible implications”. Christine Lagarde, French finance minister, openly suggested the competition had been rigged to favour EADS’s US rival Boeing, now the sole bidder.“The best situation is one of fair competition and I think it’s a shame that the company wasn’t in the best competitive situation” for the bid, she said.Rainer Bruederle, German economy minister, also said the US government had given a clear advantage to Boeing.In Britain, one of the countries that would have benefited from an Airbus win, Lord Mandelson, business secretary, said he was “disappointed”. “Given the open market to US producers we have in Europe, it is very disappointing that a US-led European consortium feels that the revised tanker procurement process is now so biased against them that it is not even worth making a bid,” he said.People close to the UK government warned there could be repercussions for US trade. “The ramifications of this are potentially very serious. It sends a protectionist signal,” said one.Some US politicians were dismayed. Richard Shelby, Republican senator of Alabama, where EADS would have created jobs, said: “This so–called competition was not structured to produce the best outcome for our men and women in uniform; it was structured to produce the best outcome for Boeing.”The Pentagon said last night: “The Northrop decision does not change our commitment to transatlantic defence ties . . . We do not set the rules to favour one party or another, European or American companies. We set the requirements that the war fighter needs and hope that a range of companies find it lucrative enough to bid.”Concerns have been growing over the fairness of the bid process. In 2004, Boeing was awarded a contract, which was rescinded after an ethics scandal. The competition was re-tendered and won by Northrop-EADS in 2008, only for Boeing to protest successfully."
152;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-03-09T20:11:09Z;Northrop’s ‘no’ highlights a step change;;It is not every day that a chief executive walks away from a multibillion-dollar contract but on Monday, the head of defence contractor Northrop Grumman said the company would not take part in bidding to replace the US Air Force’s ageing fleet of refuelling tankers.The contest structure “clearly favours Boeing’s smaller refuelling tanker …[and] does not provide adequate value recognition of [our] larger tanker, precluding us from any competitive opportunity,” Wes Bush said bluntly.The move was a watershed for the fourth-largest supplier of defence material to the Pentagon which has fought for almost a decade, and spent over $200m, to win what is one of the largest defence contracts on offer.“Clearly they decided not to throw good money after bad,” says Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Lexington Institute, a think-tank.“Northrop and EADS were bidding a bigger and more expensive plane than Boeing, so to match Boeing’s price would have implied a smaller profit margin and perhaps no margin at all.”Still, the decision to withdraw is not without its costs according to Mr Thompson.“There is a real downside to not bidding. They have irritated their European partner, EADS, they have irritated their congressional backers and they have irritated their government customer.”But for insiders, the decision comes as little surprise. Since taking over as chief executive in January, Mr Bush has emphasised shareholder returns over revenue growth.He has begun to address the consistent underperformance at its shipbuilding arm, which makes aircraft carriers and submarines, and at a recent earnings conference laid out an ambitious plan to increase margins across all of its business this year.On the tanker programme he has been equally clear, insisting that Northrop would only bid if it could minimise exposure to risk while having some reasonable prospect of return.“The action to stop the process before the bid is submitted reflects well on management,” says Howard Rubel, with Jeffries & Company. “It sends a clear message to the supply chain and other constituents about how Northrop will conduct business.”Indeed, as the defence department puts increasing pressure on contractors to sign up to long-term fixed-price contracts, shoulder more costs and improve their performance, a willingness to say no could be a crucial advantage.“My guess is that the decision is just the first in a series of changes that will reshape Northrop’s culture and business,” said Mr Thompson. “The company will focus on profitability, and operations like shipbuilding that can’t do their part could be gone.”

At that point, what the market was discounting was Armageddon. Volumes were low.“The real low [of the crisis] was October 10, which was a high volume day.“We are up only 35 per cent off the real low in the market. Investors have massively taken off short positions against the end of capitalism.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent at 1,140.45, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent to 10,564.38 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent to 2,340.68.Since a year ago, 204 stocks in the S&P 500 index are up 100 per cent or more, 33 are 300 per cent higher or more and two are up 1,000 per cent or more, according to Capital IQ.Shares in Cisco Systems, were flat at $26.13 in spite of the largest maker of networking equipment announcing a new router that it said could handle 12 times the data of the nearest competing product.Cisco climbed 4 per cent on Monday in anticipation of the announcement.The airline sector posted gains after United and Continental said in an investor call that they were seeing demand return among business customers.“The return of higher quality traffic, combined with the significant reductions in capacity that we undertook in 2009, has really begun to improve our relative revenue results,” Kathryn Mikells, UAL chief financial officer, said.UAL was up 3.7 per cent to $18.16, Continental gained 4.9 per cent to $21.19 while AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose 9.3 per cent to $9.77.Yum, the restaurant chain that owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, rose 3.4 per cent to $36.60 after the stock was raised to “buy” from “neutral” by analysts at UBS and the target price raised from $38 to $44.“Although Yum has been refranchising units for the bulk of the past decade, we are just now hitting an inflection point where the full refranchising impact becomes apparent,” David Palmer, analyst at UBS, said.Rival Burger King strengthened 2.2 per cent to $18.72 while McDonald’s was flat at $65.10.Texas Instruments, a maker of semiconductors and calculators, was one of the biggest fallers in the S&P 500, losing 2 per cent to $24.19 after it raised the low end of its quarterly forecasts but failed to reassure some analysts about strength of demand beyond this quarter.It said it was struggling to complete orders in time as demand exceeded capacity.Northrop Grumman the US defence group, lost 0.3 per cent to $64 after it said it would not bid for the US Air Force’s $35bn tanker project.It had previously threatened to withdraw from the bidding unless the US government changed some of the conditions.The move leaves Boeing as the only bidder. Its shares were up 0.8 per cent to $67.79.Chevron, the second-largest US energy company by market capitalisation, fell 0.5 per cent to $74.30 on news that it was to sell a UK oil refinery, cut 2,000 jobs and divest assets in the Caribbean and Central America to help reduce losses from its fuel business.Financials performed well, helped by the perceived easing of risk surrounding European sovereign debt.Citigroup was the highest riser in the sector, gaining 7.3 per cent to $3.82 on continued speculation that the US government was set to sell a part of its stake in the bank.The stock has gained 263.8 per cent over the past year.Bank of America gained 0.4 per cent to $16.80 but Goldman Sachs declined 0.6 per cent to $168.85.First Solar, the largest maker of thin-film solar cells, retreated 2.2 per cent to $106.22 after the stock was cut to “underweight” from “neutral” by JPMorgan.
154;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-03-09T16:44:11Z;EADS;Two troublesome projects and one set of bad results;"Bad news often comes in threes, except for EADS. Three developments in three working days involving the world’s second-largest aerospace group have been, respectively: positive – but less so than it might seem; expectedly bad; and unexpectedly bad. First, Friday night’s deal with European governments to contribute an extra €3.5bn to Airbus’s over-budget A400M military transport project. That saved the €20bn venture, but still forced EADS to take a €1.8bn charge for its share of the cost haemorrhages. And, as Evolution Securities notes, EADS remains on the hook for any further overruns – hardly to be ruled out in a project this complex.Monday then brought the withdrawal of Northrop Grumman, EADS’s partner, from the $50bn race to provide refuelling tankers for the US Air Force. Without its US sponsor, EADS is unlikely to bid solo. That was a bitter blow – though one anticipated by the market, which had not factored in earnings from the project; after all, the US Department of Defense’s final terms clearly favoured rival Boeing.Finally, EADS’s annual earnings on Tuesday were the unexpected disappointment. The A400M provision, plus a further €240m charge on the troubled A380 superjumbo, produced a surprisingly large €763m net loss, torpedoing the dividend. Worse was the 2010 outlook. Further cost pressures from the A380, plus the weak dollar and other currency effects, are expected to produce an operating profit of about €1bn – half a billion less than the market had assumed.That leaves EADS stock looking pricey indeed – even after Tuesday’s 3 per cent share price fall. The Franco-German group was previously trading on a demanding 16 times forecast 2010 earnings; factor in the reduced outlook and the multiple soars into the stratosphere. Nor is there much prospect of earnings rebounding in 2011. The share price may be commencing a long descent.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentiallyEADS warned on Tuesday of continued pressures on profit from its troubled A380 superjumbo programme after charges on the A400M military transport aircraft pushed the aerospace and defence group into a net €763m loss for 2009, against a profit of €1.57bn last time.Less than a week after finally agreeing with government customers on how to divide the cost overruns on the A400M, Louis Gallois, chief executive, warned that problems with the A380 “would continue to weigh substantially on earnings”.The group took a €1.8bn hit on the A400M in 2009, while exceptionally adverse foreign exchange rates also took their toll on the group’s performance.EADS said the negative impact of currency movements came to €2.5bn in 2009. Airbus, the group’s aircraft-making subsidiary and the biggest revenue generator, took a €240m charge to cover continued difficulties on the production of the A380."
155;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-03-09T08:38:22Z;Northrop pulls out of US air tankers race;;"Northrop Grumman on Monday night pulled out of the multibillion-dollar contest to replace the US Air Force’s fleet of ageing refuelling tankers, dealing a blow to the Pentagon’s efforts to make it a model of competitive defence procurement.The fourth-largest US defence contractor said proceeding with a bid would be a waste of resources after concluding that, under current rules, it could not win the competition.But the company offered the Department of Defense a partial reprieve, saying it would not protest against the terms of the contest out of a sense of responsibility to America’s servicemen, who “have been forced to wait too long for new tankers”.The decision is a setback for EADS, Northrop’s partner on the project. The European conglomerate had been keen to use the contract to realise its long-standing ambitions of breaking into the US defence market.“We are clearly disappointed,” said Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus, EADS’s aircraft unit. “I regret that the US air force and the US taxpayer will be penalised because of a biased competition.”The news drew a stinging response from political supporters of EADS, including Richard Shelby, senator of Alabama – where the company planned to build many of its aircraft.“This so-called competition was not structured to produce the best outcome for our men and women in uniform; it was structured to produce the best outcome for Boeing,” Mr Shelby said in a statement.The DoD rejected the charges, saying the contest was fair to both parties. It has been under acute pressure to run a successful competition because the tankers are crucial to the USAF and it has failed to seal the contract twice before.The air force’s fleet of “flying gas stations” is almost 50 years old and is expensive to maintain, but previous efforts to replace them have collapsed.In 2004, Boeing was awarded a contract, which was rescinded after an ethics scandal. The competition was re-tendered and unexpectedly won by Northrop-EADS, only for Boeing to protest successfully.This time Northrop has complained that the rules favoured the smaller, less expensive 767 aircraft that Boeing is offering over EADS’s A330 and placed unacceptable risk on contractors by demanding an 18-year fixed-price contract.The DoD adjusted the pricing structure when it issued final terms for the contest at the end of February, but largely overlooked the broader criticisms.Officials noted that the Pentagon, while it preferred a competition, had “legal options” to continue the programme even if there was only one bidder.Northrop’s withdrawal from the contest leaves the field clear for Boeing, which on Monday re-committed itself to a bid, to scoop up the 179-aircraft contract, worth up to $50bn. Follow-on deals could bring the total to more than $100bn.In an unusual move, Northrop laid down a marker for its rival, warning the DoD to stick to “the economic conclusions of the prior round of bidding as it takes actions to protect the taxpayer when defining the sole-source procurement contract”."
156;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-02-24T23:08:34Z;Pentagon releases revised tanker bid rules;;The US defence department is headed for a showdown with one of its biggest contractors after it largely overlooked Northrop Grumman’s demands for changes to the rules of the $50bn competition to replace the US Air Force’s fleet of aging refuelling tankers.In releasing its long awaited final bid terms, DoD officials insisted that they had kept the contest objective, made the process transparent and responded to the concerns of the companies, answering some 350 separate questions.“We are confident that our acquisition strategy favours no one except the warfighter and taxpayer,” said William Lynn, deputy defence secretary, in a briefing note. “We believe that both companies have the ability not only to make a competitive offering, but the opportunity to win the solicitation.”The revised and final rules seem likely to fall short of Northrop’s extensive demands. The Pentagon said it had made 230 changes, to things like the required fire-safety kit on the aircraft, but had “retained the basic structure of the requirements”.“The changes in the final request for proposals are rather minimal,” said Norm Dicks, a Democrat from Washington state and the prospective chairman of the defence sub-committee of the powerful House appropriations committee.“I don’t know if Northrop Grumman will be satisfied with that,” Mr Dicks said after receiving a briefing from top defence officials.Northrop and its partner Airbus, which is owned by EADS, the European aerospace and defence company, are competing against Boeing, the American aerospace giant, for a chunk of one of the largest defence programmes in the world.But Northrop has consistently complained that the draft rules released in September favoured the smaller, less expensive aircraft that Boeing is likely to offer and placed unacceptable risk on contractors by demanding an 18-year fixed price contract.”I must regrettably inform you that, absent a responsive set of changes …Northrop Grumman has determined that it cannot submit a bid,” wrote Wes Bush, Northrop’s chief executive, in a letter to the defence department in December.The controversial tanker contest has dragged on for almost ten years, and a Northrop decision to drop its bid would be damaging for the DoD, which has promised a “full and open” competition and sees picking a new tanker as one of its highest priorities.Any such move would also be a step back for EADS which has been looking to expand its relatively small presence in the US defence market. But it would be a boon for Boeing, which has had several key programmes cancelled by the DoD in recent years.Mr Lynn said he was hopeful that Northrop would submit a bid but said that the department had “legal options” and could continue with the programme with only one bidder.In the final rules, most of the key terms remain the same. Bidders will have to produce an aircraft that meets 372 mandatory requirements, down from 373. Adjustments will then be made for effectiveness and the cost of ownership over 40 years, but additional features are credited only if the basic prices are extremely close.The DoD made modest concessions on the contract type. While it affirmed its commitment to a fixed-price incentive contract, it created a mechanism to increase the spending in the future to allow for unexpected “economic fluctuations”.A spokesman for Northrop said that the company “will analyse the RFP and defer further public comments until its review of the document has been completed”.A spokesman for Boeing said that the release of the final RFP meant the process could move forward but added that the company was “disappointed” that the document did not address its allegations that Airbus receives unfair advantages from subsidies from European governments.The tankers are vital to both the USAF and to the companies involved. The Air Force’s current fleet is almost 50 years old and increasingly expensive to maintain, while the contract to supply an initial 179 aircraft could be worth up to $50bn to the successful contractor. Follow-on deals could bring the total to more than $100bn.In 2004, Boeing was awarded a $20bn contract to supply the tankers, but that was rescinded after an ethics scandal. The competition was re-tendered and unexpectedly won by Northrop-EADS, only for Boeing to successfully protest by raising concerns about US protectionism.The bidders now have 75 days to respond to the request. The Pentagon said it will announce its decision 120 days after that and expects the contract to be awarded this fiscal year.
157;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-02-23T19:21:07Z;Pentagon restarts bid to replace tankers;;The US Air Force will attempt to resume its long-delayed, multi-billion-dollar competition to replace its ageing fleet of refuelling tankers this week with a new set of bidding rules.It promises the competition, mired in controversy for more than six years, will be “full and open”, but doubts remain over how much of a contest it will be. One of the two bid teams, led by Northrop Grumman in partnership with EADS, the Franco-German parent of Airbus, has already warned it will not take part unless the Air Force makes significant changes to a draft set of rules released in September. It claimed the rules were skewed to favour its rival Boeing’s smaller 767 tanker against its Airbus A330.The stakes are high for all parties as this is the third time in the past decade that the Pentagon has sought to put the contract out to tender. The two previous contract awards – one to each of the two bidders – were scrapped over irregularities in the process.Pentagon officials are under pressure to ensure the competition this time round will be free of controversy. The tankers are vital to the USAF and the contract to supply an initial 179 aircraft could be worth up to $50bn, while follow-on deals could bring the total to more than $100bn.One of the sticking points for Northrop has been the fixed-price nature of the 18-year contract, with executives arguing it puts too much risk on the bidders because it is difficult to predict costs that far ahead. Northrop, however, believes the Pentagon could loosen those terms.“Apparently in their latest batch of answers [to questions from the bidders] they indicate that the government will consider restructuring the production options to reduce contractor risk. We don’t really know what that means, whether it does mean a change to fixed price tanker rules or not,” says Northrop.Boeing, in contrast, said it would be prepared to support any kind of a contract.”We can do it fixed price. If we do it fixed price, we’re going to have to put additional risk money in. If we do it cost plus, we know how to do that as well, so we’re being driven by the customer here,” says Jim Albaugh, the head of the group’s commercial aircraft business and former head of its defence division.But the main concern for Northrop and EADS remains cost, says Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute.“Their biggest worry is that the performance requirements …would be scored in a way that makes cost the chief determinant of who wins. The modified Airbus A330 that Northrop plans to offer is much more expensive than the 767 competitor Boeing plans to bid,” he says.According to Mr Thompson, if no extra credit is given for the A330’s longer range or its higher fuel payload, then price “becomes crucial to prevailing” and “so Northrop has good reason not to bid”.In a further twist, analysts believe Boeing’s case could be helped by the appointment of Democrat Norm Dicks to chair the House Appropriations Committee after the death of fellow Democrat John Murtha. Murtha supported a plan to split the buy between the two bidders in spite of opposition from the Department of Defense.“Murtha believed a split buy was the only solution that would win congressional funding to replace the 50-year old Boeing KC-135s. Mr Dicks not only has steadfastly supported the KC-767, he has equally steadfastly opposed a split buy. With Murtha’s voice now stilled, Mr Dicks is in a stronger position to oppose a split buy,” says Scott Hamilton, an aviation consultant.But Northrop dismisses this as an issue, pointing out that it has a long history of working closely with Mr Dicks, noting he was a “huge supporter” of the B-2 bomber which it built for the Air Force. “So we have a long and good working relationship,” the company says.Once the new rules are released the companies will have 75 days to complete and submit their proposals.
158;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-02-02T20:59:31Z;Lockheed under fire from Pentagon;;At a meeting with investors last week, Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company by revenues, told shareholders the industry had to prepare for a changed environment.“We and our customers are facing a new reality,” he said, “as [our customers] confront expanding mission requirements and greater fiscal pressure that is simply not going to go away in the near term.”On Monday that “new reality” arrived for Lockheed as the Pentagon approved a radical shake-up of the F-35 programme, Lockheed’s $300bn project to build a new combat jet, and confirmed that defence budgets would grow more slowly in future.The progress of the F-35 “has not been what it should, as a number of key goals and benchmarks were not met,” Robert Gates, US defence secretary, told reporters. “The taxpayer should not have to bear the entire burden of getting the JSF [joint strike fighter] programme back on track.”As a result, the Department of Defence will replace the official in charge of the F-35 programme, the successor for much of the US combat aircraft fleet, withhold $614m of performance fees from Lockheed and shift more money to the development stages to reduce risk.For Lockheed, the F-35 decision marks a setback for a crucial project. The programme made up about 10 per cent of its $45.2bn revenues in 2009 and as production increases it expects it to reach 30 per cent of revenues at its peak.The aircraft has struggled with delays and cost overruns in part because Lockheed has tried to compress the testing and development cycles and accelerate production to achieve economies of scale earlier than would otherwise be possible.However, Itay Michaeli, an analyst with Citigroup, argues that DoD support for the F-35 remains strong, with funding boosted by 2 per cent to about $11.5bn in 2011, and that restructuring could be positive for Lockheed if it sets more realistic expectations. “The question is whether Lockheed can execute,” he said.Dan Crowley, F-35 programme general manager at Lockheed, said the company hoped “to re-build our customer’s confidence through execution against a series of milestones”.He admitted that “without results there is an expectation that [the performance] fee will be withheld”.But the DoD’s moves will also heighten broader concerns that the terms of trade are set to deteriorate for the defence industry as the department prepares to spend less but demand more from suppliers.As part of reforms launched in 2009, Pentagon officials have expressed a desire to use more fixed-price contracts to cap the department’s risk on projects and shown a willingness to restructure and even eliminate under-performing systems.Defence companies are not without some leverage of their own. Recent interactions have been co-operative, said Mr Michaeli, but consolidation in the industry has created dominant operators able to push back against the DoD.Last year, Northrop Grumman threatened to walk away from the $35bn contest to select a replacement for the Air Force’s fleet of air-to-air refuelling tankers in part because the DoD insisted on a fixed-price development contract, which Northrop claimed was too risky.“As the industry leader,” Mr Stevens, told Lockheed investors last week, “we are working to contain costs …with the recognition that we really should seize this moment to do a better job.”
159;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-02-01T17:43:01Z;US lunar mission brought down to earth;;"The US will not be sending astronauts back to the moon this decade.Barack Obama, the president, proposes to cancel the Constellation lunar-return programme on which the space agency Nasa has already spent an estimated $9bn (€6.4bn, £5.6bn).Instead, Nasa’s manned space activities would focus on new rockets developed by private companies to fly astronauts to the International Space Station in low orbit just 340km above Earth.The ISS, a collaborative project involving the Russian, European, Japanese and Canadian space agencies, would keep going at least until 2020.Mr Obama wants Nasa to work with commercial companies to develop much less expensive space vehicles to convey people to and from the ISS.That would require the agency to adopt more of a hands-off attitude to space transport design and involve innovative private companies such as SpaceX and Orbital Sciences.Until now Nasa has specified all details of its rockets, which have been built by big contractors such as Northrop Grumman and United Technologies.George W. Bush, the former US president, saw a return to the moon as a step towards sending astronauts to Mars a decade or two later.His successor has not removed a Martian voyage from Nasa’s long-term agenda, but he says the US cannot afford to take the intermediate step.Mr Obama’s decision appears to leave the lunar landing field clear for China and India. Both countries are planning manned moon missions for later this decade.However, the administration will face fierce opposition in Congress, both from politicians who feel that US national pride and security require a more active manned space programme and from those whose states or districts that stand
to lose significant aerospace business under the new ­policy.Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, where Nasa’s main launch base is situated, said: “I, for one, intend to stand up and fight for Nasa, and for the thousands of people who stand to lose their jobs.”"
160;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-01-19T19:44:18Z;Norway fund shuns tobacco companies;;Norway has dropped 17 tobacco companies, including Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, from its sovereign wealth fund, adding to a growing list of stocks blacklisted by Europe’s biggest equity investor.Imperial Tobacco, Altria, Reynolds American and Japan Tobacco were among others barred from the $455bn fund – which owns more than 1 per cent of all global stocks – after the Norwegian finance ministry ruled that the companies were in breach of the fund’s ethical guidelines.The tobacco companies join a list of about 50 stocks excluded from the Norwegian fund on ethical grounds, ranging from arms manufacturers, such as Boeing and BAE Systems, to companies accused of environmental and labour rights violations, including Rio Tinto and Wal-Mart.Norway has sought to make its sovereign wealth fund a role model for socially responsible investment since introducing ethical guidelines in 2003. Tobacco companies initially escaped exclusion but Sigbjørn Johnsen, finance minister, on Tuesday said it was time for them to be removed.“It is important that the ethical guidelines reflect at all times what can be considered to be commonly held values of the owners of the fund,” he said.The fund, in which Norway invests its oil wealth for future generations, is the world’s second-largest sovereign wealth fund after that of the United Arab Emirates.According to Reuters calculations, the fund’s holdings in the 17 excluded tobacco companies were worth NKr14.6bn ($2.6bn) at the end of 2008. Its stakes included 1.3 per cent of British American Tobacco, 0.5 per cent of Philip Morris International and 1.3 per cent of Imperial Tobacco.The finance ministry said all stocks had been sold in advance of Tuesday’s announcement. It added that other companies connected with the industry could be excluded in future.The fund has a Council of Ethics that recommends stocks for removal, with the final decision made by the finance ministry.Norway stirred controversy last September by excluding Elbit Systems, an Israeli company that supplies the surveillance system for the “separation barrier” under construction by Israel in the West Bank.Other blacklisted companies include Honeywell and Northrop Grumman for their role in making nuclear weapons and EADS, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon for production of cluster munitions.
161;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2010-01-14T23:50:26Z;Cyberattacks aimed at defence groups;;"The cyber­attacks that have compromised computers at Google and other US technology companies doing business in China have also been aimed at extracting secrets from defence contractors, investigators said on Thursday.Malicious software on machines at companies attacked in the latest blitz sent proprietary data off to six web addresses in Taiwan that had received information from US defence groups before.The defence companies had been attacked using methods similar to those deployed against nearly three dozen high-tech groups including Google, which went public with the spying matter this week, pointing a finger at the Chinese government.“Partners of ours in the defence industry said that those addresses have been used in attacks before,” said Eli Jellenc of iDefense, a Virginia security firm hired by some of the recent targets. He said Taiwan was merely the last stop on the trail, not a suspect itself, and that the campaign was now seen to be after military information as well as high-tech know-how and data on domestic activists.Mr Jellenc and others involved in the inquiry said the attacks used several techniques simultaneously. Microsoft confirmed that a previously unknown vulnerability in its Internet Explorer web browser had been used in the attacks and promised to issue a patch.Other companies attacked in the spying effort that confirming their involvement included security software provider Symantec, which has a Chengdu research centre jointly owned with Chinese firm Huawei, and more than 1,000 of its employees. Symantec said it was “thoroughly investigating”.Defence group Northrop Grumman and web portal Yahoo did not dispute reports that they had been attacked as well.Google has turned the breaches into a debate over the Chinese government’s attitude to both intellectual property and censorship of the web, threatening to withdraw from the country rather than continue to suppress search results.One of China’s top propaganda officials yesterday reaffirmed the state’s commitment to online control, showing no sign of compromise, while the US backed Google more solidly.Wang Chen, head of China’s State Council Information Office and deputy head of the Communist party’s propaganda department, said online media “must live up to their responsibility of maintaining internet security”.Mr Wang did not mention Google by name, but his remarks were seen as Beijing’s first response to the group’s threat to quit the country.In a lengthy statement published on a Chinese government website, Mr Wang said China faced new challenges in regulating the internet and that “Online media must treat the creation of a positive mainstream opinion environment as an important duty.” He said China has also been “a victim of hackers and resolutely opposes hacking”.“To maintain internet security, we need international co-operation and close co-ordination.”An adviser to the Obama administration supported Google, in the latest sign that the relationship between Washington and Beijing is entering a more turbulent phase than just a few weeks ago.In some of the strongest comments yet on the case, a senior administration official gave US “approval, admiration and support for what Google has said in not participating in censorship of its site”. The official also expressed solidarity with Google’s complaint about cyber­attacks: “A lot of American institutions have faced intrusions and certainly many of them have come from Chinese origin.”Meanwhile, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said its members were optimistic about future prospects, but
concerned about the security of commercial correspondence, data and networks.Google showed no sign of bending. “We’ve said already that we will be taking a new approach in China,” the company said, adding that it had made contact with the Chinese authorities over the issue. David Drummond, chief legal officer, said in a radio interview that he expected talks to start very soon.Additional reporting by Richard Waters in San Francisco and Hal Weitzman in Chicago"
162;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-12-07T01:25:40Z;Gallois unperturbed by pessimists;;Louis Gallois has little patience with pessimists who pore over problems that, as chief executive of EADS, he is likely to face in the coming year.Speaking in his airy office overlooking the Hippodrome d’Auteil on the western edge of Paris, Mr Gallois dismisses speculation about the latest addition to the list – the Dubai economic crisis.Dubai’s Emirates Airlines has ordered 58 of the A380 superjumbos made by EADS’s Airbus subsidiary – nearly 30 per cent of all orders – and is one of the manufacturer’s biggest customers overall.The chief of the Franco-German aerospace and defence group is unperturbed. “Emirates has a business model which is working and it is very well managed,” Mr Gallois says.He is equally sanguine about the announcement last month of US Airways, one of Airbus’s most important US customers, to defer delivery of 54 aircraft.The move, he says, “was not new for us. We were in contact with them every day. It was already in our production plan”.Both Airbus and its US rival, Boeing, have suffered deferrals this year as the airline industry suffers what some claim is its worst recession in 60 years, with global losses expected to total $11bn in 2009 after reaching an estimated $16.8bn in 2008 – more than it lost after the September 11 terrorist attacks.This amounts to one of the toughest trading challenges for EADS since it was created in 2000 and even Mr Gallois cannot escape a dose of gloom. “The global picture is not booming, it’s clear.”The group also faces problems on two of its flagship programmes – the A380 superjumbo and A400M military transport aircraft – and uncertainty still surrounds its bid for a US Air Force tanker contract worth up to $50bn.EADS and the US defence group, Northrop Grumman, won a contract to make 179 refuelling tankers in February 2008, but the deal was cancelled after a protest by rival bidder Boeing.The Pentagon has now re-opened the bidding but Northrop last week threatened to pull out if the new tender criteria were not modified.Mr Gallois supports his US partner’s complaints about the tender process. “It is clearly not taking into account the capacities of a larger and more modern airplane we are proposing and which led us to win in 2008,” he says.The problems on the A400M military transport are also pressing. After getting seven partner nations to agree to fund the €20bn ($29.7bn) 180-aircraft programme six years ago, EADS has struggled to overcome technical problems that delayed the A400M’s maiden flight by two years. The delays have been costly and partner nations are arguing with EADS on who should pick up the tab.“Globally, we don’t know the impact of A400M on cash. We will see that at the end of negotiations,” says Mr Gallois.Then there is the A380. Like the A400M – and Boeing’s long overdue 787 Dreamliner, also expected to fly before the end of the year – the world’s biggest passenger aircraft was plagued with delays before entering service in 2007.Two years later, it is still struggling with production problems that annoyed some customers.Mr Gallois says that though he is concerned about the industrial issues, there is a bright side. “It’s certainly raising hurdles for increasing the production rate. But, at the same time, customers were requesting fewer planes,” he says. So that has given EADS more time to resolve the problems, though it also means more costs.Mr Gallois insists the troubles of the A380 have not been entirely in vain. “It’s a lesson learned for the A350,” he says of the group’s newest aircraft programme. The wide-bodied long-haul aircraft will be the first made using lightweight composite technology and will also help to shift the European group’s cost base away from the eurozone to dollar-based production.Mr Gallois says customer modifications will be limited on the A350.So, no in-flight showers? “No showers,” says the EADS boss. But, he adds, “that is not the most difficult” of his challenges. That is reserved for just staying the course as the climate gets stormier.
163;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-12-04T17:03:34Z;High-tech hopes are sent to Coventry;;At Ansty Park, a development site beside the M6 in Coventry, a large sign proclaims “The Future home of R&D”. But at the moment it seems to stand only as a monument to unfulfilled expectations. Behind the sign is a muddy field dotted with nettles. Beyond that is an Ericsson research centre earmarked for closure with 700 job losses.The history of Ansty Park casts a sombre light on politicians’ claims that high-tech manufacturing can reduce the trade deficit and lead the UK out of recession. Telecoms group Marconi, which began building a £120m research “campus” at Ansty in 2001, collapsed. Ericsson of Sweden announced it would pull out last month. And a mooted £40m manufacturing technology centre depends on funding from public bodies that the Conservative party has threatened to abolish.Many Britons still think of Coventry as an industrial city. But only 12 per cent of the working age population of 194,000 now toil in manufacturing. That compares with 55 per cent in the 1970s, according to Myles Mackie, corporate research co-ordinator at Coventry city council.In the past decade, Jaguar stopped assembling cars in Coventry and cut 1,150 jobs in an effort to narrow persistent losses. Telent, a telecoms company, relocated its UK base and 450 jobs from Coventry to the prosperous town of Warwick. Peugeot meanwhile made 2,300 staff redundant when it shifted production to Slovakia. Manufacturing’s share of the local economy fell a precipitous 62 per cent between 1997 and 2006, according to national statistics.Driving past derelict factories in Coventry, it is tempting to whistle “Ghost Town”, a tune by local group The Specials that encapsulated the dismal 1980s, when unemployment here was 20 per cent. That mood is abroad again near a defunct Massey Ferguson tractor plant, where Tracey Wheelan serves tea and snacks to jobseekers from a tiny van. Ms Whelan, 41, “lost everything” when her components distribution business failed. Now she is flipping burgers. “There are slow days,” she says, “but at least there is always demand for food, like there is for funerals.”Kevin Foster, deputy council leader, paints a rosier picture, talking in his office in City Hall. He says: “We saw the most eye-watering increases in unemployment during the 80s.” Coventry’s claimant count of 5.7 per cent is higher than the national average, but unexceptional historically. Big companies make headlines when they lay off thousands. Small business units, many of them with world-beating technology, attract little notice when they expand.An example is a subsidiary of US company Northrop Grumman in the suburb of Whitley, which makes bomb disposal robots. These are called “wheelbarrows” because the first primitive machine created for use in Northern Ireland incorporated wheelbarrow components. Up-to-date models, such as the Cutlass, feature arrays of cameras, sophisticated traction control and a three-fingered claw that can dismantle bombs. The company is a good example of how constant innovation keeps businesses competitive.Kevin Rooney, director of programmes at Norththrop Grumman Information Systems Europe, says that the machine “blew the competition away” to win a £65m Ministry of Defence procurement contest in 2006. Of the 100 staff, 60 are engineers. Northrop Grumman recently spent £1m extending the factory’s test area. Conditions have been tougher at Squires Gear & Engineering, a more traditional engineering business just north of the city centre. “The last year has been horrendous,” says Doug Squires, managing director, “but trading is now an improving pattern.” The business made nine of its 29 staff redundant and has cut costs to the bone.Mr Squires is proud of the thousands of vehicles across the world kept going by his components. He is equally enthusiastic about the prospects for a manufacturing-led economy, saying: “If the government wants help putting the country back on its feet, those of us hanging on in the sector will help do the job.”
164;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-12-02T19:42:39Z;Pentagon races to save air tanker contest;;The Pentagon was scrambling on Wednesday to save a multibillion dollar contest to replace the US Air Force’s ageing fleet of air refuelling tankers after Northrop Grumman and EADS in effect withdrew their joint bid.Robert Gates, US defence secretary, told the US Senate armed services committee on Wednesday that he believed “both of the principal competitors are highly qualified and we would like to see competition continue in this process”.On Tuesday, Wes Bush, Northrop’s chief operating officer, said his company had repeatedly urged defence officials to alter the bid rules, which the company says favour the smaller aircraft that its rival Boeing is likely to offer, but had been rebuffed.“As a result, I must regrettably inform you that, absent a responsive set of changes…Northrop Grumman has determined that it cannot submit a bid,” he wrote in a letter to the Department of Defense.Boeing said it was “focused on constructive engagement with our customer…to offer an advanced tanker that meets their need”.The tankers are vital to the USAF and to the companies i nvolved. The contract to supply an initial 179 aircraft could be worth up to $50bn, while follow-on deals could bring the total to more than $100bn.In 2004, Boeing was awarded a $20bn contract to supply the tankers but that was rescinded after an ethics scandal. The competition was retendered and unexpectedly won by Northrop-EADS, only for Boeing to protest successfully against decision, raising concerns about US protectionism.After those failed efforts, the current competition was supposed to be a model procurement process.Still, industry observers say both sides have rattled sabres. “The last time round Northrop did the same thing,” one industry person said. “This time people are aware it is a tactic.”The Pentagon is expected to finalise rules for the contest by January next year.
165;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-12-01T19:48:20Z;No surprise ending in the Areva T&D pantomime;;The French government’s decision to hand Areva’s transmission and distribution business to home-grown bidders – Alstom and Schneider Electric – is no exception to the old rule of continental European capitalism, especially when it comes to state-owned assets. The exception would have been if either GE of the US or Toshiba of Japan – the other two foreign bidders and both, incidentally, Areva’s competitors in the nuclear sphere – had walked away with the prize.The Chinese seemed to have understood this full well having briefly flirted with the idea of encouraging one of their sovereign funds, the China Investment Corp, to enter the bidding. But they very quickly realised that it would be pointless and that the French state had probably already chosen the winner even before the competition began.The Chinese, no beginners in the fine art of economic patriotism, were well aware of the rules of the game. One presumes the Americans and the Japanese also knew that their chances of winning the competition were slim at best. They nonetheless felt that they could at least help drive up the price of the auction to make the acquisition more costly for their French rivals.France often draws the biggest criticisms for protectionism given its fondness for its industrial champions and its reputation for chauvinism. But in reality, the French are no worse than others.Take Germany, for example. Just try to launch a hostile bid or takeover for a company such as ThyssenKrupp. The German steel conglomerate is bullet proof thanks to the Krupp foundation’s blocking stake even though it could clearly have been consolidated in the last round of steel industry consolidation. At the end of the day, it was Arcelor, the bigger European group that the French have traditionally considered theirs, that was taken over by the Indians of Mittal Steel.In Italy and Spain it is never easy, not to say impossible, to take control. Remember EDF and the French electricity company’s debacle over Edison. It did gain control of the Italian group but Rome immediately slapped a 2 per cent voting limit on its stake. And in Spain, Endesa was finally acquired by Italy’s Enel after an epic and highly political Spanish contest to keep the Germans of Eon out. There is no need bothering to mention Russia and its oil and gas industry.Even some of the so-called best in class nations behave with predictable patriotism. The US, for example, has had no hesitation in withdrawing a very large Pentagon contract for new refuelling aircraft to a partnership between Europe’s leading aerospace group, EADS, and Northrop Grumman of the US, and relaunching the competition to allow its favourite champion Boeing back in the race with considerable US congressional support. So too with the cancellation of the contract to renew the US president’s fleet of helicopters – offering US manufacturer Sikorsky a second chance after the Italian-owned AgustaWestland in partnership with Lockheed Martin won the big and prestigious original order back in 2002.Only the UK, it seems, continues to adopt a more purist stance when it comes to foreign bids. But even in Britain some are beginning to question the wisdom of allowing industrial icons to fall so easily into foreign hands.If France has a particular hang-up with foreign bidders it all really dates back to the sale of Pechiney, its aluminium champion, to the Canadians of Alcan. The company has since been dismantled in spite of all the original promises on protecting jobs and factories by the foreign bidder.It is a lesson French politicians do not intend to repeat – all the more so right now as the country continues to struggle out of the recession and with important local elections looming early next year.The Pechiney affair also motivated the government bail-out of Alstom a few years ago to avoid seeing the best pieces of the heavy engineering group go to Siemens. It also prompted the government to back the merger of Sanofi and Aventis to avoid Novartis of Switzerland moving in and threatening its domestic pharmaceutical champion.Even the new German-Canadian chief executive of Sanofi-Aventis, Chris Viehbacher, seems to have felt the need to convert himself to the French mindset. To play down his reputation as an Anglo-Saxon manager, the former GlaxoSmithKline top executive has applied for French citizenship.So Areva T&D is only the latest chapter in an old story told in all of Europe’s old continental economies. The only sad thing about this perfectly predictable industrial tale is that the French government felt it had to stage a competitive pantomime to pretend that all bids would be equally weighed and the best would win. This clearly proved to be a fairy tale that only the most gullible would believe.european.view@ft.com
166;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-11-20T02:44:16Z;Rising portfolio value bolsters KKR;;Improving value at its portfolio companies helped private equity firm KKR report economic net income of $356m for the third quarter compared with a loss of $479m a year ago.KKR’s performance underscores the extent to which private equity firms have benefited from the rally in the stock and debt markets.The firm merged on October 1 with KKR Private Equity Investors, its Amsterdam-listed unit.Reporting for the last time as a standalone unit, KPE said its net asset value rose almost 16 per cent to $3.5bn. At some point in the first half of next year, the combined firm will leave Amsterdam and relist on the New York Stock Exchange.Mark-ups in the value of portfolio companies partly reflected improved performance and partly reflected the value of comparable companies that are publicly traded.KKR bought aggressively in the boom years, seeking companies such as Dollar General which would hold up in economic downturns. Dollar General recently went public, one of many KKR-owned companies that are in line to take advantage of buoyant share prices.KKR’s results were presented in a way to appeal to shareholders. The earnings release stressed an 8 per cent growth in assets to almost $55bn, producing fee related earnings of $61.5m for the quarter. Shareholders care about fees, while investors in funds dislike fees, which they largely pay for.KKR’s results come as buy-out activity is increasing dramatically.So far this month, private equity firms have spent more than $8bn, the best month since May 2008, according to Standard & Poor’s.That figure includes KKR and General Atlantic’s $1.65bn purchase of Northrop Grumman’s TASC consulting unit.“The mix of KKR’s asset management with KPE created a leading public alternative management firm with significant embedded earnings power which we think is undervalued,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs on Thursday ahead of KKR reported its results.“We believe KKR’s franchise provides significant embedded earnings power at an attractive valuation.”The report noted that KKR is trading at 9.9 times projected 2010 earnings. That compares with Blackstone, KKR’s great rival, which is trading at 13.3 times 2010 earnings.The Goldman report added that relisting in New York “should be a positive catalyst” for KKR shares.
167;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-11-16T04:33:18Z;Tanker contest: US Air Force refuelling fight still up in the air;;When the contest to select a replacement for the US Air Force’s aging fleet of air refuelling tankers was launched for the third time at the end of September, Pentagon officials pledged that it would be a model example.Just over a month later those commitments are looking decidedly shaky. One of the bidders has raised the possibility of legal action against the USAF, while in Washington DC a proxy battle is being waged by lawmakers backing the rival teams.Disputes are par for the course in a saga that has dragged on for almost a decade. In the last contest in 2008, an Airbus and Northrop-Grumman team unexpectedly won – only for Boeing to successfully challenge the process, leading to accusations of US protectionism.With defence budgets under pressure and commercial aerospace in recession, analysts say the contract is crucial to both teams.The deal to supply an initial 179 aircraft could be worth up to $50bn, while follow-on deals could bring the total to more than $100bn.US procurement authorities are also under enormous pressure to create a competition that is free of controversy this time round, after two previous attempts collapsed amid ethics scandals and legal challenges.In its determination to create a bulletproof process, the Pentagon may have caused itself more headaches. In the last contest the USAF set 37 mandatory requirements and was able to use its best judgment to decide which capabilities were most important.This time round those subjective elements have been removed. There are now 373 mandatory requirements graded on a simple pass-fail basis. The rules are so tightly specified that the water flow in the toilets is scored as highly as the fuel offload rate.Once the key requirements are met, and certain adjustments are made, price will determine the contest. Only in the unlikely event that bids are within 1 per cent of each other will the USAF consider any additional advantages of an aircraft.Northrop executives claim that the net effect of the changes is to disadvantage their larger, “more capable” aircraft, because a tanker with fewer “bonus features” has fewer extra costs, and is therefore more likely to win.“This really is tantamount to a cost shoot-out which incentivises a ‘race to the bottom’ in terms of capability,” said Mitch Waldman, a vice-president at Northrop, at a recent press conference.To make matters worse, Northrop complains that the USAF unfairly gave Boeing access to its previous bid proposal but did not hand over reciprocal information. A spokesman says it is considering a number of options including legal action.Northrop executives are also highly critical of the USAF’s decision to remove any detailed assessment of project risk and to accept a much slower timetable for the programme – changes, it claims, that help Boeing.Behind Northrop’s anger is a sense that it is the wronged party, having won the previous contest only for Boeing to protest.As a result, the team is pressing for the USAF to rerun the last competition with the minimal required changes.Congressional supporters have been less tactful. In late October, Richard Shelby, senator for Alabama – a state that would benefit should Northrop win – said the USAF was “tilting the process” so Boeing would prevail. “I think it’s a sham process at the moment,” he said.For its part, Boeing is keeping a relatively low profile. “While our opponent and their supporters have begun attacking the US Air Force and [contest], we have chosen to work within the process,” a spokesman says.The company says that in August 2008, the government released “consistent [tanker contest] pricing information to both sides … and has already handed over a comparative amount of Boeing’s pricing data from the previous competition.”Data is unlikely to settle the matter, however, says Scott Hamilton, an aviation industry consultant.“This is not a contest about technical merits but about Boeing versus Airbus, America versus France … and Boeing has the stronger political backers.”Indeed, political supporters from Boeing’s home states have been notably vocal on its behalf. Last week 40 lawmakers wrote to President Barack Obama urging him to ensure the tanker contest penalised Airbus for what they claim are breaches of international rules on trade subsidies.To create a “level playing field” the letter said, the price formula “must reflect in some way the amount of illegal subsidies that aided the development of the Airbus airframe and may thereby allow EADS, Airbus’s parent company, to submit a reduced price bid.”For the USAF, the complaints are frustrating.“This is a tough project. We don’t need all of the … complicating elements that are added to that when people try to develop campaigns in favour of their programme,” said Michael Donley, Air Force secretary, recently.But they are clearly having some effect. Although Mr Donley said that the main outlines of the contest were put together well, he added that “I would imagine that we are going to consider some change to the [contest rules].”The USAF is currently considering comments on the draft bid rules and will produce a final set of requirements some time later this month before selecting a contract winner in June.Still, whoever wins the contest could be in for some challenging times.In another unusual move for a development contract, the air force is looking for an 18-year, fixed-price contract. Historically such deals have been expensive for everyone involved.
168;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-11-09T22:14:00Z;US stocks rally on deals;;"Deal activity by companies from chocolate makers to a nuclear submarine manufacturer buoyed Wall Street confidence on Monday, lifting US stocks after last week’s strong gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2 per cent at 10,226.94, its highest level since October last year.The S&P 500 gained 2.2 per cent to 1,093.08 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2 per cent at 2,154.06.In spite of volatile trading, Wall Street closed higher every day last week, shrugging off Friday’s data that showed a spike in unemployment.A rally in the technology sector after Cisco’s results gave the Nasdaq its biggest daily gain since July.“The market was probably too short going into those payroll numbers and the fact that there wasn’t a downside on Friday has injected some confidence,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.After an indicative offer two months ago, Kraft launched a formal hostile bid for Cadbury on Monday, valuing the UK company at £9.8bn ($16.4bn).The terms were the same as the original offer but, due to the fall in Kraft’s share price, the implied value of the latest bid was slightly lower. Cadbury rejected the offer as “derisory”.While the deal activity boosted market sentiment, Kraft was the only Dow company to end the day in negative territory, losing 0.9 per cent to $26.53. Cadbury shares edged up in London.In other deals, Northrop Grumman, one of the largest US defence contractors, agreed to sell TASC, its advisory services unit, for $1.65bn to private equity groups General Atlantic and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.The sale is the latest sign of a revival in leveraged buy-outs. Northrop rose 3 per cent to $53.93.Reports also revealed that Comcast was planning to finalise a deal to buy a controlling stake in NBC Universal from General Electric by next Monday. The acquisition would create one of the US’s largest media companies and values NBC Universal at about $30bn.Comcast rose 3.8 per cent to $15.15 and General Electricgained 3.4 per cent to $15.85.A pledge by the G20 over the weekend to keep stimulus programmes in place until the recovery was more certain added to the market’s optimism and boosted financial stocks. Bank of Americawas up 4.8 per cent to $15.77 and Citigroup gained 3.2 per cent to $4.19.Elsewhere in the banking sector, East West Bancorpsurged 55 per cent to $13.41 after the California-based bank purchased its main rival United Commercial Bank (UCB), which was seized by regulators last week.UCB, based in San Francisco, was the 120th bank to fail this year and was estimated to have assets worth $11.2bn. Morgan Stanley analysts welcomed the deal, upgrading East West from “equal-weight” to “overweight”.The G20 assurances pushed gold to fresh highs and boosted other metal prices. ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, was raised from “neutral” to “buy” by MF Global, pushing the shares 4.9 per cent higher to $36.82.United States Steel gained 3.6 per cent to $38.11 and the S&P Materials sector was up 3.2 per cent.Global sales figures from McDonald’s sent shares in the fast food chain up 1.5 per cent to $62.64.Total like-for-like sales rose 3.3 per cent in October, helped by strong demand from Europe. The gains help to offset a 0.1 per cent decline in US sales – the first monthly decline in the fast food retailer’s home market since March 2008.Shares in RadioShack, the electronics retailer, were set to hit their highest level for two years after jumping 14.3 per cent to $20.27. The chain announced plans to sell versions of Apple’s iPhone later this month.Dish Network rose 5.2 per cent to $20.14 after the company, America’s second-largest satellite TV provider, beat Wall Street forecasts.Trex, the deckings and railings maker, was one of the market’s few casualties.Its shares fell 2.5 per cent to $16.86 after the group posted a quarterly loss due to an impairment charge and continued weakness

169;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-11-08T23:39:36Z;Northrop agrees TASC sale;;"Northrop Grumman has agreed to sell TASC, its advisory services division, for $1.65bn to a private equity group, General Atlantic and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co, in the latest sign of life in leveraged buy-outs.The deal was viewed as one benchmark to gauge the health of the private equity industry and comes on the heels of this year’s biggest leveraged buy-out deal.Last week, TPG Capital and Canada Pension Plan struck a $5.2bn deal to buy IMS Health, a provider of prescription-drug data.Northrop, one of the largest US defence contractors, will net $1.1bn in cash, which it will use to fund a stock repurchase, the company said.The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.The sale was also designed to comply with new organisational conflict-of-interest rules, said Ronald Sugar, chairman and chief executive of Northrop Grumman.TASC is part of Northrop Grumman’s Information Systems sector and advises the US military. It has about 5,000 employees.The division expects 2009 revenue of about $1.6bn.Wood Parker, general manager of TASC and prospective chief executive, said: “We will now have more flexibility to invest in research and development as well as in retaining and attracting the finest talent in the nation.”Financing for the purchase will be comprised of senior secured credit facilities by a group including Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank Securities; and senior subordinated notes, arranged by KKR Capital Markets with Highbridge Mezzanine Partners as the lead investor, the private equity group said.Northrop said the divestiture would be neutral to 2010 earnings per share from continuing operations.Mr Sugar in September announced he would step down as chief executive and would be replaced by Wesley Bush, Northrop president and chief operating officer."
170;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:27+0000;BAE looks to fighter jets for growth;;At the BAE Systems combat jet production complex at Samlesbury, Lancashire, engineers busy themselves beneath a banner in the main workshed. “F-35 Joint Strike Fighter” it reads, “where our future comes together.”Europe’s biggest defence contractor has invested about £80m in the site, building offices and production sheds for the F-35, the next-generation fighter that it is making with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, the US defence groups.BAE plans to invest 10 times that amount as it works its way to the full production rate of one a day by 2016, gambling that demand for the jet will withstand the coming defence budget cuts and become the key driver of growth.The opportunities are huge. The US and its international partners intend to buy about 3,000 over the next several decades and BAE has 17 per cent of the work, making the aft fuselage and parts of the wing and tail in Samlesbury and key electronics at its plants in the US.The aircraft is moving from development to low-rate production, but until the full revenues filter through, BAE has a 33 per cent workshare on the Eurofighter Typhoon, the European collaborative combat jet, to keep it busy.At the moment, it is assembling about 20 aircraft a year to meet orders from Saudi Arabia and the UK. Analysts expect equipment and support contracts from the oil kingdom alone to bring in revenues of about £29bn up to 2030.Kevin Taylor, managing director of BAE’s Military Air Solutions business, says: “With the Typhoon and the F-35 we have the chance to dominate the sector in the short, medium and longer term.”Expectations within the company are certainly high. In the past year, growth at BAE’s flagship North American armoured vehicles unit has stalled and at its interim results, Ian King, BAE chief executive, said the F-35 and Eurofighter would pick up the slack.Outsiders are equally optimistic. Analysts expect the programmes & support division, which is home to BAE’s MAS unit, to overtake the land & armaments business as the company’s largest next year, earning revenues of about £6.3bn.As of October, the company had already eclipsed its 2008 order intake of £2.2bn, thanks to a contract for a third batch of Eurofighters and a number of long-term support contracts which make up a growing part of the business.Still, the focus on aircraft is not without its costs and risks.In September, BAE said it would cut about 1,100 jobs as it completes legacy aircraft and redeploys its resources. And BAE’s reputation took a blow last week when it was criticised heavily for failings that contributed to the fatal 2006 Nimrod surveillance aircraft disaster.Meanwhile, the US Government Accountability Office, a watchdog, has raised concerns about the plan to run F-35 testing in parallel with production. The fear is that a serious flaw will be found after producing hundreds of aircraft, necessitating an expensive retrofit.BAE’s Mr Taylor points out there are advantages to being a sub-contractor in that regard.His unit, he says, has a “build to print contract” and any changes would be beneficial to BAE at least in the short term.The GAO also notes that delays and technical problems have already caused the likely unit cost of the aircraft to spiral from $69m to $104m, raising questions about whether anyone but the US will be able to afford them.Indeed, there are widespread concerns that even the UK, which is the only level one partner on the project and has already invested heavily in development, may cut its order of 138 aircraft.Chris Addison, a project director on the F-35 programme, argues that the UK orders are marginal given the total US requirement and that BAE’s contract is firm but says that any cuts could weaken the company’s hand.With the US firmly committed, the key challenge for BAE, he says, is managing the production increase effectively. This year, the company will make components for 17 aircraft. Next year, the output will almost double to keep up with the schedule.“That creates a large element of risk but we are doing the most we can to mitigate it,” Mr Addison says. That means investing in plant in advance and improving processes continually. Workers say they have learnt 5,000 lessons from the first production model.Somewhat counter intuitively, Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Evolution Securities, argues that BAE’s current share price, which is down 17 per cent in the year to date, should give investors a degree of comfort.“Clearly there are some risks but the valuation of the shares means they are more than fully discounted already,” Mr Cunningham adds.

Second Life Enterprise, announced on Wednesday, is a version of the virtual world for business, packaged as an appliance that can be plugged easily into a corporate network.This behind-the-firewall product should give a second enterprise life to Second Life, satisfying the reservations of businesses who feel the consumer-driven open world does not have enough security, controls and content for their needs.Linden Lab, Second Life’s creator, is offering a complete package, rather like Google’s bright yellow search appliance. It will supply and provide support for a server that can be added to a company network, with a private version of Second Life installed on it. Pricing starts at $55,000.Workers will have Second Life client software installed on their PCs and the new corporate world will come with pre-installed essential elements and sets of standard business avatars.“Out of the box, the system comes with content such as meeting rooms and conference areas, which are just ready to go,” Chris Collins, Enterprise general manager at Linden Lab, told me.“There’s also a marketplace – an area where users can purchase content for their meeting rooms, or if they’re the military, it could be content for tanks and planes, all the way up to full software applications.”This Second Life Work Marketplace, due to launch in the first quarter of next year, should provide fresh opportunities for Second Life’s ecosystem of developers producing virtual goods and enterprise applications.An open beta testing phase for Second Life Enterprise begins today before a launch in the New Year. Those taking part include IBM, Northrop Grumman, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center and DefenseWeb Technologies.Some, like IBM, have already set up substantial virtual operations in the existing Second Life. They will now have the option to move these behind their organisation’s firewalls or combine the two worlds as they continue work such as prototyping, simulation, training, product design and collaboration.More than 1,400 organisations are currently using Second Life. IBM and Linden Lab announced in April last year that they would work together to develop an enterprise-class virtual world that would convince companies of the value of communicating through avatars and 3D environments.
172;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-10-21T14:26:53Z;Northrop Grumman raises profit forecasts;;Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor best known for its nuclear submarines, increased its full-year profit forecasts even as it said that higher pensions contributions had hit third-quarter earnings.The third-biggest defence company in the US by revenues said its net income fell 4 per cent to $490m in the three months to the end of September on sales up 4 per cent to $8.73bn.The company made cash contributions to its pension plans of $544m over the period, bringing the total for the first nine months to $800m as it sought to cover substantial unfunded pension liabilities.Still, the Los Angeles based company comfortably beat analysts’ expectations for earnings per share thanks to a series of share buy-backs that reduced the number of outstanding shares, and a lower tax rate.Northrop posted earnings per share of $1.52, compared with analysts’ estimates of $1.20 a share, up about 1 per cent compared with the previous year. The company raised its full-year guidance from between $4.65 and $4.90 to between $5.00 and $5.15.“This was another solid quarter for Northrop Grumman, continuing our focus on managing risk, improving performance and driving growth,” said Ronald Sugar, the chief executive officer.After almost six years as chief executive, Dr Sugar will be replaced by the current chief operating officer, Wes Bush, in January.Northrop shares rose 2.4 per cent to $51 in early US trading.Over the financial year to date, net income was roughly flat at $1.3bn on revenues that climbed 5 per cent to $26bn.“The beat and raise from Northrop is a pleasant surprise, as the company has struggled recently with writedowns in its ships segment,” said Rob Stallard, with Macquarie Research.But he added that the company may “not be out of the woods on pensions, as the discount rate could still come in lower than expected”.The underlying trading picture at Northrop was mixed. Sales and operating income rose strongly in the aerospace unit, which makes unmanned aerial vehicles, and the information systems division, which makes biometric ID systems.However, the margins at the shipbuilding unit continued to suffer from higher than expected production costs on certain expeditionary warfare and surface combatant ships.In total, Northrop won contracts worth $10bn during the period bringing the order backlog to $71.5bn compared with $70.4bn at the end of June.Northrop is currently teamed with EADS, the European aerospace and defence conglomerate, in a competition to replace the US Air Force’s fleet of ageing air-to-air refuelling tankers .
173;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-10-04T22:50:10Z;Auctions show dealmakers’ creativity;;A Kohlberg Kravis Roberts-led consortium is leading the bidding for the $1bn-plus services unit of Northrop Grumman in one of two auctions being closely watched by dealmakers to judge the health of the private equity industry.In the other auction, for Travel Channel, which is owned by Cox Communications, bids from Providence Equity Partners and others are pushing the expected price towards $800m.Both auctions have attracted interest from the buy-out sector, as much for the creative methods being used to push the deals towards the finish line as to gauge whether the industry is starting to recover from the collapse of the credit markets.Providence Equity is bidding for Travel Channel through a potential strategic partnership with Discovery Communications, which will not provide equity. Providence may structure its offer as a “leveraged partnership”, according to a person close to the matter.In such a set-up, Cox and the Providence group would contribute assets to a new joint venture, with Cox funnelling in the majority of the assets. The Providence group would own most of the equity in the joint venture, while Cox would receive a significant cash distribution.There are still other bidders in the hunt for Travel Channel, including Scripps Network, News Corporation and buy-out firms KKR and TH Lee, which is bidding with one of the corporate suitors.The auction of Northrop’s advisory services business, which provides technical advice to clients including the US Defense Department, has drawn bidders including Blackstone and two teams – one between Welsh Carson and Providence and another between KKR and General Atlantic, according to people close to the matter.The KKR/General Atlantic team appears to be the auction’s leading candidate as other bidders have pulled out, these people said. It remained unclear, however, as to whether Science Applications International Corporation, a rival engineering and technical advisory company, is interested in buying the business.In a sign that the market for buy-out financing is softening, one person involved in the process said several private equity bidders received financing commitments from multiple banks. However, the high-yield debt markets are still much tougher to navigate than the investment-grade markets that have helped drive a recent spurt in corporate mergers and acquisitions.“It’s certainly not the same old buy-out game, but sponsors are looking at lots of different transactions and ways to proceed and people are going to get creative,” this person said.
174;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Pentagon faces fresh flak over tanker deal;;Just days after relaunching a multi-billion dollar competition to replace the US Air Force’s ageing fleet of air refuelling tankers and insisting it would be a model of impartial procurement, the Pentagon has come under attack for “unfair” practices.On Friday the department of defence released its draft request for proposals (RFP), the first step in the acquisition process. It assured Congress and the media that the contest would be played “straight down the middle”.Boeing, the US aerospace company, is competing against a Northrop Grumman and Airbus team for the first slice of the programme. The USAF has described it as its highest priority, and follow-on contracts could bring the total value to $100bn.Northrop is already worried that the focus on the price of the aircraft places it at a disadvantage.The company has long complained that its rival was given access to its sensitive pricing data after losing the last tanker competition, while it had not received similar information about Boeing.Paul K. Meyer, a vice-president with Northrop, said that with Northrop proposing the same aircraft as last time, “such competitive pricing information takes on even greater importance”. He said: “It is fundamentally unfair, and distorts any new competition, to provide such critical information to only one of the bidders.”Northrop said it was reviewing its options and would work with the customer to resolve the issue.Last week, the DoD said it had examined the concerns and found the disclosures “created no competitive disadvantage because the data in question are inaccurate, outdated and not germane to this source-selection strategy.”A Boeing spokesman said: “Our position is that the USAF clearly and definitively dealt with this issue and we look forward to our first meeting with the Air Force in this competition.”Despite the controversy, Scott Hamilton, an aviation industry consultant, said that RFP had proved a mixed bag for both teams. The USAF ignored demands from Boeing supporters that it penalise Airbus for receiving “illegal” subsidies.Conversely, Airbus and Northrop had hoped that the procurement would focus on the capability of the aircraft rather than their price, giving its larger aircraft an advantage. But in the end it too was disappointed. The two teams now have about 60 days to comment on the RFP after which the Pentagon will release a final RFP. The government expects to take up to 120 days to evaluate the bids, and aims to award a contract in summer 2010.The Northrop claims threaten to embroil the contest in the type of controversy that derailed two previous attempts to let the contract to replace 179 of the air force’s 50-year-old tankers.In 2004, the first effort to replace the tankers using a $20bn lease-and-buy combination collapsed amid an ethics scandal which saw Boeing’s former chief financial officer and a top Air Force procurement official sent to prison.In 2008, the EADS and Northrop-Grumman team unexpectedly won the contest only for Boeing to challenge the process leading to widespread accusations of US protectionism. Previous failures have placed Pentagon officials under enormous pressure to create a competition that is free of controversy this time round.“[The US] cannot afford the kind of letdowns and parochial squabbles and corporate food fights that have bedevilled this effort over the last number of years,” Robert Gates, defence secretary, said recently.But the warnings appear to have fallen on deaf ears, said Mr Hamilton, the industry consultant. “This is shaping up to be another ugly contest.”
175;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-09-24T21:45:07Z;Pentagon in third attempt to replace fleet;;The Pentagon is set to restart a much delayed and controversial $35bn competition to replace the US Air Force’s ageing fleet of air refuelling tankers, marking its third attempt at letting the contract.The contest once again pits Boeing, the US aerospace and defence contractor, against a joint US and European team led by Northrop Grumman and EADS, the Franco-German parent of Airbus, the aircraft maker. With defence budgets under pressure around the world and commercial aerospace suffering amid the economic downturn, analysts say the contract to supply an initial 179 aircraft is crucial to the prospects of both teams.Follow-on deals to replace the rest of the USAF’s 50-year-old fleet of tankers could bring the total procurement to 600 aircraft over 40 years, costing more than $100bn.History suggests the battle will become highly politicised after the previous two attempts to award the contract both collapsed in controversial circumstances.The first effort to replace the tankers in 2004 fell apart amid a scandal that rocked Washington. Boeing was initially awarded a $20bn contract to supply the tankers but that was rescinded after an ethics scandal, which resulted in prison sentences for the US defence contractor’s chief financial officer and a top air force procurement official.The competition was re-tendered and unexpectedly won by the Northrop-EADS team. But last year the contract was cancelled again after Boeing successfully challenged the process leading to widespread accusations of US protectionism.Ahead of the latest contest, Congressmen with Boeing factories in their constituencies have started a campaign against Airbus accusing it of benefiting from illegal government subsidies after the World Trade Organisation issued a preliminary ruling on the issue earlier this month.Pentagon officials are under pressure to create a competition that is free of controversy. On Thursday, they briefed US politicians on what the USAF has described as its highest priority project in an attempt to reassure them the process would be fair.“[The United States] cannot afford the kind of letdowns and parochial squabbles and corporate food fights that have bedevilled this effort over the last number of years,” Robert Gates, defence secretary, said recently.The US Department of Defense is expected to issue a draft request for proposals, the first step in the acquisition process, on Friday. The request is seen as particularly important because it will give a clear indication of how the air force will judge the entries.In the run up to the bid, EADS and Northrop expressed concerns that the US would focus on price rather than on the capability of the aircraft, putting its larger modified A330 aircraft with its heavier fuel load at a disadvantage.Boeing for its part has toyed with the idea of offering a bigger aircraft than the 767 which was the basis of its previous bids.
176;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-09-18T22:12:31Z;Northrop chief to step down;;The head of Northrop Grumman, the US’s second-biggest defence contractor, has announced plans to retire at the end of the year.Ronald Sugar, chairman and chief executive, said he would step down after six years in the job, handing over the reins to Wesley Bush, Northrop’s president and chief operating officer.Mr Sugar’s departure comes at a challenging time for the defence industry, with the economic downturn placing renewed pressure on Pentagon budgets. Northrop, the world’s largest builder of naval vessels, said last month that its second-quarter profit fell by 20 per cent compared with the previous year.Mr Sugar, who has almost three decades of experience in the industry, will stay on as an adviser until next June.
177;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-09-08T02:10:23Z;Industry redraws its battleplan for a new era;;Over the past year defence stocks have taken a beating. In the US, Lockheed Martin shares are down 40 per cent while Northrop Grumman has lost almost 30 per cent of its value. In Europe, BAE Systems and Finmeccanica shares have fallen by similar amounts.Valuations have been hit even harder with forward price-to-earnings multiples, a measure of investor appetite for a stock, dropping to just under nine times 2010 earnings, their lowest levels since the early 1990s.Back then the falls presaged a brutal period for the defence industry. With the cold war at an end, US spending on defence fell by more than half leading to a wave of consolidation and savage cuts in employment.Investors fear a repeat performance and some analysts say, with good reason. In the UK, where the equipment programme is already widely regarded as underfunded, spending is likely to fall by between 10 and 15 per cent according to some estimates as the Treasury seeks to address huge public deficits.The government has promised a foreign policy led defence review next year, but when it arrives drastic equipment cuts are likely to steal the limelight. Two aircraft carriers could be reduced to one while an upgrade to the Trident nuclear deterrent could be postponed.“It is clear that there is a black hole in the defence budget,” a recent report led by two prominent British politicians concluded. “[The government] should explore all viable options for capability downgrading and quantity reductions as well as for complete cancellation of some equipment programmes.”But while damaging for the UK defence capability, any cuts may in fact have only a limited impact on UK defence companies, says Sandy Morris, an aerospace and defence analyst with RBS and a long-time observer of the sector.“Industry by and large has long since decided that we have a Mickey Mouse defence policy and has fled [to the US]. Even fairly significant cuts in the UK are barely going to have a material impact on BAE Systems, Cobham and Ultra Electronics.”The picture in the US also looks challenging though. The core US defence budget will edge towards $600bn a year but the supplemental budgets, which fund current operations, will decline sharply as the US winds down in Iraq and wages a more limited campaign in Afghanistan.As a result the total US spend on research and new procurement will fall about $45bn from its 2008 peak by 2010, equivalent to more than two times the entire Navy shipbuilding budget, according to Marty Bollinger, head of the defence practice at Booz & Company. He believes total investment spending could drop by 40 per cent in real terms over the next three years. That could lead to a radical shake-up of the sector.In the 1990s, the industry reduced capacity through a wave of mergers, but with so few players left that is no longer an option. Instead, traditional contractors will lose market share to “disruptive companies” that offer good-enough but not “exquisite” products.Mr Bollinger expects companies such as Eurocopter, the helicopter group owned by EADS, to do well by taking advantage of its global scale and ability to adapt commercial products to military uses at good prices.Defence companies are also likely to focus on providing support services, such as repairs and training, for the military as US spending on operations and maintenance overtakes the investment budget for the first time.Not everyone expects such a dramatic change. Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Evolution Securities, sees the recent share price movements as yet another example of investors looking to profit from an upturn in the economy by buying cyclical stocks.Underlying trading, he argues, has remained strong. In the first half most defence companies produced solid results, generating cash and building order books. A constant refrain was that programme cuts in some areas had resulted in gains in other areas.At BAE Systems, for example, Ian King, chief executive, noted that a slowdown in demand for its heavily armoured vehicles would probably be offset by a pick-up in combat aircraft sales as production of the F-35, America’s newest combat jet, ramps up.Certain areas of the budget will grow even as total spending declines.The quadrennial review, due shortly, will probably confirm the US administration’s intention to shift funds from expensive platforms such as the F-22 stealth fighter jet to support “irregular” warfare and current operations.In preparation for the emerging trends, global defence companies have been scooping up midsized suppliers with products aimed at defence electronics, unmanned aerial vehicles and cybersecurity.In one of the larger deals this year, General Dynamics, best known for its armoured vehicles, bought Axsys Technologies, a maker of sensors and cameras for the military, for $643m.Foreign sales are another potential bright spot. According to Frost & Sullivan, the consultancy, in the next 10 years India will spend $100bn on equipment while Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries are increasing their spending on defence.For all the talk of budget cuts, Alberto De Benedictis, chief executive of Finmeccanica UK, argues that countervailing pressures will make it hard for governments to reduce defence spending, regardless of their financial position.“In the 1990s there was a clear change in the global strategic scenario, but this time round there is no such change. The threats remain the same. What we do have is a period of budget constraint.”Afghanistan for example, could flare up at any time, requiring greater expenditures. In recent days Admiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, admitted the situation was “serious and it is deteriorating” adding to the clamour for more troops.Still, Mr Bollinger worries that the fat years and the inevitable time lag between cuts at the policy level and the impact on the industrial base have made executives slow to recognise the scale of the challenges ahead.“The scale of the downturn is going to be of the same magnitude as in the 1990s, so why would you expect to see a different outcome?” he asks.
178;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-08-26T23:40:37Z;GE seeks to sell security division for $2bn;;General Electric is looking to sell its security business, which makes alarms, surveillance systems and other safety products, and hopes to attract bids in the range of $2bn for the unit, according to people close to the matter.The US conglomerate has received preliminary indications of interest from rival manufacturers looking at the unit, and is now working towards securing another round of more definitive bids, these people said.The move to sell part or all of GE Security – one of more than a dozen business units at the manufacturing conglomerate – represents a step in GE’s effort to exit lines of business that are not key to its operations. GE Security builds fire, safety and security systems and other products for homes, offices and the government.People close to the sale process, which is being managed by JPMorgan, say the business has drawn interest from GE’s rivals in the security sector such as United Technologies, Tyco and Germany’s Robert Bosch GmBH.Security assets have historically lured private equity buyers as well, but a combination of the difficult financing environment and an expressed interest by GE in selling the assets to a strategic buyer could hamper any buy-out effort.It remains unclear whether potential buyers will be interested in GE Security’s full portfolio of products, which could prompt debate over whether the company should entertain bids for pieces of the business rather than only for the whole.GE, known for making products ranging from lightbulbs to washing machines, has particularly suffered lately from its exposure to the financial services industry. But it is not the only manufacturing conglomerate looking to shed non-core assets.Northrop Grumman, the US defence company, is also trying to sell its consulting and advanced engineering operations, which provides advice to military and intelligence customers.Such businesses have also historically attracted private equity buyers. Carlyle Group, a Washington-based private equity firm, bought Booz Allen Hamilton’s government consulting business last year.GE suffered a setback earlier this month when it agreed to a $50m settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission over charges of accounting fraud in 2002 and 2003.GE did not admit or deny the allegations, which prompted a four-year probe of a range of accounting issues.Shares of the company, which declined to comment on Wednesday, closed 1.33 per cent, or 19 cents lower, at $14.11 in New York.
179;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-07-08T01:27:49Z;Labour opens way to armed forces review;;"Bob Ainsworth, the defence secretary, initiated planning for the first strategic defence review in more than a decade on Tuesday, triggering a process that will define a new role for the armed forces in an era of fiscal austerity.Mr Ainsworth ordered an initial study – principally covering policy rather than equipment – to be produced by early next year, which will feed into a full review after the election.The decision was made after months of political pressure on ministers to launch a formal re-examination of military priorities in light of an overstretched budget, changing threats and the lessons from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.Defence industry insiders dismissed these moves as far too late; critical decisions on some big equipment programmes would have to be taken before a full review could be completed.The restricted remit of the interim review is seen by defence officials as a pragmatic step that gives space for policy development without being overwhelmed by budget fights.In a statement to the Commons, Mr Ainsworth said it would assess lessons learnt from Iraq and Afghanistan, technological changes, the potential for improved ways to procure equipment and better co-ordination in Whitehall.Many controversial decisions are deferred to a full review in the next parliament, including whether Britain needs or can afford its order of aircraft carriers or replacing the Trident nuclear deterrent.Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said industry and the armed forces were “desperate” for a review to begin."
180;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-06-29T16:09:05Z;Cobham wins US Army contract;;Cobham has won its largest contract, to supply communications equipment for trucks and tanks to the US Army, which could be worth up to $2.4bn over the next 10 years.The aerospace and defence company will work with an American partner, Northrop Grumman, to provide its Vis-X system – an internet protocol-based intercom for a range of vehicles including Humvees and Abrams tanks.Cobham and Northrop, which have worked together for 15 years, will continue to supply its older VIC-3 system to support the 85,000 vehicles in which it is already installed.For Cobham the contract win is a useful fillip for revenues and evidence that its decision to market and invest in the US was sound.Earnings from the deal will be split evenly with Northrop, implying that the contract could be worth up to $120m a year to Cobham, or about 4 per cent of forecast group revenues for 2011.Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas said: “This is good news for Cobham and illustrates the group’s ability to win significant contracts in a tightening US defence budget environment.”The deal suggests that foreign companies can still access the US defence market.In recent months European companies had worried that the cancellation of a number of high-profile international programmes such as the presidential helicopter replacement hinted at a more protectionist tone in US procurement policy.“People who say that it’s difficult to win business in the US as a UK manufacturing company will need to think again,” Mr Cook said.Cobham shares rose 1.4p to 173.9p.
181;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-06-29T16:05:31Z;Upgraded Lloyds lifts banking sector;;Lloyds Banking Group was the top performer on Monday as the London market moved higher.Lloyds gained 6.1 per cent to 70.56p on the back of an upgrade from Goldman Sachs and speculation of further state help for the banking sector.Goldman added Lloyds to its “conviction buy” list as part of a sector review.It saw the lender able to exploit its market share — the biggest of any G7 bank — when growth returned in 2011.“Lloyds had the highest return on equity of all large cap European banks pre-crisis and we believe it is likely to return to delivering among the highest in a post-crisis world,” the broker said.It forecast that Lloyds, after two lossmaking years, would earn 15p per share by 2011. This made it “the lowest value large-cap European bank”, Goldman told clients.Meanwhile, Lloyds shares were helped by revived speculation that the UK could announce a new “bad bank” scheme to buy up toxic loans.Royal Bank of Scotland gained 2.3 per cent to 39p while Barclays was up 4.3 per cent to 279.65p. The FTSE 100 closed 1.3 per cent higher, gaining 53.02 points to 4,294.03. Activity reflected a slow start to the week with total volume down about a third on the recent average.An upgrade from Credit Suisse helped Admiral, the motor insurer, take on 3.2 per cent to 883½p,“Admiral is ideally positioned to take advantage of improving pricing conditions in the UK personal motor market,” said the broker. While rivals rebuild capital positions, Admiral should be able to give the increased earnings back to shareholders, it said.Other insurers followed the market trend higher with Prudential ahead 5.9 per cent to 422¾p and Aviva up 3.4 per cent to 341½p.Defence contractor Cobham was up 1.8 per cent to 175.6p after its joint venture with Northrop Grumman won a US intercom order estimated to be worth $2.4bn over 10 years. Rolls-Royce, which agreed to buy a stake in Norwegian oilfield engineer Odim, closed 3.6 per cent better at 365¾p.Vodafone edged higher by 1.2 per cent to 117.6p. Analysts welcomed news that Vodafone was looking at rival UK network T-Mobile, but were sceptical over the prospect of such a deal clearing competition hurdles.Elsewhere among the gainers, Rio Tintowas 4.5 per cent higher at £21.53 on news that Chinalco would participate in Rio’s rights issue.Other miners were rangebound after shareholders of Vale encouraged the Brazilian group to retain cash rather than bid for rivals. Xstrata was the sharpest faller, losing 2 per cent to 672.1p.Anglo American edged up 0.5 per cent to £18.13 following reports that it would look to investment from China and the Middle East to defend itself against Xstrata’s merger approach.Anglo should instead invite bids by spinning off its Anglo Platinum unit, Merrill Lynch said.“We think that if a competitive bidding process for the Anglo rump did materialise, it could create material value for shareholders,” it said. “The remaining rump with quality base metal, coal and iron ore assets could be an attractive M&A target not just to Xstrata but to other industry players who may be put off by platinum’s labour intensive underground mining methods and resultant safety issues.”National Express led the mid-cap risers, rising 9.8 per cent to 302¾p on news that it had rejected a preliminary takeover approach from First Group. FirstGroup was off 1.3 per cent to 366p.ITV was up 3 per cent to 34¾p following a suggestion that Sir Philip Green and Simon Cowell could be planning a bid.The TV talent show judge has been working with the retail billionaire to set up a production company, leading some to believe that they have larger ambitions.Tullett Prebon rose 8.6 per cent to 293¼p after Terry Smith, its chief executive, and finance director Paul Mainwaring added to their holdings.A reassuring trading statement helped Informa gain 9.1 per cent to 231p.Jubilee Platinum stood out among the small caps when its share price rose 50.4 per cent to 53¾p.The gains came after the company was forced by the Johannesburg stock exchange, where it also has a listing, to reveal the existence of talks that, if “successfully concluded”, could have a material effect on the share price.The speculation was that Jubilee, which recently said its Tjate project in South Africa could contain 44m ounces of platinum-group metals, was looking to merge with a rival.Alizyme dropped 50.9 per cent to 2.88p after the biotech company warned that it would run out of cash by August and was seeking to raise funds.Previously, Alizyme bel-ieved it had sufficient funding to last to April/May 2010, but that was before it encountered problems with milestone payments.Airsprung Furniturerose 90 per cent to 19p after the mattress maker announced a return to profit and a ½p-a-share dividend.Earthport, the payment protection specialist, firmed 6.3 per cent to 67¼p on rumours of a bid approach while Coffeeheaven marked time at 21p in spite of rumours that a 30p a share offer could be tabled.Immersion Technology added 35 per cent to 0.77p as investors reacted to last week’s news that the shell company was to target acquisitions in the oil and gas industry.Traders believe David Lenigas, the non-executive chairman, has identified targets.Alterian, which designs databases and software platforms for the marketing industry, rose 0.2 per cent to 128½p after Panmure Gordon advised clients to “buy” ahead of Thursday’s “teach-in”.“As investors look across the sector for companies with scale, global footprint, established US presence and large spread of customers, we expect Alterian to attract a wider investor franchise,” said George O’Connor, analyst.
182;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-06-16T22:26:12Z;Countdown restarts on US air force deal;;In order to win the contest to replace America’s ageing fleet of air tankers, Northrop Grumman and its European partner EADS will have to convince government officials that they are no more foreign than their US rival Boeing.Just weeks before the $35bn competition to build about 179 new refuelling aircraft for the US air force restarts, Ron Sugar, chief executive of Northrop, said the contest was not between US and foreign teams.“It is between two international teams,” he said arguing that Boeing, like EADS and Northrop will manufacture part of their aircraft partially in the US and partially abroad.He added that there was precedent for the US awarding large-scale defence contracts to foreign companies and had not been perturbed by recent decisions taken by the department of defence to cut or cancel prominent European programmes such as the presidential helicopter replacement.His comments on the sidelines of the Paris air show came as both competitors gear up for the restart of the controversial contest.The US government is expected to issue a draft request for proposals, the first step in the acquisition process, early next month.In an earlier battle for the contract in 2008, Northrop’s partnership with the Franco-German aerospace group left it open to charges of exporting jobs abroad.The team eventually and unexpectedly won that contest, but Boeing successfully challenged the process and the contract was overturned.Mr Sugar estimates that the Northrop-EADS proposal to build a modified version of the Airbus A330 would create about 50,000 jobs throughout the US and that American components would make up 60 per cent of the aircraft.Boeing’s proposal for the previous competition involved building a modified version of its 767 aircraft, with 15 per cent of the work to be done abroad. Boeing has yet to specify its latest proposal.Mr Sugar’s statements come after a topsy-turvy few days for the tanker competitors.Over the weekend, Boeing confirmed it was considering offering the US air force a much larger aircraft than first thought, surprising industry analysts and its competitors.Next week Northrop will launch a print ad-campaign under the heading “Best value. Defined,” which compares the performance of the A330 with the 767 Boeing offered last time.In earlier competitions Boeing made a virtue of its 767 being relatively small and less expensive compared with its rival.
183;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-06-14T23:47:15Z;Profile: General Atomics;;General Atomics is by most measures an unusual company.It works on nuclear fusion research and also on magnetic levitation trains, pollution prevention software, and unmanned aerial vehicles. It is privately owned but is dependent on public money for most of its revenues. And although it was set up to develop peaceful uses for nuclear research, its greatest successes have come as a contractor to the US Department of Defence.Unravelling those contradictions is no easy task.For most of its history GA has avoided the media spotlight. But in recent years the success of its military business has made that more difficult. In 2008 the company was among the top 50 largest contractors to the DoD, taking in almost $1.1bn.At the heart of its new-found prominence is its unmanned aerial vehicle, the lethal-sounding Predator. The US military has used more than 100 of them – the basic versions to spy on insurgents and the armed variants to attack specific.Its futuristic lines have helped it to become the poster-child for both the Iraq conflict and for the hi-tech, information-focused military force that the US is keen to have. The army plans to purchase another 36 in 2010 while the air force will take delivery of 24 of the armed variant. Countries such as the UK are also adopting the technology.GA’s origins were quite different however. The company was established in 1955 on a 120-acre campus in San Diego, California, to commercialise nuclear technology, and has developed a number of key fission systems and processes. More recently it has focused on the area of nuclear fusion.Despite its best efforts, industry veterans say the company has been more successful in attracting government funding than in spinning out its core nuclear technology. In the 1960s and 1970s it pioneered extremely safe High Temperature Reactors but technical glitches hindered its own efforts and rivals such as Westinghouse and General Electric sewed up the market with a competing technology.Unique research however, has helped throw up a series of related skills and discoveries, leading the company to some unexpected places. It has developed an expertise in nuclear waste management, begun experimenting in making jet fuel from algae and has used its experience with electromagnetic research to develop magnetic levitation (maglev) trains.Amid those, GA’s defence business is somewhat incongruous. But the move into aerial vehicles was perhaps natural after the company was bought from Chevron for about $50m in 1986 by two brothers from Colorado with a background in the aviation business.James Neal Blue and Linden Blue made their money in real estate and energy but built their reputations as air force pilots and later as executives at companies such as Beech Aircraft. When GA was hit by a slowdown in funding for nuclear research, the brothers diversified into planes.In 1987 GA hired a former Navy rear admiral, Thomas J. Cassidy Jr., to develop advanced technology projects and in the 1990s the company bought up Leading Systems, a struggling UAV maker whose Gnat vehicle became the basis for the Predator.From there, development picked up pace. Predators served in the Balkans conflict, but the spy plane really took off after September 11, 2001 when counter-insurgency wars in Iraq and Afghanistan created a requirement for persistent surveillance. The programme was rushed from research into production.Since 2000, GA has sold about $4.6bn worth of equipment and services to the US military, according to government data, making defence its primary business. Indeed, the company estimates that about 80 per cent of its 5,000 staff now works on defence-related projects.That growth will give GA a 25 per cent share of the global market for UAVs until 2017, according to research company Forecast International. The growth has also attracted attention and increased competition from the dominant defence manufacturers. So far GA has managed to stay in front, using its own funds to develop armed variants and new, more capable drones.“They are very good at rapid development,” Bill Sweetman, editor of Defence Technology International. “So they are always ahead of the customer need. That is why the big American companies haven’t been able to lay a glove on them.”Separately, GA is developing an electromagnetic catapult to launch aircraft from next-generation carriers and an electromagnetic rail gun for the Navy able to generate enough power to launch a projectile over 110 nautical miles, further than conventional guns in use today.Behind its success in winning government contracts has been a formidable and at times controversial lobbying effort. In the past 10 years GA has spent more than $23m on lobbying in Washington alone.In 2006 the company hit the headlines after a study, part of a wider investigation by non-profit organisations, revealed that the company had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars taking legislators, their aides and spouses on foreign trips. While on the trips, officials attended meetings at which foreign governments were asked to buy GA spy planes.The company has always maintained an unembarrassed conviction that lobbying is entirely legitimate and crucial for GA to hold its own against the likes of Northrop Grumman and Boeing. In one interview Neal Blue noted: “for our size, we possess more significant political capital than you might think.”In recent years however, GA has been the focus of a rather different type of scrutiny as would-be buyers have eagerly circled the company. Interest in purchasing GA is significant but the company has “told them all to stand down”, says David Baxt, head of aerospace and defence at investment bank Jefferies“The thing is General Atomics doesn’t seem to see itself as a company,” he says. “Management sees it as a national research lab like Los Alamos, incubating new technology of national significance.”
184;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
185;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-06-14T17:28:48Z;Fears over bidding war for tankers;;EADS has fired a warning shot ahead of the restart of the multi-billion dollar competition to replace the US’s ageing fleet of air tankers, arguing that a process focused on price alone would be unreasonable and damaging to the US armed forces.“I sense that this is the way things are going and it would be a damn bad thing for the US military and US servicemen and war fighters,” said Ralph Crosby, chairman and chief executive of EADS North America.His comments come just weeks before the drawn-out and controversial contest is due to restart. The US government is expected to issue a draft request for proposals, the first step in the acquisition process, early next month.A formal set of specifications could be completed by August, setting the stage for a final decision in the first half of next year.EADS is unhappy about recent rumblings that the government, which is conducting the purchase of some 179 aircraft, could change the way it selects the aircraft.A combined EADS and Northrop Grumman team unexpectedly won an earlier contest in 2008 by presenting an aircraft that was larger and, it claims, more capable than its rival from the US aviation group Boeing. Boeing successfully challenged the process.However, this time senior military figures have suggested the US should buy a more basic system and make cost the deciding factor – a process seldom used for major projects. That could put EADS at a disadvantage.In March, John Young, the outgoing Pentagon procurement chief, said the US should “ask people for their best price to meet those requirements and pick [a winner] that way. That gets the best deal for the taxpayer”.EADS argues that such a focus on the lowest price for a technically acceptable system “works for pencils and notebooks,” but not for complex equipment designed to last for a generation.For its part, Boeing maintains that it is “ready for whatever procurement strategy the US government decides upon” for the tanker.The battle is significant not just for the sums of money involved – about $35bn for the initial batch of aircraft – but also for the political symbolism of the contract. The Northrop-EADS team win was seen as evidence that European companies could compete in the US and was a key part of EADS’ efforts to build a presence in the US.To help win the project, the Northrop-EADS team is mobilising a considerable promotional campaign.Defence has taken on increasing significance for EADS as the economic downturn has re-emphasised the cyclicality of its commercial aviation business. It is looking to expand by organic growth and acquisitions.
186;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-06-09T17:59:58Z;GM picks AT&T veteran as chairman;;General Motors said on Tuesday that Edward Whitacre, a former chairman and chief executive of AT&T, the telecoms group, would become the carmaker’s chairman on completion of its court-supervised restructuring.GM, which filed for bankruptcy protection on June 1, also announced that six of its 12 board members would step down once the new company is launched, probably in July or August.Those departing include George Fisher, who was the board’s lead director during the turbulence that led to GM’s Chapter 11 filing.Mr Whitacre, 67, will replace Kent Kresa, a former chairman of Northrop Grumman, the aerospace group, who has held the chairman’s job since Rick Wagoner was ousted as chairman and chief executive in late March. Mr Kresa, 71, will remain as a director until he retires next year.The new board will have 13 members: Mr Whitacre, six existing board members, four to be chosen by the Obama administration’s auto industry task force, and one each nominated by the Canadian government and a United Auto Workers healthcare trust.Fritz Henderson, Mr Wagoner’s successor as CEO, will remain on the board.As chairman of AT&T and its predecessor companies from 1990 to 2007, Mr Whitacre oversaw a series of mergers and acquisitions that created America’s largest provider of local, long-distance and wireless services. He is also a director of ExxonMobil and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, one of the US’s biggest railway operators.Mr Kresa said in an interview that during his time at AT&T Mr Whitacre had done “a great job weaving his way through [the] morass [of the telecommunications industry] and coming forward with a very, very strong company”.Under the restructuring plan, the US government will own just over 60 per cent of the “new” GM, with Canada holding 12 per cent, the UAW 17.5 per cent and unsecured bondholders 10 per cent. The bondholders will also receive warrants to raise their stake to 25 per cent at a later stage.As the principal owner, the US government has a veto on most of the board appointments. Mr Kresa has worked closely with Steve Rattner, de facto head of the auto industry task force. Mr Kresa said that GM could become a public company again within six months to a year of the new company’s creation.The New York bankruptcy court overseeing the restructuring is due to consider the sale of most of the carmaker’s assets and some of its liabilities to the new entity on June 30. Objections are due by June 19.
187;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-05-29T22:36:57Z;World of opportunity spied in cyber securities;;Cyber security is often talked about in terms of threats. But for UK defence companies, the area seems a world of opportunities.With the release of the White House report on the subject yesterday, clarifying the administration’s priorities and crucial lines of command, those opportunities are one step closer.“[Political momentum in the US] has brought new programmes and new budgets,” says Ian King, chief executive of BAE Systems. Security revenues are already worth about £1bn a year to the company, he said, most of which come from the US and UK.Cyber security covers everything from guarding military information systems from attack by foreign governments, to protecting intellectual property.The prize for companies that can meet those needs is significant. As defence budgets flatten out or even decline, the security segment offers a high growth niche. Analysts at Merrill Lynch expect the US to spend $14.6bn (£9.2bn) on cyber security this year and $25.5bn next year.To capitalise on the sector UK defence companies have begun to re-position themselves. BAE for example, includes developing its security business as among four global priorities and now says it aspires to be a “premier defence, security and aerospace company”.It has backed up that ambition with cash. In 2008, BAE bought Detica, a specialist provider of security technology, for £543m giving it a lead in the UK market. BAE is in the process of rolling out Detica’s capabilities in the US and elsewhere.The issue of cyber security has risen up the agenda in recent years after high profile incidents revealed the extent to which reliance on IT has made countries such as the US vulnerable to cyber attack.The US department of defence said it detected 360m efforts to break into its networks in the past year.As companies jostle for exposure to customers and niche technology, the M&A market has heated up.According to data providers Dealogic, in 2005 defence companies bought about 29 IT software and services companies in deals worth $3.1bn. In 2008 they bought 32 companies for $7.2bn.In the UK, Cobham, the aerospace and defence group, has conducted forays in the area. In 2008 it bought Sparta for $416m, which gave it a US presence in information management for the intelligence services.But the company is also doing more to pack security measures and functions into its other products, be they communications or battlefield systems, says Jeremy Wensinger, president of Cobham’s defence systems unit.“Whether it is ones and zeros to protect platforms on the battlefield or ones and zeroes to protect the electricity grid, cyber security is a requirement,” he says.But taking on US incumbents will be challenging. Lockheed Martin has a solid lead in the sector as a major provider of IT to the federal government. Its offerings run from high-end systems for US intelligence agencies, to software for the payment of social security benefits.Boeing and Northrop Grumman have both said that they will look at acquisitions in the space while Raytheon and General Dynamics have recently set up cyber-focused units.Defence companies will also butt up against commercial suppliers, as they tackle security issues for civilian federal agencies. And experts worry their military experience may not read across to commercial situations as well as expected.
188;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-05-28T18:37:41Z;New model army?;;"In his farewell presidential address in 1961, Dwight Eisenhower gave the English language a new phrase – the military-industrial complex.The former general, who led US troops in Europe during the second world war, was referring to an incestuous relationship between the Pentagon and powerful US defence companies with a mutual interest in spending huge amounts of public money to buy weapons to fight real and imagined enemies.More than 40 years later, Robert Gates has taken up the baton. The poker-faced US defence secretary wants to shake up the cosy set-up by reshaping spending priorities and reforming the weapons procurement process.The change has big implications for the private sector. Contractors will have to adapt to ensure a slice of the pie. Some are more advanced in the process than others but planning will be key. Big defence suppliers such as Northrop Grumman and Boeing have been modelling future warfare for decades, building sophisticated computer models to test scenarios and assess potential solutions before they are delivered to the front line.When President Barack Obama opted to retain Mr Gates in his job – the first time a Pentagon chief from the opposing party had been kept on – it was clear that change was coming to the five-sided building that spends more than $20,000 (£12,520, €14,320) a second.Mr Obama wanted to reform defence procurement to rein in spiralling costs and reduce production and procurement delays, an increasingly important task as the economy went through the floor. This gave Mr Gates the ammunition he needed to push for changes, in some cases over the objections of the military services, each of which has its own parochial interests.Over the two years since George W. Bush appointed Mr Gates in 2006, the military – and particularly the army – shifted its operational focus from conventional war to irregular warfare and counter-insurgency operations. A consummate bureaucrat who honed his skills at the Central Intelligence Agency, becoming the first entry-level analyst to rise to director, Mr Gates wanted the Pentagon to adjust its long-established procedures to the operational shift by altering the procurement system.Writing in the January/February issue of Foreign Affairs, Mr Gates said the Pentagon needed to balance spending on conventional programmes that seek a “99 per cent solution” – implying near-total victory – over years, with spending on stability and counter-insurgency operations that require “75 per cent solutions” – containing and perhaps largely subduing an enemy that retained some capabilities – over a quicker period of just months.“The challenge is whether these two different paradigms can be made to coexist in the US military’s mindset and bureaucracy,” he wrote. “The key is to make sure that the strategy and risk assessment drive the procurement, rather than the other way around.” Mr Gates suggested, for example, that the Pentagon should consider using “lower-cost, lower-tech aircraft” that could also be used by American allies, apparently a poke at the expensive F-22 fighter jet.When Mr Gates, himself a former air force officer, unveiled the 2010 defence budget three months later, he halted procurement of the F-22 – a popular programme on Capitol Hill because the spending it requires is spread across most of the US – at 187 aircraft.In cutting programmes, his success has relied in part on a better than usual relationship with the senior military brass. In other big budget shifts, Mr Gates ordered cuts to missile defence and the army’s hugely expensive Future Combat Systems programme. He postponed the development of a long-range bomber that the air force had argued would be necessary for any conflict with China. He also decided to reduce America’s aircraft carrier fleet.As part of the effort to boost the Pentagon’s ability to wage irregular warfare, the defence secretary funnelled $2bn in new funds for “intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance” programmes. Among other things, this would pay for 50 pilotless Predator drones of the kind the US military and CIA are using to target militants in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.Mr Gates also provided new resources to expand the number of cyberspace experts in the Pentagon as the US government pushes to develop its cyber defence and offence capabilities. Mr Obama has commissioned a team of experts to review US cyber security, expected to release its results in coming weeks.Not only is Mr Gates proposing cutting big-ticket items in the immediate future but he is also promoting a radical shift in the way the Pentagon buys its equipment. He was a supporter of recently passed legislation that would help the defence department lower acquisition costs, partly by clamping down on the military’s predilection for – and industry’s tendency to build – expensive gold-plated technology instead of buying existing, lower-cost alternatives.In a symbolic move aimed at preventing “requirements creep”, Mr Gates terminated a contract for the presidential helicopter being built by Lockheed Martin and AgustaWestland, which was way over cost partly because of additional requirements that had been added later.“Our conventional modernisation goals should be tied to the actual and prospective capabilities of known future adversaries – not by what might be technologically feasible for a potential adversary given unlimited time and resources,” Mr Gates said when he announced the budget in April.The General Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, last year found almost $300bn in cost overruns when it examined 95 large defence projects. On signing the costs legislation that had been championed by Senator John McCain, who lost the presidential race, Mr Obama said he too rejected “the notion that we have to waste billions of taxpayer dollars to keep this nation secure”. The president added: “When it comes to purchasing weapons systems and developing defence projects, the choice we face is between investments that are designed to keep the American people safe and those that are simply designed to make a defence company or a contractor rich.”…While efforts to control costs will affect the revenues of defence companies in the coming years, it is Mr Gates’ shift in focus towards irregular warfare that will have the greater impact.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Lexington Institute, a think-tank, says the Pentagon will be spending more on personnel – on a larger army and marine corps but also on labour-intensive technologies ranging from laptop computers for intelligence sharing to digital radios and body armour. More will go to services and proportionately less to hardware.“Some defence companies anticipated this change years ago and now are reaping these benefits. Lockheed Martin is the example of that trend. Other defence companies have developed key niche capabilities. For example, General Dynamics is very active in cyber defence,” says Mr Thompson. “And then there are other companies such as Boeing that are relatively late to the realisation that [sales of] hardware are going to be going down rapidly.”Planners at Northrop Grumman have been looking at irregular warfare for three years, says Bob Haffa, corporate director of the company’s analysis centre. Northrop looks at three different scenarios: conventional conflict against a high-end adversary that may use “asymmetric” tactics (hitting harder than the US ordinarily would); irregular conflicts; and “securing the commons” – no matter what future conflict might look like, the commons of air, land and sea and cyberspace need to be protected.“Mr Gates was talking about emphasising irregular warfare while maintaining other capabilities, so he is not abandoning big platforms and systems,” says Mr Haffa. “There is a lot of thinking going on, don’t call this warfare but call it security. We are trying to provide a secure environment for people in all three different scenarios.” He says that despite the uncertainties, there are certain capabilities the company knows will be required, such as sensors and network-centric capabilities.The company conducted a similar exercise at the end of the cold war that formed the blueprint for some of the deals that Northrop undertook.At Boeing, executives have been undertaking similar exercises. Guy Higgins, vice-president of analysis, modelling, simulation and experimentation, says the focus is less on technology than on capabilities, saying Boeing starts with the way people deal with a particular problem today and then tries to show the difference between that and the way it could be dealt with in the future.Analysts believe many of the leading defence contractors will pursue bolt-on corporate acquisitions over the coming years, focusing on areas such as homeland security, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance technologies, and robotics. Unmanned aerial vehicles, too, are seen by executives as a rich area for development.According to Mr Higgins, there has been enormous innovation in the industry over the past 20 years but in most cases it has meant putting existing technologies together in new ways to create new capabilities. Really new technology, he says, will have to start at the basic research level.With the military increasingly having to help in stability operations, however, the US and its allies will have to retain sufficient conventional air and armoured forces. Having enough boots on the ground will matter.Not all experts are convinced that Mr Gates is paving the right road, however. Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace expert at Teal Group, a Virginia-based consultancy, says the defence secretary is pushing irregular warfare partly to reduce overall costs, which he believes could eventually backfire.“This drift away from big wars happens every few decades,” says Mr Aboulafia. “Victorian Britain’s war planning ended with the first world war when, as Blackadder put it, 4m heavily armed Germans hoved into view. It happened after Vietnam, when it became clear that the Russians were a far bigger threat …And it will happen again when some large, well-armed country challenges US power after the US military has reconfigured itself to kill guys in Toyotas.”European procurement: Over time, over budget and out of dateIn Europe, the creation of a common defence capability has been an ambition for decades but elusive in practice. Obstacles include budgetary constraints, forces configured to fight the cold war and a lack of political will.Now, however, there is new impetus, with Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, making clear he wants to strengthen the European Union’s capacity for independent military action.Some initiatives are already under way. The UK and France set up a high-level government and industry forum in 2006, focusing on closer defence co-operation. Other proposals include a plan for EU nations to co-ordinate the servicing and deployment of aircraft providing long-range strategic troop transport.Nevertheless, examples of successful pan-European procurement programmes are few and far between. Nations have often been unable to agree on common specifications, and tend to make decisions based on the needs of their domestic industrial base. In the late 1990s national differences sank the three-nation Horizon project to build a new generation of frigates to be used by French, British and Italian navies.A potential test case today is the A400M military transport aircraft programme, Europe’s biggest collaborative defence project.The original contract, with a bloc of seven European nations in 2003, was the Continent’s biggest ever single arms deal, with the aircraft set to play a role in meeting Europe and Nato’s strategic and tactical needs. Today, the €20bn programme is running years late and billions of euros over budget. Partner nations will decide this summer whether to rescue it.For the UK, the biggest European spender on defence, one of the unanswered questions is how strong an appetite there is to collaborate more closely with its EU allies. The UK has historically tended to collaborate more with the US.It is one of many questions that will need to be addressed in a new UK strategic defence review, widely expected after the next general election, expected in summer 2010. The last one was conducted more than 10 years ago, when the focus was on developing capabilities for traditional state-on-state warfare.“We are trying to maintain a global role …with a budget that is so much smaller [than that of the US] so there are going to have to be some hard decisions,” says Malcolm Chalmers, a professor from Rusi, the industry think-tank."
189;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-05-27T21:12:17Z;Defence industry looks to cross borders;;Mark Elliott is an experienced executive who has spent more than 30 years running businesses all over the world for IBM. He is also a US citizen. Last week he was appointed to the board of Qinetiq, a FTSE 250 company, and earmarked to take over as chairman next year.For a bank or an energy company in today’s globalised world, the move would not be surprising.But for a member of the defence industry, whose stock in trade is state secrets and national pride and prestige, it is unusual.“Qinetiq’s ambition is to be an international, know­ledge-based company and the appointment reflects that,” says Neil Hampson, who heads PwC’s global aero­space and defence team.“It is something the rest of the industry will have to mirror in the next 20 years.”Traditionally the defence sector has been a resolutely national. Tied to domestic governments for most of their revenues and often largely government-owned, weapons manufacturers have often been inward-looking.That is changing. China, India and the countries of the Middle East are now among the largest importers of weapons and companies have chased lucrative export deals there. At the start of May, EADS became the latest defence company to develop a joint venture with a local Indian partner.The likes of BAE Systems have, through acquisition and organic growth, already moved abroad. In 2008 the ­company had more customers abroad than at home and less than 20 per cent of its revenues came from the UK.Research and development has also become globalised under pressure from complex and costly weapons platforms, too challenging for one country to attempt alone. America’s flagship Joint Strike Fighter project, for example, has enlisted contributions from the UK, Italy and the Netherlands.In turn the corporate shape of defence companies has evolved. BAE operates through six “home markets” and has a US, an Italian and an Indian citizen on its board. Other companies also talk up the international experience of their board.Still, in Mr Hampson’s estimation there is more to do. It could take decades for the industry to develop an international footprint and team, plus the necessary secondment processes – which are second nature to oil and gas companies.Of course, the process will be difficult. Given the sensitive material and information they handle, several companies have by-laws limiting the number of foreigners on the board and giving governments a say in appointments.Moreover, big US firms such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman inevitably remain more closely focused on their enormous domestic market, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of total ­global spending on arms.But even that is changing. “Yes, the US makes up half of all spending on defence, but it is not going to offer much in the way of percentage growth in the future,” says Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Evolution Securities. That means defence companies will have to adapt further.“International directors give you the appearance of diversity, useful connections and contacts and also explain how foreign markets operate,” says Mr Cunningham. Senior civil servants and ex-military men “are simply not going to open up India”.
190;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-04-22T17:37:09Z;Boeing’s quarterly profits plunge;;Boeing, the US aircraft maker, suggested on Wednesday it would be prepared to cut production further should economic conditions worsen. It said quarterly profits had halved.The group has been hit by deferrals and cancellations as airlines globally struggle to cope with the downturn. Boeing received 32 order cancellations in the first quarter – more than the 28 new orders it booked.“The economic situation is uncertain,” said Jim McNerney, chief executive. “We can’t predict with absolute certainty that our current rate in the market will hold forever. Adjusting production rates is part of this business. We think we’ve got it right now, [but] we’ll have to keep reading and reacting.”Net income in the first quarter fell to $610m, or 86 cents a share, from $1.21bn or $1.62 per share a year earlier.Boeing issued a profits warning this month and said at the time that the economic downturn had forced it to plan to cut production of its 777 – its most important long-haul jet – and would depress its previously forecast delivery prices, knocking 38 cents per share off its profits for the quarter.The group lowered its outlook on Wednesday for the full year to $4.70-$5 per share from the $5.05-$5.35 per share range it gave in January – maintaining a relatively bullish forecast, given analysts’ consensus forecast of about $4.60 per share. Boeing shares had risen 3.3 per cent to $37.86 by noon.Pressed on whether the global downturn might prompt Boeing to cancel its 747-8 freighter programme, Mr McNerney said: “Could it get worse? Sure. If the economic environment continues to tank for another three or four years, the impact of deferrals and production rate changes could put additional economic pressure on it. Is it enough to kill the programme? I don’t think so.”Mr McNerney also said that Boeing’s defence arm – which accounts for about half of the company’s revenues – was looking to diversify internationally and into different areas such as homeland security services.Mr McNerney conceded that the changing priorities in US military spending recently announced by Robert Gates, US defence secretary, “put overall pressure on the budget” but that there was “a pretty rich backlog on the defence side internationally that we’re excited about”.He said the company was not sure what the requirements were for a new refuelling tanker for the US Air Force and that it was therefore difficult to know what aircraft model Boeing would offer in a competition.The group last year successfully protested against an award of the contract to provide 179 refuelling tankers to the air force to a team led by Northrop Grumman. The tender was subsequently cancelled. It is due to be re-launched this summer.Also on Wednesday, Ronald Sugar, chairman and chief executive of Northrop Grumman, said the company looked forward to the new competition and that he expected to “win again”.He noted the aircraft-maker had invested in recent years in acquisitions in homeland security, border security and cyber markets and said the new US defence priorities could provide opportunities for those businesses.
191;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-04-07T18:59:55Z;US defence review hits big-ticket programmes;;Four years ago workers at the UK and Italian plants of AgustaWestland, the Anglo-Italian helicopter maker, were celebrating after winning a share of a lucrative contract to design and build a new helicopter to carry the US president.The decision in January 2005 to choose a consortium of Lockheed Martin and Finmeccanica, the parent of AgustaWestland, to build a fleet of VH-71 helicopters, known as Marine One when carrying the US president, was hailed as a breakthrough for a European defence contractor in the US.Tony Blair, then UK prime minister, had personally lobbied George W. Bush, the then president, on behalf of AgustaWestland.On Monday, Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, reversed the landmark decision. Amid a sweeping overhaul of the Pentagon’s weapons procurement and cuts to several big-ticket programmes, he recommended terminating the VH-71 programme, citing soaring costs, which had doubled from $6.5bn to more than $13bn.The programme, for a total of 27 helicopters, had “fallen six years behind schedule and runs the risk of not delivering the requested capability,” Mr Gates said on Tuesday. The first instalment of helicopters ordered under the initial $3.7bn contract “do not meet requirements and are estimated to have only a five- to 10-year useful life”, he added.The news, although expected after Bush’s successor Barack Obama recently described the programme as “gone amok”, is a blow to both Lockheed Martin and Finmeccanica.The companies have already delivered eight of the nine helicopters ordered under the contract, but confusion remains over whether they will ever fly with the US Marine Corps, which operates the US presidential fleet.Finmeccanica has come out fighting, saying that the possible cancellation will not have an impact on the group’s earnings because it never included the second phase of the programme. It added that the potential cancellation would entitle it to receive a penalty payment for breaching the contract.Nevertheless, the news is still a setback for the Italian group, both in terms of prestige and longer-term, as it could hold back its ambitions to expand in the lucrative US defence market.Mr Gates’ proposals still need to pass through Congress, but if implemented will have far-reaching consequences for most US and several European contractors. His plans to boost spending on unmanned aerial vehicles, for example, will be a boon for General Atomics, the company that makes the Reaper and Predator UAVs currently in service in Afghanistan.In Europe, shares in the sector rallied as analysts noted that most of the proposed cuts had already been priced into share prices.The biggest beneficiaries were companies involved in the F-35 Lightning II programme. BAE Systems, Europe’s largest defence contractor which provides almost 20 per cent of the value on the aircraft, saw its shares jump 6 per cent yesterday to 347½p, making it the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100.Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Evolution Securities who has a “buy” rating on the stock says: “This is very good for BAE as they have about 20 per cent of the unit value of the F-35”.Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine maker, is also a beneficiary because of its 40 per cent share on the engine for the F-35.Cobham, which provides electronics equipment to the F-35, was anther winner, with its share up 4 per cent.The boost to the F-35 is also good news for Lockheed Martin, in spite of the setback on the VH-71 programme. In afternoon trading in the US, Lockheed Martin shares were holding on to Monday’s gains, up 14 cents at $73.42.Shares in rival contractor Northrop Grumman were down 3 per cent at $46.39. Boeing traded lower also, down 3.5 per cent at $36.82.Analysts said Boeing was suffering from Mr Gates’ proposal to end production of its C-17 military transport aircraft and to scale back the army’s Future Combat Systems programme, on which it is prime contractor.
192;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-04-06T22:19:51Z;Gates unveils sweeping defence cuts;;Robert Gates, US defence secretary, unveiled a sweeping overhaul of defence priorities on Monday, taking an axe to several high-profile weapons programmes as part of his spending proposals.Mr Gates said the Pentagon would place more emphasis on “irregular” warfare as he outlined a series of cuts and changes as part of President Barack Obama’s $534bn defence budget.“We must rebalance this department’s programmes in order to institutionalise and finance our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face,” he said.While Congress will try to alter some of the plans, Mr Gates proposed dramatic changes, including cancelling a deal to build a presidential helicopter. Lockheed’s VH-71 helicopter programme, based on a design by AgustaWestland, the UK subsidiary of Italy’s Finmeccanica, has seen its costs soar since the companies won an initial contract in January 2005.The initial contract, worth $3.8bn, was for nine helicopters, of which seven have already been delivered. Mr Obama signalled this year that the contract was in danger when he said it had “gone amok”.Mr Gates also proposed ending production of the F-22 Raptor fighter jet at 187 aircraft. While that would affect Lockheed Martin, the company would benefit from a separate proposal to increase production next year of the F-35 Lightning II fighter jet, which will also be bought by US allies, including the UK.The Pentagon chief also ordered major cuts in missile defence systems, while restructuring the overall programme to focus on missile threats posed by “rogue” states such as North Korea. Pyongyang this weekend fired a long-range rocket over Japan in a failed satellite launch.Shares in the major defence contractors gained after the announcement. Analysts said investors saw the news as positive because it had put an end to months of uncertainty. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman both saw gains of about nine per cent.

This triggered a 22.7 per cent fall in Sun’s shares to $6.56.Banking stocks also suffered after Mike Mayo, an analyst at Calyon Securities, began coverage on 11 leading banks, giving them all an “underperform” or “sell” rating. Mr Mayo, one of the earliest analysts to turn bearish on banks, warned loan losses might exceed those seen during the great depression.Billionaire investor George Soros added his doubts about banks’ health later in the day, saying: “The banking system as a whole is basically insolvent.”Wells Fargo fell 6.7 per cent to $15.25, while Citigrouplost 4.6 per cent to $2.72 and JPMorgan dropped 3.7 per cent to $28.20.Investors are relying on banks to pull markets out of their slump more than any time in the past 60 years, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg, and worries over their profitability weighed heavily on the markets as a whole.After a very late rally, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.8 per cent down at 835.48 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 7,975.85 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.9 per cent to 1,606.71 points.“This was a dramatic run up and as we approach earnings season investors are being cautious and taking profits off the table at any opportunity,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford,But George Feiger, chief executive of Contango Capital Advisers warned the slide is a sign of more fundamental problems. “The big problems with the economy are still there,” he said. “We are still only at the beginning of this problem.”Commodities companies also declined on the back of falling materials prices. Steel makers suffered particularly badly after Deutsche Bank warned demand for steel in North America could fall 25 per cent this year. US Steel fell 2.7 per cent to $25.16 and AK Steel dropped 4.7 per cent to $8.82.The defence sector received a late shot in the arm as Robert Gates,
the defence secretary, announced an overhaul of government spending. Lockheed Martin gained 8.9 per cent to $73.28 after Mr Gates said the government would double the budget for Lockheed’s F-35 fighter plane.Northrop Grumman also stood to benefit from increased spending, and its shares lifted 9 per cent to $47.94.Lockheed was also involved in another of the day’s big stories, as speculation mounted that it might look at acquiring Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft. Textron’s share rose 11.3 to a two-month high of $8.26.Cisco added to the pressure already weighing on the technology sector because of the withdrawal of IBM’s offer for Sun. Cisco was downgraded by Goldman Sachs from “conviction buy” right back to “neutral”, with the bank saying recent gains in the company’s stock meant future growth was now priced in. The technology company fell 3.5 per cent to $17.53.Credit Suisse meanwhile said: “We believe Cisco has seen further incremental weakness in its enterprise business, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of total revenues.”General Motors was one of the session’s few risers, lifting 8.1 per cent to $2.27 after Fritz Henderson, its new chief executive, said bankruptcy was not inevitable for the company.Ford also gained ground after it was able to reduce its debt by $9.9bn after swapping much of it for cash and equity. Shares in the carmaker advanced 16 per cent to $3.77.Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceutical company, performed well after it renegotiated a licensing agreement with Japan’s Otsuka Pharmaceutical to sell the Abilify schizophrenia drug for an extra 29 months. It s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $20.51. The healthcare sector was also bolstered by insurers, which rebounded after falling on Wachovia’s prediction that government proposals to cut their subsidies could cost them as much as 20 per cent of their earnings.Humana gained 3.3 per cent to $26.31 and UnitedHealth picked up 6.8 per cent to $21.93."
194;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-03-30T14:57:24Z;GM and Chrysler denied extra funds;;The Obama administration refused on Sunday night to give fresh bail-out money to General Motors and Chrysler, telling the carmakers to come up with new plans or risk insolvency.GM has received $13.4bn in government aid and had asked for an additional $16.6bn. Chrysler has received $4bn and had asked for another $5bn. But both companies failed to meet targets on cutting their debt and reducing the cost of benefits paid to workers.The crisis talks between the companies and the administration’s auto task force cost the job of Rick Wagoner, chief executive and chairman of General Motors, who was asked to step down by the White House after 30 years with the carmaker. The chairman and chief executive positions will be split with company president Fritz Henderson taking over as chief executive and Kent Kresa, chairman emeritus of Northrop Grumman, taking the position of interim non-executive chairman.Officials said on Sunday night that Chrysler would be given 30 days and GM 60 days to reach agreement with debtholders and unions, with new tougher targets for cost cutting, or they would lose their last chance for a government bailout, almost certainly sending them into bankruptcy.“That’s going to mean a set of sacrifices from all parties involved: management, labour, shareholders, creditors, suppliers, dealers,” President Barack Obama said Sunday on CBS, before the details had been laid out.“Everybody is going to have to come to the table and say it’s important for us to take serious restructuring steps now in order to preserve a brighter future down the road … They’re not there yet,” Mr Obama said.The task force, whose members include former investment bankers Steve Rattner and Ron Bloom, decided that the companies had failed to prove their viability and would not, therefore, receive the combined $21.6bn of taxpayer money they had asked for.However, both carmakers will be supported with working capital as they work to meet their new deadlines on restructuring and could end up with more funds than they had requested. Existing loans will not be recalled.Warranties on the companies’ cars sold in the US will be guaranteed by the government in a bid to prevent buyers from turning away from GM and Chrysler. US car sales have dropped from 16m a year earlier this year to a current trend of less than 10m a year.Shares in GM plunged 27.9 per cent to $2.61 in early New York trading.Chrysler’s hopes for survival hinge on finalising a partnership agreement with Fiat, the Italian carmaker, which has offered to acquire 35 per cent of Chrysler in return for technology.In a bid to prevent US taxpayer money going overseas, the task force has said it would offer up to $6bn in support to Chrysler but only with the agreement from Fiat to build new cars and engines in the US.If Fiat wants to lift its ownership above 50 per cent, Chrysler will first have to pay back the bail-out money.A senior administration official said the companies had failed to meet a number of benchmarks, including the requirement for GM to reduce its $27bn unsecured debt to $9bn.Bondholders in GM, who have railed against the administration and the company as the March 31 deadline for an agreement approached, are now faced with conceding to new, even tougher, demands for debt reduction or accepting the results of a court-supervised bankruptcy.A representative for an ad hoc group of GM bondholders said it was reviewing the Obama administration’s response to the viability plan and would have a statement later Monday. The cost of default protection on GM bonds rose slightly in early trading, an indication of greater perceived risk of default.The president’s task force has made clear that it does not want to see the companies lapse into a traditional Chapter 11 bankruptcy from which they are unlikely to re-emerge, but would use a quick court-supervised process to restructure them forcibly as part of any final settlement.Even though it is Mr Wagoner who is unseated at GM, the company received a much better report card than Chrysler, whose cars were condemned as lacking in quality.While the task force concluded that GM could be turned into a strong business, it decided that Chrysler cannot survive independently.
195;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Statement: GM Officer and Board Announcements;;GM is announcing the following changes in the corporate officers and the board of directors:Rick Wagoner is stepping down as chairman and CEO, effective immediately. Wagoner, 56, was named president and CEO in 2000, and assumed the role of chairman in 2003.Fritz Henderson, GM president and chief operating officer, will serve as CEO. Henderson, 50, was named to his current position in 2008. He was previously vice chairman and chief financial officer.Kent Kresa, chairman emeritus, Northrop Grumman Corporation, has been named interim non-executive chairman of the board of directors. Kresa became a GM director in 2003GM is awaiting further announcements by the President and the Task Force on Automotive Reconstruction, and we will have additional comments at that time.GM Board of Directors statement, attributable to Kent Kresa, Chairman“The Board has recognized for some time that the Company’s restructuring will likely cause a significant change in the stockholders of the Company and create the need for new directors with additional skills and experience. The Board intends to work to nominate a slate of directors for the next annual meeting that will include a majority of new directors taking into account the addition of new directors, retirement, and decisions by individual directors not to stand for re-election, although the specific individuals who will be nominated or choose not to run or leave the board are not yet known.”
196;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-03-30T13:10:31Z;Henderson to take over as GM chief;;General Motors announced on Monday that Fritz Henderson, the beleaguered US carmaker’s president and chief operating officer, will replace Rick Wagoner as chief executive, and that a majority of its directors will be replaced.Mr Wagoner stepped down on Sunday at the request of the White House as part of the widening shake-up at GM, which was the world’s biggest carmaker until last year but is now dependent on government aid for its survival.Kent Kresa, chairman emeritus of Northrop Grumman, the US aerospace group, has been named GM’s interim non-executive chairman. Mr Wagoner had been executive chairman.Mr Kresa said in a statement that the board had “recognised for some time that the company’s restructuring will likely cause a significant change in the stockholders… and create the need for new directors with additional skills and experience”.He added that the board intended to nominate a slate of directors at the next annual meeting, due to be held in August, that would include a majority of new board members.No decision has yet been taken on which individuals will be nominated or will choose to leave the board.Mr Henderson, 50, has worked for GM since 1984. Prior to his appointment as chief operating officer, he was chief financial officer and, earlier, head of GM Europe.In a valedictory statement, Mr Wagoner, 56, said that “GM is a great company with a storied history. Ignore the doubters because I know it is also a company with a great future.”
197;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-03-19T00:33:07Z;MoD orders three test fighter aircraft;;The UK signalled its commitment to the US-led Joint Strike Fighter programme on Wednesday with the purchase of three test aircraft for about $700m.The decision guarantees the UK continued influence over the development of the new fighter jets, which will replace the Harrier and fly off the Royal Navy’s two new aircraft carriers.There had been speculation that strained finances and the collapse in sterling against the US dollar would force the Ministry of Defence to delay or opt out of buying the test aircraft in an effort to save costs. But the MoD confirmed that the cost of the three jets will be accounted for under this year’s financial planning round, suggesting that the programme has been spared in the budget squeeze. The jets are due to be delivered to the UK in 2011 or 2012.Announcing the agreement during a visit to Washington, John Hutton, defence secretary, said: “By purchasing three aircraft for testing, we will secure access to the development of the programme …This is a vital programme for UK defence both for the military and for industry, with over 100 UK companies involved.”At an estimated cost of $300bn (£211bn) the programme, also called the F-35 Lightning II, is the most expensive in military history. The UK, which is investing £2bn, is the sole “level one” partner which gives it direct influence over the make-up of the jet.The MoD has refused to confirm how many aircraft it will buy, although an original number of 150 no longer seems likely. Mr Hutton was expected to raise issues of affordability in a meeting yesterday with Robert Gates, the US defence secretary.Lockheed Martin, the lead contractor, said the average estimated unit cost in 2002 dollars for the F-35 was between $49m and $65m, depending on the variant. A report by the General Accounting Office, the spending watchdog in the US, put the unit cost as high as $122m through 2014, when testing is scheduled to end.Lockheed said it does not agree with all the assumptions used, pointing out that 2014 was early in the production cycle and that unit cost falls steeply from there.
198;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-02-26T21:48:41Z;Wall Street pulled lower by healthcare sector;;US stocks fell on Thursday after a bright start was wiped out by the news that President Barack Obama intends to cut subsidies in the healthcare sector as part of his reform plan.Health stocks promptly dropped, losing 5.1 per cent overall.Humana, a big beneficiary of government support in making healthcare plans for the elderly, fell 19.5 per cent to $23.64.UnitedHealth, which Mr Obama plans to make bid for a new style of insurance plan along with Humana and WellPoint, fell 12.9 per cent to $20.07. Coventry Health also lost out, tumbling 14.4 per cent to $11.88.“Traders realise that the changes may begin to squeeze healthcare companies either through lowered premiums or decreased subsidies from the government,” wrote Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers.The Obama administration’s plans also spelt bad news for the defence sector, as it vowed to end overspending and schedule delays in the US weapons program.Shares in Boeing fell 3.5 per cent to $32.71 while Northrop lost 2.9 per cent to $39.42 and General Dynamics was off 1.9 per cent to $45.68.The major falls from these sectors cancelled out the gains made by banks, which rallied as the administration also announced plans to set aside an additional $250bn for future bail-out funds.Bank of America was a winner, up 3.1 per cent to $5.32 and was helped by news that it was looking to sell First Republic Bank, a private bank inherited from Merrill Lynch.The rally included JPMorgan, which climbed 6.1 per cent to $23.05 on the day of its investor conference. The bank expected to open 120 new retail branches and projected a total of 12,000 job cuts resulting from the merger with Washington Mutual.Wells Fargo was another strong performer, rising 7.1 per cent to $14.40. Among several regional banks to enjoy strong gains, Fifth Third also did well, up 18 per cent at $2.29.The S&P financial index reflected the advances made by banks and was the strongest performing sector, up 2 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down 1.6 per cent at 752.83 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.2 per cent at 7,182.08 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 2.4 per cent at 1,391.47 points.“There is a strong belief among the financial community that the centre of power has moved from New York to Washington,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equities strategist at Citigroup. “That is why the market moves on what the president says.”Stocks had rallied earlier in the day in spite of worse-than-expected economic data that showed continuing unemployment benefits passed the landmark 5m mark to a hit a fresh record..“The data is only going to get worse, and the figures on job losses are going to be very severe later this week,” said Mr Levkovich.Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Global Banking & Markets wrote that the data would “do nothing to support serious follow through in better risk appetite today, even though the focus for the moment is very much on banks”.Consumer staples also performed badly, dragged down by Safeway, the grocery chain. Safeway shed 13 per cent to $18.37 after sales came in $400m less than analyst estimates. The sector as a whole fell 2.3 per cent.Several department stores rallied initially after Sears reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations and said it would be closing an additional 24 stores to cut costs.But the stocks fell again towards the close. Sears eased 0.8 per cent to $35.54. Kohl’s lost 1.6 per cent to $34.70 and JC Penney dropped 1.7 per cent to $15.43.Energy stocks fared well early in the day as crude oil continued to rise, hitting $45 at one point during early trade. The sector climbed in early trade but succumbed late in the day to finish just below the previous session’s level.Elsewhere, IBM bucked the general downward trend in the technology sector when it reaffirmed its full-year proft outlook and forecast a profit in its business services division.This came just a week after peer Hewlett-Packard cut its full-year outlook. IBM’s shares were up 3.6 per cent at $88.97 in afternoon trade, while HP also saw some benefit, rising 0.4 per cent to $30.24.
199;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-02-03T16:27:36Z;Northrop writedowns lead to $2.5bn loss;;Northrop Grumman, the US’s third-largest defence group, said on Tuesday it had made a net loss of $2.5bn in the fourth quarter of 2008 after writing down the value of acquisitions it made several years previously.The Los Angeles-based company had warned last month that the fall in equity markets last year had prompted it to take a $3.1bn charge in the fourth quarter after writing down the book value of businesses it took over in 2001 and 2002 which are now part of its shipbuilding and space units.The company, the world’s largest warship builder, reported a quarterly net loss of $2.54bn or $7.76 a share, compared with a year-ago profit of $457m or $1.32 a share. However, excluding the goodwill charge, the company’s fourth quarter earnings rose 19 per cent to $1.57 a share.Shares in the company rose 2.5 per cent to $47.77 a share in early morning trading in New York.Northrop said sales in the fourth quarter rose 4 per cent to a record $9.2bn. For 2008 as a whole, sales increased 6 per cent to $433.9bn. Strong demand for nuclear submarines – Northrop won part of a multi-billion dollar order for eight Virginia-class nuclear submarines in December - and electronic systems helped boost the company’s order backlog to a record $78bn.In the UK, Northrop was selected to provide a new computer-aided dispatch system for the London Ambulance system to handle emergency calls and ambulance movements.For 2009, Northrop said it expected earnings per share on continuing operations to come in between $4.50-$4.75.The company is waiting to hear details from Barack Obama’s administration of a new competition to supply the US Air Force with refuelling tankers to replace 179 Eisenhower-era tankers this spring. Northrop, together with European partner EADS, beat rival Boeing for the contract last February. However, Robert Gates, defence secretary, subsequently cancelled the competition and called for a “cooling off” period after Boeing successfully protested the award. The decision was taken to run a new competition this year.Northrop is also awaiting fresh details of the upcoming defence budget. Mr Gates recently told Congress the Pentagon would be forced to make hard choices in the upcoming budget for 2010 as the department looks for ways to pay for two wars during the current financial crisis.
200;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2009-01-22T23:24:10Z;Lockheed slashes 2009 earnings forecast again;;The financial crisis took its toll on the US defence sector on Thursday as Lockheed Martin slashed its 2009 earnings forecast for a second time and Northrop Grumman warned it would report a loss for 2008 due to a writedown of up to $3.4bn.Lockheed, the world’s largest defence contractor, cut its full-year earnings forecast to $7.05-$7.25 per share, from the $7.65-$7.90 per share it projected in October and below analysts’ expectations of about $7.85 per share.The change reflects the company’s need to make up shortfalls in its pension fund, which has been hit by the financial crisis. Lockheed said it was facing $470m in pension accounting adjustments, up from its October forecast of $60m.Northrop, the US’s third-biggest defence group, said the fall in the stock market had prompted it to take a $3bn-$3.4bn charge in the fourth quarter as it writes down the book value of businesses it took over in 2001 and 2002, which are now part of its shipbuilding and space units. It is due to report earnings on February 3.Analysts said Northrop could face pension charges. “Management is being cautious in regards to the writedown,” Rob Stallard of Macquarie Securities said in a research note. “We remain more concerned about pension obligations going forward than writedowns attributed to goodwill.”There is concern within the defence industry that President Barack Obama may seek to cut military spending. Lockheed has begun an advertising campaign to promote the F-22 Raptor, suggesting it is worried that the fighter-aircraft programme may be axed.The Obama administration has put out a statement reaffirming Mr Obama’s pledge to invest in defence. Mr Obama said the US needed to keep its “unparalleled airpower capabilities”, which may suggest that he intends to maintain Lockheed’s F-22 and F-35 programmes.Lockheed reported fourth-quarter earnings ahead of Wall Street expectations, with profits of $823m or $2.05 per share, up from $799m or $1.89 per share, in the same period a year earlier.Analysts had been expecting about $1.91 per share.Bob Stevens, Lockheed chairman, president and chief executive, said the results reflected “excellent operational and financial performance across all business areas, despite the difficult economic environment”.Lockheed shares were up 3.1 per cent at $82.47 by late morning in New York.Northrop was down 0.6 per cent at $47.70.

Lockheed has begun an advertising campaign to promote the F-22 Raptor, suggesting it is worried that the fighter-aircraft programme may be axed.Shortly after he was inaugurated on Tuesday, the Obama administration put out a statement reaffirming his pledge to invest in defence. Mr Obama said the US needed to keep its “unparalleled airpower capabilities”, which may suggest that he intends to maintain Lockheed’s F-22 and F-35 programmes.In spite of the gloomy outlook, Lockheed on Thursday reported fourth-quarter earnings ahead of Wall Street expectations, with profits of $823m or $2.05 per share, up from $799m or $1.89 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had been expecting about $1.91 per share.Sales for the quarter totalled $11.1bn, up from $10.8bn for the same period in 2007, as weaker performance in Lockheed’s aeronautics and space systems divisions was offset by good results for the company’s electronic systems and information systems units.Bob Stevens, Lockheed chairman, president and chief executive, said he expected “topline agency numbers” for the 2010 military budget to be released around February 13 and warned they may be lower than the $581bn the Bush administration had projected.“It’s just fair game to ask and permit the incoming administration to take a look at that and see what they want to do in sculpting that top line,” said Mr Stevens. “It may not be $581bn. It may well be something less than that.”Lockheed shares closed up 6.31 per cent at $85.08 on Thursday. Northrop was up 0.21 per cent at $48.08.
202;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-12-14T18:40:13Z;Rolls Royce secures Lightning II contract;;"Rolls-Royce has secured its first production contract on the F-35 Lightning II, or Joint Strike Fighter programme, the biggest defence procurement project to build a new fighter jet.The UK aero-engine maker has signed a $131m contract with Pratt & Whitney, its US counterpart, to supply the lift systems for the first six jump-jet variants of the aircraft.P&W is the lead contractor for the propulsion system of the aircraft, which is being built by Lockheed Martin, of the US, and its partners Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems.In practice, the F-35 is three similar fighters. The jump-jet variant – known as Stovl, or short take-off and vertical landing – will be used by the US Marine Corp, the Italian navy and the UK armed forces. In the UK, the aircraft will replace the Harrier to fly from new aircraft carriers being built for the Royal Navy.Orders for the lift system are expected to total 600. Rolls-Royce has played a pioneering role in the development of Stovl technology since the launch of the Pegasus engine for the Harrier in the late 1950s.This latest contract follows a $1.1bn contract signed with P&W in 2001, to develop the F-35 Stovl propulsion system over 10 years. Separately, Rolls-Royce is also working with General Electric on an alternative engine for the F-35 programme.The $300bn programme could generate significant revenues for Rolls-Royce’s defence business, which already provides propulsion systems to a range of aircraft, from fighter jets to helicopters and transport aircraft.“In terms of our future, our key role in both combat programmes, the Joint Strike Fighter and the Eurofighter Typhoon, will be significant,” said Martin Fausset, managing director of defence aerospace at Rolls-Royce.The company’s defence aerospace business generated revenues of £1.7bn last year; 45 per cent of these came from the US market, some 20 per cent from the UK and the balance from the rest of the world.Rolls-Royce says it sees world demand for military aero-engine and related services of $450bn over the next 20 years. In spite of the pressure on defence budgets globally, Rolls-Royce believes significant market opportunities exist.Mr Fausset said it was looking to expand its market share in countries with significant defence budgets, such as Saudi Arabia and India.India intends to spend $40bn on defence equipment over the next five years."
203;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-12-02T00:27:46Z;Affordability is a key asset for JSF;;The mission statement for the F-35 Lightning II or Joint Strike Fighter has not changed since the programme’s inception in the mid-1990s.It reads: “Be the model acquisition programme for joint service and international co-operation. Deliver to our war fighters an affordable and effective next-generation fighter weapon and sustain it worldwide.”The key word in this military-management speak is “affordable”. The main driver when the programme was first conceived was to manage what no one had ever managed to do before, to build a highly capable fighter at a relatively low price.The current cost range for an F-35 is between $49m and $65m, depending on the variant. This compares with an estimated cost of $135m for the F-22 Raptor, Lockheed Martin’s most recent fighter jet, and about £60m ($90m) for the Eurofighter Typhoon.Pentagon planners wanted to build an economical, low-cost next-generation fighter jet that would replace many of the different fighters operated by the US air force, navy and marines. Commonality across the services would save costs.But the plan was even more ambitious: to sign up as many of the US’s allies as possible, notably those nations already flying the ubiquitous F-16, to help cut the purchase price even further, as well as the eventual in-service costs, including maintenance.“It was seen as a way of getting economies of scale,” says Tom Burbage, Lockheed Martin vice-president and general manager of the programme.In practice, the F-35 is a family of three fighter jets, all assembled on the same production line by Lockheed Martin in Fort Worth, with at least 70 per cent component commonality.The first variant, which will be bought by the US Air Force and most allies, is a conventional fighter designed for standard airstrips.The second version, bigger and sturdier, is for the US Navy and is designed to operate from aircraft carriers.The third and most complicated version is a “jump jet”, designed to replace the Harrier aircraft operated by the US marines and the UK’s Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.In the US, once in service, the F-35 will be the main combat aircraft for the navy, the air force and the marine corps, replacing the F-16, the Harrier and the older versions of the F/A-18 Hornet.Apart from costs, keeping the programme’s international partners happy has been a challenge from the start.The UK is the only “level one” partner on the programme, which gives it direct influence on the make-up of the aircraft. The UK’s BAE Systems, along with America’s Northrop Grumman, are the two industrial partners on the programme with Lockheed Martin.While the UK has no complaints about the work it has won on the programme – the value of the work to the UK supplier base is estimated to be as high as $30bn – there have been persistent concerns that US arms export controls will prevent it from gaining access to some of the technology on the aircraft to allow its armed forces to operate it independently.Negotiations between the UK and the US on this point have been protracted, with the UK at one point threatening to pull out if its concerns were not met.Mr Burbage insists that issues over this transfer of technology have now been resolved.“The UK can have the operational solution,” he says, adding that “team JSF will provide the through-life support” for the aircraft.John Osborn, US general manager of the F-35 for BAE Systems, says: “We know we have affordability problems. The biggest challenge is managing this transition through to production. Next year is the first year that more money will be spent on production rather than development.”Another nation, Norway, which last month agreed to buy the F-35, at one point expressed concerns and looked at alternative aircraft when Norwegian companies did not get the share of work that the government had expected.………….Lockheed Martin veteran and former test pilot remains in controlManagement continuity on high-risk, complex defence programmes is rare but Tom Burbage, a Lockheed Martin veteran, joined the F-35 Lightning II programme about a year before the company was selected as the prime contractor in 2000 and has been there ever since.The 61-year-old began his career not in the corporate sector but as a naval aviator following in the steps of his father. All Burbage junior ever wanted to do, he says, was fly.He accumulated thousands of hours flying different aircraft as a US navy test pilot, but in 1980, with a young family to look after, he decided it was time for a change.The corporate world beckoned and he joined Lockheed Martin, becoming manager of business development for US government programmes in Burbank.He was later appointed vice-president for operations in Washington DC, a move he describes as “his one big break”.The position brought him vital experience of the corridors of power in Washington DC, experience that helped him when he launched the F-22 fighter jet in the late 1990s and now the F-35.Until 2004, Mr Burbage was the sole programme manager but it became so big, he says, “it was hard to keep it positioned in the outside world and run the day-to-day details”.The company hired a co-manager to run the daily operations, leaving Mr Burbage free to “concentrate on getting international customers over the line, working the congressional and the budgetary issues”.He is acutely aware of the challenge he faces, not least because his job entails keeping two parties happy: his bosses at Lockheed Martin and the US government, notably US Air Force Major General Charles Davis, the programme executive officer for the F-35.Mr Burbage says the only way to do the job is “one day at a time …I don’t know where the years go”.What keeps him sane during his globetrotting is rowing. His ambition is to row in each of the partner nations on the F-35 programme.A highlight so far has been a session rowing with the Australian men’s national masters team.
204;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-10-27T17:14:19Z;Defence: Innovation keeps space sector aloft;;Southern California used to be the undisputed king of the defence and aerospace centres – the biggest companies were based in the area – but then the Cold War ended and they left. Or so many people outside California seem to believe.But it is a popular misconception that Los Angeles’s once thriving defence sector has ceased to exist. The industry has certainly contracted, following the waves of consolidation in the 1990s as the US came to grips with being the world’s only superpower, but the region around Los Angeles and southern California continues to be the acknowledged world leader in defence, thanks to an expertise in space technology design and development.“California lost aircraft manufacturing but the space industry has become very strong,” says Michael Gruntman, a professor of astronautics at the University of Southern California.He adds that about half of all US satellites are designed, developed and manufactured in the region.The consolidation of the industry when the Cold War ended meant thousands of aerospace manufacturing jobs were lost. The industry now employs about 38,000 people locally, according to Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, compared with about 130,000 in 1990.In spite of the industry’s smaller size, Los Angeles and southern California continue “to be the main aerospace centre in the US”, according to Jerry Nickelsburg, an economist at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.“Manufacturers realised that metal-bending and riveting could be done elsewhere,” he adds. “The design, development and innovation stayed here but a lot of the assembly work went to other places.”Space technology is driving much of the innovation in the industry, whether it is the Nasa scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena or the defence engineers at Raytheon’s space and airborne business, which designs electronic warfare and next-generation radar systems.All of the biggest defence companies continue to have substantial operations in or around Los Angeles: Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman are all based there, as is the Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research and development centre that supports US national security, civil and commercial space programs.Aerospace Corp has been based in El Segundo close to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) for 50 years and provides technical support to the US Air Force Space and Missile Systems Centre, which is close by.The group pioneered the first global positioning system (GPS) for satellite navigation, which came to public prominence in the first Gulf War and has become widely used in mobile phones and car navigation systems.“It was developed for the military,” says David Gorey, senior vice-president of Aerospace Corp’s space systems group. “And 10 or 15 years later, there probably isn’t an individual who is unfamiliar with that system.”Aerospace has a long and glittering history in California. The first space missions were planned in the state, inspiring a generation of engineers and technicians. “They were testing rocket engines [for the first space missions] near my home when I was a child,” says Jon Jones, president of Raytheon’s space and airborne systems business.California has “always been a place that spawned and supported innovation”, he adds. “There have been a lot of innovators. People like Howard Hughes, [Donald] Douglas and Jack Northrop all started companies here.”Military contracts continue to be the primary source of revenue for the city’s defence companies. “Thirty or 40 years ago this industry was primarily about building aircraft,” says Frank Flores, vice-president of engineering at Northrop Grumman.“The products that we are developing today are very different. They’re not just air-vehicles …they’re much more integrated and have more functions.”The entrepreneurial spirit embodied by aerospace industry pioneers such as Hughes and Douglas continues in Los Angeles where new companies, such as Space X, are challenging established business models.Based in Hawthorne, near LAX, the company was created by Elon Musk, the founder of PayPal. It is developing cheaper launch vehicles with the aim of reducing the cost of firing commercial satellites into orbit.Recent international developments, such as the Russia-Georgia conflict and the recent downing by China of a weather satellite, are new challenges for companies that rely on US defence contracts.“Space [technology] will play a big role in responding to these changes in the geo-political environment,” says Prof Gruntman of USC.But the industry faces a looming challenge. During the consolidation era of the 1990s, many graduates chose to avoid the sector in favour of other technologically sophisticated industries, such as telecoms or IT.Although that trend has since been reversed, the industry continues to suffer from a skills shortage.Northrop Grumman, one of the largest aerospace employers in Los Angeles, is currently looking to fill more than 1,000 positions. “We have to develop a new generation of aerospace professionals,” says Mr Flores.“The challenge we face is similar to the telecoms industry in terms of complexity. But the big difference is our products have to work first time.“There’s no beta test for us …with our products, lives are at stake.”
205;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-09-03T22:30:12Z;Syria in talks to buy Airbus jets;;President Nicolas Sarkozy began a two-day visit to Damascus on Wednesday as the French government confirmed that “exploratory discussions” had taken place with Syria over its desire to buy Airbus passenger jets.Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, is hoping that Mr Sarkozy’s visit – the first by a western leader for several years – will help secure his tentative return to the international fold.But the preliminary talks about the potential sale of Airbus aircraft to Syrianair will add to sensitivities over Mr Sarkozy’s initiative, particularly in Washington. The US has a trade embargo against Syria and Airbus jets contain many US-made components.Airbus, in partnership with Northrop Grumman, is still hoping to win a $35bn (€24bn, £20bn) deal to supply air-to-air refuelling tankers to the US airforce and any controversy over potential sales by the company to Syria could bolster supporters of rival bidder Boeing.An Airbus spokesman said: “We are always in discussion with any potential customer. But there is no proposal and no deal and we cannot comment on any early stage of discussion.”But a senior French official said: “These are exploratory discussions. One of the elements will be to know, when the moment comes, what will be the position of the US. But we are not at that stage as far as I know.”Mr Sarkozy met Mr Assad to discuss Lebanon and Syria’s indirect peace talks with Israel.The French and Syrian leaders will sit down on Thursday with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister, who has helped mediate the indirect talks between Syria and Israel, and the emir of Qatar, which brokered a Lebanese power-sharing agreement.Syria’s state-controlled press has billed Mr Sarkozy’s trip as an example of the failure of the US-led policy of isolation and a recognition of Damascus’s regional role.“It’s a huge public relations coup that will solidify Assad’s claim [to power],” said a diplomat. “For him it is a personal vindication.”Just nine months ago, Mr Sarkozy suspended diplomatic relations with Damascus, citing the government’s failure to help resolve the political crisis in Lebanon that threatened to drag that country back to civil war.But in May, Syria supported a Lebanese agreement reached in Doha, the Qatari capital, that paved the way for the election of a president and the formation of a Lebanese government. It was then revealed that Damascus had been holding indirect peace talks with Israel.Mr Sarkozy rewarded Syria for the developments by inviting Mr Assad to a Mediterranean Union summit and France’s national day celebrations in July – an invitation usually reserved for France’s closest allies.France’s belief is that by engaging with Damascus it can help dilute Syria’s relationship with Iran and see the Arab state become a positive force in helping resolve the Middle East’s crises.But the US still shuns Syria.
206;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-08-31T18:13:48Z;Race for tanker deal set to start;;The US Department of Defense will this week set the clock ticking on a new competition for a $35bn contract to provide aircraft refuelling tankers to the US Air Force as it publishes the final requirements for bids.An announcement of the requirements, or request for proposals, could come as early as Monday.However, the publication will be two weeks later than originally expected when the DoD announced in June it would re-open the competition that pitched Boeing against a consortium of Northrop Grumman and Europe’s EADS.The original contract was awarded to Northrop and EADS in March, provoking a fierce reaction from Boeing’s supporters about the selection of a “foreign” competitor. The Chicago-based company successfully contested the award, claiming there had been flaws in the selection process.At the time, the DoD said it would aim to make a new contract award by the end of December. But, given the delay, there are concerns it will be unable to meet its already tight timetable.And the competition could be thrown into further disarray if Boeing decides to pull out of the bidding. The company said last month it would consider withdrawing from the tanker competition if it was not granted 180 days to re-submit its bid – substantially more than the 45-60 day deadline for proposals that observers had originally been expecting.According to Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace expert at the Teal Group, John Young, the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, “is in a very tough position”.
207;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-08-26T22:05:59Z;Boeing lands $4.3bn US army helicopter deal;;Boeing on Tuesday won a $4.3bn helicopter contract with the US army, days after the company threatened to pull out of a $35bn competition to provide refuelling tankers to the US air force unless it is given an additional six months to work on its proposal.The helicopter contract will see Boeing provide 191 Chinook helicopters to the army over the next five years and also includes an option for the purchase of an additional 24 helicopters.The contract comes on top of the 48 CH-47F helicopters Boeing has already delivered to the army since it received its combat-ready certification in 2007. The aircraft is currently being used by US forces in Iraq.Jack Dougherty, vice president of Boeing’s H-47 programmes, said the contract would enable the US army to realise about $450m in savings. “This also builds security into our production schedule for the next five years, stabilising the workforce for Boeing and for our supplier partners,” he said.Boeing could announce as soon as this week that it is withdrawing from the refuelling tanker contest if it is not granted 180 days to re-submit its bid – much more than the 45-60 day deadline for proposals that most observers had been expecting before the company issued its warning last week.If Boeing were to pull out of the bidding it would be a blow to the Pentagon’s procurement process and likely delaying delivery of the aircraft.The contract was awarded to a consortium of Northrop Grumman and EADS in March, provoking a fierce reaction from Boeing and its supporters about the selection of a “foreign” competitor.Its lobbying efforts paid off in June, when the Pentagon agreed to reopen the competition after the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, agreed that there had been flaws in the selection process.The Pentagon issued a new draft of its requirements, or request for proposals, earlier this month. It is expected to issue its final request for proposals within the next two weeks.

We need to propose a different aircraft . . . If we are unable to get sufficient time to prepare for this new proposal, there is a strong likelihood that we would no-bid,” said Boeing. If Boeing pulls out of the bidding it would be a blow to the Pentagon’s procurement process and could delay delivery of the aircraft.To prepare a serious bid, Boeing said on Friday it would need extra time to evaluate the requirements and evaluate costs.The company emphasised the move was not a delaying tactic. Some analysts have said that Boeing would stand a better chance of winning the bid if the Democrats win the US election in November.The competition for the contract has already proved controversial. The defence department awarded the first contract to a consortium of Northrop Grumman and EADS earlier this year, causing dismay in the US defence industry. Boeing supporters expressed concerns that jobs would be lost overseas, although this was disputed by Northrop.In June, the Pentagon agreed to reopen the competition after the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, agreed with Boeing that there had been flaws in the selection process.The Pentagon issued a new draft of its requirements, or request for proposals, earlier this month. It declined to comment on Boeing’s request but said it still expected to issue its final request for proposals, as planned, next week.Boeing, which is competing against a team of Northrop and EADS, the European defence company, had originally proposed an aircraft based on a modified 767-200 but has been considering alternatives.The rival team had originally offered a modified Airbus A330, which can carry more fuel.
209;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
210;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-08-22T15:16:07Z;Boeing asks for more time on tanker bid;;A new competition for a $35bn contract to provide refuelling tankers to the US Air Force could be scuppered unless the government gives Boeing another six months to work on its proposal.The Chicago-based aerospace and defence company confirmed on Friday it is asking for six months to put together a new bid because the Air Force had changed its requirements and now appeared to be asking for an aircraft that could carry more fuel. The Pentagon is expected to give a 45- to 60-day deadline for the submission of final proposals.“We feel strongly this is a new competition. We need to propose a different aircraft…If we are unable to get sufficient time to prepare for this new proposal, there is a strong likelihood that we would no-bid,” said Boeing.The company had concluded that the Pentagon’s amended requirements for the competition, which is pitting Boeing against a team of Northrop Grumman and EADS, the European aerospace and defence group, required an aircraft that could carry more fuel than the 767-200 that Boeing had first proposed.To prepare a serious bid, Boeing said on Friday it would need extra time to evaluate the new requirements, talk to its suppliers and evaluate costs, a process it said was impossible to complete by an earlier deadline.“We are not asking them to change the new requirements, we are asking for a reasonable timeframe to put together a meaningful and competitive proposal,” said Boeing.The company stressed that the move was not a delaying tactic. Some analysts have said that Boeing would stand a bigger chance of winning the bid if the Democrats win the election in November.If Boeing pulls out of the bidding it would be a blow to the Pentagon’s procurement process and could delay delivery of the aircraft.

Supporters of Boeing expressed concerns that American jobs would be lost overseas, although this was disputed by Northrop.In June, the Pentagon agreed to reopen the competition after the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, agreed with Boeing that there had been flaws in the selection process.Representatives from the two companies met officials from the DoD on Tuesday to discuss the revised draft request for proposals, or RFP. The document outlines the government’s requirements for the new fleet of 179 aerial refuelling aircraft.After the meeting, Boeing, which had been rumoured to be considering pulling out of the competition, appeared to keep all its options open. It said it hoped the meeting “was just the beginning of a continuing dialogue as we move toward a final RFP that prescribes the right aircraft and gives appropriate weight to all of the capabilities that will be required for the evolving mission over the next several decades”.The new draft RFP suggests that extra credit will be given to a tanker that can offload more fuel, an element that would appear to favour the bigger aircraft being offered by Northrop and EADS. The consortium is offering a tanker based on the Airbus A330, while Boeing fielded its smaller 767 in the first competition. There has been speculation that Boeing could decide to offer its larger 777 aircraft in the revised competition.The DoD is now expected to issue its final set of requirements next week. The companies will then have 45 days to submit their final proposals.They will be asked to submit revisions to these in the first week of December, with an award made around the end of the month.

213;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-07-31T00:09:26Z;Congress move may force Pentagon tanker rethink;;The Pentagon may have to consider the impact on the US industrial base of awarding a refuelling tanker contract to EADS, the European aerospace and defence company, if a measure passed on Wednesday by a congressional committee becomes law.The House appropriations defence committee bill could benefit US’s Boeing over EADS and Northrop Grumman, its US partner, in a new competition to provide the Pentagon with 179 in-flight refuelling tankers.Randy Belote, spokesman for Northrop, said the company believed the provision ”does not introduce a new definition of ’industrial base’ or a change in law”, which he said meant that Northrop and EADS’s KC-45 tanker was ”fully compliant with all current industrial base requirements”.The US Air Force stunned the defence industry in February by awarding a $35bn contract to EADS and Northrop instead of Boeing, which has supplied the military with tankers for decades.Last month, the Pentagon agreed to reopen the competition after the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, agreed with Boeing that there had been flaws in the selection process.Before the GAO decision, Robert Gates, US defence secretary, had reminded congressional critics that US law barred the Pentagon from considering industrial base issues in awarding military contracts.But the latest congressional move – which needs full committee approval – could force the Pentagon to consider how another EADS victory would impact on the US defence industrial base.Separately on Wednesday, EADS said it was planning further cost-cutting and restructuring measures at Airbus and other divisions aimed at saving €1bn ($1.6bn) a year by 2011/12.EADS has been forced to take an additional €715m charge resulting from the latest round of delays in early deliveries of the A380 superjumbo. It also remains “cautious” about its efforts to overcome delays in the development of the A400M military transport aircraft.The cuts and planned efficiency improvements, which will be presented to trade unions in the autumn, are being forced on EADS in part by continuing weakness of the dollar against the euro, which is undermining the competitiveness of Airbus against Boeing.The group is in the midst of its existing Power8 restructuring programme aimed at saving €2.1bn a year by 2010 and eliminating 10,000 jobs.The group confirmed its previous forecast for a recovery in operating profit (before goodwill and exceptional charges) to €1.8bn in the whole of 2008, in spite of the extra charge for the A380 delays and lossmaking contracts. Profits fell steeply in the previous two years to €52m in 2007 and €399m in 2006 because of restructuring charges and delays of more than two years in A380 deliveries.EADS said on Wednesday that in the first half of the year operating profit (before goodwill and exceptional charges) had risen from €358m to €1.16bn, while revenues had increased by 8 per cent to €19.7bn.The shares fell 62 cents, or 5 per cent, at €12.05.
214;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Northrop earnings boosted by new orders;;Northrop Grumman, the Los Angeles-based defence group, on Tuesday said profit in its second quarter rose 8 per cent on the back of new orders for its military equipment and electronics, as well as one-off tax benefits.America’s third-largest defence contractor said net profit in the three months to June 30 was $495m, or $1.44 per share, up from $460m or $1.31 per share in the same period last year. New business awards won during the quarter totalled $7.5bn.Earnings from continuing operations increased to $483m, from $472m. Sales for the quarter rose 10 per cent to $8.63bn.Ron Sugar, Northrop chairman and chief executive, said based on this quarter’s solid numbers and a total backlog of $67bn, the company remained on track to achieve its guidance for 2008. “The long-term outlook for Northrop Grumman remains outstanding,” he said in a statement.Despite the strong inflow of new orders, Northrop is still waiting for the final outcome on two key programmes.In February, the company, together with European partner, EADS, beat a rival bid from Boeing to win a $35bn contract to provide the US Air Force with refuelling tankers. Boeing’s subsequent appeal against the award was upheld and the competition has been re-opened with a new contract award expected by the end of this year.During the second quarter, Northrop was also awarded a $1.16bn contract from the US Navy for the development of a new maritime surveillance unmanned aircraft system, BAMS. Rival Lockheed Martin is contesting the award. A decision on whether to uphold the protest is expected next month.Last week, the company said it was increasing its quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share, from $0.37 per share. Shares in Northrop were up marginally from their previous day’s close of $68.67 in pre-market trading in New York.

Still, gains were trimmed slightly by results from Burlington Northern Santa Fe. The railway company said second-quarter profit had fallen 19 per cent to $350m due to higher fuel costs and flooding in the Midwest, and the shares fell 0.7 per cent to $98.05.The housing market also offered a pleasant surprise, as sales of newly-constructed single-family homes fell only 0.6 per cent to a 530,000 annual pace – a smaller decline than expected.Homebuilders rose 2.2 per cent with a 4 per cent gain to $11.51 for Lennar helping to lead the way.Consumer-facing sectors rose as oil continued to pull back and a survey showed a surprise rebound in consumer confidence. Technology stocks were the strongest gainers, benefiting from some decent earnings news as well. Google added 3.4 per cent to $491.98, while Ebay gained 4.1 per cent to $25.40 and the sector advanced 1.6 per cent.Juniper Networks was the biggest winner in the sector after its second-quarter profits jumped 40 per cent and it lifted third-quarter forecasts. Juniper shares surged 17.7 per cent to $26.57.Energy also fared well thanks to Arch Coal which said second-quarter profit had tripled and the company raised its full-year forecast. Arch Coal rose 9.2 per cent to $55.64 while the sector added 1 per cent. Over the week, energy was the biggest loser, however, dipping 2.7 per cent as oil fell back. The benchmark S&P 500 pared early gains but was still ahead 0.4 per cent at 1,257.77 points at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent to 11,370.69 points and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent higher at 2,310.53 points.In recent days equity markets have been roiled by earnings news and other ructions in the financials. The sector jumped 6.6 per cent on Tuesday only to see fragile confidence crumble and suffer its biggest fall in eight years two days later.Those moves largely cancelled out each other, however, and the S&P 500 lost 0.2 per cent over the week. The index has now fallen for seven of the past eight weeks. The Dow dipped 1.1 per cent and the Nasdaq added 1.2 per cent over the week. Financials edged down 0.1 per cent.Linda Duessel, an equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Last week we rallied sharply as investors sold energy stocks to cover shorts in financials. So the question is, now what are we going to do? Trading could be sloppy as we search for new leadership.”Friday produced some more bad news from the financials. Early gains were wiped out after data showed rising foreclosures, and S&P said it might cut certain of the ratings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The pair fell 3.9 per cent to $11.55 and 6.1 per cent to $8.27, respectively. The financial sector as a whole lost 0.6 per cent.Although somewhat obscured by the travails of the financials, earnings season kicked into high gear this week. After 226 company reports, earnings for the S&P 500 are down 24.6 per cent on average. Excluding financials, though, earnings grew by 9.3 per cent.Industrial stocks were among the biggest gainers over the week, adding 1.4 per cent. The healthcare sector gained ground, climbing 1.3 per cent over the week thanks to some solid results from the likes of Coventry Health Care and Unitedhealth Group.The pair added 10.7 per cent to $33.46 and 14.7 per cent to $27.45 over the week, respectively.
216;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;America’s air force misses the target;;Say what you like about the F-22, the world’s most advanced and expensive fighter jet, it is obviously fun to fly. One of these $350m aircraft dipped and fluttered around the sky above the Farnborough air show this week in a bravura show of agility.The F-22 is a supersonic stealth aircraft dreamt up at the end of the cold war to impose American air superiority over Soviet fighters. In recent exercises, its invisibility and advanced radar and avionics allowed it to shoot down 80 aircraft for every time that it was hit itself.The F-22’s party trick is to be able to pivot horizontally in mid-air as it sniffs around for a target. “The sensation is not: ‘Oh, my gosh, the nose is slipping out of control. It is ‘Oh, my gosh, I can get the nose to do what I want,’ ” said Al Norman, the F-22’s senior test pilot.What impresses the US air force, however, is not what pleases the US government. The F-22 has become a symbol of what Robert Gates, the defence secretary, has dubbed “ ‘next-war-itis’ – the propensity of much of the defence establishment to be in favour of what might be needed in a future conflict”.Mr Gates wants the US military instead to focus on the “war on terror” and asymmetric conflicts in which it has to work with allies to combat suicide bombers and insurgents in hot, dusty countries. The kind of air support that such campaigns require is helicopters and cargo aircraft, not a 21st-century stealth fighter jet.As a result, he has stood firm against the USAF’s wish to have 381 F-22s to replace its ageing fleet of F-15s, a Vietnam-era fighter that has been repeatedly patched and upgraded. The US will buy only 183 and intends to make do instead with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a forthcoming stealth aircraft that is cheaper and more versatile.Mr Gates may be right that the F-22 will prove an unnecessary precaution in the world as we know it and that five squadrons is “a reasonable buy”. But there are two difficulties with his obstinate position, one military and the second financial.The military problem is that air superiority is something the US takes for granted but is not inevitable. Mr Gates clearly believes the USAF is stuck in the past but he could equally be accused of being stuck in the present. While terrorism is the immediate threat, China’s military rise and Russia’s military resurgence are worries for the future.If it came to a “peer” battle with another military power, the US would have sheer numbers on its side. But Russian-built Sukhoi Su-27s, which have been acquired by countries including China, could match the US’s “fourth generation” aircraft – F-15s and the like – in a fight.It would require a “fifth generation” stealth fighter – either an F-22 or an F-35 – to see them off. The US should have plenty of Joint Strike Fighters: it has ordered about 2,400 for its air force, marines and navy, which are due to enter service in 2011.But the Joint Strike Fighter, which is being developed and shared with allies including the UK, Italy and Canada, was not primarily designed as an “air superiority” fighter. It is a fighter-bomber intended to be shielded by F-22s in any big battle.The second problem is that Mr Gates’ F-22 stance is financially crazy. Unlike the JSF programme, the US will not share the F-22 with its allies because it wants to keep hold of the technology. But it does not want to buy many of them either.This has made each F-22 absurdly expensive. The General Accountability Office has put the cost of each one at $345m (€218m, £173m) if the programme is limited to 183 aircraft. The marginal cost of building each F-22 is about $140m, while the Joint Strike Fighter should cost about half that sum.If the US really does not want to buy any more F-22s, the next step is obvious: it should allow its allies to buy them instead (Australia and Japan have already shown interest). This would have the dual benefit of getting more F-22s in the sky and lowering the unit price.It would also fit with the trend – especially in air force procurement – of the US sharing technology and development costs with others. The reality for contractors such as Lockheed Martin, which is the main company behind the F-22 and the Joint Strike Fighter, is that making aircraft purely for the US air force is becoming less attractive.The USAF does not hand out a lot of new contracts. Mr Gates’ stance on the F-22 is part of a shift towards giving priority to the army, navy and marines. The fierceness of the current battle between Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS over the $35bn contract to replace US air tankers is an indication of their scarcity.Even when the US does buys a new or upgraded aircraft, it is less risky and more profitable for a contractor if it is allowed to sell versions of it overseas. Not only can it produce more of the same thing but it can defray development costs.It is also, as the F-22 fiasco shows, becoming harder to trust the USAF. Even when it chooses an aircraft and wants to order plenty of them, it is liable to be overruled by the US government. It may not be the USAF’s fault but its grip on procurement is clearly a bit precarious.So, if I were a manufacturer, I would try to ensure that future air contracts were shared between the USAF and other countries. And, if I were Mr Gates, I would either buy more F-22s or allow US allies to buy and fly them instead. Otherwise, the F-22, astounding though it is, will have been a costly mistake.john.gapper@ft.comRead and post comments at John Gapper’s Business Blog
217;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-07-15T22:37:37Z;Northrop chief warns on tanker meddling;;Ronald Sugar, chief executive of Northrop Grumman, which is vying with Boeing over a $35bn US Air Force tanker contract, has warned of “dire consequences to the transatlantic alliance” should the competition be influenced by protectionism.The tussle between Northrop and European partner EADS, and Boeing for the contract to provide refuelling tankers to the USAF has attracted an unprecedented amount of political attention in recent months. Northrop and EADS originally won the contract in February, a victory some Boeing supporters warned would cost American jobs.The two saw their victory overturned last week as the US Department of Defence decided to re-open the competition after Boeing complained about the process of the initial competition.The decision came after a damning report by the General Accountability Office, an arm of Congress, which said it agreed with Boeing that there had been flaws in the process used to choose Northrop and EADS.“There will be dire consequences to transatlantic alliance if this decision is reversed on political grounds because it would basically send a chilling signal in terms of our relationship with our most trusted Allies that we do have to fight together with in the future,” Mr Sugar said in an interview with the Financial Times at the Farnborough International Airshow.“All major US defence and aerospace companies fully support international trade and global access to technology. We have one strange anomaly here where for the purpose of this programme you have an argument being made for the purposes of protectionism. But even the companies involved, even our adversary here, is extraordinarily supportive of international trade – they have to be, they built half of the 787 out of the US,” he added.According to Mr Sugar, much of the political noise surrounding the competition was due to “a handful of political people who are more concerned about work in their state”.“The bizarreness of this is that [the Northrop/EADS proposal] will create 48,000 new jobs in the US and we are an American company,” he added.Speaking separately at the Farnborough show, Jim McNerney, chief executive of Boeing, insisted that protectionism had had nothing to do with the company’s protest. Its protest had been based on the process. “This is a technical issue for us. I have worked hard to get our employees to focus on the issue in this way,” he said.Mr McNerney said the company’s protest could risk its working relationship with the USAF, although this was its first objection to a procurement process, whereas Boeing’s rivals had filed at least 28 protests in the last decade.
218;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-07-14T09:59:47Z;UAVs: Killer drones turn benign;;Over the past year, the US Army and Air Force have been pushing to send more pilotless aircraft to patrol the skies above Iraq and Afghanistan.Once a tool primarily for military intelligence, drones have quietly transformed into offensive weapons. The US Army recently sent Sky Warriors, armed variants of the well-known Predator, to Iraq, and the USAF has the Reaper, a larger version of the Predator that carries more armament.The aircraft have become so central to military operations that the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, recently scolded Air Force leaders for not sending them quickly enough to the field.Still, the US, which operates more than 5,000 such aircraft, holds the lead in unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs in military-speak. Other countries, however, are catching up. Israel, which also has an active UAV industry, has been using armed drones in its controversial policy of targeted killings. The UK recently confirmed it had fired weapons in combat for the first time from its Reaper UAV, and BAE Systems this year unveiled its appropriately named “Fury” drone.But do not expect companies soon to play up the image of armed drones patrolling the battlefield. At this year’s Farnborough International Airshow, companies say they will push unmanned systems of many types, but very little on the armed side. Tom Cassidy, president of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems and maker of the Predator, confirms his company will highlight the MQ-9 Reaper, but foreign sales are limited. “That’s the way it is and probably the way it’s going to stay,” says Mr Cassidy. “The US is very concerned, exporting this capability.”In general, companies are hesitant to market armed UAVs. “It’s a sensitive issue,” agrees Daryl Davidson, executive director of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), a trade group. “People also don’t want to draw the ire of protesters.”What people will see at Farnborough, according to Mr Davidson, is a number of unmanned aircraft of different shapes and sizes. The variety of drones is having a significant impact on the commercial market.“Eight to 10 years ago, a lot of people in the business were thinking that what was going to emerge were large airplanes at high altitudes,” Mr Davidson says. “It’s just the opposite, with the proliferation of very small, portable, small-footprint UAVs that can be transported in a backpack or the inside of a small truck or Humvee.”In fact, some of the biggest companies will have limited offerings on display at Farnborough. For instance, Lockheed Martin, which debuted its Polecat UAV at Farnborough two years ago, has been relatively quiet about its unmanned efforts since the aircraft crashed in testing. A spokesperson confirmed Lockheed will not be displaying unmanned systems this year. Boeing is showing off ScanEagle, used by the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan. Raytheon will market an unmanned ground-control system.The push now is to move UAVs into more areas, from maritime surveillance to local law enforcement. Police departments are looking at UAVs to monitor traffic. In California, they have been used track wildfires.The military is also thinking about expanding the uses of drones. Mark Lewis, the USAF chief scientist, says: “In the broadest operational sense, trends will take us further on the path of using UAVs in ways, and for applications, that inhabited systems could not fill.”Northrop, which builds the US Air Force’s high-flying Global Hawk UAV, is similarly looking at the commercial sector. The market, according to Ed Walby, a business development director at Northrop Grumman, is similar to the satellite market of the 1960s and 1970s, when only the government could afford to build. Now, with UAVs there is “this explosion of commercial applications,” he says.For their part, companies are eager to demonstrate the softer side of UAVs, says Mr Davidson of the AUVSI. That in turn, is spurring others to get into the market, and to look for commercial applications. “The growing commercial market,” Mr Davidson predicts, “will dwarf the defence and civil markets.”………………………………………………………………In the driving seat of historyHe flew it in. And he was flying it out again. David Thomas was the RAF display pilot who flew Avro Vulcan bomber XH558 into its Bruntingthorpe hibernation in 1993. And he was in the right-hand seat when the cold war warrior returned to the air last October at the end of a unique, £7m ($13.8m) restoration, writes Rohit Jaggi.Visitors to Farnborough should on Wednesday be treated to a show by a type that first displayed at the event in 1957. They will see an aircraft whose dramatic delta wing belies the fact that it came into service just 11 years after second world war stalwart the Avro Lancaster. And they will see an aircraft that not only carried nuclear weapons, but also delivered bombs to the other side of the world during the Falklands war.Mr Thomas was at the helm of the Vulcan when I saw it take to the skies above Leicestershire last month on its last test flight in support of its permit to fly. I needed a torch to peer into the vast bomb bay, empty of everything except the ghosts of the 20,000lb nuclear weapons it was built to carry. By contrast, the area for the crew of five is tiny.Mr Thomas is bubbling with enthusiasm. “She handles like a fighter,” he says. “You don’t so much fly one as strap it on.”The Vulcan does about two gallons to the mile, not so bad given that it is a 200,000lb-plus behemoth, but the restoration team cannot hide the fact that it has relatively dirty engines. Still, the fuel it will use for a season of display flights is equivalent to just one return flight by a 747 from London to San Francisco. And the Vulcan to the Sky Trust plans to buy 558 trees to offset carbon used.If this piece of history can be kept in the air it will be used as inspiration for the next generation to carry on the UK’s tradition of engineering innovation. But the cost will run to £1.6m a year – and while Aerobytes, a software supplier, has stepped in to underwrite costs until the end of July, the future is uncertain.
219;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;EADS: Blow to the Franco-German flagship’s defence ambitions;;The joy experienced by Louis Gallois, chief executive of EADS, at the group’s unexpected victory this year over Boeing to supply a fleet of in-flight refuelling-tanker aircraft to the US Air Force has been short-lived.The decision by the US defence department last week to reopen the $35bn air-tanker contract is a big blow to the US defence ambitions of Europe’s leading aerospace and defence group. Against all odds, it won the contract with its US partner Northrop Grumman as the prime contractor in February.Robert Gates, US secretary of defence, launched an “expedited” new competition and said he hoped the final contract could be awarded by the end of the year.The delay – and, ultimately, the possible loss – of the tanker deal is not an immediate financial blow. Deliveries of the aircraft were not due to build up until early into the next decade.But losing the deal would slow significantly EADS’s efforts both to build a bigger presence in the defence sector to balance its dependence on commercial aircraft, and just as importantly to shift more of its production into the dollar zone and out of expensive euro-based economies.Already it has had to freeze the plan to build an assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama, not only for the tanker aircraft but also for its A330 freighters.Since January, Mr Gallois has been elaborating his Vision 2020 for the development of EADS in an effort to generate new momentum.He wants to increase the weight of defence activities in the group to balance the cyclical risk of the Airbus commercial aircraft business, and to build a much more substantial presence, in both services and equipment, in the US defence market. Potential acquisitions are being studied and one small deal in the US has already been completed.Mr Gallois is also aiming to increase the group’s industrial presence in the US, and to raise the share of dollar-based activities outside Europe to provide better protection against foreign exchange volatility.Mr Gallois, previously the French joint chief executive, took over as sole chief executive last autumn as a product of the long overdue reform of the Franco-German group’s tangled corporate governance.But his early efforts to build a stable and united management team, focused on industrial recovery and international expansion, are being undermined by the continuing French regulatory and judicial investigations into alleged insider dealing by 17 former and present EADS and Airbus executives and by its two core industrial shareholders, France’s Lagardere and Daimler of Germany, ahead of a profit warning in June 2006. All deny any wrongdoing.Mr Gallois said in an interview with the Financial Times that he was concerned “the morale of the people in the company could be hurt by this constant pressure. That is my main concern, but we have to live with that. My line is always the same. These guys are not guilty. There is no judgment. You cannot be guilty without judgment and we will defend them as [best] we can. We are fully confident they will be able to find good arguments to defend themselves.”The investigations are distracting management attention at a time, when the group faces complex challenges in its main market of commercial aerospace.The airline industry is fast entering a crisis and cyclical downturn triggered by the sudden surge in fuel costs. The fear is growing that Airbus commercial jet production targets for the next couple of years are too ambitious, and that some of the huge order backlog successfully built in the past three years could start to melt away as airlines defer orders and some go out of business altogether.While the commercial environment becomes more difficult, EADS is breaking new ground in its efforts to extend its global industrial presence and to outsource more activities to low-cost and dollar-zone countries.Last month, Airbus started transporting the first aircraft modules to its new single-aisle jet assembly line in Tianjin, China. The assembly process of the first aircraft for Sichuan Airlines will start in August with delivery scheduled for the first half of next year.Airbus is also seeking to outsource more work on future programmes than on any previous aircraft, and it has recently agreed a big contract with Spirit AeroSystems of the US to design and manufacture the lower-composite centre-fuselage frame for the new A350 family of long-range wide-body jets.Spirit will produce the composite fuselage structure in a new facility to be built in North Carolina.For the A350, about 50 per cent of the aerostructures work will be outsourced to risk-sharing partners, up from 30 per cent with the A380.Airbus is awarding large work packages to tier-one suppliers, such as Spirit, in order to achieve a better spread of its future investments and risks.
220;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-07-14T09:59:46Z;787 Dreamliner: Boeing levels off after losing altitude;;In April of this year, Boeing looked to be in the doldrums. After weeks of intense speculation, the US aircraft maker admitted it was delaying the production of its 787 Dreamliner for the third time. First deliveries of the aircraft would not begin until mid-2009, Boeing said – 14 months behind schedule.Another delay was humiliating enough, but it came as Boeing was still nursing its bruises from losing a $35bn contract to supply the US Air Force with aerial-refuelling tankers. The Pentagon plumped for a rival bid from EADS, the European defence company, and Northrop Grumman, its US partner.By last month, however, the Chicago-based aircraft-maker appeared to have turned a corner. In Seattle, its commercial aircraft division completed the “power-on” sequence for the 787, connecting each of its complex electrical systems to a power grid. For the much-delayed 787, this signalled Boeing’s intentions to get the programme back on track. Heidi Wood, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, called it “a positive step towards rebuilding lost credibility and perceived risk on the programme”.The milestone came after the Government Accountability Office, oversight arm of the US Congress, agreed with Boeing that there were flaws in the process used to award the refuelling deal. The Department of Defence is now reopening the bidding.Both the 787 and the aerial-refuelling tanker have important implications for Boeing’s competition with Airbus, the European aircraft-maker that is the US company’s only significant rival in commercial jets.The success of the 787 – the most successful new commercial aircraft in the history of aviation in terms of launch sales – is critical to the company’s overall competitive strategy. It symbolises how Boeing and Airbus made very different bets on which kind of aircraft to develop. The mid-sized 787 focuses on light materials to aid fuel efficiency – as opposed to Airbus’s A380, which carries more than twice as many passengers.Boeing touted the 787, a $10bn project, as the aircraft that would help re-establish the company after years of trailing Airbus.Cai von Rumohr, analyst at Cowen and Company in Boston, says that, while the delays may have sullied that aim, they came as little surprise. “They screwed up on the 787, but they had also screwed up on the 737 and the 747, and Airbus screwed up on the A380,” he says. “That goes with the territory. This is technology that’s tough to get to run on time without problems. They’re dealing with sophisticated customers that get upset at times but understand and which have Airbus as their only other buying option – and Airbus has also made mistakes.”If the 787 reflects Boeing’s competition with Airbus for commercial aircraft, the refuelling tanker speaks to an intense desire to keep EADS, Airbus’s parent, out of the US defence market. Much is at stake: if EADS is able to establish a production base in the US, the fear is that it will chip away at Boeing’s effective monopoly in North America.Although Boeing may be quietly pleased at developments over the past six weeks, there is still scope for its outlook to sour again.First, there is the possibility that the 787 could be further delayed. The aircraft is yet to be flight-tested, when other problems could surface. Second, although the GAO ruled in Boeing’s favour, the Air Force may well deny its bid for the aerial-refuelling tanker contract a second time. Third, in the longer term, Boeing could fall foul of any review of US military priorities after a new administration is installed in Washington.Fourth, it faces broader concerns about how the spike in fuel prices could hit the airline sector. One school of thought is that airlines will respond by moving to more fuel-efficient aircraft and retiring gas-guzzlers. Boeing could also be helped by the geographic diversity of its customer base.A more worrying scenario is that more and more customers start to defer orders – something that has already started. Historically, order backlogs build up towards the end of a boom and deferrals tend to kick in 18-24 months after a downturn begins.With order books healthier than they have ever been, that is unlikely to affect Boeing in the near future, but it could prove a longer-term concern. “You have a seven-year backlog, so you’ll see some movement within that – some guys moving out, others moving forward,” says Mr Von Rumohr. “But you also have to consider the risk – are all the customers going to be there to buy the product?”………………………………………………………………………………………………….Dreamliner’s glitzy launch succeeded by nightmaresWhen Boeing presented its 787 Dreamliner to the world, it went for glitz.The glossy ceremony, held at the company’s factory near Seattle, was hosted by Tom Brokaw, the TV anchorman, and attended by 15,000 guests – including the US transport secretary. It was watched by thousands more employees on screens at a nearby sports stadium and other viewers in 45 countries.Even the date of July 8 2007 – 7/8/7 in US date format – was chosen for impact.But the roll-out was soon overshadowed by persistent rumours that the aircraft that had been unveiled was nothing more than a shell. Eventually, Boeing was forced to admit that important systems had not been installed and the 787 had been held together with temporary fasteners.It was the first in a series of errors. Since then, the programme has been delayed three times, underlining how one of the aircraft’s main virtues – a global supply chain – has proved to be a costly and embarrassing burden.Demand for the 787 – a long-range, 250- to 300-seat jet whose carbon-fibre body is set to make it 20 per cent more fuel-efficient than comparable models – has been record-breaking: Boeing has received orders from more than 60 customers for 892 aircraft, worth $145bn at list prices.But while the aircraft is high-tech and futuristic, its production has been slowed by low-tech problems in supply-chain management.Boeing envisaged that suppliers around the world would ship near-completed fuselage sections, already stuffed with wiring and systems, to Seattle, where they would be put together in as little as three days.In practice, that placed the aircraft’s prospects in the hands of contractors. The aggregated difficulties of these companies loosened Boeing’s grip on what were aggressive production targets.Alenia Aeronautica, an Italian company that makes part of the fuselage, had to replant a 300-year-old olive grove before it could build its factory in southern Italy. Production at Vought, a supplier in South Carolina that provides the rear section of the fuselage, was complicated by it sub-contracting work to Israeli Aerospace Industries in Tel Aviv. The assembly instructions on some components arrived with no English translation.Mike Bair, the Boeing executive who ran the 787 programme until he was replaced after the first delays last October, told an audience in Seattle last year that the company would have to reconsider its supply system. Prompted by the FT, Jim McNerney, Boeing’s chief executive, admitted in April that “we have learned a lot and have the scars to prove it”, but reaffirmed his commitment to the global supply chain.Most analysts agree that if Boeing can make global outsourcing work, it can gain an important competitive advantage.Meanwhile, the 787 programme now faces the more traditional concern of problems emerging when flight testing begins.It also faces demands from customers for compensation. Boeing has already said it is assuming all 787 deliveries it expects to make next year will not generate profit because of negotiations about compensation for delays.It can afford no more errors.
221;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-07-13T20:38:59Z;Boeing claims ‘most capable aircraft’ in tanker deal;;Jim Albaugh, head of Boeing’s defence business, insisted that the company had offered “the most capable airplane” in the contest to provide refuelling tankers to the US Air Force.The Chicago-based company was handed a remarkable reprieve last week after the US Department of Defense overturned a previous victory by rivals Northrop Grumman and EADS for the $35bn contract.Boeing, which has supplied the military with tankers for decades, had immediately protested against the February award.Last week’s decision to reopen the competition followed a damning report by the General Accountability Office, an arm of Congress, which said it agreed with Boeing that there were flaws in the process used to choose EADS and Northrop.In its report, the GAO upheld eight of more than 100 complaints that Boeing raised about the selection process.Speaking ahead of Monday‘s Farnborough Airshow, Mr Albaugh said Boeing would wait to see how the guidelines for bids might change under the new competition before deciding whether to retender its 767.Under the original tender, Boeing proposed an offering based on its mid-sized 767 aircraft rather than the larger A330 aircraft offered by EADS and Northrop.There has been speculation that Boeing could now decide to field the larger 777 aircraft. “Our view continues to be that a big airplane is not the solution,” he said. “It has high operating costs and doesn’t have the flexibility to land at all airports.”Boeing, he said, had fielded the “most capable airplane” with the “lowest risk” and “lowest life-cycle cost”. The company would ultimately be driven by the requirements of the air force but it was not sure “a big airplane is the right answer”.He defended the company’s decision to protest against the award, stressing that the protest had been “based on procedural issues and it was sustained based on procedural issues”.The contract has attracted much political attention in the US and Europe.Some had seen the victory by Northrop and EADS as a sign that the lucrative US defence market was now fully open to competition from abroad. Mr Albaugh said: “A lot of people have tried to say this is all about ‘Buy America’ but to us it was all about the Request for Proposal [guidelines for the contract] was not followed.”EADS on Sunday said it was confident that it would be able to win back the contract. John Young, chief operating officer of EADS North America and chief executive of its tanker programme in the US, said: “We have the best product . . . that will stand the test of time. The US military always chooses the best product.”Separately, Boeing said it is working on a sixth-generation fighter aircraft. The company has already invested money on prototypes and technologies but declined to give any further details.
222;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-07-10T00:02:59Z;US to reopen EADS tanker contract;;The US ambitions of EADS suffered a setback on Wednesday after the Pentagon announced it would reopen a $35bn air-tanker contract, overturning an earlier victory by the European group over rival Boeing.Robert Gates, US secretary of defence, said an “expedited” new competition would be launched to provide refuelling tankers to the US air force.Mr Gates said he would ask for revised proposals from industry and that the new selection process would be overseen by John Young, the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, and not the air force.The decision is a big blow to the US defence ambitions of EADS. The Franco-German aerospace and defence group won the contract against all odds with US partner Northrop Grumman in February. The victory was a key plank in EADS’ ambitions to build a footprint in the US, the world’s largest defence market.Boeing, which had supplied the military with tankers for five decades, immediately protested the award. Wednesday’s decision follows a damning report by the General Accountability Office, an arm of Congress, which last month said it agreed with Boeing that there were flaws in the process used to choose EADS and Northrop.In its report, the GAO said the air force had made “significant errors” in awarding the contract to Northrop and EADS over Boeing. It stressed that its decision had been based on errors in the selection process and was not an assessment of the merits of the two competing aircraft.On Wednesday, Mr Gates said the contract could not be awarded at present “because of significant issues pointed out by the GAO”. The new contest would re-examine the eight Boeing concerns that were upheld by the GAO, out of more than 100 that it had raised, he said.Mr Gates stressed that “this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long”.He said he hoped to award a contract by December.Northrop said it was reviewing the decision “to ensure the re-competition will provide both companies a fair opportunity to present the strengths of their proposals”.The decision is a remarkable reprieve for Boeing. The company had won an earlier contract to lease 100 tankers to the air force but this was cancelled by Congress after it emerged that Darleen Druyun, a senior air force procurement official, had held illegal discussions with Boeing during negotiations■ Andreas Sperl, an EADS executive, was taken into custody for questioning by Paris police on Wednesday as part of an insider-trading investigation, a spokesman for the company said. Sperl, 61, chief executive of EADS’s Elbe Flugzeugwerke unit, is the first acting EADS executive to be held by police in their probe. He was previously chief financial officer of EADS’s Airbus SAS, whose aircraft production delays are at the root of the investigation
223;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-07-09T22:35:42Z;Boeing back in play as ‘natural order’ returns;;When the US Air Force earlier this year gave EADS, the European defence and aerospace company, a $35bn contract to supply it with refuelling tankers, the decision sent shockwaves across the Atlantic.Washington had never chosen anyone other than Boeing to provide air-to-air refuelling and the contract had been regarded as a shoo-in for the Chicago-based company. On Wednesday, the natural order of things reasserted itself, at least in part.EADS and its US partner, Northrop Grumman, saw their contract snatched away. The Department of Defense said it would re-open the competition and take the handling of the new process away from the air force.The Pentagon’s February decision had caused rejoicing in the European aerospace industry which regarded it as a landmark deal that finally opened up the lucrative US defence market.Boeing was stunned. After an outcry from senior executives, the company appealed the decision, the first time it had made a formal protest against a US defence contract award.Its complaint led the General Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, to conduct an investigation into the air force’s handling of the contract negotiations. Last month, in a damning report it said it agreed with Boeing that there were flaws in the process used to choose EADS and Northrop.On Wednesday, Boeing welcomed the decision to reopen the contract but cautioned that the government’s guidelines for bids might change. Under the original competition Boeing proposed an offering based on its mid-sized 767 aircraft rather than the larger A330 aircraft offered by EADS and Northrop.“We remain concerned that a renewed request for proposals (RFP) may include changes that significantly alter the selection criteria set forth in the original solicitation,” Boeing said. “As the GAO reported in upholding our protest, we submitted the only proposal that fully met the mandatory criteria of the original RFP.”Separately, Northrop said it was reviewing the decision “to ensure the recompetition will provide both companies a fair opportunity to present the strengths of their proposals”.Louis Gallois, chief executive of EADS, said he welcomed the decision and that EADS was “prepared to fully support our partner Northrop Grumman in rapidly addressing our customer’s requirements. We are ready and anxious to get back to work and begin delivering the world’s most capable tankers to our partner and the US air force.”Announcing his decision on Wednesday, Robert Gates, US defence secretary, said he hoped to complete the new selection process by December.Defence analysts, however, said they would be surprised if a decision could be reached that quickly. Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute said: “There is not enough time left in this administration to do a competent re-award of the tanker contract. I expect the award to be finally made in the next administration.”
224;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-06-19T22:59:26Z;More pain to come as EADS fights on;;"It always seemed too good to be true. The victory in March by EADS and its US partner Northrop Grumman over Boeing in the fierce competition to supply inflight refuelling tanker aircraft to the US Air Force – an initial $35bn contract – was won against the odds.EADS and its Airbus subsidiary may have won a string of other contests against Boeing to supply tanker aircraft to the UK, Australia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, giving the company belief it had the superior product.But translating that strength into actual orders in Boeing’s own backyard seemed an unlikely step, and EADS senior executives were incredulous in private at the breakthrough. Once the initial euphoria passed it became clear Boeing was not giving up without a fight and would press its appeal hard to Congress.The decision on Wednesday by US congressional investigators to urge the US Air Force to re-open the competition and to obtain revised proposals from the contestants was much less of a surprise than EADS’s initial victory, but it could still be a serious setback for the European group’s long-held ambitions to build a significant presence in the US, which has by far the largest defence procurement budget in the world.At the very least, EADS faces a delay of many months before it can press ahead with its plan to build an assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama, not only for the tanker but also for its A330 freighters. At worst it could lose a new bidding contest to Boeing and would have to resign itself to a long uphill battle to win a larger slice of Pentagon work.The threat to the deal could severely hurt EADS’s efforts both to build a much bigger presence in the defence sector – to balance its overwhelming dependence on commercial aircraft – and just as importantly it would undermine its attempts to shift more of its production into the dollar zone and out of expen-
sive euro-based economiesThe US tanker deal ticked all of the right boxes and seemed finally a strong sign EADS was climbing out of several years of deep crisis.It has suffered from damaging battles between its Franco-German shareholders, infighting among top management and costly and embarrassing delays in key aircraft development programmes led by the A380 superjumbo, the A400M military transport aircraft, and the A350 new family of long range, medium capacity jets. Its profitability has also been severely undermined by the strength of the euro.The threat to the tanker deal comes as the group is still beset by these challenges and fresh ones are emerging fast.The airline industry is fast entering a crisis and cyclical downturn triggered by the sudden surge in fuel costs. The fear is growing that Airbus commercial jet production targets for the next couple of years are much too ambitious, and the huge order backlog could start to melt away as airlines defer orders and some go out of business altogether.Airbus is also still in the midst of the difficult recovery programmes aimed at bringing production of the A380 superjumbo and A400M military transport aircraft back on track.Key elements of the Power8 restructuring programme at Airbus, aimed at cutting costs by €2.1bn ($3.2bn) by 2010 including the elimination of 10,000 jobs, are in trouble. Most importantly, Airbus has failed to sell off several of its plants in Germany and France to outside suppliers.There is more pain to come. The cost-saving measures were based on addressing an exchange rate of €1/$1.35, but at rates of $1.50 to the euro and worse, much more must be achieved from 2011, when the cushion of protective currency hedges will largely have disappeared.While a huge industrial restructuring challenge re­mains, Airbus continues to struggle to contain growing tensions between its French and German workers, which have reached such a state that Louis Gallois, EADS chief executive, has been forced to intervene at the aircraft subsidiary. Last month he flew to Toulouse to reassure unions that German factories were not being favoured over French sites.Tensions on the factory floor have been exacerbated by the French regulatory and judicial investigations into alleged insider dealing by EADS and Airbus executives ahead of the profit warning in June 2006.All deny any wrongdoing, but the ongoing inquiries have left a cloud of suspicion, that have made the crucial second phase of Power8 cost-cutting increasingly difficult. Under French law the process could continue for several years."
225;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;EADS in call for calm on tankers;;EADS has asked European governments not to comment on a US congressional auditor’s recommendation that the US Air Force reopen a competition for refuelling tankers that the company originally won.The US Government Accountability Office on Wednesday found flaws in the air force process used to select EADS and Northrop Grumman, its US partner, over Chicago-based Boeing. The issue has been highly charged on Capitol Hill since the air force earlier this year stunned experts by choosing EADS for the $35bn deal.“They all seem to accept that saying anything now would be like pouring oil into the fire,” said one EADS official.The French, German, UK and Spanish capitals remained silent on Thursday, but the decision in favour of Boeing drew sharp comments from a provincial French deputy official.Bernard Carayon, deputy for the Tam region, described the outcome as a “a severe blow to transatlantic friendship”, in comments that drew irritation among the EADS ranks.Another EADS official said the process had been “tense and critical” in the US, and that any political interference could further jeopardise EADS and Northrop’s chances.A senior executive said EADS was confident that the air force would select the US-European consortium if the competition is reopened. “The GAO did not question any of the performance-related criteria,” said the executive. “Our aircraft is still the best.”The air force is reviewing the decision, which is not legally binding. However, ahead of the GAO decision, the air force vowed to follow the recommendation. Senior US politicians, including Barack Obama and John McCain, the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, have called for the competition to be rerun.Hans Peter Ring, chief information officer for EADS, on Thursday briefed German officials on the situation. The company has not suggested that GAO was politically motivated.EADS believes the air force will choose a compromise between a second full competition, which could take two years, and ignoring the GAO. But experts in the US believe a new competition is the most likely outcome.Several EADS executives suggested that the presidential election could make the process more difficult, although some expressed hope that the issue could be resolved within two months. The air force has 60 days to respond to the GAO recommendation.The GAO move is likely further to delay the replacement of the air force’s fleet of Eisenhower-era inflight refuelling tankers. The air force has struggled through most of the Bush administration to start replacing its fleet of KC-135 tankers, which were refuelling aircraft during the Vietnam war in the 1960s and most recently have been in operation over Iraq.Sue Payton, the top air force acquisitions official, on Wednesday said the air force would review the decision by the GAO, and “do everything we can to rapidly move forward so America receives this urgently needed capability”. Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Lexington Institute, said the GAO indictment of the air force acquisition process would “make it hard” for Ms Payton to remain in the job. He said the GAO report essentially accused the air force of being biased in selecting EADS and Northrop.The GAO is preparing to release the full text of its report.
226;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-06-19T19:20:03Z;Boeing workers cheer watchdog;;As news of the General Accountability Office’s announcement filtered through to the 767 production line at Boeing’s factory at Everett, near Seattle, on Wednesday afternoon, workers broke into cheers.The 600 production and support staff may have been celebrating only the possibility of a stay of execution, but for Boeing the likelihood that the US Air Force will have to redo the bidding process for the aerial refuelling tanker feels like vindication.“The GAO recognised the process was not properly followed and that is a victory for Boeing workers, American taxpayers and the men and women in our armed forces,” said Cynthia Cole, president of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. “We hope the air force now recognises which aircraft really won the bid process.”In its report, the GAO watchdog faulted the way the air force awarded the Northrop Grumman/EADS proposal extra credit for offering a larger aircraft that could carry more fuel, cargo and troops than the 767.Boeing only has orders for eight 767 refuelling tankers from Italy and Japan and the company has invested more than $1bn in the programme in the hope of winning the US Air Force contract.Boeing has only another 48 of the commercial versions of the aircraft still to build, although that number might increase as Boeing struggles with delays on its planned replacement – the 787.Without the air force contract, the 767 is likely to be closed down by about 2012.Boeing said on Thursday it was too early to speculate on whether the company would re-submit the same proposal or whether it would change its bid to the larger 777 – more comparable in size to its rival’s offer. When the contract was awarded to its rival, Boeing told the FT it would have offered the 777 had they thought it better matched the requirements.
227;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-06-19T18:39:31Z;Dodgy defence;;When President Eisenhower warned America about the rising power of the military industrial complex in 1961, defence spending was greater than the combined net income of all American companies. Corporate earnings are now seven times the defence budget, but the procurement process remains politically charged.The Government Accountability Office recommended on Wednesday that the US Air Force reopen the bid process for a $38bn contract for tanker jets that provide mid-air refuelling. This follows a good deal of public teeth-gnashing, and furious protests from Boeing over victory by a consortium that, while led by Northrop Grumman, uses a foreign EADS-made aircraft.Yet tempting as it is to see the dark force of protectionism, the charge does not stick. As the investigative arm of Congress, the GAO is non-partisan and has objected to flaws in the process, not the decision itself. More than 60 per cent of the value of the EADS aircraft would be American in origin and both BAE Systems and Finmeccanica have won US defence business against domestic bids.Instead, the increased willingness of defence contractors to appeal against procurement decisions points to the concentration of spending in large but scarce government programmes. In spite of a considerable rise in defence spending, little of it has gone on new kit, so missing an opportunity is painful. EADS’s tanker jet is proving popular around the world, meaning that if Boeing gets no US order, it will probably have to make do with scraps from Japan and Italy. Meanwhile for EADS, whose shares approached a five-year low on Thursday, losing the tanker contract would be a strategic blow. The earnings impact is minimal, but the project is an essential part of raising the dollar component of its cost base. Without hedging, at current exchange rates the company would lose about €2bn this year. Time for EADS executives to pin the US flag to their lapels.Post and read comments on this LexLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

228;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;US tanker review gives boost for Boeing;;EADS suffered a heavy blow on Wednesday when US congressional investigators urged the US Air Force to reopen a $35bn refuelling tanker deal the European defence company had won over Boeing.The Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, agreed with Boeing that there were flaws in the air force process used to choose EADS and Northrop Grumman, its US partner, over their Chicago-based rival.The GAO stressed that its decision was based on errors in the selection process and was not an assessment of the merits of the two aircraft competing to replace the air force’s tankers.Michael Golden, a senior GAO official, said the air force made “significant errors” that could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition.These included flawed cost assessments. While the GAO ruling is not legally binding, the air force has previously vowed to follow any recommendation. On Wednesday, the air force said it was reviewing the decision.Sue Payton, the top air force acquisitions official, said the air force would “do everything we can to rapidly move forward so America receives this urgently needed capability”.Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace expert at the Teal Group, said there was no chance the air force would reject the recommendation given the tough language in the GAO report, which he said provided a “flamethrower” to Boeing’s political allies who had lambasted the air force decision to award the deal to EADS.Mr Aboulafia said that while the GAO decision was not the “end of the road” for EADS and Northrop Grumman, “it is a serious wrench in the machinery”.Experts added that the outcome was now likely to be decided by the next administration. John McCain and Barack Obama, the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees both urged the air force to reopen the competition.The GAO stressed that it had not evaluated the tankers’ merits but only the selection process. But the ruling will likely lead to European cries of protectionism .A French government official said: “We need a clear view on the reasons why the GAO took this decision”.Paris would be concerned if the decision meant the US defence market was closed to Europeans as prime contractors.Louis Gallois, EADS chief executive said: “Though we are disappointed, it is important to recognise that the GAO’s announcement is an evaluation of the selection process and not the merits of the aircraft.”Boeing welcomed the decision as a vindication of its protest, while Northrop said it was reviewing the decision.The GAO ruling is also a huge setback for the air force, which has been trying to recover from a previous tanker-related scandal that sent a senior air force official and Boeing executive to prison.
229;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-06-18T22:57:50Z;GAO ruling refuels debate in tanker saga;;When the US Air Force this year gave EADS, the European defence company, a $35bn contract to supply the military with refuelling tankers, the unexpected decision prompted one defence industry analyst to write a note to his clients that began “Dear Fellow Shock Victims”.Richard Aboulafia, the analyst at the Teal Group, pointed out that most analysts believed the air force would choose Chicago-based Boeing for the contract, which could ultimately be worth more than $100bn. It was, he said, “the first time anywhere in the world that an imported defence system won against domestic direct competitor”.The decision was equally shocking because the air force several years previously had chosen Boeing to replace the ageing fleet of Eisenhower-era in-flight refuelling tankers. That contract was cancelled following a scandal related to the tanker deal that sent a senior Boeing executive and air force official to prison.The tanker saga saw another twist yesterday when the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, sided with Boeing in recommending that the air force reopen the competition.Boeing had asked the GAO to investigate the tanker deal after it was awarded to EADS and Northrop Grumman, its US partner. This time, too, most analysts assumed that the GAO would side with EADS, the parent company of Airbus, partly because the air force was so emphatic that EADS and Northrop had offered the best tanker when it announced the decision.Joining Sue Payton, the top air force acquisitions official, in announcing the decision in February, General Arthur Lichte, the head of the military command that oversees tankers, said he could sum up the reason for EADS’ and Northrop’s victory in one word, “more”.“More passengers, more cargo, more fuel to offload, more patients that we can carry, more availability, more flexibility and more dependability,” he said.When politicians called Ms Payton to Capitol Hill to explain the decision, which had enraged both supporters of Boeing and lawmakers who believed a US company should have been chosen, she suggested that the offer from the US-European team was miles ahead of Boeing.Yesterday, however, the GAO said the differences between the two bids were so close that “significant errors” made by the air force could have impacted the final outcome.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Lexington Institute, said it was important to realise that the GAO was challenging the process, not the result of the competition, a point also made by Louis Gallois, the chief executive of EADS.Mr Thompson and other analysts suggested that the result of the GAO assessment was that the decision over which tanker to finally choose would be up to the next administration.“This being an election year, we doubt whether any decision will be made rapidly,” said Rob Stallard, an analyst at Macquarie Securities. “Political support for both sides is vocal and entrenched, and in our opinion we would not be surprised if the DoD [Department of Defence] ultimately buys both Airbus and Boeing tankers.”
230;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-05-04T21:14:22Z;EADS and Northrop come out fighting;;EADS and Northrop Grumman, the duo that controversially pipped Boeing to a $35bn US Air Force refuelling tanker contract in February, have criticised the political backlash against the deal as antiquated and “extraordinarily unhealthy”.Stepping up the rhetoric, Ralph Crosby, the US head of European defence group EADS, spoke out against politicians who had sought to interfere in the Pentagon’s value-driven procurement strategy.He said: “The acquisition process [should] not become so politicised.“Every time there is a difference between one constituency and the other on what ought to be bought, it becomes a congressional issue. This is how we did stuff in the Civil War.”Since the contract was awarded to EADS, politicians have campaigned against the decision, claiming it will cost US jobs and jeopardise national security. Boeing itself is fighting a fierce rearguard action in an attempt to overturn the decision.Ron Sugar, chief executive of Northrop, EADS’s US partner on the contract, refused to comment on Boeing’s behaviour, but was outspoken on the bidding principle: “It is one thing to protest [against] a competition where you feel that the selection process was not right. That is your legal right. It is quite another thing that after you’ve lost, to decide you have to change the game politically.”In March, Boeing launched a formal protest with the Government Accountability Office, an arm of Congress, against the award of the contract to EADS and Northrop. Last month, the GAO dismissed requests by Northrop and the US air force to throw out Boeing’s complaint.EADS and Northrop are set to supply 179 air-to-air refuelling tankers using a modified version of the Airbus A330 passenger jet.
231;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-04-24T20:48:38Z;Wall Street rally led by financials;;Wall Street stocks rallied for a second day on Thursday as financials led markets higher and investors picked out the positive in a mixed batch of earnings reports.The day began in gloomy fashion as cautious outlook statements from several corporations, including Apple and Amazon, stirred fears of a consumer-spending slowdown.Materials and energy stocks, which have supported equity markets for much of the past few weeks, had their worst day in over a month, following commodity prices lower in spite of strong results from industry leaders.But an unexpected rally in financials helped wipe out those declines thanks to upgrades and strong results at a handful of insurance companies.Homebuilders contributed to the turn in sentiment after the National Association of Home Builders said the US housing market would begin to recover in the third quarter, brushing aside new data showing sales of new homes slumped in March.The benchmark S&P 500 erased losses of as much as 0.6 per cent to close up 0.6 per cent at 1,388.82 while the Nasdaq Composite ended 1 per cent higher at 2,428.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,848.95.Financials advanced 3.8 per cent on Thursday, their biggest gain since the start of the month, as investors looking for a bottom to the market rotated out of energy stocks and into the downtrodden sector. T Rowe Price, the fund manager, led the gainers adding 11.8 per cent to $60.24 after posting its 20th straight quarterly increase in earnings.Insurers Travelers and Aflac added to that revival, climbing 4 per cent to $50.23 and 4.1 per cent to $67.76, respectively, after both beat first-quarter estimates and raised their full-year forecasts.Investment banks also made ground after the chief executive of Merrill Lynch said the firm would maintain its dividend. Merrill Lynch added 7.1 per cent to $48.09 while Lehman Brothers rose 6.2 per cent to $46.38.James McGlynn, portfolio manager of the Summit Everest Fund, said: “There was so much uncertainty going into the earnings season, people thought financials were going to drop another shoe, so the stocks have perhaps been overly discounted.”Mike Mayo, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said: “The crises now seems closer to the end, albeit with lingering uncertainty related to monoline insurers, CDO dispositions and short-term money markets.”As oil slipped off its highs and the dollar rallied, giving consumers more wiggle room, JC Penney climbed 3.5 per cent to $41.97 while Macy’s added 5 per cent to $24.36.Ford led the consumer sector higher after the car group unexpectedly swung into profit in the first quarter as reduced costs offset weak US sales. Ford jumped 11.7 per cent to $8.40 while rival General Motors added 5.6 per cent to $22.11.Companies reliant on discretionary spending had initially found it hard going after several bellwethers cut forecasts and were sold by anxious investors.Starbucks tumbled 10.4 per cent to $15.99, Whirlpool, the appliance maker, slid 10.1 per cent to $73.89 and 3M lost 1.7 per cent to $79.25.Homebuilders helped the advance. Lennar added 7.9 per cent to $18.38 while Pulte Homes rose 5.4 per cent to $13.81.In technology, too, early despair gave way to enthusiasm. Better-than-expected results and forecasts from LSI pushed the sector into the black. The maker of storage chips advanced 20.8 per cent to $5.99.By the close, Apple, which added 15 per cent in the month running up to the results, was 3.7 per cent higher at $168.94. Amazon fell 4.1 per cent at $77.69.Energy and materials stocks were a drag on indices. Gold producer Newmont Mining said first-quarter profit rose fivefold thanks to record prices for bullion but its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $42.94, mimicking the pattern of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold on Wednesday. Freeport shares fell 3 per cent to $112.61 while energy groups Chevron and ConocoPhillips dropped 2.2 per cent to $92.40 and 1.8 per cent to $82.96.Industrials rose after Northrop Grumman, the shipbuilder, and Goodrich, the aerospace components maker, posted better-than-expected results. Goodrich shares jumped 9.7 per cent to $67.66 while Northrop climbed 4.4 per cent $72.55.
232;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-04-22T16:09:47Z;EADS pays $350m to purchase PlantCML;;EADS has announced that it is buying a California-based provider of emergency response services.Europe’s largest aerospace and defence group is paying $350m for PlantCML, a privately owned company which provides call management and radio dispatch products for emergency call centres in eight of America’s 10 biggest states.It is EADS’s third purchase in the US but by far its most significant. The company wants to expand its defence and homeland security activities to reduce its dependence on Airbus, its commercial aircraft business.Marwan Lahoud, strategic director, told the Financial Times in an interview this year that EADS was targeting sales of $5bn in North America by 2012, a five-fold increase in four years. The purchase comes just weeks after EADS won a contract – with its partner, Northrop Grumman – to provide refuelling tankers to the US Air Force.Louis Gallois, EADS chief executive, said: “With this acquisition, EADS solidifies its position in security systems and solutions, while fulfilling our commitment to invest in our capabilities, and grow in the US.”EADS is buying PlantCML from Golden Gate Capital, a San Francisco-based private equity fund. The company has an annual turnover of about $200m and employs just over 600 people. The deal complements EADS’s existing security portfolio, which already includes mobile radio systems and network security training.
233;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-04-02T23:11:19Z;Congress rejects Northrop tanker plea;;A Congressional oversight agency on Wednesday rejected requests by Northrop Grumman and the US Air Force to dismiss a Boeing protest over a deal to supply the military with refuelling tankers.Boeing last month protested to the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, over the air force decision to give EADS, the European defence company, and Northrop, its US partner, a $35bn contract to provide 179 tankers that are used to refuel military aircraft during flight.The air force and Northrop asked the GAO to dismiss partially the Boeing protest. But Northrop on Wednesday said the GAO had rejected both requests. In a statement, Northrop said the GAO took the decision because Boeing had narrowed the scope of its original protest in a supplemental filing with the government agency.“Boeing’s decision to abandon the public relations rhetoric contained in its original protest filings is in keeping with our motion,” said Randy Belote, a Northrop spokesman.“We are encouraged that the company has streamlined its approach. We remain convinced that the air force process that led to Northrop Grumman’s selection was fair, open and transparent, and we look forward to assisting the air force defend its selection decision before the GAO.”But Bill Barksdale, a Boeing spokesman, said that Northrop’s claim that Boeing had limited its protest was “categorically false”. He confirmed that Boeing had filed two supplemental protests following the initial complaint.He said the additional protests bolstered Boeing’s case and accused Northrop of employing “spin at the highest level” in welcoming an adverse decision before it was even announced by the GAO.Boeing alleges that the tanker competition was unfair. The Chicago-based company says air force officials misled them about the size of aircraft they were seeking. Boeing offered a modified version of its 767 aircraft, but the air force chose a version of the larger Airbus 330.The GAO has 100 days from the initial protest to offer a recommendation. While the decision is not legally binding, the air force has vowed to accept the recommendation. Most analysts believe Boeing has little chance of success with the GAO, but that the company will push advocates on Capitol Hill for support.In 2002, the air force chose Boeing to sell and lease tankers to the military. Congress later cancelled the deal.
234;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
235;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-04-01T17:28:15Z;EADS sets to work on case for defence;;Louis Gallois, chief executive of EADS, knows that the stakes are high for the Franco-German aerospace group after the French stock market regulator on Tuesday formally accused it and several senior executives of having violated market rules.So he wasted no time in writing to the company’s 116,000 staff around the world to urge them to “be patient and support each other” in the face of what could prove to be a long and difficult period as the second phase of the investigation into alleged insider dealing and misleading market information begins.“We will now be able to defend ourselves,” Mr Gallois wrote, after it emerged that the Autorité des Marchés Financiers had launched sanctions proceedings against the company and 17 of its most senior executives.EADS has been accused of issuing misleading information in the run-up to its profit warning of June 2006, while the executives and core shareholders stand charged with insider trading after selling shares in November 2005 and March 2006. All deny wrong-doing.“I have confidence in the entire management team,” Mr Gallois told his staff in the memo, which was read out to the Financial Times.He said there was “no evidence to my knowledge that casts doubt on their probity”.Mr Gallois may have no choice but to have confidence for the AMF’s formal allegations – coming after 21 months of investigation – could not have come at a worse time for management. The wounds inflicted by years of Franco-German management in-fighting are barely beginning to heal after last summer’s truce while Mr Gallois must also avert a crisis of morale at a delicate time in the industrial cycle as the weak dollar erodes profit.Airbus, where severe delays to its flagship A380 superjumbo forced the 2006 profit warning, is ramping up production to meet the record orders it has won in the last two years.It is doing that while attempting to implement a drastic cost-cutting plan, abide by a demanding delivery schedule for the A380 and avoid more delays on the A400M military transport plane.The restructuring programme, meanwhile, hit a severe hiccup last week when EADS had to shelve temporarily the sale of the German sites. Unions in France opposed to the sale of French sites are now demanding similar treatment and these obstacles have raised questions about the room for manoeuvre to finance the planned A350 mid-sized airliner.The market so far has not drawn any strong conclusions from Tuesday’s regulatory setback. EADS shares even rose on the news.However, that could change if the management becomes embroiled in a time consuming defence before the AMF’s sanctions committee, which will make the final decision.“This company needs a very, very focused management team,” said one analyst on Tuesday. “If they are going to spend three months on defending themselves, that is bad news. They haven’t got three months.”A note published on Tuesday by Credit Suisse reinforced the scale of the challenge. It estimates that, if profits on hedging were excluded, EADS will make an underlying loss of €2.2bn ($3.4bn) in 2008.It is the distraction of the inquiry and a possible return to Franco-German wrangling should executives be forced to leave – rather than the financial impact – that appears to most worry Mr Gallois.That may be why EADS’ strategy is first to disprove the allegation that it misled the market about A380 delays. “There is nothing specific against the individuals in the report …not a single piece of evidence,” said one person close to the subject. “The allegations are based on their roles in operational committees and delays are part of daily life in aerospace. When we prove that the financial information we gave was correct, then the rest will fall.”
236;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-30T17:12:49Z;EADS demands evidence of wrongdoing;;Louis Gallois, chief executive of EADS, has warned France’s stock market authority that its investigation into alleged insider dealing at the Franco-German aerospace group could threaten the company’s fragile recovery unless it turns up “clear evidence” of wrongdoing.“You can’t condemn people who have huge responsibilities, you can’t attack a company …without clear evidence,” he told the Financial Times in a recent interview. “This company is clearly on [the path to] recovery. I don’t want that jeopardised on rumours, on feeling. I want evidence, clear evidence. It’s too important.”Mr Gallois, who says he is “fully confident” in his management team, has spared no effort in recent weeks to make his concerns known, as the AMF, the French regulator, finalised its report on controversial share sales by directors and shareholders in the weeks ahead of a shock profits warning.The report will also take a view on whether the EADS board misled the market about delays to the flagship A380 superjumbo project at its Airbus subsidiary that led to the profit warning.The governing board of the AMF is expected to meet Monday to weigh the findings, handed to the 15-member “college” several days ago. A preliminary report on the allegations was leaked to French media last autumn and signalled concerns over insider dealing “on a massive scale”, which the company and all those involved deny strongly.Among those who sold shares between November 2005 and April 2006 are some of the group’s most senior executives, such as Airbus chief executive Tom Enders and his deputy Fabrice Brégier. Core shareholders Lagardère and Daimler are also under investigation, although the German stock market authority’s own inquiry turned up no evidence of wrongdoing.Nevertheless, the stakes are high for EADS. Certain reports suggested this weekend that if the company is accused of misleading investors, its recent landmark victory in the US – where it was awarded the largest defence contract of recent times – could be jeopardised. EADS and its US partner Northrop Grumman were chosen over US rival Boeing in February to supply air refuelling tankers to the US air force in a deal worth $35bn. Boeing is challenging the award, and the contract has been suspended pending an inquiry by the US General Accounting Office, which is expected to last until July.Reflecting deep-seated unease over the possible effect of the inquiry, Mr Gallois gave an interview to French daily Le Figaro last week to voice his concerns. He said the AMF college was dealing with “complex questions that have heavy consequences for EADS”.
237;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-18T22:45:25Z;Boeing dismisses idea to split USAF contract;;Boeing would not be interested in splitting a deal with EADS to supply refuelling tankers to the US Air Force, the company said on Tuesday.This month, the air force awarded EADS, the European aerospace group, and Northrop Grumman, its US partner, a $35bn deal to provide 179 air-to-air refuelling tankers. Boeing has protested at the decision to the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress.Most analysts believe Boeing’s protest to the GAO stands little chance of success. Instead, they say it would be more likely that Congress could require the air force to buy from both companies.However, Mark McGraw, the Boeing executive responsible for the tanker programme, said he doubted the GAO would recommend the air force split the deal between the rivals. He added that Boeing would not be interested in such an outcome.Speaking to reporters, Mr McGraw said a split-buy “does not make a lot of sense for industry for the air force”.Mr McGraw conceded the GAO protest was “an uphill battle”. But he said Boeing hoped to get “another shot” through a recommendation that the air force re-do the competition. GAO recommendations are not legally binding but the air force this weekend said it would follow the recommendation.Boeing supporters have claimed the air force compromised US national security by choosing EADS. Mr McGraw expressed concerns about the implications of relying on foreign countries to supply spare parts.Boeing claims the air force unfairly changed its requirements during the selection process in a way that favoured EADS’s larger KC-330 tanker.
238;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-18T19:37:30Z;The new governor comes clean;;David Paterson, who replaced Eliot Spitzer this week as New York’s governor, apparently believes in getting the bad news out there early.Just hours after he was sworn in to replace Spitzer – who last week was forced to resign after revelations that he had paid thousands of dollars to prostitutes – he admitted that he had had an affair.Paterson and his wife, Michelle, told the New York Daily News they had both had extramarital affairs during a rough patch in their marriage. But they said they went to counselling and salvaged the marriage.The couple gave the interview after rumours about the new governor’s personal life spread around Albany, the state’s capital, last week. The press may continue to chase the story, but it seems unlikely that Paterson, a Democrat, will suffer much political fallout from the revelation. Simply by not being Eliot Spitzer, who battled members of both parties during his brief term, Paterson has a decent store of goodwill in state politics. His inauguration was greeted with cheers from Republicans and Democrats alike, many of whom were overjoyed at the news of Spitzer’s resignation.Unlike Spitzer, Paterson has deep roots in state government, having served as a senator for 20 years. And, also unlike Spitzer, Paterson has never compared himself to a “steamroller” who would roll over anyone who got in his way.Second chancesBut Spitzer should take heart. Just north of New York, a once-reviled politician has shown that it is possible to rise from the grave.Few residents of Ontario could find anything good to say about Bob Rae when he was hounded from the premier’s office in 1995. Rae, who led the province’s left-leaning New Democratic party at the time, antagonised conservatives by running up a hefty budget deficit. He then managed to alienate erstwhile trade union allies by imposing a public-sector wage freeze.But Rae spent the next decade shedding his socialist image and building a reputation as a trusted – and likeable – conciliator. Among other missions, he helped oversee peace talks between the government of Sri Lanka and Tamil Tiger rebels.Rae, now 59, completed his resurrection this week with a landslide win in a Toronto by-election for a federal parliamentary seat – this time as a Liberal.He and his old friend Michael Ignatieff, an MP in Ottawa, will be front-runners for the Liberal leadership if – many would say when – the party turns on its current leader, the hapless Stéphane Dion.Try something elseA good old-fashioned cabinet row at Downing Street on Tuesday as Gordon Brown’s ministers debated their response to a critical report saying the government was not living up to its own green rhetoric.Observer’s mole under the table says debate became heated when Ruth Kelly, the transport minister, proposed that ministers should start driving Toyota Prius hybrid cars to set a good example to the rest of the country.“Gesture politics of the worst kind,” grumbled one minister. Among those resisting were John Hutton, the business secretary, whose job includes banging the drum for British-made cars including Land Rover and Jaguar. Brown, who was in Brussels last week lecturing other European leaders on the environment, told Kelly to go back to the drawing board.Shake-up screw-upAs part of his political relaunch following Sunday’s local election fiasco, French President Nicolas Sarkozy shook up his own team of aides, rooting out some of the most controversial characters.Georges-Marc Benamou, a left-leaning journalist and writer who served as cultural adviser, was eased out in return for a plum job as head of France’s cultural institute in Rome.The only problem is that Benamou had already promised it to someone else. And that someone else, Olivier Poivre d’Arvor, lodged a complaint on Tuesday.Poivre d’Arvor, the Italian-speaking head of France’s institute for international cultural exchange, is eminently qualified for the job. He had even drawn up a plan to relaunch the Rome institute. Benamou meanwhile said he was looking forward to his new post because he could spend more time on his writing.So much for Sarkozy’s public-sector efficiency drive.Gloves offAlabamans may take pride in their southern hospitality, but they are playing tough against Boeing and its backers. Mobile, a port city in lower Alabama, has been celebrating since the US air force last month unexpectedly chose EADS and Northrop Grumman to supply refuelling tankers, which will be assembled there. Stephen Nodine, president of the Mobile county commission, is worried that Boeing, the loser in the $35bn deal, might engineer a reversal on Capitol Hill.Nodine rubbed Boeing’s nose in it in the Wichita Eagle – a paper in Kansas where Boeing has a strong presence – saying that “sometimes the smell of sour grapes can waft down all the way from the Pacific Northwest to the Deep South”.CDOs explainedWolfgang Reitzle, Linde’s chief executive, on the credit crisis: “I thought ABS always stood for anti-lock braking system but I discovered the other day it meant asset-backed securities – only I can’t see where the assets are. Similarly CDOs seem to stand for collateral damage obligations.”Send your comments to Observer
239;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-17T18:59:19Z;The battle for global business is not yet won;;EADS, the European defence company, has beaten Boeing to win a huge US Air Force order. And, as of May, Unilever will not have a British or Dutch member of its top executive team for the first time since the company was formed by an Anglo-Dutch merger in 1930.It would be comforting to view this as a sign that commerce has dissolved national differences. Unfortunately, it has not.Take the EADS win of a $35bn contract to provide the US Air Force with refuelling tankers. It was achieved in highly unusual circumstances. The air force originally selected Boeing to provide the tankers, a deal that was cancelled after it emerged that a top defence procurement official had been holding secret job talks with Boeing. Both she and Boeing’s then-chief financial officer went to prison. Philip Condit, Boeing’s chief executive, was also forced to resign.In the reopened contest, EADS had to cast itself as an all-American provider of jobs in order to succeed. It chose a US partner, Northrop Grumman, to front its bid. Northrop said the contract would support 48,000 American jobs, almost double its initial estimate of 25,000, which it claimed was more than Boeing’s projected 44,000. The aircraft will be assembled in Alabama.As for Unilever, Geoffrey Jones, Harvard Business School professor and author of the book Renewing Unilever, argues that the complexion of its executive management– the team will consist of a Frenchman, three Americans, two Indians and a Zimbabwean – is exceptional.Few companies have gone as far as Unilever in shedding their national identities, or, in this case, dual identities. Most people would struggle to guess the nationality of Unilever’s brands – where do Flora, Dove or Domestos come from? – but not many companies are like that.John Kay argued on this page in 2004 that “almost all companies have an identifiable nationality” and that remains the case. Some have made efforts to shed their origins, but few have followed through, either because no one found it convincing or because it proved commercially damaging.One company that tried, strangely enough, was Boeing. In an interview with the Financial Times in 1997, Mr Condit said he wanted to see Boeing lose its American image over the next 20 years. “I believe we are moving towards an era of global markets and global companies,” he said. We are over half way through those 20 years and Mr Condit has gone. Who today thinks of Boeing as anything other than American?British Airways tried to become a denationalised company too. Under Robert Ayling, its then chief executive, BA commissioned art from around the world to replace the Union Jack on its tailfins. British business travellers, key to the airline’s profitability, were furious and Lady Thatcher covered up one of the international designs on a model aircraft at a Conservative Party conference. BA went back to the Union Jack.Another blow to cross-border business was the unravelling in 2007 of the DaimlerChrysler merger after nine fraught years. EADS itself has been a fractious Franco-German entity.There are signs of cross-border success. Renault’s link with Nissan is one of the most intriguing. Royal Dutch Shell, an Anglo-Dutch combination that became a single company in 2005, has been around longer than Unilever. ArcelorMittal is a genuinely international company.While few companies’ leadership teams are as international as Unilever’s, many have chief executives who grew up elsewhere. Both Vodafone and PepsiCo have Indian-born bosses.Manufacturing is international. Brands may have national associations, but the products have probably been made in Asia. But there are signs everywhere of a protectionist backlash. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have attacked the decision to give the air force contract to EADS. Supporters may hint we should not take their protectionist rhetoric seriously, but they use it because it resonates with voters.As my colleague, Michiyo Nakamoto, reported this month, Japanese sentiment has swung against foreign investors. Takao Kitabata, the top bureaucrat at the ministry of economy, trade and industry, said Japanese companies should be able to choose their shareholders, a breed he called “fickle, irresponsible and greedy”. José Manuel Barroso, European Commission president, has warned of the dangers of European protectionism.These are perilous times. If we are heading into an international downturn, protectionist pressures will only grow. The idea of business as an instrument of international co-operation has shallow roots. Boeing has launched a formal complaint against EADS’ victory. You do not have to be an EADS enthusiast, or even a European, to hope the complaint fails.Send your comments to michael.skapinker@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/skapinker
240;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-17T16:00:15Z;Dogfight intensifies over US tanker contract;;EADS, the European defence company, and Northrop Grumman have shifted their lobbying and public relations machine up a gear after Boeing’s decision to protest against the US Air Force decision to award the US-European consortium a $35bn deal to supply refuelling tankers.Northrop last week hired a lobbying firm run by Trent Lott, the former Mississippi Republican senator, and John Breaux, a former Democratic senator from Louisiana. Northrop and EADS are relying on a group of Washington firms – including Hill & Knowlton, Quinn & Gillespie, and Public Strategies – to counter Boeing’s powerful lobby on Capitol Hill.Boeing supporters have challenged the unexpected decision on several fronts, including that it would cost American jobs and damage the US defence industrial base. They have also lambasted the air force for choosing EADS while Airbus and Boeing are involved in a World Trade Organisation dispute.Boeing last week lodged a protest with the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress. Boeing allies allege that the air force changed the requirements of the competition at a late stage in a manner that favoured EADS. The company has also suggested that the air force misled Boeing by encouraging it to offer the 767, a smaller aircraft than the Airbus A330 which won.The GAO has 100 days to respond to the protest. While the air force is not legally required to follow the agency’s recommendation, it almost always does. One congressional aide familiar with the process said government departments were inclined to treat GAO recommendations as mandatory because they are given great deference in the courts.Major David Small, an air force spokesman, on Sunday said the air force “will follow the recommendations of the GAO.” If the GAO ruled in Boeing’s favour, it would also provide ammunition to politicians on Capitol Hill who want to reverse the deal.Last week, Sue Payton, head of air force acquisitions, says the air force was legally required to ignore the impact on US jobs and the industrial base. With Robert Gates, US defence secretary, and Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the joint chiefs, Ms Payton has strongly defended the competition as fair.While the GAO considers Boeing’s protest, lawmakers from states with a strong Boeing presence – particularly Washington and Kansas – are trying to engineer broader opposition to the deal on Capitol Hill. EADS and Northrop are hoping to counter that by urging politicians without a direct stake in the fight to stay on the sidelines.Another element of the Northrop-EADS strategy is to downplay the role of the European company in public statements. While EADS will supply the Airbus tanker, Northrop, which is the prime contractor, generally comments publicly instead of its European partner.EADS and Northrop must decide whether to start the tanker programme soon or wait until the GAO has issued its recommendation. A source familiar with the planning said the companies had already decided to proceed with a groundbreaking ceremony in Mobile, Alabama, where the tankers would be assembled. Randy Belote, a Northrop spokesman, said only that the companies “hadn’t announced plans”.The companies have had some success pushing back against Boeing. Last week, John Warner – the Republican on the Senate armed services committee who backed Senator John McCain’s investigation of the original Boeing deal – reminded lawmakers the defence industry was increasingly globalised.”Until the GAO acts and reports to Congress their findings, we should lower the emotional rhetoric, be accurate with the facts, and withhold judgment of the work done by a large dedicated group of uniformed and civilian acquisition specialists,” said Mr Warner.Mr Warner also defended John McCain, the Arizona senator and presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who aggressively investigated a previous Boeing contract to provide the air force with tankers. Congress cancelled that deal in 2003 after investigations revealed that a senior air force officer had held illegal job negotiations with Boeing.Some Boeing supporters have blamed Mr McCain’s investigation for ending the original deal. Others have accused Mr McCain of pressuring the air force to change the requirements of the competition to suit EADS. Mr McCain responds that he only forced the air force to remove language that would have tilted the competition unfairly towards Boeing.Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group, said that while Boeing faced a “long fight” to try to regain part of the tanker contract, the outcome might depend on whether the Democrats won the presidency and retained control of Congress in November, which he said would produce a 60 per cent chance of a split-buy.Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, said he doubted whether there would be enough evidence “within the narrow confines of a GAO inquiry”, but added that “a combination of GAO findings and legislative action could stall or reverse the decision”.Paul Nisbet, an aerospace expert at JSA Research, said the GAO decision was also likely to be “engulfed in politics”. He added that there was also the possibility that the recent improvement in US relations with Germany and France could work against Boeing.“It would be a blow to these improved relations with these Airbus countries if the US air force decision were to be reversed. The GAO, looking out for its own well being, will likely be ‘politically correct’ regarding its ruling.”Mr Nisbet says he believes Boeing’s chances are a “long shot”, and said he doubts that “there is sufficient resolve in the Congress to pass legislation that would unfund the tanker or reverse the US Air Force’s decision.”
241;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-11T23:26:28Z;Boeing makes good its pledge to fight;;Boeing followed through with a promise to protest against the US air force’s decision to award a refuelling tanker project to EADS, its main European rival, accusing the military of running a “fundamentally flawed” evaluation.The air force’s decision to assign the $35bn contract to EADS and Northrop Grumman has drawn scrutiny from politicians, including Democratic presidential hopefuls Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and renewed concerns for US job losses.Citing a litany of mistakes that the air force made in weighing the Boeing tanker’s strengths against those of its rivals, from cost and size to past performance, the Chicago-based aircraft manufacturer said the competition “resulted in the selection on the wrong airplane”.Mark McGraw, vice-president of Boeing’s tanker programmes, saidduring a conference call with reporters: “We think we were not treated fairly.”Boeing filed its formal protest with the US Government Accountability Office, which will spend 100 days reviewing the process and its outcome.The air force and the GAO did not respond to requests for comment.The protest will further delay the replacement of the an ageing tanker fleet.While the air force initially chose Boeing for the project in 2002, Congress cancelled the deal after the government learned that a top procurement official had held illegal job talks with the company.The scandal sent Boeing’s chief financial officer to prison and forced its chief executive to resign.On the call, Boeing executives declined to speculate on whether politics had played a role in the air force’s decision.They said that they would at least like to come away from the GAO protest with a clearer understanding of how to pursue military tanker contracts in the future.The executives took issue with the air force’s decision to go with EADS’s larger, “less capable” A330 jet, even though its proposal request initially called for a medium-sized tanker.Boeing’s tanker, which is based on the 767 aircraft, matched the needs outlined in the request, the company said.Beverly Wyse, another Boeing vice-president, said on the conference call: “If they wanted a larger tanker, it would have been nice to be very clear that that was a requirement”.Air force officials have said the EADS-Northrop proposal was superior to Boeing’s on every level.Northrop said on Monday that its successful bid would support 48,000 US jobs, which was double its previous estimate.
242;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-11T19:30:34Z;McCain under fire over Pentagon contract;;John McCain faced fresh scrutiny of his role in the award of a $35bn (€23bn, £17bn) Pentagon contract to EADS on Tuesday after it emerged that some of his top advisers lobbied for the European aerospace group to win the deal.Mr McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has portrayed himself as a neutral watchdog in the long battle between EADS and Boeing to supply a new generation of refuelling tanker aircraft to the US air force.But the revelation that three of his aides lobbied for EADS threatened to deepen the perception that Mr McCain helped steer one of the biggest military procurement contracts in recent years into foreign hands.Tom Loeffler was serving as national finance co-chair of the McCain campaign when his lobbying firm, the Loeffler Group, was recruited by EADS last year. Susan Nelson, a former Loeffler lobbyist who represented EADS, later joined the McCain campaign as finance director. John Green, a lobbyist for Ogilvy Gov­ernment Relations, also worked for EADS before joining the McCain campaign on a volunteer basis recently.The McCain campaign said none of the three had lobbied the Arizona senator on the tanker deal.Mr McCain played a central role in opening the contract to competition after helping expose a corruption scandal surrounding an earlier deal for Boeing to supply the aircraft.He twice wrote letters to the Pentagon pressing for bidding rules that gave EADS a fair chance – although he insists he never lobbied for the group to win the contract. His campaign said both letters were sent long before any of his advisers were involved in lobbying for EADS. “I never weighed in for or against anybody that competed for the contract,” Mr McCain said this week. “All I asked for was a fair process.”But critics, including Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, have accused him of complicity in the outsourcing of thousands of jobs to Europe that would otherwise have gone to Boeing workers in the US.Anger against Mr McCain is greatest in the states of Washington and Kansas, where Boeing has its biggest plants. Boeing announced on Monday that it would appeal against the decision to award the contract to EADS.Mr McCain has argued that his actions helped save taxpayers billions of dollars by bringing competition and transparency to the bidding process. “I intervened in a process that was clearly ­corrupt. That’s why people went to jail,” he said this week, referring to an air force official and a former Boeing executive who were prosecuted in relation to the scandal.EADS, the Franco-German parent of Airbus, will build the tankers in partnership with US-based Northrop Grumman, creating jobs in both the US and Europe.
243;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-11T02:47:14Z;Boeing formally contests EADS deal;;Boeing will on Tuesday formally contest the US air force’s decision to award a $35bn refuelling tanker contract to a partnership between EADS and Northrop Grumman.The move will further delay the replacement of the US’s ageing refuelling tanker fleet, a process that the air force has been attempting since 2002, when it originally selected Boeing for the project. Congress cancelled that deal after it emerged that Darleen Druyun, the top air force procurement official, had held illegal job talks with Boeing.Ms Druyun and Mike Sears, then-chief financial officer at Boeing, were sent to prison. Phil Condit, Boeing’s chief executive at the time, was forced to resign. While the decision to give the contract to EADS-Northrop was a shock, Boeing’s objection will come as little surprise.In recent days it had catalogued a range of complaints about the way the air force evaluated the two bids. Pentagon officials have said that the EADS-Northrop proposal was superior to Boeing’s on every score, but the Chicago-based company has challenged that, countering that in its debriefing with air force officials, the two bids emerged as much closer than had been portrayed.”Our team has taken a very close look at the tanker decision and found serious flaws in the process that we believe warrant appeal,” Jim McNerney, Boeing’s chairman, president and chief executive, said on Monday night. ”This is an extraordinary step rarely taken by our company, and one we take very seriously.”Boeing’s case will rest on the technical merits of its bid. The company argued on Monday that its proposal was superior to EADS’ in terms of mission capability, and contended that the air force should have placed it ahead when measuring risk and past performance.Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the joint chiefs, on Monday defended the air force decision. Speaking to reporters aboard his plane en route from Colorado to US Strategic Command in Nebraska, Adm Mullen said that ”everything that I have been told indicates that it was a free, fair and open competition”.”This has been a very prolonged process that has been very difficult and I would certainly hope that every lesson that could have been learned was learned.”Adm Mullen added that he hoped the issue could be resolved ”as rapidly as possible.””I need those tankers. That is a real military capability that I have got to have to sustain my military force in the future,” said Adm Mullen.Boeing and its supporters have pushed its proposal as an ”all-American” bid, casting its competitor as a foreign option that would lead to US jobs being outsourced abroad. The tanker’s airframe, based on the A-330 passenger jet, will be made in Europe before being assembled in the US.The contract has become a hot political issue, with Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential contenders, leading the outrage at the decision to award the contract to a partnership led by a non-American company.Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic speaker, Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic majority leader, and Norm Dicks, a Democratic congressman from Washington state – where Boeing would have assembled its tankers – have also lambasted the decision.Northrop hit back on Monday, claiming its bid would support 48,000 US jobs, double its previous estimate for the project and more than the 44,000 Boeing claimed its own bid would support.The company said its initial figure of 25,000 had been ”a conservative estimate”.
244;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-10T19:42:28Z;Northrop plays up jobs boost from EADS deal;;Northrop Grumman on Monday sprang to the defence of the controversial $35bn refuelling tanker contract, awarded to the US defence contractor and European group EADS in preference to Boeing.The contract has provoked political criticism, with some people portraying the joint EADS-Northrop bid as an example of the “outsourcing” of American jobs. The tanker’s airframe, based on the A330 passenger jet, will be made in Europe before being brought to the US for assembly.Northrop attempted to put a positive gloss on the deal, claiming it would support 48,000 US jobs, double the company’s previous estimate for the project and more than the 44,000 Boeing claimed its own bid would support.The company said its initial figure of 25,000 had been “a conservative estimate” based on Department of Commerce guidelines but that, under a Labor Department formula, its project would support 48,000 indirect and direct jobs in the US.Northrop also said its supplier base included 230 companies in 49 US states.Boeing, which has supplied the US military with tankers for five decades, on Monday said it had “spent the weekend evaluating with growing concern” the air force’s award, and suggested it was preparing to contest the decision.“This competition was much closer than has been reported, and that raises the stakes if the process was flawed and unfair in any way,” said Mark McGraw, head of Boeing’s tanker bid. “We have serious concerns over inconsistency in requirements, cost factors and treatment of our commercial data …We take a protest very seriously.”Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, the two Democratic White House contenders, were among the first to criticise the deal along with Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic speaker, and Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic majority leader.Norm Dicks, a Democratic congressman from Washington state, where Boeing would have assembled its tankers, has also lambasted the decision.John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee who led the Congressional investigation into the original Boeing deal, said he hoped the air force had conducted a fair competition.The air force had chosen Boeing to supply it with 100 tankers in 2002 but Congress cancelled the deal after it emerged that Darleen Druyun, a former top air force acquisitions official, had held illegal job discussions with Boeing while still negotiating the deal. Ms Druyun admitted boosting the value of the deal to help Boeing.Both Ms Druyun and Mike Sears, then chief financial officer at Boeing, were sent to prison. The fallout from the affair forced the resignation of Phil Condit, Boeing’s chief executive, in 2003.
245;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-09T19:27:15Z;Defence contract was won fair and square;;From the moment the US air force announced the decision to award a $35bn contract to supply aircraft-refuelling tankers to Europe’s EADS and its US partner Northrop Grumman, there were outcries from members of Congress whose parochial interests lie with the rival offering from Boeing.The contract is the largest acquisition programme in the history of the air force. To have expected controversy not to follow, regardless of the winner, would have been foolish. What is unfortunate in the controversy is that the uproar is based upon mendacity, rather than logic and reason.The objective of the acquisition was clear from the outset: acquire the best new tanker for the US air force. The air force, in a lengthy, full and open competition, determined that the KC-30 was superior to Boeing’s KC-767 and was the best tanker to meet its needs. To claim at this late date that our military will not be getting the best plane simply because the contract was not awarded to Boeing is illogical and ignores the facts. The KC-30 has more capacity to offload fuel, and carries more passengers and cargo, thereby giving the air force more capability,flexibility and dependability. It outperforms the KC-767 not only by industry standards but, most importantly, by the standards of the air force, which rates it superior in every one of the five categories used.Charges have been raised that by awarding a contract to a foreign company, national security may be at risk because the US military would have to rely on foreign suppliers. Nothing could be further from the truth. The prime contractor of the team that won, Northrop Grumman, is no less an American company than Boeing. While Northrop’s proposal uses a European-designed airframe, a close scrutiny of the two competing proposals shows that the two have a similar amount of foreign content.This is hardly the first defence programme to be awarded to a US-European team. Boeing itself was part of a team that recently won the army contract for the joint cargo aircraft – an Italian-built aircraft that will be assembled in Florida at a Boeing facility. There was no outcry at this award from Boeing’s supporters, even though it would seem that the joint cargo aircraft programme would similarly “take American tax dollars and build this plane overseas”.The global environment makes it almost impossible for any major military product to be 100 per cent US-made – especially when our goal is to provide the best equipment for our war fighters. Moreover, US aerospace firms have supplied billions of dollars’ worth of equipment built by Americans to foreign countries.As members of Congress, we are concerned about US jobs. But any assertion that this award “outsources” jobs to France is simply false. With a new assembly site in Mobile, Alabama, this contract will bring tens of thousands of jobs into the US. According to the job-forecasting tool from the department of commerce, Northrop Grumman will employ about the same number of US workers on the tanker contract as Boeing would have. The Northrop Grumman tanker team will employ about 25,000 US workers at more than 230 supplier companies in 49 states.Congress must remain as objective as possible and insist on due process. Invalidating the award, starting the process again or inserting prohibitive language into legislation to block the tanker acquisition would be irresponsible and based on raw emotion. Should Boeing choose to protest, the Government Accountability Office will determine whether this award was properly executed and we must let regular oversight prevail.This was a fair and open competition, and I do not believe a protest will be successful. If the original decision is ratified by the GAO, it is imperative that the air force not be forced to overturn a decision simply because there are some who do not like it. Politics should have no place in the Department of Defense’s acquisition process.“Facts are stubborn things,” John Adams once said. If the US air force and members of Congress wanted the tanker to be a job-creation programme for Boeing, they should have eschewed a competition and sole-sourced the contract in the first place. Instead, the intent was to provide our soldiers in uniform with the best air refuelling aircraft in the world, at the best value for the taxpayer. In the final analysis, that is precisely what the air force did.The writer is Senator for Alabama, senior member of the appropriations committee and a member of the appropriations subcommittee on defence
246;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-08T00:07:40Z;Boeing ponders protest over tankers deal;;Boeing is seriously considering protesting the US Air Force decision to award a $35bn contract for refuelling tankers to EADS, the European defence company, the company said late on Friday.The Chicago-based company expressed “significant concerns” about the process used to select EADS and Northrop Grumman, its US partner, following an air force briefing on Friday. “We left the room with significant concerns …including programme requirements related to capabilities, cost and risk, evaluation of the bids and the ultimate decision,” said Mark McGraw, Boeing’s tanker programme manager.“What is clear now is that reports claiming that the Airbus offering won by a wide margin could not be more inaccurate.”Experts were stunned last week when the air force chose EADS, the parent company of Airbus, over Boeing, which has supplied the military with tankers for five decades.Boeing has 10 days to launch a protest to the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, which could force the air force to re-open the competition.“Our plan now is to work through the weekend to come to a decision on our course of action early next week,” said Mr McGraw. “It will be a very rigorous and deliberative process to ensure we’re balancing the needs of the war fighter with our desire to be treated fairly.”The air force will brief Northrop and EADS on Monday. Randy Belote, a Northrop spokesman, declined to say whether his team would stall plans to assemble tankers, should Boeing protest.The air force originally intended to buy and lease 100 tankers from Boeing. But Congress cancelled the deal after it emerged that Darleen Druyun, a senior air force procurement official, had held illegal discussions with Boeing during negotiations.Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, suggested that John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee who investigated the original Boeing deal, was responsible for the tanker deal being “outsourced” to a European company because his probe “intervened”.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Lexington Institute, said Boeing challenged the air force’s view that there was more risk attached to Boeing’s cost assumptions than those of EADS.
247;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-07T19:12:18Z;Boeing could announce third delay for 787;;Boeing could announce a third delay for its 787 Dreamliner when it issues an update on the project at the end of March.The US aerospace group, which lost out to EADS last week on the controversial $35bn US Air Force refuelling tanker contract, said it was assessing the progress of the 787, its first all-new commercial jet since the 777 entered service in 1995.“We are working towards a schedule that we had outlined in January,” said Boeing. However, it left open the possibility that the company might report further delays when it gives the update. “The assessment could change that schedule,” it said.Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, said it expected the first deliveries of the 250-300 seat jet to be pushed back to the third quarter of 2009, from Boeing’s current target of “early 2009”.“[Boeing] continues to underestimate the amount of work required on the 787,” said analyst Richard Safran. “We think Boeing will notify suppliers of new production targets shortly, motivated by the need to keep delivery commitments to airlines.”The 787 is Boeing’s most successful new aircraft, with 857 orders in place, worth about $140bn. New orders have continued to flow in spite of the programme being delayed, first in October and again in January.A further delay would be both embarrassing for the company and irksome to Boeing’s customers, who are starting to grumble about pressing for compensation from the aircraft maker.After Boeing announced the airliner’s second delay in January, Qantas, the Australian flag-carrier, said it would seek damages. International Lease Finance, the world’s leading aircraft leasing group, said last month it was also looking for compensation from Boeing.The warning came as Boeing was due to meet US air force officials on Friday to be debriefed on why it lost the $35bn contract to EADS and Northrop Grumman. Most analysts had expected the air force to select Boeing, which has supplied the US military with tankers for five decades, to win the deal which could ultimately be worth more than $100bn.The contract has become a hot political issue, with Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential contenders, leading the outrage at the decision to award the contract to a partnership led by a non-American company.Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, said this week that Boeing would have won the contract but for the fact that: “Senator McCain intervened, and now we have a situation where the contract may be – this work may be outsourced.”The air force originally selected Boeing for the project in 2002, but Congress cancelled the deal after it emerged that Darleen Druyun, the top air force procurement official, had held illegal job talks with Boeing.Ms Druyun and Mike Sears, then chief financial officer at Boeing, were sent to prison, and Phil Condit, the company’s then chief executive, resigned.Mr McCain was at the forefront of Congress’s investigation into the deal.
248;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-07T00:41:58Z;Cobham to seek targets following 13% gain;;Cobham will continue its acquisition spree and has up to £600m in its arsenal to spend on targets in high- growth areas, according to Allan Cook, chief executive.The aerospace and defence group spent $750m (£373m) on bolt-on purchases last year and Mr Cook said that the “acquisition pipeline is as strong as ever”.Mr Cook was confident about the coming year thanks to the health of the markets in which Cobham operates, notably the lucrative US defence market that represents 47 per cent of revenues. The US government’s budget for defence spending in 2009 would be 7 per cent higher than this year, he said.Cobham’s US ambitions were boosted last Friday when a consortium led by Northrop Grumman and EADS, the European defence group, to which it is a supplier, won a contract to provide the US air force with refuelling tankers. The contract is worth about $1bn in sales.Mr Cook painted a bullish picture as he unveiled a 12.9 per cent advance in underlying profits to £206.5m for the year to December 31. But pre-tax profits slipped to £173.5 (£185.2m) on turnover of £1.015bn (£1.061bn) as the company absorbed amortisation and exceptional costs, including a £3.9m charge resulting from an aborted acquisition.The total dividend is raised 20 per cent to 4.5p via a 3.28p final, payable from earnings per share of 13.13p (11.61p). Cobham said its order book had increased by £163.2m last year, down from a £215.1m lift last time round.The shares closed up 1p at 193¾p.FT Comment● Like most of its UK peers, Cobham is targeting countries where spending on aerospace and defence is on the rise. This means the US defence market and emerging markets in Asia and the Middle East. Further bolt-on deals are on the agenda, backed by a healthy balance sheet. Trading on a 2009 price/earnings ratio of 13.1 times, according to Citigroup analysts, Cobham looks a good defensive bet among UK mid-caps.
249;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-06T01:39:14Z;Gates defends EADS tanker deal;;Robert Gates, US defence secretary, on Wednesday defended the air force’s decision to award a $35bn deal for refuelling-tankers to EADS, the European defence contractor, over Boeing.While the decision drew more fire on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Mr Gates stressed that it was a “merit-based” outcome from a “fair competition”, and pointed out that the defence industry has become increasingly globalised.“The reality is that we sell aircraft and ships and weapons systems all over the world…so there is a global aspect to this business,” said Mr Gates.Boeing and its congressional supporters on Wednesday suggested that the competition had been unfair. At a House hearing on the deal, Norm Dicks, a Washington state congressman, claimed the air force made last-minute changes that helped tilt the outcome towards EADS and Northrop Grumman, its US partner. Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Lexington Institute, said the air force had adjusted a model used to assess the rival bids, but noted that both proposals were downgraded as a result.John Murtha, Democratic chairman of the defence appropriations subcommittee, also warned that Congress could block the purchase of the 179 tankers, saying “political implications are important”.House lawmakers raised concerns that the air force had not considered the economic implications of the deal. Northrop says the deal will support 25,000 jobs in the US, but Boeing argues that they would have created more. But Sue Payton, the top air force acquisitions official, who defended the outcome said US law precludes the Pentagon from considering the impact of jobs.“The competition was carried out under rules established by statute,” Mr Gates said later. “And if there is a desire to change the rules of the game, in terms of how these competitions are carried out…then clearly the Congress can do that, through statute.”Boeing has not decided whether to protest to the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, which could require the air force to reopen the competition. Most analysts believe Boeing would have little chance of success. Jim Albaugh, chief executive of its integrated defence systems unit, said Boeing would only protest if it believed there was an “irregularity” in the proposal process.Additional reporting by agencies
250;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-05T02:03:17Z;Pentagon hit by barrage of fire over EADS deal;;The Pentagon decision to award EADS, the European defence contractor, and Northrop Grumman a $35bn contract to supply refuelling tankers to the US Air Force came under a barrage of fire on Tuesday as more lawmakers joined the chorus of critics on Capitol Hill.Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, said Congress should hold hearings on the unexpected result. Most analysts had predicted the Air Force would select Boeing, which has supplied the US military with tankers for five decades.Jim Manley, spokesman for Mr Reid, told the FT that Mr Reid “has concerns”. The Nevada senator was following in the footsteps of Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic speaker, and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, the two contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination.While the deal has the support of politicians from Alabama, where EADS will assemble the 179 inflight refuelling tankers, it has been criticised by lawmakers from Washington state, home of the facility where Boeing would have converted its 767 commercial jets to tankers.Senior Air Force officials are expected to be grilled in the House and Senate over the deal. Michael Wynne, Air Force secretary, and General Michael Moseley, Air Force chief of staff, appear before the Senate for regularly scheduled hearings. Meanwhile, Sue Payton, the leading Air Force procurement official, will testify before a specially convened House hearing.The Air Force selected Boeing in 2002, but Congress later cancelled the deal after it emerged that Darleen Druyun, the top Air Force procurement official at the time, had held illegal job discussions with Boeing. Both Ms Druyun and Mike Sears, then chief financial officer at Boeing, were sent to prison. The fallout from the affair also forced the resignation of Phil Condit, Boeing’s chief executive, in 2003.One congressional source said the animus on Capitol Hill over the decision among Boeing supporters was “as bad as I have ever seen it”. Mrs Clinton has expressed outrage at the decision to give the contract to EADS, the parent company of Airbus, and its US partner.Richard Aboulafia, a defence expert at the Teal group, said Congress could get involved in trying to alter the decision, for example by forcing the Air Force to buy from both rivals.“If the Democrats get the presidency and the House and Senate armed services committees, then all bets are off,” Mr Aboulafia said.EADS and Northrop have pointed out that they would be creating jobs in Alabama, where the tanker will be assembled. EADS has also talked about assembling cargo planes at the same facility in Mobile.Duncan Hunter, the senior Republican on the House armed services committee, onk Tuesday said the decision would lead to a net loss of US jobs. He said Boeing’s tanker would be 85 per cent built in the US, while EADS-Northrop’s tanker would only be 58 per cent US-built.John Young, the top Pentagon acquisitions official, defended the deal, saying the Air Force was not running its acquisitions evaluations as a “jobs programme”, according to Reuters.The attempt to portray Boeing as an all-American company may be undermined by its 787 project, which has a truly global production system. Its middle fuselage sections and horizontal tailpieces, for example, are made in Italy by Alenia Aeronautica. Its wings are produced in Japan.In a move that could be seen as laying the groundwork for a protest, Boeing on Tuesday called for an immediate briefing from the Air Force, saying the plan to brief the company after March 12 was unfair.The Pentagon later suggested that the briefing might be moved forward to this week.Boeing could protest to the General Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, which could require the Air Force to re-offer the contract. Paul Nisbet, an aerospace expert at JSA Research, said the possibility of the GAO overturning the decision was no more than 10 per cent.“The Air Force has undoubtedly gone overboard to avoid the types of problems they have encountered with the GAO on the past KC-767 and [CSAR-X] Search & Rescue helicopter awards.”Winslow Wheeler, a procurement expert at the Center for Defense Information, said the GAO’s previous tendency to not sustain protests had recently changed. The GAO compelled the Air Force to reopen the CSAR-X helicopter competition – which Boeing originally won – following a protest by Sikorsky..
251;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-04T00:04:29Z;GE gains from EADS contract win;;General Electric is to earn at least $5bn over the next two decades from providing jet engines to the European-led consortium that beat Boeing in the race for a $35bn contract for US Air Force refuelling tankers.People close to the US conglomerate said the contract for 179 aircraft, one of the largest yet for its aviation division, was unexpected as most experts had tipped an alliance of Boeing and Pratt & Whitney, GE’s arch-rival, to win.Analysts say the total value of the contract won last week by the consortium of EADS, the European defence company, Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor, and GE could rise to more than $100bn if the Pentagon decides to replace its entire fleet of 600 tankers. Such a move could treble GE’s sales on the project.“It’s a great win for us,” Scott Donnelly, chief executive of GE Aviation, told the Financial Times on Monday. “Something of this magnitude is quite unique, a once in a decade occurrence”.The surprise victory of the EADS-led consortium sparked a political backlash in the US, with several members of Congress expressing outrage at the decision to award the prized programme to a foreign contractor.But officials at GE stressed that the vast majority of the jet engines to be supplied to the Air Force would be built on US soil.And while EADS, which controls Boeing’s rival Airbus, has stressed that 60 per cent of the aircraft will be made in the US, GE officials said that 82 per cent of the engine will come from US factories.GE’s plants in North Carolina and Ohio – two states that have been hit hard by the shrinking of the US manufacturing base in recent years – are likely to be the main sites for the project.Mr Donnelly said he did not know whether those considerations played a part in the US government’s decision to award the contract to EADS but said “the issue of jobs and content was something that people talked a lot about”.He added that GE had decided to back the EADS consortium in the middle of last year because the financial rewards were more appealing.GE and EADS have already co-operated on tankers for Australia and Saudi Arabia.Separately, GE announced that Beth Comstock would leave its entertainment unit, NBC Universal, where she was president of integrated media, to become group chief marketing officer. Ms Comstock, seen as a key ally of GE’s chairman and chief executive Jeffrey Immelt, will replace Dan Henson, who moves to head GE Capital Solutions.GE also announced that Mr Immelt received total compensation of $19.6m in 2007, a 10 per cent rise over the previous year. GE shares rose 5 per cent last year.

Citigroup analyst Donald Fandetti said the lender risked bankruptcy.“Thornburg will have to sell assets in a distressed market or raise equity capital to meet margin calls,” Mr Fandetti said. “Failure to complete either of these two could put Thornburg at risk of bankruptcy.”Shares in the lender, which specialises in adjustable-rate jumbo loans, fell 51.5 per cent to $4.32.Mortgage woes also rattled Deerfield Capital.

253;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-02T22:07:41Z;Shock and awe at award to ”socialistic” Europeans;;The surprise announcement that EADS, the European defence company, and partner Northrop Grumman had won a lucrative deal to supply the US Air Force with refuelling tankers, has thrown the holiday plans of Louis Gallois, EADS’ chief executive, into disarray.“I am trying to leave for the mountains. I am not sure it will happen,” the Frenchman, clearly delighted, told the FT.Boeing was the clear favourite to win the $35bn deal. Most analysts were very sceptical that the Pentagon would award such a high-profile contract to the European-US team. This helped explain why the shock at EADS was matched only by anger of some politicians.Duncan Hunter, the top Republican on the House armed services committee, accused the Air Force of awarding the contract to “socialistic” European counties at the expense of US aerospace workers and taxpayers.“These are the same European governments who are unwilling to support us in the ‘Global War on Terror’,” said Mr Hunter.The few voices of support came from Alabama where EADS plans to assemble the 179 tankers. Republican senators Richard Shelby and Jeff Sessions praised the deal, while Jo Bonner, a Republican congressman, commended the Air Force for “seeing beyond all of the rhetoric”.Boeing had waged an aggressive campaign painting the EADS/ Northrop tanker as an un-American product that would cost US jobs. That was the argument that clearly fuelled most of the outrage from Capitol Hill, and particularly from the delegation from Washington state, where Boeing planned to assemble its tankers.“I was shocked…there will be real scepticism among the defence-related committees in Congress,” said Norm Dicks, a Washington congressman and staunch Boeing ally.“Even more regrettable is the decision to award the contract to Airbus, which has consistently used unfair European government subsidies to take jobs away from American aircraft workers.”One group of Washington lawmakers, including Democratic senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, said they were “outraged” and vowed to ask “tough questions about the decision to outsource this contract”.Even the Air Force seemed sensitive to the charges. In announcing the winner at the Pentagon on Friday, Michael Wynne, secretary of the Air Force, and General Duncan McNabb, vice chief of staff of the Air Force, congratulated Northrop Grumman without even mentioning EADS.And when asked whether Congress would be upset at the outcome, General Arthur Lichte, head of Air Mobility Command which manages the US tanker fleet, shot back: “This is an American tanker. It’s flown by American airmen. It has a big American flag on the tail, and every day it’ll be out there saving American lives.”In the weeks leading up to the announcement, Boeing and EADS had duelled over the question of which aircraft was really “American”. Boeing said EADS would only assemble, not manufacture, its KC-30 tankers in the US, while EADS noted that significant parts of Boeing’s KC-767 are made in Italy and Japan.With the Air Force planning to ultimately replace its entire fleet of about 600 tankers, EADS and Northrop could ultimately win as much as $100bn in contracts. With the stakes so high, Congress may find it hard to stay on the sidelines.“This was always a hyper-politicised programme. It likely had nothing to do with the Air Force’s choice, but many will see this as a Republican selected aircraft built in a Republican state,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace expert at the Teal group.“If Democrats gain full control, they might be tempted to cut KC-30 acquisition rates, and possibly even add a parallel KC-767 procurement line.”Boeing may also decide to protest the decision. But Loren Thompson, a defence expert at the Lexington Institute, argued that since the EADS/Northrop aircraft beat Boeing in four of five categories deemed important by the Air Force, the chances of a reversal were slim.“Anyone who pursues a ‘Buy American’ campaign to overturn this decision will have to explain why they want to impose an inferior plane on the nation’s war fighters,” said Mr Thompson.While Sue Payton, head of Air Force acquisitions was reluctant to outline why Boeing had lost the deal until the company had been briefed, Gen Lichte summed up the benefits of the EADS/ Northrop tanker in one word: “More”.“More passengers, more cargo, more fuel to offload, more availability, more flexibility, more dependability…more patients in the aeromedical evacuation role,” he explained.Randy Belote, a spokesman for Northrop, declined to say whether the company expected Congress to find a legislative solution to help Boeing.“The fundamental question is ‘since both tankers are built in America from foreign components, which is better for the war fighter, the tanker that provides the best war fighting capability at the best cost or the tanker that offers half the capability at a higher cost?’ It is a simple answer,” said Mr Belote.Ms Payton on Friday said the Air Force had gone to great lengths to ensure a fair competition, stressing that there was “absolutely no bias”. With this decision, the Air Force is hoping to bury a painful part of its past. In 2003, Congress cancelled an Air Force contract to buy and lease tankers from Boeing after an investigation revealed that Darleen Druyun, the senior Air Force procurement official responsible for tankers, had held illegal job negotiations with Boeing while still negotiating the deal.“The Darleen Druyun situation was a half a decade ago,” said Ms Payton. “We have been extremely open and transparent…we have had a very thorough review of what we’re doing. We’ve got it nailed, and I don’t see any relationship to what has gone on in the past at all.”Additional reporting by Peggy Hollinger in Paris
254;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-02T20:29:57Z;Victory spells orders bonanza for European suppliers;;"Europe’s aerospace industry will be one of the main beneficiaries of EADS’s stunning victory.Although the company and its US partner, Northrop Grumman, have stressed that 60 per cent of the aircraft will be made in America, existing suppliers on the A330-200 will receive increased orders.EADS plants in France, Spain and Germany will also benefit, according to analysts. The horizontal tail planes of the A330 family are built in Spain.British aerospace companies, in particular, stand to win. It is the UK’s second-largest defence export this decade (after the deal to sell Eurofighter Typhoons to Saudi Arabia) and will deliver an estimated £3bn. British factories will build all wings for the A330-200; the wings are assembled at Broughton; big sub-assemblies are at Filton, now owned by GKN.Other UK suppliers that stand to benefit include Messier-Dowty and Magellan. Cobham will produce equipment to transfer fuel between planes. Allan Cook, chief executive, said the contract would be worth $1bn in sales over the life of the programme.“It gives the transatlantic alliance a significant industrial boost and will secure British jobs for many years to come,” said Robin Southwell, chief executive of EADS UK."
255;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-02T20:21:56Z;US outrage over EADS tanker contract;;Senior US politicians lashed out at the decision to award EADS, the European defence group, a $35bn contact to supply refuelling tankers to the air force instead of American rival Boeing.Members of Congress were outraged that such a crucial military contract should be awarded to an overseas contractor. The decision threatens to add fuel to mounting protectionist sentiment in the US, amid concern about the slowing economy and shrinking manufacturing workforce.“It’s stunning to me that we would outsource the production of these airplanes to Europe instead of building them in America,” said Sam Brownback, the Republican senator for Kansas, where Boeing has a site. “I’ll be calling upon the secretary of defence for a full debriefing.”Anger was deepest in the state of Washington, where most of Boeing’s production facilities are headquartered. “This is a blow to the American aerospace industry, American workers and America’s men and women in uniform,” said a joint statement by several of the state’s congressional delegation.There was no immediate reaction from the main US presidential candidates but the decision could become a campaign issue at a time when Democratic rivals Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are focusing on trade and jobs. John McCain, the probable Republican nominee, played a key role in the tanker saga by helping quash a no-bid deal for Boeing to build the aircraft after corrupt ties emerged between the US group and US Air Force procurement officials in 2001.Both EADS and Northrop Grumman, its US partner, have stressed their offering will create thousands of jobs in the US, promising that 58 per cent of the value of the tanker aircraft will come from US companies.Such a landmark victory for EADS would have been almost inconceivable three years ago but US relations with Paris and Berlin have sharply improved since the election of the more pro-US Nicolas Sarkozy as president of France and Angela Merkel as German chancellor.Reporting by Andrew Ward in Washington, Sylvia Pfeifer in London, Scheherazade Daneshkhu in Paris and Hal Weitzman in Chicago
256;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-03-02T19:42:26Z;EADS wins;;The good old US of A can’t seem to win a trick at the moment. Its economy is cracking and the dollar is being trumped. Now its own air force has awarded a $35bn contract to build aerial refuelling tankers, not to Boeing, as widely expected, but to a team lead by EADS, the European aerospace and defence group. That EADS’s partner is LA-based Northrop Grumman seems to be no consolation to US politicians fuming over jobs.The management of EADS will be overjoyed to give long-suffering shareholders some good news. The company’s stock price has halved since its 2006 highs on the back of delays to Airbus’s A380 super jumbo and the falling dollar versus the euro. Certainly, the win fits perfectly with the management’s stated aim to reduce EADS’s dependence on Airbus, which last year accounted for about 65 per cent of revenues.But the terms of the tanker contract are unknown, save that EADS and Northrop will be sharing an initial $1.5bn for the development and design of four test aircraft. Whatever margin investors assume – and chances are cost played a bigger part in winning the contract than EADS cares to admit – that barely touches the sides considering that Airbus is estimated to have lost upwards of €800m last year, according to Goldman Sachs. Investors will have to wait and see what the margins look like as the 179 aircraft start rolling out of the hangar. But for the next few years at least, the fate of Airbus will be the main driver of EADS’s share price. A capital raising remains a very real possibility.Still, with clouds on the horizon for commercial jets, every bit helps. For Boeing, on the other hand, the loss is an unwelcome blow following delays to its 787 Dreamliner. But all is not lost: the US air force eventually wants more than 500 new tankers. In an election year, in spite of the craziness of having two different tankers in the sky, calls may become louder for the really big order to head to Boeing.
257;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;EADS lands $35bn US defence deal;;EADS, the European defence company, scored a stunning victory in its campaign to penetrate the US defence market on Friday by winning a $35bn (£17.6bn) contract to supply the US air force with refuelling tankers.EADS and Northrop Grumman, its US partner, beat Boeing in a competition that could ultimately be worth more than $100bn.The winning team will initially supply 179 air-to-air refuelling tankers using a modified version of the Airbus A330 passenger jet.But the air force may select the same aircraft to replace its entire fleet of about 600 tankers over the coming decades.Louis Gallois, EADS chief executive, told the Financial Times that it was “just great” to beat Boeing, saying: “I think it is the best contract I have won in my life.” Ronald Sugar, Northrop’s chief executive, said he was “delighted”.The decision is a huge blow to Chicago-based Boeing. Congress cancelled its original deal to supply tankers in 2003 following a procurement scandal that sent a Boeing executive and air force procurement official to prison.“Obviously we are very disappointed,” Boeing said in a statement. “Once we have reviewed the details behind the award, we will make a decision concerning our possible options.” Shares in Boeing fell 3.7 per cent in after-hours trade, while shares in Northrop rose 5.6 per cent.Most analysts, before the decision, expected the losing bidder to protest.Politicians from the state of Washington and Kansas, where Boeing would have built the tanker, lashed out at the air force decision.“We are shocked that the air force tapped a European company and its foreign workers to provide a tanker to our American military,” said Patty Murray, a Democratic senator from Washington. “At a time when our economy is hurting, this decision to outsource our tankers is a blow to the American aerospace industry, American workers and America’s military.”General Michael Moseley, air force chief of staff, this week warned that a protest would force the air force to continue using 44-year-old planes.“From the warfighters’ point of view we need to get on with this,” said General Arthur Lichte, commander of the US Air Mobility Command, which oversees the US tanker fleet.Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace expert at the Teal group, said the decision was a “major win for EADS and a breakthrough for their crucial US defence market strategy”. EADS will assemble the aircraft in Alabama where it has developed a strong group of congressional supporters.But lawmakers supportive of Boeing will likely paint the decision as a blow to US industry.“We are proud that the US air force chose the Northrop Grumman/EADS team to modernise its aerial refueling fleet,” said Ralph Crosby, chief executive of EADS North America. “We already have begun the work necessary to expand our US industrial footprint in support of this important programme.”Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Lexington Institute, said that the air force had concluded that the winning team beat Boeing in four out of five criteria used to pick the aircraft, including superior fuel and cargo-carrying capacity.The air force has gone to great lengths to dispel any suggestions of bias.Sue Payton, the head of air force acquisitions, who has stressed that the Pentagon provided regular feedback to the rivals, said Northrop and EADS “clearly provided the best value to the government”.Reporting by Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington, Sylvia Pfeifer in London, Peggy Hollinger in Paris, and Hal Weitzman in Chicago
258;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-01-25T00:15:41Z;Lockheed produces fighting fourth quarter;;Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, two of the US defence industry’s leading companies, gave a boost to corporate America on Thursday by announcing healthy quarterly earnings.Defence contractors have been experiencing a boom in recent years thanks to higher weapons spending at the Pentagon. While there are concerns the sector could struggle should the US begin to withdraw from Iraq, Lockheed, the world’s largest defence contractor, is thought to be insulated, given its focus on fighter jets and long-term projects.Northrop, the US’s third-largest defence contractor, is hoping to secure future earnings by beating Boeing in a contest for a $40bn contract to build the US Air Force’s next generation of in-flight refuelling aircraft, the results of which are expected next month.On Thursday, Lockheed reported fourth-quarter profits well ahead of analysts’ expectations and raised its forecast for 2008, while profits at Northrop came in just above expectations.Lockheed said net profit in the quarter reached $799m, or $1.89 per share, up from $729m, or $1.68 per share, a year earlier, on flat sales of $10.84bn. For the full year, net profit was $3bn, up from $2.5bn in 2006, while sales were up 6 per cent to $41.9bn from $39.6bn a year earlier.The company also revised its forecast for 2008 and said it expected earnings per share of between $7.05 and $7.25, up from $6.95-$7.15. It raised its projection slightly for net sales for 2008 to $41.8bn-$42.8bn, citing strength in the aeronautics business for the changed outlook.Bob Stevens, Lockheed chairman, president and chief executive, said the results showed “our programme execution was solid, we won important new business and we continued to shape a balanced business portfolio”.Northrop reported fourth-quarter net income of $454m, or $1.31 per share, up from $453m, or $1.28 per share, in the same quarter of 2006, on a 10 per cent increase in sales to $8.8bn from $8bn. Sales for 2007 increased 6 per cent to $32bn from $30.1bn in 2006. Northrop expects earnings from ongoing operations to be between $5.50 and $5.75 per share on sales of about $33bn.
259;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2008-01-24T22:50:00Z;Lockheed expects funding extension for F-22;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor, on Thursday expressed confidence that the US Congress would grant additional funding to its F-22 fighter jet programme, postponing the scheduled closure of the company’s production line in 2011.This month, the FT reported that the Pentagon would ask Congress to approve $500m funding for four additional F-22s.Gordon England, deputy defence secretary, had opposed extending the programme beyond the purchase of a planned 183 jets, while the Air Force has been pressing for a total of 381 F-22s.“This concept is looking more likely rather than less likely,” said Bob Stevens, Lockheed’s chairman and chief executive. “There’s a fairly compelling dialogue that’s occurring in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill,” he said.Mr Stevens said the efficiency of the production line and the ageing F-15 fleet gave him the sense that “the operational tempo is not likely to diminish in the foreseeable future”.He said he would be reluctant to “shut down a line that has taken a good deal of time to bring to this configuration … There will never be a less expensive F-22 than the one we can buy off an active line”. His comments came as Lockheed Martin reported fourth-quarter profits well ahead of analysts’ expectations and raised its forecast for 2008, while profits at Northrop Grumman, the US’s third biggest defence contractor, came in just above expectations.Defence contractors have been experiencing a boom in recent years on the back of higher weapons spending at the Pentagon.Lockheed said net profit in the quarter reached $799m, or $1.89 per share, up from $729m, or $1.68 per share, a year earlier, on flat sales of $10.84bn. For the full year, net profit was $3bn, up from $2.5bn in 2006, while sales were up 6 per cent to $41.9bn from $39.6bn a year earlier.Northrop Grumman reported fourth-quarter net income of $454m, or $1.31 per share, up from $453m, or $1.28 per share, in the same quarter of 2006, on a 10 per cent increase in sales to $8.8bn from $8bn. For 2007 as a whole, sales increased by 6 per cent to $32bn.
260;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;US Air Force hopes to ride out tanker turbulence;;The US Air Force will next month reopen a difficult chapter in its history when it has to decide whether to award Boeing or the US defence contractor’s European rival, EADS, a lucrative contract to supply refuelling tankers to replace its ageing fleet.The stakes could not be higher for Boeing, EADS or the air force. Victory for EADS, which is partnered with Northrop Grumman, would mark a huge step in its strategy to expand into the US defence market. While the initial contract is worth $40bn, a second tranche is expected to bring the final value to more than $100bn.Boeing, on the other hand, wants to ensure it remains the sole supplier of air-to-air refuelling aircraft to the US. Along with the air force, it also wants to repair some of the damage done to its reputation in 2003 when a previous contract to provide tankers was revoked following accusations of bias and corruption.Congress scuppered the earlier deal awarded to Boeing following investigations that led to the imprisonment of a top Boeing executive and a former senior air force procurement official at the Pentagon.Boeing is once again proposing the KC-767, a modified version of its 767 commercial airframe that uses a boom to refuel military aircraft in flight.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman and EADS are offering the KC-30, adapted from the Airbus A330 passenger jet, which has won many of the recent tanker competitions around the world.The air force is hoping for a smooth competition that will allow it to move forward with replacing the current fleet of tankers – its top priority – which are decades old.However, most analysts expect the losing bidder to protest the decision, a recent trend in air force contracts that senior officials are trying to reverse by providing lots of feedback to the companies before they offer their final bid.Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst at JSA Research, says it is “almost a given” that the loser will protest the decision to the air force.“The reason why either side must protest if it loses is because this will be the largest purchase of commercial wide bodies in the world during the first half of the current century,” said Loren Thompson, defence expert at the Lexington Institute. “When that kind of money is at stake, companies don’t simply let an opportunity slip away.”EADS previously floated the idea of a split-buy, but Sue Payton, the top air force acquisitions official at the Pentagon last year told the Financial Times that dividing the first tranche of aircraft between the two bidders would be too costly in the short-term. The Pentagon confirmed to the FT this remains the position.Boeing has also dismissed the idea that it would be prepared to be one of two suppliers and said any such move would be a “tragedy for the US taxpayer”.But Mr Thompson says both bidders have separately started preparing to lobby Congress to force a split-buy should they lose.He says Boeing would likely make the same argument that EADS has put forward, saying the air force should evaluate each tanker in operation for a number of years before making a decision on one company to supply the more substantial second tranche.But Boeing said it was unaware of any Plan B, saying “the Pentagon has never talked about a split buy and neither have we”.In spite of having already submitted their final bids, both companies are still engaging in public relations campaigns that are aimed at raising awareness on Capitol Hill where the ultimate battle will be fought. While there are significant differences between the KC-767 and the KC-30, the biggest fight is likely to be over US jobs.Boeing is portraying itself as the US bidder, saying EADS is really a European company that will steal American jobs.“If you look down at our badge it says: ‘one company’,” says Boeing. “It’s not multiple countries and different places. It’s one organisation that’s working hard to provide something in a seamless way.”EADS and Northrop hit back by pointing out that the 767’s fuselage is made in Japan while the tail is made in Italy. “The KC30 is as European as the 767 is Japanese,” says Northrop. EADS will assemble the KC30 in Mobile, Alabama.Last week, the company announced it would also build A330 cargo planes at the same facility if it wins the air force competition. The move is part of the company’s strategy to argue that it is building a new centre of aerospace excellence in the US.The Air Force is expected to announce its decision in February, which will then bring the battle back to Congress.
261;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Frequent flying gets buying off the ground;;While most of the City was enjoying a well-earned Christmas break, Allan Cook was busy collecting air miles.The chief executive of Cobham, the aerospace and defence group, has spent much of the past month flying to the US in pursuit of potential acquisitions. On Wednesday, he revealed the fruit of all those trips – Cobham’s biggest-ever acquisition and its second in just four weeks.Cobham is paying $416m (£212m) for Sparta, an unlisted US group that specialises in US intelligence and missile defence. The deal follows December’s acquisition of Lansdale, another US defence company focused on sensors and antenna, for $240m from BAE Systems.It is no accident that both deals have taken place on the other side of the Atlantic.The US, the world’s largest defence market, has long been an attractive hunting ground for Britain’s defence companies.BAE Systems, Britain’s largest defence contractor, may have very publicly led the charge across the Atlantic, but the country’s mid-tier defence companies have not been far behind.The US government spends between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent of GDP on defence. Overall, the total US defence budget this year should reach a massive $696bn, a 14 per cent year-on-year growth – and British companies are competing for a slice of the pie.Cobham is no stranger to the US market and supplies both prime contractors as well as the US Department of Defence. Even before the two recent deals, almost 50 per cent of its revenues were being generated in America.The company’s total pro-forma US revenue in the past 12 months would have been about $1.4bn assuming the completion of Sparta, Lansdale and a smaller, third acquisition.According to Mr Cook, making inroads across the Atlantic has become easier as the company’s business there has grown.Nevertheless, he says one of his main aims this year will be “to elevate Cobham’s position, name and reputation” among the prime contractors such as Northrop Grumman and Raytheon.“We want to build on [our US position] but there is no question we have to work hard establishing our position,” he says.Some analysts have recently raised the prospect that US defence spending could be slashed if the Democrats regain power in the White House later this year.Analysts at UBS said they were somewhat concerned about Sparta’s dependence on missile defence, an area less supported by the Democrats and one that could experience cuts if a Democrat candidate wins the US presidency.Mr Cook, who was in Washington DC last week during the recent New Hampshire primary, said all the signals he was picking up showed that this was not a great concern for defence contractors.“Irrespective of which administration it is, I do believe that while the current growth rate in the US defence budget cannot be sustained …it is still going to grow,” he says.Mr Cook is unlikely to cut down on the transatlantic flights any time soon.After the Sparta acquisition, Cobham still has an estimated £400m of firepower in terms of debt and capacity and Mr Cook admits that, although the company never deliberately targets deals in certain countries, “most of the potential acquisitions that we see on the horizon are in the US”.Along with its smaller UK peers, Cobham is often cited as a potential takeover candidate but no credible predator has emerged – yet.Having missed out on what could have been a transformational deal last summer, Mr Cook is sticking to Cobham’s strategy of focusing on high technology, high growth areas.He insists the company is not under pressure from shareholders to return the money if it doesn’t find any further acquisition opportunities anytime soon. One of Cobham’s largest institutional shareholders confirmed that it was supportive of what the company was doing.The company’s products mean it is a major beneficiary of spending on network- centric warfare, whereby different military platforms, such as air and sea, are linked by rapid and secure communication channels. Analysts predict there will be further consolidation to come.Clive Forestier-Walker of Numis Securities, said: “Consolidation in the mid-tier level in the US market will continue.“Prices are coming down now because the market has come down. They are still fairly high, but these are strategic moves.”
262;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Bidders with cash able to pick and choose;;The UK continues to present overseas acquirers with plenty of takeover opportunities. While the pace of mergers and acquisitions in 2008 is unlikely to reach the record levels of the past two years, bidders with the cash are still looking for opportunities. Here are some of the companies which could be involved in deals next year.UTILITIESScottish & Southern Energy is one of last two independent energy companies left in the UK and merger arbitrageurs are betting that it will be on the receiving end of bids next year. EDF, the state-owned French energy company, which lost out on buying Scottish Power last year, could make a move on SSE. Investors will be hoping that the smaller water companies such as Northumbrian Water and Pennon will be attractive targets for infrastructure funds. Now that United Utilities has sold its non-core businesses, it could also be an attractive takeover target for pension funds and insurers looking for assets with stable cash flow.PHARMACEUTICALS, BIOTECH, & CHEMICALSNext year could be the year for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which are struggling with weak pipelines and increasing pricing pressure, to merge. Industry specialists expect to see significant activity among European biotech companies, where acquisition, not organic growth, is now considered a better way to expand a development pipeline. Top of the target list in the UK is Shire, which has no controlling shareholder and a strong pipeline of drugs aimed at specialist doctors. Genmab, which discovers and develops human antibodies for the treatment of life-threatening and debilitating diseases, has been linked with GlaxoSmithKline, while Silence Therapeutics could make a good technology play for the larger pharma companies, bankers believe. Johnson Matthey, the precious metals and speciality pharmaceuticals company, has been linked with Praxair of the US.METALS & MININGBHP Billiton’s attempted takeover of Rio Tinto has fuelled speculation that other miners are set to merge. Top of the list is Xstrata, the world’s sixth largest mining company, which is a favoured target of both Anglo American and Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil and has hinted it may be interested in talking to potential bidders. Vedanta Resources, the mining group controlled by Anil Agarwal, the Indian billionaire, could be in the takeover sights of the Chinese, while Lonmin, the world’s third-largest platinum producer, has been marked as a target for any company believing long-term platinum prices could be higher than current spot prices.CONSTRUCTION & HOUSEBUILDINGM&A in the construction services market has been extremely buoyant in recent years with the total value of transactions rising at an average of 30 per cent each year for the past four years, according to PwC. However, analysts appear split over whether the property sector has further to fall or not. Those who believe the bad news has now been priced into most stocks are betting on bids for British Land, which this month reported its worst net asset value performance for 14 years and as a result could attract the interests of sovereign wealth funds. Also on their shopping list is thought to be Hammerson, which invests mostly in shopping malls and retail parks, and Segro, formerly Slough Estates.DEFENCE & ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIALSInvestors believe Cobham, the defence and engineering contractor, is likely to be on the receiving end of a takeover bid this year with both Northrop Grumman and L3 Communications, the US defence groups, on bankers’ lists of potential bidders. Merger speculators are betting that Meggitt could receive a bid from Sulzer of Switzerland. Investors are hoping to see some bid activity round Thales, which, having called off talks with Safran, Europe’s second-biggest aircraft engine maker, could strike a deal with Finmeccanica, the Italian defence group. Invensys, the engineering group created out of the merger of BTR and Siebe, has long been seen as a takeover target, but Siemensof Germany could finally make an offer and become a leader in process automation. Having sold its aerospace unit toGeneral Electric, some investors are hoping Smiths Group could now be broken up.RETAIL & CONSUMERMitchells & Butlers, the pub group considering converting to a low-tax real estate investment trust (REIT), may finally succumb to a merger from rival Punch next year, which would create the UK’s biggest estate with 11,000 pubs. Investors are also hoping to see a bid for C&C, the Irish maker of Magners cider, whose stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value this year after it said profit would miss forecasts. The company would make a good addition for SABMiller, some bankers believe. Halfords, the bike and car-parts retailer, has been linked with Autobacs Seven, its Japanese rival.TECHNOLOGY, MEDIA & TELECOMSInvestors are hoping to finally see a tie-up between Reed Elsevier and Wolters Kluwer this year following the merger of Thomson Corporation and Reuters. United Business Media, the events organiser and publisher, is likely to look for smaller acquisition opportunities within the information services and trade shows sector. Investors are also hoping to see Springer Science + Business Media, the world’s second largest academic publisher, make a renewed takeover attempt for Informa, the business publisher of Lloyd’s List, having had its initial overtures rejected this year.Colt Telecom, the UK phone service provider, has been the subject of takeover speculation for months, with AT&T of the US the firm favourite.INSURANCE & FINANCIAL SERVICESMerger arbitrageurs have been waiting for the share prices of mortgage banks Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley to fall further following the impact of the credit crunch. Once they do, both banks would be attractive targets for continental Europeans such as Santander or Crédit Agricole. Hopes remain strong that talks between insurers Prudential and Aviva could be revived.
263;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-09-10T09:19:28Z;Emerging markets to outbid Pentagon;;In the coming years, the global defence market is expected to continue to expand. While the US, the largest defence market, is predicted to remain strong in the short-term, emerging powers such as India are looking to provide new opportunities for the large defence companies.When emergency spending for the Iraq and Afghanistan missions is included, the Pentagon budget for 2008 runs neck and neck with the Dutch economy in terms of size.The top US companies – includingLockheed Martin Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, and, increasingly, European companies, such as BAE Systems and EADS – are still focusing on the American marketplace where the largest contracts are concentrated.But while spending for the “war on terror” should remain high in the years to come, defence companies are expecting tighter budgets overall when the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns start winding down. There is also likely to be a shift in priorities away from weapons procurement as the Pentagon sets aside money to build up the army and the Marines.There is a growing sense inside and outside the Pentagon that the spiralling cost of weapons programmes cannot continue at the current pace. Some companies also believe John McCain, the Arizona senator who has been a fierce critic of the growing cost of procurement, may return to bang the drum if his presidential campaign is not reinvigorated. For all of these reasons, the large companies paying more attention to newer markets – Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Dassault and Saab – are among those eyeing the opportunity of supplying India with a new fleet of fighter jets to replace its ageing fleet of Russian-built MiG-21s.While India has traditionally bought from Russia and France, US companies may benefit from the recent warming in US-India relations. The US manufacturers in the fighter jet market – in addition to BAE and possibly Dassault – are also lining up for the battle to provide Japan with new aircraft to replace its ailing fleet of F-4s and F-15s.China’s emergence as a significant military power of the future however, will provide more limited possibilities for American and European defence companies because of restrictions, and concerns, about exporting there.For Europe’s biggest defence company, BAE Systems, its strategic decision to focus on the US, taken at the end of the 1990s, has appeared inspired of late, as the company profits from its position as the Pentagon’s biggest supplier after the big five of Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon. At the same time, the potential pitfalls of an essentially “foreign-headquartered” defence manufacturer being too reliant on the US have been highlighted by the US Department of Justice’s decision to pick up the baton on a corruption probe into BAE’s Saudi arms deals.Many in the industry were surprised when the Department of Justice flexed its independent muscles and pushed ahead with the probe (which had been abandoned by the British), given the political cost of the US upsetting two of its key allies in the UK and Saudi Arabia.BAE has done a good job of putting an American face on its US business, which by some measures now accounts for about half of its sales – most notably under the leadership of Mark Ronald, the former head of the US business who maintains a figurehead role at the group. But it is still a British company, with a London headquarters, which may leave it vulnerable if US rivals raise the issue of national security.The strong historic performance of BAE’s US business went some way towards easing congressional or Pentagon doubts about its recent $4.1bn purchase of Armor Holdings, establishing the company as the world’s leading land systems group. Some had thought the Saudi controversy would scupper the deal, though it passed without trouble.Mike Turner, BAE’s chief executive, uses the deal to prove that it is “business as usual” for his company in the US. But BAE outbid all other parties in the Armor auction and the target company was not deemed strategically important by the US government. And BAE’s Saudi issues could still be used by rival lobbyists on future deals, if it comes into direct conflict with any of its bigger US competitors.BAE’s ambitions to break into the US top-five appear on hold for now, but not particularly because of the Department of Justice probe. As Mr Turner says, there is little appetite at the Pentagon for further consolidation among the top players, though this could change if the defence budget falls back from its record run.Suggestions that private equity buyers could be interested in cash-rich defence companies, which always appeared slightly fanciful given the political concerns, are also off the table as a result of the global credit squeeze.It will be interesting to see how BAE fares in the US if a troop withdrawal takes place from Iraq. It has benefited more than most through its ownership of the Bradley fighting vehicle. Lockheed and Boeing are less conflict reliant.Regardless of BAE’s travails, its European rivals would gladly swap places with the British group, though they lack the advantages of the “special relationship” between the US and UK.Italy’s Finmeccanica has seen some success in selling presidential helicopters and cargo aircraft, but is finding it difficult to secure defence electronic acquisitions.Similarly, EADS has had some helicopter success and is in the running to supply air refuelling tankers, though most experts still believe it will lose out to Boeing.It looks unlikely that continental Europeans will be able to move beyond being mere platform providers to dominant local companies such as Lockheed and Northrop, although the work will still be welcome and offers some evidence that the US is becoming slightly more open to international partnerships.Bob Stevens, Lockheed’s chief executive, has used this argument to berate the European Defence Agency for looking to establish a unified European defence industry to challenge the US, though the chances of the Europeans getting their act together look as remote as ever.With the industrial crisis at its Airbus passenger jet subsidiary, a heavily weakened and cash-strapped EADS is no longer in a position to pursue its French rival, Thales.Instead, Thales is in the driving seat. It is considering bidding for parts of Safran, the French aeroengines, aerospace parts and telecoms group, and could also pursue Dassault – making Denis Ranque, the Thales chief executive, a surprise French defence industry consolidator-in-waiting.A tie-up between Thales and Finmeccanica on defence electronics appears more distant than ever, as Thales no longer needs the protection to ward off unwanted advances from EADS.The political implications of protecting Italian and French high-technology jobs also make this look like a non-starter. However, in the UK, the most important western defence market after the US, Thales appears to be facing a serious challenge.Finmeccanica has recently emerged as BAE’s biggest rival in the UK through its ownership of Westland Helicopters and an avionics business.Thales’ previous position as the natural counterweight against BAE dominance in the UK is no longer taken for granted.
264;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-07-27T14:05:36Z;US military spending lifts ITT;;ITT reported a rise of over 50 per cent in net profit on Friday, riding on increasing US military spending in the war in Iraq.The world’s 12th-largest defence contractor recorded $213.7m in net income, or $1.16 per share, compared with $140.9m or 75 cents per share last year. Analysts on average expected 90 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.ITT’s defence business, which makes devices such as digital combat radios, night vision devices and satellite instruments for military use, generated an operating income of $130m, representing a 29 per cent growth.The company expects to outpace the growth in US military spending because its specialist technology covers areas the military will continue to invest in, said ITT spokesman Andy Hilton.US military spending has sharply increased in recent years and is currently running at more than $600bn. The spike, however, is not expected to continue amid increasing doubts about the war in Iraq and proposals to limit war spending.A 2008 spending bill, budgeting $142bn for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, is currently at a lesiglative stand-still as the Democrat-controlled Congress attempts to re-shape the budget proposal.Earlier this week, Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor, and Northrop Grumman, the third largest supplier, also beat Wall Street estimates in their second-quarter results.The company maintained its full-year outlook of $3.44 to $3.50 per share.ITT shares were down 1.2 per cent at $66.46 in early trading in New York.
265;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-07-24T20:53:56Z;Foreign earnings save US blue chips;;"Foreign earnings came to the rescue of a slew of US multinationals on Tuesday, offsetting weakness in the domestic economy and highlighting their growing reliance on the rest of the world.Several blue chips that reported second-quarter earnings said their international business had outshone their US operations. They included UPS, the logistics group; DuPont, the chemical maker; PepsiCo, the soft-drinks maker; and United Airlines.The one sector that bucked the trend was defence, with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, among the biggest suppliers of aircraft, missiles and information systems to the Pentagon, beating Wall Street estimates.But the results season has been characterised by the increased importance of US companies’ international operations, which have been helped by the weakness in the dollar and rapid growth in emerging markets.General Electric, the industrial conglomerate, derives about half its sales from overseas and Caterpillar and IBM have both shown strong growth in international sales.UPS, often cited as a bellwether for the US economy, reported better-than-expected profits, lifted by strong performance in its international business. The 4.6 per cent rise in the daily number of packages it delivered internationally helped compensate for a decline of 0.2 per cent in the US.Rival FedEx has also been buoyed by growth abroad.DuPont cited weakness in the US housing and car markets as factors in second-quarter earnings missing analysts’ expectations. Its shares fell 6.4 per cent in late afternoon trading.The second-biggest US chemical company, which sells insulation and paints to the housing and motor industries, suffered a 2 per cent decrease in sales domestically while its overseas volumes grew by 4 per cent.PepsiCo profits beat analysts’ expectations thanks to growing demand for soft drinks in China and Europe and potato chips in Russia and Mexico.An increase in international revenues helped United Airlines shrug off concerns about over-capacity and lower domestic demand to report bullish second-quarter earnings. While passenger revenues in the Americas declined slightly, transatlantic and transpacific flights generated 25.5 per cent and 12.2 per cent more revenue respectively."
266;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-07-24T19:13:40Z;US defence firms bullish on outlook;;US defence contractors continue to reap the benefit of rising Pentagon spending as the US military remains engaged in high-intensity operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.Both Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor, and Northrop Grumman, the third largest supplier, reported second quarter profits which easily beat Wall Street expectations.However, the sharp rise in US military spending - currently running at more than $600bn, including supplementals - in recent years is not expected to continue amid increasing doubts about the Iraq deployment as a growing number of US politicians look for an exit from the conflict.Despite the better-than-expected performances of both companies, Bank of America analysts retained a neutral rating on the outlook for the industry, citing “the likely slowdown in defence spending as the US withdraws from Iraq, and uncertainty concerning the presidential elections next year.”Defence companies are looking to deal with the uncertain future by raising profit margins, targeting more foreign deals and diversifying. Lockheed has made strides in this direction by becoming the biggest provider of IT services to the US government.Lockheed, best known for building fighter jets for armed forces around the world, saw its earnings in the quarter jump 34 per cent to $778m, as sales rose 7 per cent to $10.7bn. Earnings per share were $1.82, beating analysts’ average forecasts of $1.52, according to Reuters.Lockheed’s share price was up 4 per cent at $103.48 in mid-afternoon trading in New York.Lockheed’s results were lifted by continued deliveries of the F-22 Raptor, the US Air Force’s latest air superiority fighter, and F-16s. It also benefited from the continued development of the $276bn F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme, with first deliveries of the aircraft expected next year.Northrop, which makes nuclear submarines and warships, saw earnings rise 7 per cent to $460m, and sales reach $7.9bn. Earnings per share were $1.31, beating forecasts of $1.23 a share. Its shares were down 1.3 per cent at $77.82 in mid-afternoon trading, as sales missed expectations and volumes in its ships and aerospace divisions fell.Fresh orders for Northrop in the quarter included a $2.4bn contract from the US navy to design and build an amphibious assault ship, as well as a $191m contract to develop a new communications system for the US air force’s Stealth bomber.Lockheed raised its predictions of profit for the year, and Northrop raised the bottom end of its forecast.
267;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-05-14T21:53:48Z;Pentagon defends weapons-buying strategy;;Critics of ballooning defence acquisition costs are increasingly taking aim at the Lead Systems Integrator contracting model. But the top Pentagon acquisitions official says those concerns are overstated.The LSI model, under which one large company is given responsibility for managing and overseeing a complex acquisition, was introduced in the 1990s partly because the Pentagon had cut employees with the technical expertise to oversee acquisitions projects.In an interview, Kenneth Krieg, under-secretary of defence for acquisition, technology and logistics, dismisses concerns that the LSI concept – which includes programmes such as the Army’s projected $161bn Future Combat Systems and the Coast Guard’s Deepwater programme – itself has resulted resulting in cost increases.“As the most important issue on cost, I think that is far from being the most important issue on cost,” said Mr Krieg. “As far as LSIs, we only have a couple of them. Everyone is focused on the FCS programme, and it gets lots of heat and light, and there are lots of issues to worry about in terms of cost and capability in FCS, only some of which are related to LSIs.”Congress has questioned whether the Pentagon has outsourced too much acquisitions responsibility to contractors. The LSI model came under renewed scrutiny recently when the Coast Guard removed Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman as LSIs for the Deep-water programme to replace its ships and aircraft.Mr Krieg said LSI was an “experimental approach” that was still being evaluated, and suggested that many contracts were not that different from more traditional contracts where a prime contractor managed an acquisitions programme.“My point is that there are not a lot of them that are done that way. It was a trendy brand idea, and a lot of prime contractors suddenly branded themselves as LSIs.”Donald Winter, secretary of the Navy, recently criticised the LSI concept in arguing that the Navy should “reassert” itself over acquisition. But Mr Krieg says he was arguing that “we need to be a better buyer and a better manager of the things we buy”.“That is irrespective of contract types,” said Mr Krieg. “So that is back to really managing and overseeing the programmes, and I agree with Secretary Winter on that.”Mr Krieg also dismissed suggestions that the LSI model was the main reason for the burgeoning costs of programmes such as FCS and Deepwater. “The discipline to make an informed choice upfront, and then the discipline to manage the systems correctly over time is more a place where cost growth takes place, more root cause for cost growth than the contracting vehicle like an LSI.”He said an area where the Pentagon has received “well-founded” criticism was for not linking contract awards and incentives to performance, which is another factor that has allowed acquisitions costs to increase.With the annual Pentagon budget running well over half a trillion dollars, and the acquisitions budget growing to over $100bn, some members of Congress have started to advocate fixed-price contracts, which they argue would put more pressure on defence companies to control costs. But Mr Krieg says fixed-price contracts are not always appropriate.“Fixed-price contracts are good when you have started to fix risk. If you have unbounded risk and fixed price that is not a good environment. When you have bounded risk and bounded price that is a good environment,” said Mr Krieg. “And so my general view on it has been to relate the amount of risk you have in the programme and who bears it with the contract type.”He says another reason for rising acquisitions costs is that the Pentagon has often “been willing to enter a programme with technology that was immature, and an optimistic schedule about how we were going to close on that, and then underfunding it”.Some experts have questioned whether the Pentagon will retain the emphasis Donald Rumsfeld, the ousted defence secretary, placed on transformation. Mr Krieg says Robert Gates “has the same view” about the need to transform the military.“The asymmetric world in which we are operating, whether it is asymmetric low or asymmetric high, is the challenge to the historical structure of the department and the capabilities of the department,” said Mr Krieg. “And how we shift that mix over time is just as important to Sec Gates as it is to Rumsfeld.”Defence industry executives believe Mr Krieg is preparing to step down later this year. But his successor – expected to be John Young who recently became his principle deputy – may have to deal with tighter acquisition budgets as the Pentagon comes under increasing pressure because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
268;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-04-24T18:31:10Z;New weapons strategy correct says Lockheed;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor, insisted it was still capable of running large projects outside its usual area of expertise, after high-profile problems in building a new type of warship.Cost overruns on its first Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) prototype have raised doubts about Lockheed’s “adjacent market” strategy, where the company best known for fighter jets and spacecraft has moved aggressively into non-traditional areas such as shipbuilding and helicopters.“I remain convinced the adjacent market approach makes sense to all our stake-holders. We will continue to pursue new lines of business,” said Chris Kubasik, Lockheed’s chief financial officer.His comments came as Lockheed reported a 19 per cent rise in net profits to $690m for the first three months of the year, as higher margins across the business, notably in the F-22 fighter jet programme, offset a flattening in sales.As a result of the LCS overruns, the US Navy tried to force Lockheed to accept a fixed price contract for a second ship, shifting financial risk to the company – an offer declined by Lockheed. The US military usually takes on the risk of developing new weapons, with contractors guaranteed a good return.Mr Kubasik said: “We do not think fixed price contracts are appropriate for development activity because they do not encourage the kind of direct, responsive and collaborative behaviour necessary for success.”Lockheed also defended its performance on the Deepwater programme to modernise the US Coast Guard’s fleet of ships and aircraft, from which Lockheed and Northrop Grumman were recently removed as joint managers. Lockheed argued that its part of the venture, modifying aircraft and implementing information systems, had performed well.Some Pentagon officials want to wrest back control of large weapons programmes from contractors. But Mr Kubasik said it would take at least 10 years for the Pentagon to re-acquire the necessary system integration skills, which were lost when the department slimmed in the 1990s.
269;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-04-23T22:17:57Z;Winter calls for more control;;Donald Winter, US Navy Secretary, is well placed to judge the defence industry as a former Northrop Grumman executive.His recent assessment has been harsh.In a blunt speech to a packed audience of naval officers, Pentagon officials and industry executives in Washington this month, Mr Winter berated companies for not investing enough in shipyards and called on his department to re-establish control over shipbuilding programmes.General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin are the biggest companies involved in warship-building.The department had developed a bad habit of relying too blindly on its contractors, he said.Though he was happy for companies to make profit margins above 15 per cent, his comments put the navy at the forefront of a trend to wrest back more control of complex weapons projects from the large defence contractors, who dominate the US military landscape.
270;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-03-09T02:54:15Z;Boeing chief confident of USAF order;;A $15bn Boeing contract to supply search and rescue helicopters to the US Air Force is unlikely to be resubmitted for competition in spite of the concerns of the main US spending watchdog, the chief executive of the aerospace group has claimed.The comments from Jim McNerney at a lunch in London put Boeing at odds with the Government Accountability Office, which last week said other companies should be allowed to compete for the $15bn deal for 141 helicopters.“I do not think there will be a full-blown re-compete on the helicopter competition,” Mr McNerney said.A new competition could delay the contract by 19 months and lead the USAF to update its requirements, he added.The GAO, an influential voice in Washington, said the way that the USAF had evaluated the life-cycle costs of the helicopters was inconsistent with the approach required under the terms of the competition.It said Boeing’s contract, based on a variant of its CH-47 Chinook helicopter, should be cancelled if it no longer represented the best value to the government.Boeing won the contract late last year against competition from Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky, the helicopter group owned by United Technologies.Lockheed and Sikorsky had both protested against the Boeing award and welcomed the GAO’s findings. On Thursday, Lockheed expressed surprise at Boeing’s comments. “The GAO has recommended the contract be re-competed,” it said.But Douglas Harned, analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in a note to clients that he expected the USAF would stick with Boeing’s Chinook.He said: “Although the procurement process may have been flawed, we believe that the air force ordered the helicopter it wanted, seeing the Chinook as the lowest risk approach.”The controversy comes at a sensitive time for Boeing and the USAF, with their relationship still under scrutiny following a procurement scandal related to air refuelling tankers.A contract for the tankers was cancelled and competition for a new deal, which could be worth more than $100bn, has been started, pitting Boeing against US defence rival, Northrop Grumman, and EADS, the Franco-German aerospace group.Separately, Mr McNerney expected talks to recommence this month between the US and Europe over a dispute related to alleged subsidies at Airbus and Boeing.
271;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-02-12T21:53:37Z;Boeing unveils pitch for USAF tanker contract;;"Boeing confirmed on Monday that it would offer a version of its 767-200 aircraft in competition with the Airbus A330-200 for a US Air Force refuelling contract worth an expected $40bn.The air force is expected to make a decision later this year on replacing the first tranche of its ageing fleet of Boeing-made KC-135 tankers with 179 new aircraft. First deliveries are expected in 2011 or 2012.The US group is pitched against a joint venture between Northrop Grumman, the third-largest US defence group, and EADS, the Franco-German parent of Airbus.Boeing described the USAF tanker fleet as “a national asset” and emphasised the domestic benefits of its proposal, which it claimed would support 44,000 jobs, with aircraft assembled at its Everett facility near Seattle. The Boeing-led team includes Smiths Aerospace, recently acquired by General Electric; Rockwell Collins; Vought Aircraft Industries; Honeywell; and Spirit AeroSystems.Northrop, which confirmed last week that it would take part, would build its tanker at a new facility in Alabama. The contest is viewed by EADS as a key test of its ability to expand its US business and also marks the first major battle between Boeing and Airbus in the military market.The vexed issue of state subsidies, currently the subject of a case to be heard next month at the World Trade Organisation, is not expected to be part of the process after the USAF unexpectedly dropped a requirement to outline state support and any impact from a WTO judgement. “I think the air force answered this in the design matrix,” said Mark McGraw, vice-president of Boeing’s tanker programme.The US and the European Union have been locked in a long-running dispute over government subsidies to the commercial aircraft produced by Boeing and Airbus.The 767-200 is smaller than the A330-200, but Boeing said it offered better operating and efficiency characteristics than other 767 variants and the larger 777, which were also evaluated. A version of the tanker is being developed for the military in Italy and Japan.The 767 has enjoyed a recent resurgence in demand from passenger and cargo carriers, and is effectively sold out until 2012 following a recent large order from UPS. Boeing said it may build a separate line if it wins the air force contract.The USAF order could be expanded to as many as 500 aircraft worth $100bn, and analysts expect Boeing to consider offering its new 787 aircraft as an alternative at a later date, while the proposed Airbus A350XWB could also emerge as a rival contender.Boeing was fined $615m and lost the original tender to provide 767 refuelling aircraft after it emerged that a former defence department official, Darleen Druyan, helped it win the bid before joining the company. Ms Druyan and Mike Sears, Boeing’s former CFO, were both jailed for their role but have since been released."
272;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-02-08T16:18:25Z;Northrop Grumman to bid for tanker deal;;Northrop Grumman on Thursday confirmed it would bid for a $100bn aircraft tanker contract for the US Air Force through a joint venture that will pit the parent of Airbus against arch-rival Boeing in the military market for the first time.The US defence group and EADS, the Franco-German aerospace company, will offer a version of the Airbus A330-200 for the airborne refuelling contract, while Boeing will announce on February 12 whether it will pitch a version of the Boeing 767 or the larger 777.Northrop Grumman, the third-largest US defence contractor, had threatened to drop out of the contest after expressing concern that the bidding criteria set by the Pentagon favoured Boeing.The defence department had said it would proceed with just one bidder, despite the chequered history of the programme to replace the entire fleet of Boeing KC-135 tankers.Boeing was fined $615m and lost the original tanker contract after it emerged that a former defence department official, Darleen Druyan, helped it win the bid before joining the company.Ms Druyan and Mike Sears, Boeing’s former chief financial officer, were both jailed for their roles but have since been released.“After carefully studying the final language in the Air Force’s KC-X request for proposals, we and our team members have determined that the Northrop Grumman KC-30 is a very competitive offering that fully supports the Air Force’s tanker mission,” said the company in a statement.The deal is viewed as crucial for both bidders in terms of their future relations with the US defence department. Boeing is rebuilding relations with its largest customer after a series of procurement scandals, while EADS is looking to expand its relatively small presence in the US market.The air force plans to acquire a fleet of 179 aircraft, which will provide capacity for troop and cargo movements, as well as refuelling capacity.
273;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-01-25T22:30:13Z;Wall Street slumps on higher rates;;"US stocks slumped on Thursday, as concern about rising Treasury bond yields offset better than expected earnings from a number of companies.Interest rates have reached their highest levels since mid-August, and sparked an uneasy mood in stocks after their rally on Wednesday.“The main threat to the bulls appears to be the continuing rise in interest rates,” said Ken Tower, the chief market strategist at CyberTrader.The S&P 500 slumped 1.1 per cent to close at 1,423.90. All 10 industry groups in the index were in negative territory, with energy and financial stocks leading weakness. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9 per cent to close at 12,502.56, after the blue-chip barometer set a record close on Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to finish at 2,434.24, despite a solid rise in Ebay. The online auctioneer rose 8.2 per cent to $32.45 after it beat estimates and raised guidance for the first quarter and 2007 above current forecasts. The stock is up 7.9 per cent so far this year, having lost 30 per cent last year.Shares in Microsoft were down 2.1 per cent at $30.45, as investors awaited its earnings due after the market closed on Thursday. The company beat estimates and had pared most of its losses in after-hours trade.Another big earnings story on Thursday was Ford, which delivered a loss of $5.8bn, or $3.05 a share, for the fourth quarter, increasing its loss for 2006 to $12.7bn; the largest annual loss in its history.Shares in Ford rose 0.2 per cent to $8.22. The stock price had fallen 2.5 per cent in the previous two days. Traders noted results outside North America were better than expected and Ford’s cash burn rate was less than expected as it continued to restructure operations.In deal news, Blackstone increased its offer for Equity Office to $54 a share in cash, raising the proposed buy-out of the office-property landlord to $38.3bn from an original offer of $48.50 a share. The move came in response to a recent $52-a-share offer from a group led by Vornado Realty Trust. Shares in Equity Office were 4.2 per cent higher at $54.90.AT&T was among a handful of gainers in the Dow after it reported a 17 per cent rise in net income from better revenue growth of its wireless and internet units. Shares had pared an earlier rise to $37.70, its highest level since May 2002, and closed up 0.4 per cent at $36.79.Lockheed Martin rose 0.3 per cent to $97.44 after its fourth quarter net income rose 28 per cent. Shares in rival defence contractor Northrop Grumman fell 0.7 per cent to $71.30, as a 37 per cent rise in quarterly profit missed estimates.Dow Chemical fell 0.3 per cent to $41.94, and revesred an earlier rise to $42.68. The company’s 11 per cent drop in fourth quarter net income to 98 cents a share beat estimates."
274;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-01-25T22:22:27Z;Lockheed bullish on defence spending;;Lockheed Martin on Thursday predicted that the new Democratic-controlled Congress would approve increased US defence spending as the world responded to the “uncertain security market” from events such as the recent Chinese anti-satellite test.The world’s largest defence contractor by sales provided the industry’s most bullish assessment to date of future spending trends ahead of the White House budget and supplemental requests being prepared by the Pentagon.“In our judgement, with a $14.2 trillion economy, the nation has a lot to protect, and we might see even more funds flow in,” said Bob Stevens, Lockheed Martin’s chairman and chief executive.Mr Stevens declined to be drawn on whether the recent Chinese destruction of a satellite with a ground-launched rocket would temper the opposition among some Democrats to maintaining spending levels on missiles and space systems, one of his company’s largest businesses.However, he noted that Congress had never failed to provide funding to address what he called “the complexity in the world”, either in the budget or through approving supplemental requests.Some industry executives expect the Pentagon budget to flatten or decline in real terms over the next few years, with companies looking to compensate by improving margins, expanding internationally and diversifying. Lockheed, for example, is the biggest provider of IT services to the US government.Mr Stevens’ remarks came as Lockheed raised its 2007 earnings’ forecast and announced plans to boost margins and raise operating earnings by $1bn by the end of the decade. He pointed to an increased focus on homeland security and law enforcement work in addition to its core aircraft, ship and missiles business, but ruled out any move into commercial aerospace.The company said international sales would start to displace the dominant position of its largest customer, the US defense department. This could include “selective” additions to the eight countries currently in the Joint Strike Fighter programme, now known as the F-35 Lightning II, as well as winning contracts for its fast-growing IT and outsourcing unit.Defence companies are benefiting from record military spending, supplemental budgets for conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and the outsourcing of government services. Shares in Lockheed and Northrop Grumman, which reported a 16 per cent rise in full-year earnings on Thursday, hit all-time highs this week.Lockheed’s earnings per share in 2006 were $5.80, up from $4.10 in the previous year. Yearly operating profit was $3.95bn, up from $3bn.In the fourth quarter, net profit rose to $729m from $568m the year before, with the aeronautics business posting a 32 per cent rise in profits. In November, Lockheed received a $1bn order for an extra 24 F-22s, bringing to 131 the total of the new fighter jets under contract.Yearly sales in aeronautics declined slightly, though earnings rose 18 per cent as sales of the F-22 and the development of the JSF offset fewer deliveries of C-130 military transport aircraft and reduced volume on the F-16.More than half of Lockheed’s revenues and profits now come from its information technology and government services businesses. In the past year, profits in the division rose by 17 per cent on the back of higher sales of naval systems and sensors, air defence programmes and a sharp rise in service revenues.The space systems business, which makes military and commercial satellites, also saw sales and profits rise sharply.At the end of last year, Lockheed and Boeing, the next biggest defence contractor, finalised a joint venture of their space launch businesses, which make expendable rockets to launch satellites. The venture is expected to lead to yearly cost savings of $150m for the two companies.Northrop, which makes warships, nuclear submarines, unmanned aircraft and advanced electronics for fighter jets and other weapons, reported quarterly profit of $453m, up from $331m the year before.Improved margins in information, electronics and ship-building were offset partially by a charge on a radar programme.Earnings for 2006 rose 16 per cent to $4.44 per share, up from $3.83 per share in 2005. Operating profit rose 13 per cent to $1.6bn.
275;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-01-21T20:00:04Z;Partner puts EADS bid in jeopardy;;EADS faces losing a potential $100bn deal to upgrade the US Air Force’s fleet of refuelling aircraft after Northrop Grumman, its US partner, threatened to abandon its bid.A tanker deal, earmarked as the air force’s number one priority, is crucial for the Franco-German aerospace group as it looks to build its business in the lucrative US defence market.But executives at Northrop, the defence company leading the EADS bid team, say they will pull out of the competition unless the air force makes a last-minute amendment to the bidding criteria, which they argue favours a rival bid from Boeing.The Northrop/EADS tanker is based on the Airbus A330, which is bigger than the rival Boeing 767 offering and able to perform multiple functions.However, the Airbus aircraft are more expensive individually and the air force has indicated that it will make its decision based primarily on cost.Northrop has argued that a price-based contest does not take into account the extra capacity of its larger aircraft and the fact they could carry more fuel, cargo and troops.“If the capabilities-to-cost evaluation metrics aren’t included in the final proposal,” Northrop said on Friday, “we will not bid.”An executive on the Northrop/EADS team said the consortium would not be used merely as a “stalking horse” to provide competition for Boeing.The air force has countered that it will be able to afford fewer aircraft if it buys the A330 and that they will not be appropriate for some smaller foreign airfields.The air force was hoping to send the “request for proposals” to the bidders this week although industry executives speculated that this could be pushed back until the end of the month.Even if Northrop decides to drop its bid, leaving Boeing as sole bidder, the political wrangling over the contract could drag on for months.The tanker contest has been mired in controversy from the outset.Boeing was chosen originally to supply a fleet of 100 new tankers in 2001 but the contract was cancelled after a procurement scandal.Senator John McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Forces Committee and possible presidential candidate, was a driving force behind the investigation into that deal and is keen that the competition remains open.
276;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2007-01-17T08:33:20Z;Global defence outlook;;At a Pentagon dinner in 1993, US defence industry executives were warned to consolidate or die ahead of budget cuts. That “last supper”, as the event became known, seems a long way off now. Since September 11 2001, the FTSE global aerospace and defence industry index has returned almost 90 per cent in dollar terms, beating global equities’ rise of about 60 per cent. From its traditional hefty discount to the market, the global sector now commands a 15 per cent premium on multiples of both earnings and book value.Despite recent outperformance and earnings upgrades, investors should be getting nervous. First, profit levels are becoming punchy. Return on equity for the global sector has risen to 16 per cent, compared with an average since 1993 of 12 per cent. For the biggest stocks, such as Lockheed Martin and the UK’s BAE Systems, return on equity is running at well over 20 per cent. Unlike the stock market as a whole, it is easy to see how high returns might normalise for the defence industry. Most contracts are supposed to be priced at a small premium to cost. Sooner or later, customers – usually companies’ respective governments – may ask questions about value for money.Second, demand could slow if the US, accounting for half of global defence spending, becomes more isolationist after the Bush presidency. Last March, the Department of Defense forecast an 8 per cent real fall in its budget to $463bn for the year to October 2007. But include the huge “supplemental” budgets used to fund Iraq and Afghanistan, and total spending could rise by up to 17 per cent year-on-year to $652bn, says the International Institute for Strategic Studies.The lesson of Vietnam and Korea is that when wars end, spending falls sharply. Today, trophy projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter are hard to abandon. But the size of companies’ secure order books should not be overstated. In December 2005, Lockheed, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon had a combined backlog equal to 24 months of sales. Without a new US war, defence stocks look vulnerable.
277;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;EADS woos US to go where the money is;;EADS will never have the natural advantages of BAE Systems when it comes to establishing a foothold in the US defence market.Whereas the British company has the special trans-atlantic relationship to smooth its path, the Franco-German aerospace group has the handicap of a shareholder roster still shaped largely by national interest.Yet in spite of this, EADS has embarked on a concerted push to force its way into the world’s most lucrative military market.“It’s the same as if you asked someone in the old west why they robbed banks,” says Ralph Crosby, chief executive of EADS North America. “Because that’s where the money is.”And as Tom Enders, the German co-chief executive in charge of the company’s defence business, points out, EADS does own Airbus, the only alternative to Boeing in the provision of large aircraft.At the same time, some powerful US politicians are eager to push competition in weapons procurement, something that could benefit EADS.Senator John McCain, member of the Senate armed forces committee and possible Republican presidential candidate, was a driving force behind the earlier investigation into a former deal with Boeing to supply 100 tanker aircraft, based on the 767 passenger jet. The deal was eventually pulled and Senator McCain remains alert to making sure the competition remains open.As an example, the air force decided this year to ask Boeing and Airbus to highlight the possible financial implications from a World Trade Organisation dispute between the US and Europe when submitting their bids.The WTO dispute centres on accusations of state support for both companies, but its inclusion as an issue in the tanker contest could have favoured Boeing.However, last week a senior air force official said the WTO case would not have a bearing on the contest.EADS has also been canny about its bid location, choosing the state of Alabama as the home for its manufacturing site if it wins.Alabama has benefited from being the home site for Toyota and Hyundai car plants, and its local and state-level politicians are aggressive about promoting its interests.EADS officials also say they intend to build more than 60 per cent of each aircraft by value in the US, as they seek to counter the “Buy America” lobby epitomised by Duncan Hunter, the influential Republican Congressman from California.Regardless of these efforts, Boeing has a strong position in the US industrial landscape and any decision to award such a lucrative deal to a European competitor would be a shock.The air force could soften the blow by awarding a support contract to the loser of the main deal, and future orders of tanker aircraft, beyond the original 179 aircraft, will be put out to competition again.Boeing will also benefit from a Democrat-led Congress. Sam Adcock, head of government relations at EADS North America, says: “Boeing has very large numbers of US employees, most of whom are US labour union members. I do not think for a second that we can ‘outdemocrat’ Boeing.”Meanwhile, EADS executives have, though, been offered assurances that they are not just being used as a “stalking horse” to keep pressure on Boeing .The presence of Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor, alongside EADS adds valuable lobbying expertise. EADS has also teamed up with Raytheon, another “prime” US defence contractor, to take part in a $6bn cargo aircraft bid, after winning a $2bn-$3bn army helicopter supply contract this year in its first big Pentagon deal.
278;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-12-14T22:16:31Z;EADS says Paris stake hurting US move;;Attempts by EADS to break into the lucrative US defence market are being hampered by the French government’s 15 per cent stake in the European aerospace group, according to its German co-chief executive.Speaking at the launch of a military helicopter for the US Army this week, the first big Pentagon contract for EADS, Tom Enders said the “government shareholding is not conducive to doing business in the US”.EADS, in common with its European peers, is desperate to win a greater share of the $450bn a year US defence budget and is competing with Boeing to supply a fleet of air refuelling tankers that could eventually be worth more than $100bn.But US executives at EADS fear the perception of state intervention in the company’s affairs plays into the hands of political opponents and lobbyists pushing a “buy America” agenda.The comments from Mr Enders will be contentious because they suggest that German interference in EADS is less of a worry than French meddling. “I don’t know of any German government shareholding in EADS,” he said.French and German interests in the aerospace group are safeguarded by a delicate balancing act, where France owns 15 per cent directly and controls another 7.5 per cent through Lagardère, the media group.DaimlerChrysler, the German carmaker, owns 22.5 per cent. Germany’s desire to keep the balance was highlighted recently when it lined up a group of German banks to buy a 7.5 per cent EADS stake that Daimler wants to sell.EADS is eager to build its defence business to bring it more in line with Boeing, which makes about half its sales from passenger aircraft and half from defence.Boeing and EADS, which has teamed up with Northrop Grumman, a leading Pentagon contractor, are locked in a fierce competition to supply 179 new tanker aircraft, the US Air Force’s priority procurement programme.The deal is expected to be worth about $10bn initially, but support and maintenance revenues would lift this sharply.The tanker contract had been in danger of becoming entangled in a WTO dispute between the US and Europe over state subsidies for Boeing and Airbus aircraft. But the US Air Force has said a WTO settlement would have no bearing on the deal.
279;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-11-10T21:30:54Z;Wall St edges higher helped by deals, earnings;;US stocks were caught in several cross-currents during the week as earnings, deals and likely repercussions from the mid-term Congressional elections were digested by investors.The main indices rose modestly, led by the Nasdaq Composite, which was helped by a surge in earnings from technology giant Cisco, up 12.5 per cent over the week at $26.74.With the Democrats claiming control of the House of Representatives for the first time since 1994 and narrowly gaining a majority in the Senate, equity investors focused on the likely winners and losers under a new Congress.“It’s uncertain just how much specific regulation or actions will be imposed by the Democrats,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “While investor concern is well founded, congressional gridlock will likely hold sweeping changes at bay.”Early indications were that losers could include companies in the pharmaceutical and defence sectors, while labour conditions at Wal-Mart, down 2.2 per cent at $46.47, and a rise in the minimum wage are also likely to attract the attention of lawmakers.The winners are expected to include alternative energy and stem cell research companies along with the Government housing agencies that made gains over the week. Fannie Mae, up 3.6 per cent at $60.38, and Freddie Mac, up 2.2 per cent at $69.48, capitalised on expectations of less onerous regulation.In contrast, investors sold down the healthcare sector and big defence companies this week. The New York Stock Exchange Healthcare index rose 1.7 per cent early in the week ahead of the elections but tumbled after the election results.

281;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-10-31T19:58:48Z;Germany’s EADS fudge won’t taste good in US;;DaimlerChrysler is a strange company. As the German core shareholder in EADS, you would expect it to do all it can to promote more stability in the troubled European aerospace group. Instead, it is managing to unsettle it even more by sending strong signals it wants to cut its stake in EADS from 22.5 per cent to 15 per cent as soon as possible.Daimler has clearly indicated to the German government it wants to sell, possibly as early as next year.Indeed, the German and French co-chief executives of EADS are due to hold talks on Friday with the German chancellor Angela Merkel. The issue is not just how to fix Airbus, but how to maintain Franco-German parity in the management and control of the group.In the background, Russian interests, represented through Vneshtorgbank’s 5 per cent stake in EADS, are nagging away for more power.The easy solution proposed by Berlin is for the state-owned KfW bank to pick up the Daimler stake. After all, the French government already owns a stake in EADS.But Daimler argues that such a move risks undermining EADS’s chances of pulling off a key US defence deal next year. American opponents would argue EADS was being “nationalised” and should be blocked.EADS has teamed up with Northrop Grumman to bid against Boeing for the US Air Force’s massive air-refuelling tankers and transport aircraft renewal programme. The Pentagon is due to award by next summer the initial contract of a programme with a potential value of $100bn over 30 years.This would be transformational for EADS and a terrific boost after all its troubles. Small wonder Daimler is insisting private German shareholders buy the 7.5 per cent stake. The problem is that private shareholders are not interested.So the government is trying to come up with a fudge whereby the private shareholders would be given a state guarantee from the KfW bank for their EADS holding. Who are they fooling? Not the Americans.Difficult cohabitationItalian finance is at a crossroads. A new generation of younger, reforming bankers is increasingly challenging these days the old recidivist order that has dominated postwar Italian banking. Nowhere is this more evident than at Capitalia where the two extremes live under the same roof. For the past five years, Cesare Geronzi, the bank’s veteran chairman, has cohabitated with his youthful chief executive Matteo Arpe. The younger man was entrusted with reviving what at the time was regarded as a leper in the Italian banking system.His performance with the young team of managers he recruited has been impressive. The Roman bank has been transformed, its shares have risen by 720 per cent over the past four years, nearly 40 per cent of its stock is now held by international funds and foreign banks are said to be circling.The problem is that cohabitation is becoming difficult. For Mr Geronzi increasingly seems to regard this success as a threat to his own shrinking power base.So he is suggesting expanding the bank’s current shareholder pact to other old dinosaurs such as Silvio Berlusconi’s Fininvest and Salvatore Ligresti’s FondiariaSai insurance group – the idea being to prevent the bank falling into foreign hands.Much of the takeover talk for now seems nothing more than scaremongering. Whenever consolidation does happen, the bank’s new generation of managers has shown it is perfectly capable of looking after the best interests of the bank and its shareholders.Consumer angstExplaining German consumer reticence – official data yesterday showed retail sales fell in September below the level a year earlier – is not easy. For many economists, the German consumption “rocket” should already have ignited. German exports were the first to lift off, investment is currently booming and employment is rising. Consumption should have followed as a logical consequence.Hans-Joachim Körber, chief executive of Metro, Germany’s largest retailer, put his finger on the missing link, commenting that Germans remained “very sceptical . . . they know a planned tax increase (VAT rises by three percentage points in January) and changes to the health system will cost them money.”The European Central Bank has long suspected Germans of “Ricardian” tendencies – the greater their angst about public finances and the future of welfare provision, the lower their inclination to spend. And anecdotal evidence supports such theories. Shopping is no national pastime in Germany.The good news is that Berlin is getting more of a grip on public finances, which, if the theory is correct, should feed through eventually into stronger consumption. The bad news is that the sense of overall political drift in Berlin, where the two main political parties are in uneasy coalition, is unlikely to disappear anytime soon. ralph.atkins@ft.com
282;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-10-29T22:05:48Z;L-3 chief charts steady course;;The name L-3 Communications is derived from the initials of two of its founders, Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta, and Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that has provided much of the financing for its prodigious growth spurt.The death of Mr Lanza in June has signalled a pause for breath, meaning it is unlikely to deploy capital anywhere near as aggressively as in the past.Michael Strianese, who has taken on the chief executive role, says he can maintain a steady double-digit growth through organic expansion and fewer acquisitions. He also says the company is not seeking a buyer, even though offers would be entertained.Last year’s $2.6bn acquisition of Titan, an IT specialist, has left the company well covered in the government services market, an increasingly important sector for defence companies looking to reduce their exposure to military equipment budgets.L-3 made $2.2bn in sales from government services in the nine months to September, up from $1.1bn last year as a result of the Titan purchase.In common with the rest of its defence peers, L-3 remains keen to acquire more businesses for its battlefield communications and information division, where sales in the nine months to September grew from $1.5bn to $2.1bn.It is this “battlespace” systems and sensors area of the business that most interests possible acquirers, though as Mr Strianese concedes, potential purchasers are less enamoured of its “specialised products” division. This unit contains a hugely diverse range of businesses from traffic collision avoidance systems to microwave components and antennas.This unwieldy structure and the autonomous way L-3’s separate businesses operate are among the reasons Mr Strianese, still acting as finance director at L-3 until a successor is found, was preferred to an external candidate, who may have found L-3’s complex finances and “family style” approach difficult to fathom.Mr Strianese said he would make it a priority to bring the separate businesses closer together and said only “very special” companies would be considered for acquisition, particularly in the specialised products division.However, he pointed out that specialised products was home to companies making the highest margins at L-3.The company has also been expanding into the UK in the area of battlefield electronics and communications following the recent purchase of TRL, an electronic warfare specialist. L-3 has set up a London-based subsidiary, L-3 UK, headed by Ron Cook, a former director of procurement at the Ministry of Defence in battlefield systems.The UK government has said it is relaxed about US companies owning British defence manufacturers, as long as the intellectual property for key weapons systems, and the workforce building them, remains in the country.Mr Strianese said L-3 was actively pursuing more UK defence electronics acquisitions, although it will face competition from bigger US rivals such as Boeing and Northrop Grumman.
283;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-10-29T22:05:48Z;L-3 signals end of acquisition spree;;L-3 Communications, the world’s biggest defence electronics manufacturer, has signalled an end to years of frenetic acquisition activity and indicated it would be open to takeover approaches.In an interview with the Financial Times, Michael Strianese, who was appointed chief executive of L-3 last week, stressed he was not actively marketing the company and had not received approaches but said it was the board’s duty to consider any bids.New York-based L-3 has been the subject of takeover speculation since its 74-year-old founder, Frank Lanza, died in June.Mr Lanza, an inveterate dealmaker and one of the most high-profile executives in the defence industry, built the company from scratch, starting with the acquisition of 10 unwanted defence electronics businesses from Lockheed Martin in 1997. L-3 is now the next largest Pentagon contractor behind the big five of Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon.The company now finds itself in a potential sweet spot of military spending, with bigger companies coveting many of its defence electronics units, particularly in the crucial area of battlefield information and communication systems.Military equipment budgets are likely to come under growing pressure in the next few years, with more dollars being spent on maintaining existing weapons or upgrading them with new technology rather than developing new “platforms” such as fighter jets, warships and armoured vehicles.Since its inception, L-3’s sales have grown an average of 35 per cent each year, with about 25 per cent of that coming from acquisitions.Mr Strianese, L-3’s finance director before succeeding Mr Lanza as chief executive, said he expected that growth would slow considerably in the next few years, to about 7.5 per cent a year from organic growth and 7.5 per cent from acquisitions. The company has a $9.7bn market value and expected sales of about $12.4bn this year.“Continuing to grow the company at a rate of $10bn at a time is not going to be productive,” Mr Strianese said. “Growing so rapidly over the past nine years has been a huge success but it also meant that focusing on synergies was not the priority.”L-3 is made up of more than 80 often disparate businesses, one of the reasons that makes it difficult for potential suitors, which include BAE Systems of the UK, to put together a bid.Mr Strianese admitted the company was often perceived as a “loose confederation of companies acting independently. But that has to change at the size we are now.”
284;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
285;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-10-24T18:25:25Z;US defence;;Frustration may be spreading on many fronts in the war on terror. For now, however, investors in defence contractors have not shared the pain. Over the past 12 months, returns in US aerospace and defence shares have beaten the broader market by 10 percentage points. Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor, has done even better, with returns of 45 per cent, almost three times those of the S&P 500.Lockheed’s latest results – along with those of Northrop Grumman, best known for its warships – provide some ammunition for defence enthusiasts but also suggest a need for caution. Even after stripping out one-off gains, Lockheed once again beat earnings expectations in the third quarter. That is all the more impressive given that analysts’ forecasts have been steadily rising. However, revenues were up just 6.7 per cent at Lockheed and were even weaker at Northrop.At least both benefited from rising operating margins. Changes in product mix were partly responsible for this, with Lockheed’s recent focus on IT in particular starting to pay off. Mainly, however, defence contractors seem to be getting better at squeezing higher profits out of a slow-growing sales base.Operating leverage, however, can be a bit of a double-edged sword when the bulk of revenues are dependent on a single customer. At Lockheed, about 85 per cent of 2005 sales were to the US government, with another 13 per cent to foreign governments (including those funded by the US). But growth in overall US defence spending is likely to slow and calls for more boots on the ground instead of high-tech gear are on the rise. Add the prospect of a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections and pressures on the Pentagon and other federal agencies to get a bigger bang for their buck are set to increase.
286;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-10-12T18:12:42Z;German government eyes EADS stake;;The German government is ready to take a stake next year in European aerospace company EADS to protect national interests if carmaker DaimlerChrysler decides, as expected, to cut its holding from 22.5 per cent to 15 per cent.After a regular meeting of the French and German cabinets in Paris, Angela Merkel, chancellor, said she had “not ruled anything out” when it came to Daimler’s wish to cut its stake in the Franco-German dominated group.Government officials said state-owned bank KfW was now preparing a contract that would be ready to sign from the end of the year.Officials said the chancellery, finance and industry ministries in Berlin had ironed out differences and now all backed the option to buy the 7.5 per cent stake – worth €1.3bn ($1.6bn) – in the parent of troubled aircraft maker Airbus.“We don’t want that stake to end up in the hands of [French President Jacques] Chirac or [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” one official said in reference also to the Russian government’s interest in having a say in the group.The Berlin administration’s deliberations come at a sensitive time for EADS. It has joined US defence company Northrop Grumman to bid against rival Boeing to secure a huge order for about 200 tanker planes for the US Air Force.Aware that US lawmakers might object to an apparent “nationalisation” of EADS, officials stressed Berlin would only keep its stake until France cut its 22.5 per cent stake or a private German investor was finally found.The KfW option is considered less than ideal. But officials said it reflected the fact that the chances of finding a private investor are slim. Berlin has failed so far to persuade German companies to buy in to EADS.As a result, Berlin would not demand a further board seat, being represented by Manfred Bischoff, the Daimler executive and co-chairman of EADS’ board – much as his counterpart Arnaud Lagardère bundles French interests.Since the founding of EADS, Daimler’s stake has always matched those of the French government and French media company Lagardère, a construction designed to guarantee equal influence for both national governments.Recent ructions at Airbus about delays to the A380 passenger aircraft and rumours that production could move from Hamburg to Toulouse have not improved relations between the two nations that dominate EADS.In addition, the Russian government controls a 5 per cent stake in the aerospace group through a state-owned bank and is lobbying for a seat on the board – something rejected by EADS and the French and German governments.
287;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-04-25T17:16:59Z;Lockheed prospers on US arms build up;;Lockheed Martin profits rose 60 per cent in the first three months of 2006 as the world’s biggest defence company continued to take advantage of growing US military budgets.Northrop Grumman, its US rival, also beat analyst expectations, though first quarter profits fell 12 per cent to $358m, largely because of damage at its Gulf coast shipyards caused by Hurricane Katrina.The strong performance recently by all the major US contractors - Lockheed, General Dynamics, Northrop, Boeing and Raytheon - has pushed defence shares to fresh highs. It has also generated huge cash piles at the companies, raising expectations for further consolidation of the industry.Net income at Lockheed rose to $591m, or $1.34 a share, from $369m, or 83 cents, in the same period last year. The higher figure included a $150m contribution for share disposals in a satellite company and the sale of space imaging assets.Sales rose 8.6 per cent to $9.21bn.Operating profits rose across each of Lockheed’s businesses in the quarter, but most markedly in its electronics division, boosted by the contribution from air defence, training and maritime systems. The company also recently won a $2bn contract from the US air force to develop a secure global communications network.Lockheed, like many of its peers, is also pushing into the lucrative provision of IT services to federal government departments. It won a contract in the first quarter to shift the FBI from a paper-based to an electronic case management system.Profits at Lockheed’s space business also rose sharply, to $193m from $153m. This was because of bigger sales of government satellites, ballistic missile systems and missile defence activities.Growth at the aerospace business was held back by lower sales of F-16 fighter jets and fewer C-130J deliveries. But profits still rose from $222m to $240m because of higher volumes on the F-22 and F-35 programmes.Northrop, which makes B-2 stealth bombers and nuclear submarines, managed to lift operating profit at its information systems, electronics and aerospace divisions. But profits fell sharply in naval ship-building because of Katrina and less work on the DD(X) programme to build a new destroyer for the US navy.L-3 Communications, the defence electronics group, reported quarterly profit of $138.9m, compared with $102.4 million, a year ago.
288;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-04-07T19:09:21Z;BAE unlikely to pick big US targets;;The prospect of BAE Systems building a £5bn ($8.7bn) acquisition war chest and parking its tanks on the lawns of big US rivals may have a certain appeal to UK patriots.In reality, the US ambitions of Britain’s biggest defence company are likely to be more mundane.BAE broke into the top tier of Pentagon suppliers last year with the $4.2bn purchase of United Defense Industries, maker of the US army’s Bradley fighting vehicles.The possible £3bn proceeds from the sale of its 20 per cent stake in Airbus to EADS provide the firepower to strike similar sized deals. Merrill Lynch, the investment bank, argues that with its strong balance sheet BAE could have more than £5bn to spend.But BAE executives are cautious, and while US deals are wanted, expensive acquisitions are unlikely – for now at least. “They will probably use the money over time on smaller transactions,” says one person close to the company. “And any transactions will probably be smaller than the UDI deal, though things can change.”BAE bought UDI relatively cheaply but since then the values of US defence companies have soared. Big US rivals – Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon – also have cash to spend.BAE has said it is not interested in acquiring L3 Communications, a defence electronics specialist with a $10bn market value, because the “numbers do not add up”. But even smaller US defence groups valued in BAE’s £500m-£2bn target range command racy price to earnings ratios.The company is looking to buy smaller defence electronics specialists, but is also building a presence in the more prosaic area of IT contracting for US government departments, an increasingly lucrative business. In 2004, it paid $600m for DigitalNet, a computer network provider to the Pentagon and other federal agencies, and similar low-key deals are probable.“The US targets are not likely to be names which are clearly on our radar screens, in much the same way as the DigitalNet acquisition,” says Ben Fidler, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.BAE executives insist the Airbus disposal was driven by the timing being right for an exit rather than to provide funds for any specific acquisition.But this could leave them with a large unused cash pile unless they identify targets quickly that will not destroy value. That could stretch investor patience.“It will take a little while to spend the Airbus cash and pressure will grow on BAE management to return money to shareholders if it takes a long time,” says Mr Fidler. “If they did return money, they could always launch a subsequent rights issue if they needed cash at a later stage for an acquisition.”The Airbus stake sale will initially dilute BAE earnings by between 15 and 20 per cent. But the positive reaction of the London market on Friday showed investors were expecting the sale and were comfortable with BAE’s strategy to reuse the funds on its US acquisition strategy. BAE’s shares, which have risen 60 per cent in the past year, rose 4½p to 435½p.The dilution could also put on hold any plans by BAE to sell out of more of its European joint ventures.A statement on Friday from Mike Turner, BAE’s chief executive, highlighted his strategic goal to “be the premier transatlantic defence and aerospace company with a strong footprint in both the UK and US”. He failed conspicuously to mention Europe, where BAE owns 37.5 per cent of MBDA, the missile company, and 20.5 per cent of Saab, the Swedish fighter-jet maker.EADS, which also owns 37.5 per cent of MBDA, is keen to buy out BAE and Finmeccanica, the Italian defence group that owns 25 per cent of the missile group.However, an industry source says an MBDA deal is now less likely in the short term because BAE will be reluctant to reduce its group earnings any further after the Airbus sale.And while the Airbus sale allows BAE to exit at a good time from a non-core business, MBDA is more central to BAE’s ongoing strategy. Britain’s Ministry of Defence would also be worried about BAE selling out of the UK missiles business.The acquisition of BAE’s Airbus stake could also hold back further any plans by EADS to bid for Thales, the French defence electronics specialist.EADS had €5.5bn ($6.6bn) of net cash at the end of last year, but much of this will be spent on the Airbus stake. While an EADS/Thales deal would not unduly worry BAE because of its own strategic US focus, the prospect of a much enlarged competitor on its doorstep would present challenges.Thales has a strong relationship with the MoD, and BAE would resist any threat to its domestic dominance.BAE had threatened to pull out of the UK because of its troubled relationship with the MoD, but a recent government white paper heralding BAE as the UK’s contractor of choice in “air, land and sea” has repaired the damage.It is considering a joint bid with VT Group for Babcock International, where it could emerge as the owner of most of Britain’s naval shipyards.Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at the Teal group, says BAE’s plans to sell its Airbus stake would be received well in the US.“It removes the negative sentiment about BAE being a tool of European government economic policy.”Additional reporting by Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington
289;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-04-06T23:31:12Z;BAE builds up its dealmaking firepower;;BAE Systems, Britain’s biggest defence company, has made no secret of its ambition to expand further in the US and the sale of its Airbus stake to EADS, the Franco-German defence company, will give it more firepower to do deals.The company has in recent years been exiting its European businesses and looking to form an ever-closer relationship with the US defence department, the highest-spending military customer in the world.In its annual results presentation in February, Mike Turner, BAE’s chief executive and architect of its US-dominated strategy, said he was keen to buy more US companies following last year’s $4.2bn (£2.4bn) purchase of United Defense Industries, the armoured vehicle maker.The UDI deal was the biggest acquisition in BAE’s history and made it the sixth-largest defence contractor in the US - one level below the big five: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon.At the same time, it has sold its UK avionics business to Finmeccanica of Italy and a German naval electronics business to ThyssenKrupp, the German industrial group, and EADS.According to Mr Tuner, BAE had even considered pulling out of its home market in the UK because of its unhappy relationship with the Ministry of Defence.But times have changed and a recent UK government white paper has established BAE as the partner of choice for the MoD across “air, land and sea”.Where the UK was the most open defence market in the world to international competition, it will now do more to protect BAE as its national champion.Mr Turner is glad that the new spirit of rapprochement should guarantee his company margins of about 8 per cent from what remains its biggest customer. But this pales by comparison with the 15 per cent defence companies expect to make in the US.Hence, while BAE is happy with its position on the Eurofighter, with a huge new deal expected with Saudi Arabia, it continues to see its most attractive growth prospects in the US.In a meeting with analysts last week, BAE’s US management team said it did not need to make more big acquisitions to gain scale because the UDI deal had provided it with a perfect political “footprint” with the DoD.Through UDI, BAE makes the Bradley fighting vehicle used by US armed forces and is heavily involved in creating the next generation of fighting vehicles.Some speculation has centred on a possible bid for L3 Communications, a US defence electronics specialist. But it has a $10bn (£6bn) market value and US BAE executives said such a deal would be too expensive and not earnings enhancing.Some experts feel BAE is more likely to make further bolt-on acquisitions in the £1bn-£2bn range, but with the Airbus cash in its pocket maybe its ambitions will grow.
290;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-02-02T18:19:38Z;Raytheon profits up 13% in busy defence season;;Raytheon, the world’s largest maker of missiles, on Thursday announced better-than-expected profits of $276m for the fourth quarter, closing out an earnings season for the US’s largest defence contractors that saw all five of the Pentagon’s leading arms manufacturers post impressive gains.Raytheon’s fourth quarter profits were up 13 per cent on 2004 levels, and its revenues for the quarter were up 9 per cent to $6.2bn. For the year, Raytheon earned $871m on $21.9bn in sales.Although Raytheon is the smallest of the so-called Big Five Pentagon contractors, it has benefited from the continuing rise in US defence spending along with its bigger competitors, all of whom in the last week reported strong revenue and earnings improvement in 2005.The strong performance has pushed shares in all the major US contractors – Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Boeing and Raytheon – to at least three-year highs, and has generated huge cash piles for several of the companies, raising expectations for another round of industry consolidation.The industry has also been buoyed by the Pentagon’s decision – expected to be confirmed next week, when it unveils its 2007 budget – not to kill any of the large weapons programmes that were subject to intense cost-cutter scrutiny over recent months as part of the departments’ sweeping quadrennial defence review.Although Raytheon was less vulnerable than the other prime contractors since it makes fewer of the large, high-cost platforms that came under scrutiny, it is a leading subcontractor on several programmes that were thought to be at risk, including the US navy’s new destroyer, called DD(X).Raytheon’s gains came in almost all its business divisions, including its high-profile missile unit, which saw revenues jump 11 per cent to $1.1m in the fourth quarter thanks to the rollout of its latest upgrade for the US navy’s Tomahawk cruise missile. Earnings in the unit climbed 4 per cent to $118m.The company’s defence electronics and sensors division performed the strongest, posting $154m earnings on $1bn in sales. The profits were a 29 per cent increase on a year earlier, an improvement the company said was due to sales overseas and improved performance in domestic programmes.
291;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-01-27T23:32:37Z;Airbus ‘fit to bid for US tanker contract’;;Airbus, the European aerospace group, should be capable of participating in any competition to supply the US air force with air-to-air refuelling tankers, a Pentagon-commissioned study says.Norm Dicks, a Democratic congressman whose Washington state district includes a facility owned by US rival Boeing, said a study by Rand, the think-tank, had determined that both Boeing and Airbus would be in a position to offer suitable aircraft to replace the existing ageing fleet of refuelling tankers. Former senior air force officials at one time said Airbus did not have aircraft to meet the requirements of the air force.Mr Dicks, one of a number of lawmakers briefed on the study, said it concluded that the Pentagon should replace the existing fleet of air-to-air refuelling tankers with a fleet of either medium- to large-sized aircraft or a combination of aircraft. He indicated that the study concluded that Boeing’s 767, 777, 787 and 747 aircraft, or Airbus’s A-330 and A-340, were capable of meeting the air force’s requirements.Boeing initially won a contract to supply the air force with 100 tankers. But Congress cancelled the deal after Darleen Druyun, a former senior air force procurement official, admitted boosting the price of the deal as a gift to Boeing. Ms Druyun, who went to work for Boeing after leaving the air force, served nine months in prison last year for holding illegal job talks with Boeing. Michael Sears, the former Boeing chief financial officer, was sentenced to four months for his role in the scandal.The Pentagon is expected to decide this year whether to proceed with another tanker competition. European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) has teamed up with Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor, to participate in any future competition. EADS previously suggested that the Pentagon should split any contract between competitors.
292;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-01-25T13:38:59Z;Armoured vehicles drive General Dynamics earnings;;General Dynamics, the US defence giant, on Wednesday announced better-than-expected earnings and revenue growth in the fourth quarter thanks in part to a strong global demand for armoured vehicles.The company said its fourth quarter earnings from its continuing operations hit $406m, up 23 per cent from the $330m posted in 2004. Revenues for the quarter were $5.8bn, up from $5.2bn from a year earlier.Nicholas Chabraja, General Dynamics chief executive, said the growth came in all four of the company’s business divisions, including its civilian aerospace unit, making of Gulfstream executive jets, which increased revenue by 13 per cent in the fourth quarter.But he said the strongest sales growth came in its combat systems division, the unit which makes armoured vehicles including the US army’s iconic Abrams tank, which posted a 23 per cent sales increase to $1.4bn.General Dynamics also announced a substantial cash position for the quarter and the year, much like other US defence groups, including Northrop Grumman which on Tuesday said it had accumulated a $2.5bn cash pile in 2005. General Dynamics said its free cash flow from operations hit $1.8bn in 2005.The accumulation of cash by large defence groups has led to speculation that another wave of consolidation is in the offing. General Dynamics has already announced a $2.2bn takeover of defence technology group Anteon last month.Despite the strong earnings, General Dynamics gave guidance for 2006 which was slightly below analyst expectations, saying it expected to post earnings per share of between $7.80 and $7.85. For the year, the company said it had posted $21.2bn in revenues, up from $19.1bn a year earlier, and $1.5bn in earnings, up from $1.2bn.Like other US defence companies, General Dynamics is awaiting the 2007 Pentagon budget, expected to be unveiled early next month. Although analysts have raised the expectation that a range of weapons programmes could be killed or scaled back, General Dynamics is not expected to be amongst those hard hit.Because it is the US’s leading maker of armoured vehicles, which have been heavily used in Iraq, the Pentagon budget could help the company’s performance, since it is expected to show continued investment in maintaining and upgrading the army’s land systems.The company’s most vulnerable programme, the US navy’s new destroyer called DD(X), has also been given recent contract awards, leading many to believe the programme will be spared the budget-cutters’ knife.
293;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-01-24T16:58:25Z;Keeping the know-how of a retiring generation;;"If the average age of the scientists in your company’s R&D department is 48, surely there is no need to worry yet about losing expertise if one of them retires? Wrong, says David DeLong: “I want to know which of the key people are 56, 58 or 60 – who is getting ready to walk out the door.”Mr DeLong, a consultant and research fellow at MIT’s AgeLab and author of a book* on the implications of an ageing workforce, is one of several experts urging organisations to work harder at ensuring that the knowledge held only in employees’ heads is not lost when they leave the company or retire.It is not just the ageing workforce that organisations need to bear in mind, experts say. Over the next few years, the oldest of the 76m to 78m US baby-boomers will reach retirement age, and the post-second world war population bulge is repeated elsewhere.Stir in other demographic trends, such as the falling birth rate in some European countries, and that ought to be enough stimulus for organisations to recognise the need to capture and retain the knowledge and expertise that is never written down – one of the main aims of a set of practices known as knowledge management (KM).“For a long time KM has been a solution looking for a problem, and it has finally found it,” says Mr DeLong.Judging by a global study** of 1,400 workers aged between 40 and 50, conducted last year by Accenture, the experts have failed so far to instil a sense of urgency. Nearly four in 10 respondents said their organisations did not have a formal process and/or tools for capturing their workplace knowledge.When it comes to retiring, 27 per cent said they expected to be let go without any transfer of knowledge and only 17 per cent expected an intensive, months-long process of knowledge transfer. “There was not a lot of clear focus about how to capture the knowledge in people’s heads,” says Peter Cheese, global head of Accenture’s human performance practice.Many companies are aware of the demographic issues but not sure how concerned they should be. “There is a specific worry, but there is still a lot of debate across the organisation,” says Scott Shaffar, director of knowledge management at Northrop Grumman’s integrated systems business. “Is it a crisis, or something that will gradually affect us – because it is really hard to predict when the baby-boomers are going to retire given the changing financial conditions that are out there.”Northrop Grumman is very similar to many other aerospace companies and to some of its customers, says Mr Shaffar, as a large proportion of its workforce are baby-boomersUnfortunately, implementing effective KM has been a task beyond many companies, in part because they have put too much faith in IT as a solution. Mr Cheese says the technology has not been flexible enough to support the very real challenges of KM, and companies have often focused on technologies that act like libraries – giving a structure and taxonomy to corporate information – when KM is really about tacit knowledge retained by individual employees.This “social context of knowledge” is often overlooked, says Eric Lesser, an expert in human capital issues at IBM Business Consulting Services and author of a report*** on ageing workforce issues.“Performance in highly competitive marketplaces requires workers armed with knowledge that goes beyond the explicit information contained in manuals and databases. There is an increasing need to tap into the experience, intuition and social networks of employees,” says Mr Lesser.What Mr Cheese calls the “touchy-feely stuff” is every bit as important as IT in achieving this. “Technology can enable and help, but if a company does not have a culture of knowledge sharing and collaboration, all the technology in the world isn’t going to help,” he says.But KM’s touchy-feely side makes it particularly hard to achieve a neat, measurable return on investment in the supporting technology. Additionally, the costs of lost knowledge are largely hidden, and do not show up on balance sheets, says Mr DeLong.“Managers as a whole have not been educated to see intellectual property as an asset in the way that money is,” agrees John Kay, a member of the management group at PA Consulting Group. “If the average company managed its money in the way it managed its IP, it wouldn’t be in business.”For too long, he says, companies have talked about KM as if it is an end in itself, but it can only be a means to an end – improving the company’s business performance. “Like IT, KM has set itself up as a discipline in its own right. Managers have been intimidated by the way it is discussed.”There is, finally, the question of who takes responsibility for implementing KM within organisations. Some companies have appointed, at boardroom level, knowledge managers who can influence the direction of the company, says Mr Kay, but others in the role have been glorified IT managers, who can organise the information but cannot influence the cultural aspects of KM.“Authority is distributed, so it’s very difficult to put it in,” he says. “Like the issue of how to get benefits out of IT, it’s part of everybody’s job.”It is little wonder, therefore, that most companies’ achievements in KM have been more discrete than all-embracing. “We’ve worked with many companies that have managed this issue well within key knowledge domains – such as R&D, engineering, and field service,” says Jim Murphy, research director at AMR Research. “It seems that many are just beginning to deal with the issues on a much more global basis – for all employees [people with domain knowledge, relationship knowledge, and key intellectual property in their heads].”Experts such as Mr Kay and Mr DeLong point to several instances of companies that have recognised the need for effective KM. BP wins praise on the technology side for its expert locator system that helps employees find the right specialist within the company on a given issue, such as a particular type of oil drilling problem.The UK oil major is also commended on the touchy-feely front for making it part of a specialist’s job to help a successor, rather than simply getting on with his or her new job. Mr Kay contrasts that approach with the attitude in some parts of the UK civil service, where “people are deemed to be the expert in a field at the instant they step into it”.Mr DeLong cites the in-depth interviews carried out by Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine group, on soon-to-retire Concorde engine designers, to ensure their expertise was preserved for future customers – irrespective of Concorde’s own retirement. But getting experts to articulate their knowledge is no simple process, he warns, noting how one US organisation spent $1m on videotaping retiring experts but did not think about how future users would access the information they needed. The tapes now sit on a shelf, unused.IBM has been active in the KM field, too, both on its own account and on behalf of its customers. Internally, its ThinkPlace intranet tool, devised by Nick Donofrio, executive vice-president for innovation and technology, helps the company to marshal and share innovation, and is combined with several cultural and management approaches including incentive and recognition schemes.Then, last September, Big Blue announced new consulting services to help organisations prepare for the potential loss of highly valued skills and knowledge as the baby-boom generation reaches retirement age.Nevertheless, nothing illustrates better the struggles many companies have had with KM than the prevalence of what is euphemistically termed “knowledge recovery”. In plain English, this means bringing back people whose knowledge has been lost, as contractors and consultants.One US study found that 60 per cent of organisations have been doing this, says Mr DeLong, not that companies are too keen to talk about it – “nobody wants to advertise that they’ve made a mistake”, he says. Mr Kay at PA says he is often called in by companies that have lost knowledge or are about to do so, and says this shows they have failed to build KM in to their cultures.Mr Shaffar at Northrop Grumman agrees that “there is not a lot that can be done if someone announces they are retiring in a few months time” and says a long-term strategy is necessary to try to ensure this situation does not arise.For a company such as Northrop Grumman, he says, knowledge resides in practices, and there are groups of employees which represent each practice. “So the question becomes not so much one about individual retirements, but what happens to the practice as a whole as a result of the impact of retirements.”There are some hopeful signs. Mr Murphy at AMR identifies a resurgence of interest in KM as companies recognise the need to get it right, because of the twin pressures of retirements and compliance issues. There is also, he says, a better understanding both of the limitations of the technology, which might account for 10 per cent of a solution, and of the need for companies to take a holistic approach.But, in the face of inexorable demographic trends, there is much more for companies to do on the non-technological side of KM. Succession planning, traditionally limited to very senior posts, needs to be pushed further down the organisation, says Mr DeLong.Northrop Grumman is one company that has stepped up its succession planning activities. The company has been hiring recently, but Mr Shaffar says that, as a result of downsizing in the past, there is a big gap between its baby-boomers and the new “millennials.” This raises questions about where the next generation of leadership will come from.Another idea, recommended by Mr Kay, is a “friendly-leaver” policy for early retirees, ensuring that successors are fully briefed, and advocates creating a culture in which older people feel it is an important part of their job to bring on a new generation. This could be encouraged through financial incentives or simply, in a professional context, by the feeling of enrichment at having helped a younger colleague.Perhaps the biggest challenge, especially for big companies with a long history of downsizing, job cuts and corporate upheaval, is to develop or rebuild the trust that encourages employees to share knowledge rather than hoard it.This has particular resonance in the context of an ageing workforce. At best, companies have a little more time to deal with capturing tacit knowledge if workers stay on longer, says Mr Cheese at Accenture, but the issue will become all the bigger if they do not deal with it, as retirees will depart with even more information in their heads.“The downsizing issue is likely to send a signal to veteran employees that knowledge is the key to them staying in the job,” says Mr DeLong. “How you shift that sentiment and belief, so that older employees share their knowledge, is a real issue for organisations with that history.”But perhaps soon-to-retire employees will take the contrary position, realising that the more they share their knowledge and remain involved with the company’s activities, the more useful they will be seen to be.“People will share with their colleagues if it is presented as helping colleagues with their career and keeping their own legacy alive in the company,” says Mr Shaffar. “As people get closer to retirement, and are presented with an opportunity to be a mentor to a new hire, I think we find they are pretty available.”*Lost knowledge: confronting the threat of an ageing workforce.

294;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2006-01-24T14:15:34Z;Northrop reports profit rise despite hurricanes;;Northrop Grumman, the Los Angeles-based defence giant, saw its profits in the fourth quarter rise 22 per cent over 2004, despite having its warship building operations hit hard by Hurricane Katrina in October.While its revenues for the quarter were largely unchanged at just under $7.9bn, its net income rose to $331m from $272m thanks largely to improved performance in its fast-growing integrated systems division, which includes the company’s unmanned spy drones like the Global Hawk and Firescout.The earnings beat analyst estimates, and the company improved its earnings guidance for 2006 from $4.10 to $4.30 per share to $4.25 to $4.40 per share. The fourth quarter results helped Northrop deliver record revenues of $30.7bn for the year, up 3 per cent over 2004.Northrop also announced it had generated $678m in net cash in the quarter, more than double a year earlier, finishing the year with more than $2.5bn in cash from operating activities. The pile joins other strong cash positions from the US’s defence companies, a situation that has led to speculation the industry is poised for another round of consolidation.Already, shipbuilding rival General Dynamics has moved to acquire defence technology group Anteon for $2.2bn, and Lockheed Martin took a stab at buying the defence services business from Computer Sciences late last year.Ronald Sugar, Northrop chief executive, said in a statement that the “outstanding cash generation” would help the company proceed with its already-announced $1.2bn share buy-back. “This year’s strong results were achieved despite the charges associated with Hurricane Katrina,” Mr Sugar said.The industry is braced for the Pentagon to announce its 2007 budget next month, which is expected to see cuts in several large weapons programmes. Already, Northrop has been hurt by a slow-down in the navy’s new destroyer programme, called DD(X), but the Pentagon has said it would not kill the ship, as many analysts expected.Still, the slow-down in the DD(X) programme, coupled with damage to the company’s shipyards in the Gulf Coast town of Pascagoula, Mississippi, saw Northrop’s shipbuilding revenues slip from more than $1.7bn in 2004 to just under $1.5bn last year. The hit was particularly hard in its surface ships division, where sales dropped 56 per cent.Northrop also said it took a $65m pre-tax charge because of problems in the upgrade of the F-16 fighter, built by Lockheed Martin. Northrop, which is responsible for the electronic warfare suite for the newest version of the fighter, being built for the UAE, said costs will be higher to complete the system.Some of those charges were offset by the sale of its remaining stake in wireless communications provider Endwave, which it unloaded for $14m.
295;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2005-10-25T20:30:42Z;Wall Street pauses for breath;;Wall Street bulls paused for breath on Tuesday after their broadest rally in more than a year as several downbeat earnings forecasts encouraged profit-taking.Ken Tower, chief market analyst at Charles Schwab’s CyberTrader unit, warned clients that Monday’s rally “does not guarantee” further gains, even though such broad rallies tend to herald more durable advances, rather than their conclusion.Shares in Texas Instruments fell 7.7 per cent to $28.55 after the maker of mobile phone chips gave a lower guidance than expected for earnings for the fourth quarter.Also in technology, Lexmark International was 6.5 per cent lower at $39.69 after the printer maker reported sharply declining third quarter profits.PortalPlayer, which makes chips used in Apple’s iPod music players, tumbled 27.7 per cent to $20.15 after the company announced a secondary share offering aimed at raising cash.Altera shares gave up 7.3 per cent to $16.43 a day after the maker of programmable chips said its third quarter revenues would fall short of earlier estimates.Similarly, Altiris saw its shares decline 4.3 per cent to $16.90 after the software company reported falling profits in its third quarter.There was some excitement away from technology stocks as Primedia shares plunged 35.1 per cent to $1.98, a day after the news that its chief executive had left while the niche publisher was exploring plans to split itself into two units.In the same sector, Cablevision Systems lost 12.8 per cent to $24.26 after news its owners, the Dolan family, gave up on taking the cable television operator private.Among Dow components, DuPont, the chemicals manufacturer, saw its stock gain 3 per cent to $40.80 as the announcement of a share buyback offset news of quarterly loss and a warning of profits below expectations in the fourth quarter. Dow Chemical, a rival, was 0.9 per cent lower at $43.89.Also on the old economy side of the market, Sherwin-Williams shares lost 9.1 per cent to $40.75 after the paint manufacturer warned of higher raw materials costs weighing on its latest and future earnings.Against the predominantly negative backdrop, the Dow Jones Industrial average was down 7.13 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 10,377.87 at the close of the session. The broader S&P 500 index fell 2.84 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 1,196.54 and the Nasdaq Composite index retreated 6.38 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 2,109.45.Arthur Hogan, the chief US markets strategist at Jefferies & Co, said that Tuesday’s session amounted to “a whole lot of nothing. However, he said that the stage had been set for a 1,000-point move of the Dow industrials in either direction. “As such, we’ll take flat instead of 100-points down any day,” he said.Defence contractors also suffered, with Lockheed Martin off 1.8 per cent at $61.23 as analysts raises concern about its growth outlook, despite the company reporting 39 per cent growth in third quarter profits.Peer Northrop Grumman was 1.8 per cent off at $52.92 after it reported stalling profits, adding that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico had damaged its shipyards.
296;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2005-10-10T17:43:39Z;Northrop says Katrina will depress profits;;Northrop Grumman has warned that its earnings will be lower than expected this year because of $1bn of damage and work delays at its Gulf coast shipyards following Hurricane Katrina.Three of the defence contractor’s facilities in Mississippi and Louisiana were in the path of the devastating storm six weeks ago. Work was delayed on 11 ships at the yards in New Orleans, Gulfport and Pascagoula but Ron Sugar, chief executive, pledged the company would catch up next year.“While the damage is significant, Northrop has weathered this disaster and will come back even stronger than before,” he told investors, during a conference call. “Our team has already made solid progress in restoring the yards and resuming production.”The company said storm-related costs, including contract penalties for delayed ship deliveries, would reduce full-year earnings by 40 cents a share to a range of $3.55-$3.65 a share. However, guidance for 2006 earnings remained unchanged at $4.10-$4.30.Work has resumed on all 11 ships under construction but more than 7,000 of its 20,000-strong workforce in the Gulf coast region remain off work and 700 are unaccounted for. Many employees lost their homes in the storm and have evacuated out of the area.Northrop said it expected to recover the “preponderance” of the estimated $1bn of cost of repairing and clearing up its storm-damaged facilities. But it warned of a dispute with its insurance provider over some of the losses. The company’s Pascagoula and Gulfport shipyards were particularly badly hit by the 25ft storm surge that battered the Mississippi coastline.Nick Fothergill, analyst at Banc of America Securities, said the profit warning was “largely expected and should not be taken too negatively.”In addition to the impact of work delays, contract penalties and storm damage, the company said it would also be affected by increased labour and material costs following Katrina.Northrop said that the cost of putting its shipbuilding business back on schedule would reduce near-term working capital but it did not expect “a material impact to its overall financial health”.The company reduced its forecast for 2005 revenues by $1bn to a range of $30.5bn-$31bn.
297;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2005-09-07T22:40:25Z;Northrop joins EADS in air force tanker bid;;"US defence giant Northrop Grumman ended months of speculation on Wednesday by announcing it would join Franco-German aerospace group EADS in a campaign to sell in-air refuelling tankers to the US air force, a contract that could be worth more than $20bn (€16bn, £11bn).Northrop and EADS have been in talks for months about joining forces in the bid, using Airbus’s A330 to compete against an expected offer from arch rival Boeing and its 767. But Ronald Sugar, Northrop chief executive, had delayed a final decision because of the ongoing row between the US and European Union over subsidies to the two commercial aircraft makers.Northrop officials said they believed the political climate was now open to a bid with the A330 in spite of the subsidy rift. “We’ve heard both Congress and the air force stress the need for a competition, and we are prepared to address that need by forming a strong industry team,” said Scott Seymour, head of the Northrop division that will oversee the tanker bid.Northrop said it would be prime contractor for the aircraft, dubbed KC-30; EADS would be “a principal subcontractor and team-mate”. The arrangement is similar to competitions in which foreign defence groups have tried to sell airframes to the Pentagon by teaming up with US contractors.Italian group AgustaWestland, for example, recently won a battle to sell the US navy its EH-101 as the president’s Marine One helicopter, but only after it joined up with US defence group Lockheed Martin, which acted as prime contractor on the bid. The Pentagon chose Brazil’s Embraer business jet to act as a new spyplane in a bid where Lockheed was the prime contractor.The agreement is significant for EADS, which has been fighting to get its A330 offering taken seriously since the US tanker replacement programme ramped up three years ago. Former Northrop executive Ralph Crosby, who heads EADS’ North American business, has said it would be nearly impossible for Airbus to win a competition against Boeing without a US partner.“Partnering is important because we can’t bring all the capabilities,” Mr Crosby said in a recent interview. “Quite frankly, in a practical sense for a programme of this scale and scope, the US air force is not likely to buy from a foreign company, even one that is incorporated in the United States.”Boeing dominates the global tanker market, and has sold the 767 to Italy and Japan. But Airbus has made inroads in the last two years, beating the 767 in the UK and Australia."
298;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2005-06-14T21:00:32Z;Airbus spat delays Northrop tanker bid;;"Ronald Sugar, chief executive of Northrop Grumman, the US defence giant, said his decision on whether to compete in the US air force's troubled refuelling tanker programme had been affected by congressional efforts to punish Airbus parent EADS, his likely partner.The stance, taken just weeks after the House of Representatives moved to bar EADS from Pentagon programmes because of its dispute with the US over commercial aircraft subsidies, indicates that Northrop will not announce it will join the Airbus bid during the Paris Air Show this week, as many in the industry had anticipated.With the congressional dispute likely to continue through the summer, a Northrop decision could be delayed for months.According to industry officials, Northrop has been in advanced talks with EADS to take the lead on the Franco-German group's efforts to sell A330s to the US air force when the Pentagon announces a competition for the programme later this year.But Mr Sugar said in an interview with the Financial Times that the House legislation had effected the timing of his decision.“We have to be mindful of the issues surrounding the WTO and subsidies issue,” he said. “Clearly there are those who would believe that laws could be written where you can't actually do this. And of course if it's not legal to do, we're not going to do it.”He added: “It's anybody's guess how this will play out over the summer.” Mr Sugar's decision was also being affected by the fact the air force had yet to announce its requirements for a new tanking aircraft. An evaluation of its needs by Rand is not expected until August.“It's hard to say we're going to win a programme when we don't know what it is yet,” he said. Ralph Crosby, head of EADS's North America operations, said he hoped the measure passed by the House barring Airbus contracts with the Pentagon would be stripped out of the legislation once negotiations with the Senate began.He said the timing of a partnership agreement would not affect his plan to announce next week the selection of a US city where EADS would assemble an A330 tanker if it won the bid. But finding a US partner was essential for his bid's success; Northrop is believed to be the only company EADS is currently in discussions with. Robert Stevens, Lockheed Martin chief executive, said this week his company was not in talks over the programme.Despite his concerns about the trade dispute and the lack of specific requirement data yet from the air force, Mr Sugar said Northrop was still looking seriously at competing.“The scale of this programme is enormous,” he said. “We're talking about tens of billions of dollars, perhaps as much as $100bn over a long period of time. We put those things together and we think about the fact we're one of the largest defence companies in the world [and] it's clearly something we're looking at.”"
299;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Thales targets BAE’s Atlas Elektronik;;Thales, the French armament group, hopes to buy the German company, Atlas Elektronik from BAE Systems, Financial Times Deutschland, the FT’s sister paper has learnt.Atlas Elektronik, one of the world’s leading suppliers of electronics for submarines and ships, employs 1600 people and has a turnover of 292m Euro.“We will definitely pursue an acquisition if Atlas Elektronik comes on the market and we are invited to make an offer,” Jean-Georges Malcor, managing director of Thales-Marine told FT Deutschland.But it remains unclear whether Thales will be allowed to bid for the company under German law. The German government recently passed a law that vetoes the sale of armament groups to foreign companies. The German government has recently emphasised not only the importance of the French-German relations, but the need to strengthen its own armament industry. The French government has a 31 per cent stake in Thales.ThyssenKrupp, the steel manufacturers and engineering firm, and EADS, the aeronautic defence and space company, are also interested in buying Atlas Elektronik.Mr Malcor believes that the amalgamation of naval companies is inevitable. “The process has already begun. It is no longer a question of if, but a question of when and how,” he said.In Germany, one dockyard has already been built under ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and in France the state owned dockyard, DCN, which will soon be privatised, joined Thales through a joint venture with Armaris. The French company is one of the main promoters of a naval dockyard network, following the example set by EADS.In contrast to Europe, America only has four main naval groups – Europe has twelve large companies. And two of these groups are full-range suppliers. Both General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman have their own dockyards.“Customers are starting to ask for total solutions to cater for certain needs that they have,” Mr Malcor said.The industry is on the brink of change. The end of the Cold War has issued in new demands on ships and there has been an increase in the number of electronic parts, according to Mr Malcor. “The ships should have a universal purpose. There is a trend towards a multi-mission-platform,” he added.Thales is well equipped to deal with changes in the market. The naval division has a turnover of 2.04bn Euro and employs almost 7100 workers. And Mr Malcor expects a “possible surge in contracts” from large projects. “There may be contracts worth up to 3bn Euro coming in,” he said.Mr Malcor declined to comment on a possible merger between EADS and Thales, other than to say that different options are being considered. But, at the recent EADS general meeting, Arnaud Lagardere, the co-chairman of the supervisory board, said that a merger between the two groups was a possibility.

301;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2005-03-07T20:08:36Z;Lex: BAE Systems;;"Modern tanks resemble armoured computers; the latest version of the US Army's Bradley fighting vehicle has as much software as a combat aircraft. These souped-up hunks of metal are proving well-suited for today's wars, as Iraq and Afghanistan have shown. Hence they command a growing share of military budgets. The Pentagon has requested an extra $1.3bn this year to upgrade its fleet of 7,200 Bradleys.This confluence of widening margins and rising demand is attracting the big defence contractors to the formerly neglected business of land combat systems and none more so than BAE Systems. After acquiring tank builder Alvis last August, the UK group is buying United Defense Industries, maker of the Bradley, as well as guns and missile launchers, for $4.2bn.At 24 times forecast earnings, the deal is no bargain, reflecting rival interest from Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman and others. But after a flattish 2005, UDI should produce two years of double digit growth due to a step-change in its maintenance contracts with the US Army. Underlying earnings growth should then revert to around 8 per cent. This should mean BAE just about covers its 8 per cent cost of capital for the deal in 2007, even ignoring potential savings.More importantly, BAE increases its exposure to lower-risk service and support revenues in North America. That is preferable to waiting for the next step in the glacial consolidation of Europe's defence industry."
302;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2005-01-12T20:55:22Z;EADS to seek US home for tanker facility;;Airbus parent EADS on Wednesday took its biggest step yet towards setting up a US-based plant to construct air-to-air refuelling tankers for the US Air Force, announcing a search to find a home for the new facility.Although the Pentagon has not yet announced a new tender for tankers, rival Boeing's deal with the air force a $23bn contract to convert 100 767s into refuellers is widely regarded as dead.This follows revelations that the air force procurement official overseeing the programme steered billions of dollars in contracts to Boeing to secure a job at the company.Ralph Crosby, head of EADS in North America, said it hoped to select a city by the end of the year. The company would at first build a small engineering centre to support Airbus's A330, A340 and A350 commercial aircraft.The engineering centre would be operational by the first quarter of 2006, employing just 50 people to begin with.However, EADS was budgeting an investment of $500m-$600m to expand the facility in case it was chosen to build a “sizeable” number of tankers for the air force. The site would then be able to convert A330s into tankers and potentially do more advanced assembly work on the aircraft.“While there is no formal programme at this point, the deputy defence secretary has said there definitely will be a competition,” Mr Crosby said. “Given the US will be the place where these tankers will be built …we felt like giving states and localities the chance to put their best foot forward.”EADS, largely a Franco-German company, has said it hopes to link with a large US defence company in a tanker bid. Mr Crosby said the future partner likely to be either Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman could influence the location of the new plant.Mr Crosby said that, for the time being, the criteria would be limited to infrastructure including an existing 9,000 ft runway and a skilled employment base. He declined to comment on whether political considerations would be taken into account in choosing a location.

304;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2004-12-06T20:49:37Z;Observer - US;;"Roche's friendship in the fast laneSenator John McCain recently lambasted his old friend James Roche, Air Force secretary, for disparaging European defence contractor EADS and Ralph Crosby, head of its North American operations, in e-mails.On one occasion Roche told another Pentagon official that Crosby would use a telephone call to ""butter his personal croissant in Paris"".In his first interview on the subject, Roche explains all. ""[Ralph] is a West Pointer, Army. I am a sailor. We have competed against each other for a position for 20 years,"" he says, referring to the top spot at Northrop Grumman, which both failed to grab.""He has been rough on me. I have been rough on him. It is quite combative.""On the other hand, he is also very admirable. He is the only person I know who can actually take apart a Ferrari and rebuild it. I have admired that for years,"" says Roche, who steers powerboats and Ferraris when not being ferried to the Pentagon in a government Cadillac. (Roche called his Ferrari his ""Bella Macchina"".)When it comes to more cerebral matters, however, Roche sees himself as the better man: ""I think my Shakespeare is probably a lot better than his"" - a sturdy statement given that he admits Crosby ""is a dead-eye shot with a rifle"".In the end, Roche says Crosby has earned his respect for his management of EADS: ""There are things you do in the heat of battle.""We have all come from the industry and it is a rough and tumble industry. This is not a business for pussycats.""Don't speakIBM is much in the news of late, with all eyes on the sale of its personal computer business. And as luck would have it, a copy of IBM's ""Guidelines for speaking to the press"" has landed in Observer's lap.The missive details what Big Blue calls ""imperatives"". This list includes such tidbits as ""Avoid Surprises/Do not create news without prior planning""; ""Make no comments on profitability""; and ""Do not attack competition openly"".In an effort to project ""one IBM"", the company naturally wants to present a unified, if somewhat stilted front. ""Stick to the IBM image we put forward since IBM's turnaround: The customer comes first, IBM second, your unit third, everything else later."" Or for the more reflective employees there is this mantra: ""Always ask yourself: is my statement to the long-term benefit of IBM, will my quote be appreciated by senior IBM management.""The best one could be: ""Don't speak openly against a standard IBM position (ie the era of the PC being over)""Spelling beeThe Central Intelligence Agency has caved in: South Korea's president can spell his name the way he wants.Having updated its website last week, the CIA has abandoned the ""No Mu-hyun"" spelling - to which South Korea objected - for Roh Moo-hyun.That would seem to be enough to make everyone happy, but transliteration is, after all, a tricky, if not downright dark art. And the South Korean newsagency Yonhap has pointed out that the CIA is still wrong on several spellings.Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, is known as Kim Chong-il. And the spy agency uses something called the ""McCune-Reischauer system of romanisation"" in spelling provincial names, ignoring the government's official spellings.Then again, the CIA may know something it doesn't.Double dribbleNike has been hurting the feelings of Chinese people, it seems. The State Administration for Radio, Film and Television (Sarft) has banned an advert for the US sports group because it fails to respect ""the traditional culture of the motherland"".The commercial features basketball star LeBron James battling all comers in a simulated computer game. Among his opponents are a couple of Chinese women.But Sarft's complaint that Nike has ""insulted national customs"" suggests its ire may be directed at least as much at James' other opponents: a kung-fu master and a dragon.Worst of all, no doubt, Nike's corporate champion win the bouts.On messageWhat do you get if you combine ""Chinese Wisdom and International Expertise""? If state-owned China Aviation Oil is any guide, $550m in losses.The fine-sounding East-West slogan coined by CAO did not stop the company from being mired in a scandal over its oil derivative trading debacle. But Singapore-listed CAO is keeping the slogan on its website, along with a number of reminders that corporate introductions on the internet must be treated with caution.After all, CAO's claim that it was ""maximising profits"" by combining derivative and physical trading looks a little out of date.So does its boast of ""overwhelming support from international bankers"" - since they were last seen heading for the hills.No doubt CAO's government owners will be hoping that its ambition to be a ""bellwether firm for overseas Chinese enterprises"" will prove to be equally incorrect.Big wheelsIt comes as no surprise that Americans like to drive big cars, but the US Census Bureau, usually in the business of tracking people, has released some data saying they don't like them at the same rate as they used to.Although SUV registrations increased by 56 per cent from 1997 to 2002, that paled in comparison with the golden years of 1992 to 1997 when they shot up 81 per cent.Still, the statistics say that one of every eight drivers in the US has an SUV, while in Colorado and Wyoming a whopping one out of five drives the snow-stomping machines. Alas, the nation's capital has a paltry one for every 30 drivers: they're just not the way to arrive at a gala in style.observer@ft.com"
305;NOC;Northrop Grumman Corp;2004-11-18T00:32:25Z;Another casualty in Boeing tanker contract;;The Pentagon suffered more fallout from the Boeing tanker scandal on Wednesday, with the resignation of Marvin Sambur, the top air force procurement official.The resignation follows Tuesday's decision by James Roche, air force secretary, to leave the Pentagon in January. Mr Roche and Mr Sambur were advocates for a controversial $23.5bn deal to buy and lease 100 Boeing air-to-air refuelling tankers.While Donald Rumsfeld, defence secretary, has put the deal on hold, Congress has effectively blocked it from going ahead because of conflicts of interest between Boeing and the air force.Lawrence Di Rita, the chief Pentagon spokesman, this week also withdrew his nomination to become assistant secretary of defence for public affairs. John McCain, the chairman of the Senate commerce committee who has investigated the tanker deal, had blocked Mr Di Rita's nomination in an attempt to get increased co-operation from the Pentagon over the tanker scandal.Mr Roche had been nominated to become army secretary, but last year withdrew his name following opposition from Mr McCain. Mr Sambur on Wednesday told Reuters that his decision to step down partly reflected his view that no air force officials could be confirmed while he remained in office. The air force denied Mr Sambur's decision was connected to the tanker deal, adding that tanker recapitalisation remained a “top priority”.Mr Roche has also come under scrutiny following an e-mail exchange with Robin Cleveland, the White House budget official overseeing the Boeing deal. The FBI is investigating correspondence in which Mr Roche appears to try to curry favour with Ms Cleveland by recommending her brother for a job with Northrop Grumman, his former employer.While President George W. Bush has nominated Condoleezza Rice, his national security adviser, to replace Colin Powell as secretary of state, there have been no announcements on the future of Mr Rumsfeld.Observers think Mr Rumsfeld will remain for the time being, to further his goal of transforming the military and to recover from the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. But Douglas Feith, the undersecretary of defence for policy who was responsible for postwar planning in Iraq, is expected to leave his post.The tanker scandal has already claimed the Boeing careers of Phil Condit, former chief executive, and Mike Sears, former chief financial officer, while raising questions about the Pentagon procurement process and the revolving door of former officials who leave to work for defence companies.Mr Sears pleaded guilty this week to holding job discussions with Darleen Druyun, a former air force procurement official, while she was still in charge of negotiating the terms of the Boeing tanker deal. Last month Ms Druyun was sentenced to nine months in prison.Federal investigators have interviewed other Boeing executives to ascertain whether they knew Ms Druyun had not recused herself from Boeing-related business when Mr Sears held secret job discussions with the former Pentagon official.

Operating income posted a more modest gain, rising 1.6 per cent to ?300m, on sales of ?4.57bn, up ?16m from last year.Thales, which in July beat US rival Northrop Grumman to win an ?800m ($1.4bn) contract to build an unmanned drone for the British military, said it expected operating income to rise slightly for the full year, driven by a gradual recovery in the commercial aerospace sector and an improved performance in its security business.The company confirmed its outlook for 2004, saying that full-year net income should be ?markedly higher? than in 2003, on earnings up sharply because of reduced financial expenses.Thales has been bullish about its prospects beyond 2004, predicting double-digit growth in operating profits in 2005 and 2006.Along with its new ?800m drone contract, Thales has recently been tapped to build a new aircraft carrier for France, and is the preferred contractor in a joint venture to build a new carrier for Britain. Thales has spent ?3bn on restructuring since 2000, shedding lossmaking units and making acquisitions to refocus on core offerings in defence, aeronautics and IT services.Shares in Thales fell 0.97 per cent to 28?p in early trading in Paris.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
