Moreover, while the lower-end of NetApp’s earnings and revenue outlook for the current quarter missed Wall Street expectations for earnings of 69 cents, on sales of $1.37bn, the high-end handily topped estimates.Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities attributed part of Thursday’s share price drop to weakness in services and in its Americas Commercial division where revenues rose just 2 per cent from a year ago, “considerably slower” than the 6 per cent growth rate clocked in the previous quarter.Analysts also warned the company is like to see more competitive from rivals in 2018, causing sentiment on the stock to sour. “The company has clearly turned the corner, but we see increased competition in the next year from a currently underperforming Dell EMC and a preoccupied Hewlett Packard Enterprises,” Steven Milunovich, an analyst at UBS, noted.A broader sell-off in US stocks, led by a drop in the technology sector which has been dogged by concerns of stretched valuations, also weighed on NetApp shares.

2;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2015-05-21T20:33:38Z;Best Buy jumps after strong product cycle;US stocks on S&P 500 poised for record high;Strong product cycles in large screen televisions and mobile phones helped Best Buy report first-quarter same-store sales growth ahead of Wall Street forecasts.The consumer electronics chain said comparable sales, a key industry metric, rose 0.6 per cent in the quarter, ahead of Wall Street’s forecasts for a 0.2 per cent drop.Excluding instalment billings, however, like-for-like sales slipped 0.7 per cent.The Minneapolis-based company reported profits of $129m or 36 cents a share, compared with $461m or $1.31 a share in the prior-year period.Sales declined 1 per cent year-on-year to $8.55bn but topped Wall Street estimates.“While the consumer electronics industry is subject to product cycles, we are excited about the role that technology plays in people’s lives and the opportunities that this creates,” said chief executive Hubert Joly.“We are also confident that we are executing against the right investment strategy that will allow us to capitalise on key technology waves and customer-experience opportunities to build sustainable long-term shareholder value.”Since taking over as chief executive in late 2012, Mr Joly has worked to overhaul management and cut expenses.However, the company has struggled to come up with effective answer to the prevalence of “showrooming” — the practice in which customers visit stores to check out products in person and then go home and buy them online for less.Shares of Best Buy, which have advanced 38 per cent in the past year, climbed nearly 4 per cent to $35.11.Salesforce.com lifted its full-year revenue outlook, giving the company’s shares a 4 per cent boost to $72.91.The San Francisco-based company said revenues in the year to January will be in the range of $6.52bn to $6.55bn, up from an earlier forecast of $6.47bn to $6.52bn. This was ahead of Wall Street estimates for $6.5bn.“Our current outlook puts us on track to reach a $7bn revenue run rate later this year,” said Marc Benioff, chief executive.Salesforce, which has a near $50bn market valuation, was the subject of takeover reports earlier this month.Shares of Lumber Liquidators fell 17 per cent to $21.10 after the flooring company said its chief executive Robert Lynch unexpectedly resigned.The Virginia-based company has come under scrutiny since a 60 Minutes segment earlier this year alleged that some of its laminate flooring supplied from China had excessive levels of formaldehyde — a chemical compound that has been linked to cancer.NetApp was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, falling 10 per cent to $31.77, after the data storage maker reported fiscal fourth-quarter results and issued first-quarter earnings and sales guidance that missed Wall Street estimates.The company also said it would reduce its global workforce by about 4 per cent.Analysts at JPMorgan, Needham & Co and Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded the stock following the results.A rally in oil prices lifted energy stocks with the S&P 500 energy sector rising 0.8 per cent and leading the benchmark index higher.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to a record high at 2,130.82 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 18,285.74. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4 per cent to 5,090.79.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
3;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2015-01-05T13:13:15Z;The cleaner who soared all the way to the board;How companies can recognise the hidden talents within their ranks;"Karen Hester had no thought of becoming a manager when she started a cleaning job at Adnams, the British brewer based in the seaside town of Southwold. “I wanted evening work, so my children wouldn’t miss out during the day,” she says. Twenty-six years on, she runs Adnams’ entire operations and is about to join its board.Her potential was spotted after she became a purchasing clerk simply bec­ause she needed to change her hours when her children started school − “there had been no complaints about the cleaning”. In her new role, she met Andy Wood, now chief executive but then supply chain head. Im­pressed by how she project managed the purchase of his company car, he asked about her background. When he discovered she had qualified to drive heavy goods vehicles as a 17-year-old army recruit, and gained two promotions in record time, he persuaded her to join the transport division and became her mentor.“Karen wasn’t an obvious model for a future business leader, but she displayed a tenacity, an inquisitiveness and willingness to learn that marked her out,” Mr Wood says.Individuals with underused talents — even if not on the scale of Ms Hester’s latent abilities − exist in all walks of life. But many organisations struggle to judge people on their true merits.First, talented employees with unconventional backgrounds may have to overcome the unconscious bias of superiors to reach senior roles. Even if we try to be “neutral judges”, says Francesca Gino, a professor at Harvard Business School, we tend to view people with whom we feel some affinity — whether because of education, gender, ethnicity or some lesser connection − more favourably.Likewise, as institutions, businesses may create barriers for individuals who do not fulfil stereotypical expectations. A case in point is fast-tracking graduates over other employees. Executives “must be bright enough” to do the job, as John Mervyn-Smith, chief psychologist at UK-based talent consultancy eg. 1, observes. But he adds that qualities such as energy and drive, emotional maturity, ability to solve problems and learn quickly − at which Ms Hester excelled — are often better predictors of successful leadership than academic qualifications.What can businesses do to find potential that may be hiding in plain sight, especially if the individuals concerned may not think promotion is for them and so do not put themselves forward?Creating a variety of routes into senior roles helps. Having previously concentrated on honing the leadership skills of executives near the top of the organisation, Vodafone has introduced a career development programme, known internally as “Retail Spine”. The initiative spots promising shop floor employees and equips them with skills and experience they will need to become general managers and ad­vance into the top jobs.Candidates nominate themselves or are put forward by a manager to be as­sessed for potential to think strategically, manage through inf­luence and adapt to change. “By taking people out of their day-to-day role and looking at them from a broader perspective, we aim to spot potential early and pull people up through the organisation,” says Jenni Heyes, who runs Vodafone’s employee training and development operations.Another approach is to encourage employees with thoughts on how to im­prove the business, wherever they are in the pecking order, to pitch for re­sources to put their ideas into action. At L’Oréal, 33-year-old James Taylor has spent three years managing a £4m IT project to improve planning and forecasting processes. He had the idea while working as an account manager in the UK consumer products division and entered an internal innovation competition. Now he is about to begin a global role, at director level, at L’Oréal’s The Body Shop. “The project gave me exposure to senior managers across Europe …and [an opportunity to show] what I was capable of achieving,” he says.When businesses talk of leadership diversity, most think of gender and ethnicity. But organisations can also be dominated by personality types. Studies suggest there are far fewer introverts in leadership positions than extroverts, and the more senior the role, the more extroverts predominate. But according to research led by Wharton business school, quiet, reflective managers in charge of entrepreneurial colleagues tend to produce better results than outgoing and assertive managers. The quiet­er bosses, the 2010 study found, were more receptive to their team’s ideas than the extroverts, who did most of the talking in the group.To spot the potential of quieter personalities, businesses may need to undertake a more searching approach. Debbie Hance, head of business psychology at Head Light, a talent management software provider, observes that companies already gather 360-degree feedback from subordinates to pinpoint areas where managers need to improve. However, such intelligence could also help organisations identify staff who ex­cel in the quieter, nurturing aspects of leadership, such as mentoring peers, that sometimes go unnoticed. “There are certain strengths, such as empowering others, that people display to those below them more than they do to their bosses,” Ms Hance says.Observing peer group dynamics can also be instructive. Tom Mendoza, vice-chairman of US-based data management and storage business NetApp, says he looks for “the go-to guys” to whom others turn for advice.In the early 2000s, the habit led him to put sales rep Joe Santamorena in charge of the New York office’s rapidly expanding financial salesforce, even though his immediate bosses argued against the appointment. They fretted that he had never managed anyone, or hired staff.But Mr Mendoza was convinced that Mr Santamorena was a natural leader after observing him spontaneously mentoring less experienced reps. Today Mr Santamorena runs NetApp’s commercial sales group for the Americas. “His one big negative was that he’d never hired anyone, so [the challenge] was to give him the help that he’d need not to fail on that particular task,” Mr Mendoza says.Having taken an unusual route herself, Ms Hester says she keeps a weather eye open for untapped potential, taking particular care not to typecast people. “I never assume the warehouse-worker in blue trousers and a blue top isn’t capable of doing the same role as the person in the shirt and chinos,” she says.Further readingBe inclusive. Initiatives such as offering various paths into leadership and holding competitions that bypass hierarchies send a message that the business aims to judge people on their merits and is looking to uncover hidden potential.
Recognise biases. People are predisposed to favour those whom they resemble; but the ones who recognise their biases are better placed to deal impartially.
Observe team dynamics. Identifying the people to whom others turn for guidance can uncover natural leaders, while also exposing the self-promotion of individuals who will do anything for the boss, but nothing for their peers.
Talk to people. At Adnams, it was chatting with Karen Hester as he signed for his company car that alerted Andy Wood to her achievements in the British army and gave him a clue to her untapped abilities.
Prioritise substance over style. Would-be leaders with unusual backgrounds may lack interview knowhow. To gauge underlying ability, Ms Hester focuses on what “people are trying to say, not how they say it.” It is not interviewing well that matters, but the potential to do the job."

EMC has a market capitalisation of $57bn.The investment counts as one of Elliott’s largest to date and comes just months after it sold out of EMC’s smaller rival, NetApp, where it successfully agitated for cost cuts and share repurchases.EMC shares were up more than 3 per cent in early trading.Elliott has already made contact with potential acquirers of the storage business, people familiar with the conversations said.Consolidation has swept through parts of the hardware market, raising expectations for more deals in the storage market as well. However, some potential buyers of EMC may be forced to sit on the sidelines should it come into play.Hewlett-Packard, which has been an active hardware acquirer in the past, is in the midst of repairing its balance sheet after earlier deals, and has turned its focus to software and services. Meanwhile Dell, which has also moved into storage as it diversifies beyond PCs, went private last year, robbing it of the chance to use stock to make large acquisitions.Oracle and Cisco Systems have also set out to build broader IT hardware divisions, though they may shy away from buying a traditional storage business that risks being disrupted by newer technologies from the likes of VMware.Mr Tucci, the architect of EMC’s strategy of running companies in promising new markets at arm’s length rather than integrating them, is due to retire early next year, which is why Elliott’s decided to move now.Mr Tucci’s approach has been credited with allowing VMware to grow unfettered, making it the most successful new software start-up since Oracle and accounting for the lion’s share of its parent’s stock market value. Elliott has told other EMC shareholders it believes the core business would be valued more highly as an acquisition target if VMware were separated.VMware recently expanded its strategy to compete in EMC’s core market, with a more modern software-based approach designed to reduce the need for storage systems like those sold by the parent.Ownership of VMware has caused friction in the past inside EMC. Pat Gelsinger, VMWare’s chief executive officer, described in a recent interview how his company’s willingness to partner with a rival storage company, NetApp, had brought complaints from some EMC salespeople.He credited Mr Tucci with allowing VMware to develop independently and not be hampered by its parent’s business priorities.VMware began including a line in its regulatory filings early last year that it would not take any actions that would hamper the tax-free nature of any future spin-off by EMC.
5;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2012-02-16T22:24:52Z;S&P 500 at nine-month high on strong US data;;The S&P 500 closed at a nine-month high, and just five points shy of its post-financial crisis peak, as investors shrugged off delays to a deal on bail-out funding for Greece, and the threat of ratings downgrades for US banks.The S&P 500 climbed 1.1 per cent to 1,358.05, now up 8 per cent for the year. The benchmark US index has climbed 100 points in 2012, the first time that has happened by mid-February, according to S&P Capital IQ. The previous highest points return by February 16 was 79 in 2010,Bank stocks led the rally, with financials in the S&P 500 climbing 1.6 per cent, despite opening sharply lower after the rating agency Moody’s warned late on Wednesday that it might downgrade several large US banks.Morgan Stanley climbed 1.2 per cent to $19.19, despite the threat of a three notch ratings downgrade by Moody’s.Citigroup and Goldman Sachs climbed 3.1 per cent to $32.71 and 1.4 per cent to $114.74 respectively, despite the rating agency’s warning that it could downgrade their debt by two levels.Bank of America shares climbed 4 per cent to $8.10 for one of the best performances in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Commercial banks were possibly lifted by US credit card portfolio data, which showed loss rates declined month-on-month in January, defying seasonal trends for a holiday-shopping induced uptick in losses.“We expect underlying credit quality for the [sector] to remain relatively stable over the next several quarters given our outlook for stable employment levels and lower bankruptcy filings,” Moshe Orenbuch at Credit Suisse told clients, with other analysts also upbeat on the data. Investors took heart from a variety of positive US data, with jobless claims hitting a near four-year low.Citigroup analysts said global equities could rally another 11 per cent through to the year-end, citing signs of inflows into equity mutual funds and the absence of a rally in government bond yields, with US Treasuries still yielding less than 2 per cent.“US 10-year bond yields [still have] some way to go before becoming a competitive alternative to equities, in our view,” Robert Buckland wrote in a note. Shares in Apple, which climbed to a record $526.29 before selling off sharply on Wednesday, were buffeted again on Thursday, amid reports that the company had pulled the iPad 2 from Amazon China because of an ongoing trademark dispute over the iPad name.However, analysts blamed an index rebalancing, which will force some exchange-traded and mutual funds to sell Apple stock because of its increasing weight in portfolios. “The share price move is all about technicals,” said Mike Walkley, a tech analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “The China iPad news is not material to the stock price, or certainly not yet. Resellers account for a small proportion of sales in China and the company has not pulled iPads from Apple stores. ”Its shares reversed losses to close up 0.9 per cent to $502.21.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index to climb 1.5 per cent to 2,959.85.Microsoft appeared to be given a bounce by the rebalancing effect with its weighting in the Dow Jones Industrial Average set to increase. Its shares climbed 4.1 per cent to $31.28, helping the Dow close above 12,900 for the first time since 2008. The blue-chip heavy index was up 1 per cent to 12,904.08.But in a more bearish signal, the transport sector of the Dow has fallen more than 1 per cent in February. Dow theory suggests the wider index follows the lead of transport stocks, which offer the first signs of economic slowdown. Shares in Amazon fell 2.5 per cent to $179.93, approaching a nine-month low, after Morgan Stanley analysts removed their “buy” equivalent recommendation on the online retailer, citing competition from Apple.General Motors shares surged 9 per cent to $27.17 after reporting its best-ever calendar year earnings in 2011.Shares in CVR Energy climbed 5.8 per cent to $29.20 after activist investor Carl Icahn tabled a conditional bid of $30 per share for the refiner.Clearwire fell 4.7 per cent to $2.25 after the wireless broadband provider to Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile network by subscribers, reported a wider fourth-quarter loss than expected on higher interest and tax costs and guided below analysts’ expectations for 2012.NetApp climbed 7.2 per cent to $42.74 after the data-storage product maker reported better than expected revenue in its fiscal third quarter.JM Smucker fell 8.4 per cent to $71.60. The maker of Folgers coffee reported third-quarter earnings excluding some items of $1.22 a share, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.41.Shares in Zillow climbed 0.8 per cent to $34.26, after reporting fourth-quarter results and Citigroup analysts urged clients to buy shares in the online property-search company, arguing “rentals creates a potentially substantial new growth opportunity” for the company in 2012.
6;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2012-01-19T22:09:43Z;Tech stocks shine as S&P 500 consolidates gains;BofA climbs on fourth-quarter profit;A strong day for tech stocks helped the S&P 500 consolidate gains to close above 1,300 for a second consecutive day, hitting a five-month high.F5 Networks rose 10.6 per cent to $120, after the computer network provider narrowly beat analyst expectations for fourth-quarter earnings and forecast a strong start to 2012, despite falling revenues from government clients.F5’s market cap has now increased fivefold since the start of 2009, leaving some analysts cautious about the potential for further gains. “At over 24 times our full year 2012 expected earnings per share, we believe more earnings momentum is needed to keep the stock moving up,” said Rod Hall at JPMorgan.F5’s result provided a fillip to other networking and software companies. Juniper Networks advanced 6.1 per cent $23.88, while Cisco Systems was one of the best performers in the Dow Jones index, putting on 1.3 per cent to $19.79 ahead of results.Semiconductor manufacturer NetApp was up 8.3 per cent to $37.51 on reports it could be a subject of takeover bids.Cloud business software developer Salesforce.com rallied 6.3 per cent to $114.51 as Canaccord Genuity analysts said the company’s recent weakness on new billings, could prove temporary, “and not necessarily indicative of [the] firm’s outlook”.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,788.33, but Google, the second most heavily weighted stock in the index, plunged 10 per cent to $581.35 in after-hours trading, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a large margin.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced just 0.4 per cent to 12,623.98. The S&P 500 finished 0.5 per cent higher at 1,314.50, a gain of 4.5 per cent for the year.The benchmark index is set for its best January since 1997, but analysts warned a disappointing start to the earnings season could weigh on the index. Of the 59 S&P 500 companies that had reported by Thursday afternoon, only 49 per cent had beat expectations, the lowest level in 10 years, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.“Investors are now faced with losing the catalyst that strong earnings growth typically provides during reporting season,” said Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.Bank stocks continued to rally, as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America beat analyst expectations with fourth-quarter results, but materials, the other star sector of this year’s rally, sold off as profit fell at copper miner Freeport-McMoRan and Newmont Mining lowered its 2012 copper production forecast.BofA eked out a fourth-quarter profit on strong loan growth, although a lossmaking quarter for its investment banking unit weighed on performance, continuing the trend set by JPMorgan and Citigroup.Morgan Stanley declared a loss, but one that was much smaller than expected by analysts, as the investment bank bucked the trend to report an increase in trading revenue.BofA closed up 2.4 per cent to $6.96, after breaching $7 for the first time since the end of October in the morning session. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.4 per cent to $18.28. Other big bank stocks also rallied, except for Wells Fargo, which slipped 0.3 per cent to $30.15.Regional bank Huntington Bancshares fell 4 per cent to $5.79 as its average return on assets fell slightly despite a surge in lending, as the low interest rate environment appeared to take a toll.Freeport-McMoRan opened 2.5 per cent lower, before paring losses to end the day off just 0.2 per cent to $44.37. Fourth-quarter profit of $640m was less than half the figure for the same period in 2010. But many analysts had predicted worse results, after labour disputes hit production at its Indonesian mines in the fourth quarter. Newmont Mining fell 1.2 per cent to $59.60, after raising its forecast for gold output, but lowering guidance on copper extraction.Gas-focused energy exploration and production companies continued their torrid 2012, after natural gas futures, which have been plummeting for some time, hit a decade low.Cabot Oil & Gas fell 6.5 per cent to $63.09 and Range Resources fell 4.1 per cent to $54.06. Cabot is now off almost 17 per cent year to date.Ebay climbed 3.9 per cent to $31.51, as the company beat fourth-quarter estimates, thanks mainly to heavy usage of its PayPal electronic payments site. But some analysts focused on the less than stellar performance at Ebay’s core internet auction website business.“We continue to question the sustainability of the recent mid-teens core general merchandise volume growth rates heading to 2012,” said Brian Nowak at Nomura.Car parts manufacturer Johnson Controls slumped 8.4 per cent to $32.60 for the worst performance in the S&P 500 as the company lowered full-year earnings guidance, citing weakness in demand from Europe.But the aircraft part supplier Rockwell Collins climbed 5.5 per cent to $59.96 after the company said it was doubling production of parts for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner this quarter.First Solar slumped 10 per cent to $38.70, on reports the German government will cut subsidies for solar energy. The solar industry remains heavily dependent on support from eurozone governments for demand.Eastman Kodak, the company that invented the handheld camera, ended a prolonged share price slide by filing for bankruptcy. The shares were last trading at 36 cents.

The S&P 500 closed at 1,277.3, less than a quarter of a point up for the day, with financials bearing the brunt of selling, off 0.5 per cent.Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $15.94, while the afterglow from Citigroup’s $2.5bn bond offering on Tuesday, its largest such debt issue since 2009, did not last long. Its shares fell 0.6 per cent to $28.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.2 per cent to 12,418,42 and the Nasdaq Composite index was flat at 2,648.36, although the Nasdaq had opened sharply lower as technology stocks suffered.Ebay, the auction website, fell 3.8 per cent to $30.16 after Yahoopoached Scott Thompson from Ebay-owned PayPal as its new chief executive. Yahoo investors were unimpressed however, sending shares down 3.1 per cent to $15.78.Data storage company Netapp fell 3.1 per cent to $35.64 after a downgrade from Credit Suisse analysts, who tipped the company’s rate of market share growth to slow in 2012.Shares in Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, slumped 3.7 per cent to $97.48. The stock was a darling of internet investors in 2009 and 2010 as it saw rapid customer growth but Mark Moerdler at Sanford Bernstein said the company may be unable to prize more market share from smaller rivals. “Looking forward, we believe it will become more difficult for Salesforce.com to grow,” Mr Moerdler wrote to clients.Netflix shares surged 11.4 per cent to $80.45, after the company said users had streamed 2bn hours of video from its website in the fourth quarter. However Netflix did not provide comparative figures for previous quarters.Cabot Oil & Gas climbed 7.2 per cent to $82.32 after the company raised its dividend 33 per cent to 16 cents a share and announced that it had doubled production in the Marcellus Shale during 2011. Separately, Cabot announced a two-for-one stock split.Shares of car vendor AutoNation fell 6.8 per cent to $33.26 after Edward Lampert’s ESL fund cut its stake in the company to 52.5 per cent from 56.4 per cent. Mr Lampert also reduced ESL’s stake in car parts retailer AutoZone to 12.6 per cent from 21.7 per cent, but after falling sharply at the open, shares recovered to close 2.2 per cent higher at $326.96.Chipotle Mexican Grill climbed 2.2 per cent to $348.75 after Goldman Sachs analysts added the fast food restaurant to its “conviction buy” list, tipping the company for earnings growth of 35-0 per cent this year as food costs fall, boosting margins.Shares in Chipotle rose almost 60 per cent in 2011 after more than doubling in value in 2010.Ford Motors rose 1.5 per cent to $11.30 as December sales rose 10 per cent, beating most analyst estimates. General Motors saw December sales growth of 5 per cent, which gave shares a 0.5 per cent fillip to $21.15. Both companies were left in the dust by Chrysler, which saw December sales leap 37 per cent compared with the previous year.Discount website Groupon fell 2.5 per cent to $18.79, significantly below the $20 offer price for its November IPO.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar fell 3.1 per cent to $34.70 as the Commerce Department said a decision on additional tariffs for Chinese solar-equipment would be delayed by a month to mid-February.CF Industries was up 2.7 per cent to $157.99, after Citigroup analysts recommended the nitrogen fertiliser producer.""Given the recent slowdown in fertiliser sales, we now prefer nitrogen as our top nutrient – nitrogen cannot be stored in the ground so its application tends to be steady,” Citi analysts told clients. MasterCard, off 3.3 per cent to $356.25, and Visa, off 1.8 per cent to $101.15, both fell as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its buy recommendations from both stocks.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare slid 5.4 per cent to $4.69, as investors continued to fret about long-term government funding for Medicare after Citigroup downgraded the sector on Tuesday."

The 14 per cent fall in Oracle’s shares early on Wednesday after its weak earnings report suggests that this particular stool’s one good leg is becoming wobbly.Oracle sells more software to big companies across industries and geographies than anyone else. In the past quarter, new software licence revenues grew just 2 per cent, a 10th of the rate of a year ago. It appears that those robust global companies are feeling a bit cautious. The pressing issue is what this means for the earnings of other big business technology vendors. These fit into two camps: the slow-growing value plays, and innovative growth plays (Oracle falls between the two).Consider a representative sample of the former – IBM, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, SAP, Dell and Xerox. Analysts expect near-term sales growth in the 3 per cent to 4 per cent range on average. Even this may be a bit optimistic, but the reason to own these stocks is their cash generation and low valuations more than their revenue trajectory. For the latter group – EMC, VMware, Salesforce.com, NetApp – the outlook is for strong double-digit growth. If the slowdown reaches cutting-edge parts of data storage, virtualisation and cloud computing, look out.Oracle is not a perfect bellwether. Last week’s results from technology services leader Accenture were solid. Business technology spending has not simply stopped. But Oracle’s results are unsettling, not just for other technology companies but for companies and investors who have hitched their financial wagons to the fortunes of the world’s largest companies.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
9;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
10;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2011-12-02T02:44:47Z;Wikileaks names 160 mass spyware vendors;;WikiLeaks has named 160 companies, including large corporations such as Alcatel-Lucent, Northrop Grumman and Siemens, that it claims are selling mass surveillance technologies, some of which are being used by repressive regimes in the Middle East.The publication is part of a new campaign launched by the whistle-blowing organisation, together with Privacy International, the pressure group, and media organisations from six countries, to expose the extent of spyware being used against civilian populations.Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, said mass surveillance had now become a multibillion-dollar business for western intelligence contractors, working on behalf of governments around the world. At least some of these, he claimed, were knowingly selling equipment to regimes, which were using them to persecute political opponents.“Who here has an iPhone? Who here has a BlackBerry? Who uses Gmail? Well, you’re all screwed,” Mr Assange told a press conference in London. “Intelligence contractors have surveillance systems for all those right now,” he said.“In the last 10 years, systems for indiscriminate, mass surveillance have become the norm,” WikiLeaks claimed on The Spy Files, a subsidiary website launched on Thursday. “Intelligence companies such as VASTech secretly sell equipment to permanently record the phone calls of entire nations. Others record the location of every mobile phone in a city, down to 50 metres. Systems to infect every Facebook user, or smartphone owner of an entire population group are on the intelligence market.”Mr Assange said these security concerns were partly the reason the company delayed launching a new, long-expected online submissions system allowing whistle-blowers to pass secrets to the website.The publication of this information by WikiLeaks follows recent allegations that equipment made by Trovicor, a former subsidiary of Nokia Siemens Networks, was used to monitor the communications of Bahraini citizens. Nokia Siemens Networks said it sold the Trovicor business in 2009 after “issues were raised about potential misuse of the technology, which were of concern to the company”.Three US Senators have asked the Obama Administration to investigate how the Syrian government obtained equipment from California-based NetApp and Blue Coat Systems. The companies have denied selling directly to Syria.Wikileaks released 287 documents on Thursday, which appeared to be mainly brochures and marketing documents related to surveillance equipment. However, Owni, the French media outlet working with WikiLeaks, revealed a page of a manual from Amesys, the French surveillance company, which apparently showed the pseudonyms of 40 tracked figures. Owni claimed that these pseudonyms corresponded to political dissidents that Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi had sought to jail or kill.Sophos, a UK-based IT security company named in the WikiLeaks files, said the whistle-blowing organisation had misunderstood the nature of its technology, which is used to help telecoms companies comply with tracking requests from police forces.“We actively ensure that our products comply with EU export restrictions and UN sanctions,” said Steve Munford, chief executive of Sophos.However, Eric King, human rights and technology advisor with Privacy International, said the problem was that surveillance technology was not included in most countries’ export restrictions.“Governments need to make sure that companies are no longer allowed to sell these products,” he said.Alcatel-Lucent, Northrop Grumman, Siemens, VASTech and Amesys were unavailable for comment.
11;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2011-11-18T19:24:41Z;Bears dominate Wall Street despite positive data;Major indices finish week down sharply;US markets spent the week threatening to break free from their eurozone shackles, only to be thwarted as the threat of contagion reared its head again.Bullish investors pointed to a flurry of positive US economic data – new unemployment claims fell to their lowest since April, while retail sales accelerated in October – but bears remained transfixed by sovereign bond yields in Europe, which spiked during the week.A warning from Fitch Ratings an hour before markets closed on Wednesday on US banks’ exposures to eurozone sovereign debt settled the tussle decisively in favour of the bears. The S&P 500 tumbled 2 per cent in an hour, turning a modest gain into a heavy loss.”Europe has been driving the market for a long time, and it will be driving the market for a long time to come,” said Channing Smith, a fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.The financial sector of the S&P 500 ended the week off 5.6 per cent, yet again falling more than any other sector.The investment bank Jefferies plumbed new year lows of $9.50 on Thursday, as yields on its benchmark 2018 bond soared above ten per cent, amid fears of interbank lending strain. The bank has been trying to reassure investors that its eurozone exposures are manageable. Shares recovered somewhat but were still ended the week down 9.6 per cent to $10.16.Other investment banks, which investors target when the eurozone is in the news, also fell. Morgan Stanley was down 13.1 per cent to $14.21 and Goldman Sachs was off 9.6 per cent to $91.91.The bankruptcy of MF Global continued to cast a shadow over the CME Group, the futures exchange, partially responsible for regulating the broker.The CME fell another 5.6 per cent this week to $248.89, as regulators publicly floated responses to the MF Global collapse.“We still think CME’s futures business remains strong,” said Alex Kramm, exchanges analyst at UBS. “But investors have no way of knowing what the regulatory fallout from the MF Global bankruptcy will be, so it’s no surprise the shares are soft.”The S&P 500 was closed the week down 3.8 per cent, trading at 1,215.66, its worst week since an awful September.The Dow Jones was off 2.9 per cent to 11,796.23, given ballast by Boeing, which ended the week up 0.8 per cent to 67.46, after securing its largest ever civilian aircraft deal from Emirates.The Nasdaq Composite index was down 4 per cent to 2,572.5.Despite the positive October sales data, several high profile retailers sold off after posting disappointing quarterly results.Abercrombie & Fitch fell 16.7 per cent to $47.30, as a high profile bet on European growth failed to pay off. Quarterly earnings per share of 56 cents were a full 15 cents lower than expected, as sales at flagship European stores disappointed.Walmart, whose exposure to value seekers normally helps it outperform in a falling market, fell 3.3 per cent to $57.23. The discount retailer reported sales growth at its US operation for the first time in two years, but analysts were alarmed by the large spending on discounts and special offers required to drive those sales.Sears slumped 13.5 per cent to $64.27, as its quarterly losses widened by almost 50 per cent compared to the same period in 2010. The loss of $2.57 a share followed a poor performance at the department store chain’s Canadian subsidiary.Midwestern oil refiners took a hit on news that the flow in a key oil pipeline will be reversed, alleviating the glut of West Texas Intermediate crude oil at Cushing, Oklahoma.Refiners with access to the WTI crude have benefited from cheap oil, but the discount of WTI compared to Brent crude narrowed sharply on the news.HollyFrontier, which is almost completely dependent on WTI crude, fell 14.4 per cent to $24.38. Other refiners were affected. Shares in Tesoro fell 16 per cent to $23.69. Although WTI only accounts for 20 per cent of Tesoro’s output, Citigroup had expected that output to produce 60 per cent of 2012 earnings.Semiconductor stocks had a volatile week with the Philadelphia Sox index tumbling 5.2 per cent.NetApp slumped 17.6 per cent to $34.74 after lowering guidance for the current quarter. The data-storage products maker blamed “unexpected weakness” at nine large accounts, and some analysts gave management the benefit of the doubt.“In our view, NetApp’s woes seem to be macro and competitive in nature and not due to execution mis-steps,” JPMorgan analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote to clients.Applied Materials fell 11.8 per cent to $11.23, despite unveiling solid profits of 34 cents a share in the third quarter.Orders from solar panel manufacturers for the company’s semiconductor products tumbled almost 75 per cent quarter-on-quarter to just $86m, forcing the company to lower forecasts for the current quarter, as solar firms cut back on expansion.Micron Technology jumped 15.8 per cent to $16.20, after a jury dismissed claims it had colluded with Korean firm Hynix Semiconductor to fix the prices of computer memory chips.Additional reporting by Johanna Kassel and Jason Abbruzzese
12;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2011-11-17T21:44:11Z;Jefferies sells off on funding concerns;Investors cheered by positive economic data;Jefferies plumbed new year lows on Thursday as bond traders sold the investment bank’s debt. Shares closed down just 2.2. per cent to $10.09 but earlier fell as low as $9.50, the first time the stock has fallen below $10 since November 10, when analysts highlighted the size of the bank’s exposure to eurozone sovereign debt.Jefferies has since taken steps to show its eurozone positions are manageable, halving its exposure in a single morning of trading at one point. But Thursday’s sell-off appeared to be linked to concerns about how the company funds itself.At 4pm, Jefferies’ benchmark bond, expiring in 2018, yielded 856 basis points more than US Treasuries of similar maturities, an increase of the spread by 135bp over the course of the morning, according to MarketAxess data.Better than expected unemployment data – new claims fell to their lowest in seven months– kept the S&P 500 steady in the morning session despite a renewed spike in eurozone bond yields. But just before 12.30pm, the benchmark index tumbled 25 points in a matter of minutes, with traders variously blaming a breach of technical levels or deadlock in Congress’ budget super committee.The S&P 500 closed off 1.7 per cent to 1,216.15, once again dashing bullish investors’ hopes that US markets can break free from eurozone shackles.”Europe has been driving the market for a long time, and it will be driving the market for a long time to come,” said Channing Smith, a fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent, with investment banks hard hit. Goldman Sachs fell 3.5 per cent to $92.30, and Morgan Stanley was off 3.6 per cent to $14.13.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 per cent to 11,770.80, but the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2 per cent to 2,587.99, as poor results from data storage company Netapp weighed on tech stocks.Netapp slumped 12.3 per cent to $35.64 after lowering guidance for the current quarter. The data-storage products maker blamed “unexpected weakness” at nine large accounts, and some analysts gave management the benefit of the doubt.“In our view, NetApp’s woes seem to be macro and competitive in nature and not due to execution mis-steps,” JPMorgan analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote to clients.But fears of falling demand for storage products hit related stocks, with hard disk drive manufacturer Western Digital off 5.8 per cent to to $25.26 and semiconductor supplier SanDisk Corp off 3 per cent to $49.52.Applied Materials fell 7.5 per cent to $11.53, despite unveiling solid profits of 34 cents a share in the third quarter.Orders from solar panel manufacturers for the company’s semiconductor products tumbled almost 75 per cent quarter-on-quarter to just $86m, forcing the company to lower forecasts for the current quarter, as solar firms cut back on expansion.Stephen Chin at UBS said Applied’s recent acquisition of Varian, another semiconductor manufacturer, could lead to a spike in implanter sales offsetting lower solar and display sales in 2012.Sears Holding Corporation dropped quickly after the bell, as the department store chain announced third-quarter losses, excluding some items, of $2.57 per share, an increase of almost 50 per cent compared to the loss for the same period in 2010.Shares recovered slightly but closed down 4.6 per cent to $65.19.Perry Ellis International saw its market capitalisation fall by more than one-third to $13.70 after it slashed full-year earnings per share guidance to $2 per share, compared to analyst expectations of around $2.50. The fashion retailer blamed heavy spending on promotions, which had not resulted in the expected increase in sales.MeadWestvaco was the stand out performer in the S&P 500, up 5.9 per cent to $29.51 after announcing it will spin off its consumer and office products unit and merge it with ACCO Brands in a transaction valued at about $860m. Shares in ACCO rose 26. 4 per cent to $8.80.CF Industries Holdings fell 10.2 per cent to $149.96, and Mosaic tumbled 7 per cent to $50.76, as falling corn prices raised fears that demand for fertiliser will far.“The perception among investors is that as the price of corn drops farmers cut back on fertiliser use,” said Colin Isaac, chemicals analyst at Atlantic Equities. “Although that does not always turn out to be the case, but fertiliser stocks are highly correlated to the corn price.”AMR Corp, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 5.5 per cent to $1.72, after hitting an 8 year intra day low of $1.63. Bankruptcy fears spiked again, on reports that American did not plan to restart negotiations with its pilot union, and chances recede of a deal to rein in costs.
13;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2011-11-17T20:38:35Z;NetApp: watch the canaries;Selling information technology to big corporations has been a gold mine;"Selling information technology to big corporations has been a gold mine for IT enterprise providers in recent years. Companies handle an ever-increasing amount of data and new tools for managing it have emerged. Revenue and profit growth at the leading IT providers has been strong, even during the downturn. As with any mine, however, watch the canaries.With $6bn in annual sales, storage vendor NetApp is a big bird. Results reported this week may have the miners worried. Revenue was up by a fifth but below expectations; margins and guidance were light, too. The company said the issue was “an unexpectedly large slowdown” in nine of its largest US accounts. Customers are looking for low prices in a market where “there is a lot of capacity chasing deals”. NetApp’s shares fell by more than a 10th on Thursday.Of the IT companies that have reported recently, NetApp provided the biggest negative surprise. But there are a few other queasy-looking canaries: EMC, another leader in storage, said that it expected slightly less than seasonal revenue growth in the next quarter, a view echoed by CDW, the big technology reseller. A glance at recent quarterly reports from the IT leaders (IBM, Oracle, Cisco Systems, Juniper, Hewlett-Packard and Dell) shows that there is a reasonably consistent pattern of revenue and net income deceleration. But the slowdown is not severe and is perhaps to be expected as the rebound from the 2009 recession recedes into the past. Margins have only faded slightly.The core strengths of the IT vendors – geographically diversified corporate customers with strong balance sheets and products that provide demonstrable returns on investment – remain. But the industry is not isolated from the larger economy. If global growth sputters, the chirping will stop too.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
14;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2011-08-18T20:53:44Z;Wall Street slumps on economic data;;Wall Street had its worst day in a week as investors reacted to higher-than-expected inflation and the lowest level for the Philly Fed’s business survey since March 2009.Materials stocks led the decline, down 5.8 per cent. AK Steel closed down 10.6 per cent at $7.83 and US Steel was down 9.37 per cent at $27.27, in anticipation of falling industrial activity.Technology shares also fell heavily for the second day running, down 5.3 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 5.2 per cent to 2,380.43.NetApp shares slumped 14.1 per cent to $35.85 after the California-based data storage provider missed revenue and sales targets, which pulled down rival data storage and circuit companies. EMC Corporation shares were down 8.5 per cent at $20.59, and Jabil Circuit shares were down 11.8 per cent at $14.27.Financials fell 5 per cent. Bank of America lost 6 per cent to close at $7.01 but finished above its low reached last week. Analysts at Credit Suisse this week lowered their earnings estimates for BofA but also recommended buying the shares at $14, rather than $17, citing an increased pace of asset sales.Citigroup fell 6.3 per cent at $27.98 and the closely watched KBW Banks index was off by 5.6 per cent.Wells Fargo, which is considered to have a stronger balance sheet than its rivals, fell 4.7 per cent to $23.72, and Goldman Sachs, which may benefit from market volatility in its trading businesses, fell 3.5 per cent to close at $113.14.The broad S&P 500 index was down 4.5 per cent at 1,140.68. It was the index’s third-biggest fall of the past two weeks but still well behind the nearly 7 per cent decline last Monday. US stock trading volume was at the highest so far this week but was still well off the highs seen last week.The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was off by 3.7 per cent at 10,990.88.Only 10 stocks in the S&P 500 advanced on Thursday. The best performer was the computer game retailer Gamestop. Its shares were up 4.7 per cent to $21.43, despite quarterly earnings of 22 cents a share, down 4 cents from the same quarter last year.Anthony Wible, digital media analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, increased his fair value estimate for the share to $30, on strong sales of used games. Used games sales, which accounted for 50 per cent of profits and bring in a profit margin of 50 per cent, were up 12 per cent, making up for a 10 per cent fall in the sale of new products.Gamestop is the most heavily shorted company in the S&P 500, according to Data Explorers, with 30 per cent of shares sold short as of Wednesday.Traders were reacting to a flurry of negative economic data. The closely watched Philadelphia Federal Reserve survey of business sentiment fell to -30.7, its lowest level since March 2009. In July, the index had been at 3.2.“I think ‘shock’ is the right word for the market’s reaction to the result,” said Colin Cieszynski, analyst at CMC Markets. “It has led to another round of investors throwing in the towel on stocks.”A consolation, according Mr Cieszynski, is that the main indices are still trading above the lows of last week, so investors are unlikely to face margin calls that would trigger forced selling. “Unless traders took bullish positions over the weekend, their positions are likely covered. That means if sentiment turns round, there is a chance of a rally,” he said.The consumer price index rose 0.5 per cent month on month in July, more than double the average forecast of 0.2 per cent and the most in four months. Excluding volatile energy and food prices, inflation was at 0.2 per cent. Jobless claims were up in the week to August 13 at 408,000, also higher than expected.Homebuilders fell after existing home sales dropped to 4.67m in July, from 4.77m in June, bucking expectations of a rise. Shares in land developer PulteGroup were down 11.5 per cent to $4.16.Retail groups were down after Sears, the department store, posted losses of $1.13 a share for the second quarter, far worse than the forecast loss of $0.46 a share. Sears shares were down 8.2 per cent at $55.23.Same-store sales at Sears were down 1.2 per cent, while same-store sales at Sears’ discount Kmart branded stores were flat, which followed a trend this week of better performances by discount brands.Sears’ results overshadowed positive earnings from Limited Brands, the owner of the Victoria Secret’s and La Senza lingerie brands. Limited posted earnings of 48 cents a share, 2 cents higher than consensus expectations, and raised expected annual earnings from $2.45 to $2.50 a share.Same-store sales were up 9 per cent compared with a year ago, and the company predicted same-store sales could rise as much as 10 per cent again in August. Limited shares were down 1.8 per cent at $33.73 at the close.
15;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2011-05-26T20:44:29Z;Wall Street shrugs off weak economic data;;The retail sector bounced higher after a slew of strong earnings results from the likes of Tiffany and Guess, helping the wider market to shrug off weak employment and growth data.Shares in Tiffany were up 8.6 per cent to $76.04, the best-performing stock on the S&P 500, after the jeweller reported a 26 per cent jump in first-quarter net income and raised its full-year earnings guidance.The stock has risen 74.4 per cent over the past year, benefiting from recovering demand for high-end goods and its expansion into international markets.Elsewhere in the retail sector, Guess reported a 15 per cent drop in quarterly profits as higher costs offset a 10 per cent increase in revenue but earnings per share came in better than expected and the stock jumped 11.2 per cent to $44.57.These strong results helped the S&P retail index put on 0.6 per cent and the consumer discretionary index add 0.8 per cent, the best performing on Wall Street. Looking to the wider markets, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.4 per cent at 1,325.69.The gains were limited by lacklustre data on employment and economic growth.The commerce department announced that the US economy grew at an annual rate of 1.8 per cent in the first quarter, disappointing investors who had hoped the figure would be revised up to 2.2 per cent.Separate data showed that initial unemployment claims increased by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 424,000 last week, which was also worse than economists had been expecting.This data will do little to allay the mounting concern that the US economy is entering a protracted slow patch that will keep the equity markets in a depressed state for the summer months.The S&P 500 has lost 2.8 per cent so far this month on these concerns.“The employment and GDP data were disappointing,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management. But he was optimistic about the rest of this year, saying that softer oil prices and promising signs of a resolution to the European sovereign debt crisis could yet see life return to the equity markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent to 12,403.236 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.8 per cent at 2,782.92. The S&P, Dow and Nasdaq indices are all still trading below their 50-day moving averages, despite the gains in the last two sessions.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Freescale Semiconductor saw a modest bounce in its first day of trading after pricing its initial public offering at the bottom of an already reduced price range on Wednesday.Shares in the private equity-owned chipmaker were up just 1.8 per cent to $18.33, suggesting that the hot market technology initial public offerings did not extend much beyond internet stocks.Shares in LinkedIn, the business-focused networking website, were up 109.4 per cent on its first day of trading last week while Yandex, the Russian search engine, was up 55.4 in its first day after pricing on Monday evening.

16;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2011-05-18T20:48:33Z;Energy and materials lift Wall Street;;Strong earnings from Dell buoyed related technology stocks and helped lift sentiment on Wall Street, pulling the wider markets into positive territory for the first time in three sessions.Dell was up 5.4 per cent to $16.75, making the stock one of the best performing on the S&P 500, after the company reported a 177 per cent rise in first-quarter profits.The better than expected jump in earnings came thanks to growth in sales to large businesses, which outweighed the weakness in sales to retail customers.Dell raised its earnings and revenue outlook for the year, in contrast to Hewlett-Packard, which lowered its forecast in the previous session as the weakness in consumer markets ate away at earnings.Shares in HP were down 9.7 per cent this week after falling another 1.1 per cent on Wednesday to $36.49.The results from Dell boosted related stocks in the computer hardware sector. NetApp, a provider of data storage, was up 2.5 per cent to $53.61, while Western Digital added 1.4 per cent to $36.82.Apple, the second most valuable company in the world by market capitalisation, gained 1.1 per cent to $339.87.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent to 1,340.68, its best day of trading in nearly a month. The index was helped higher by energy and materials stocks, which benefited from a rise in commodity prices.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, gained 3.8 per cent to $48.62, helping the S&P materials index up 2.1 per cent. Marathon Oil, the energy group, added 3 per cent to $51.53 as the wider S&P energy index put on 2 per cent.The gains helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 0.7 per cent to 12,560.18 and the Nasdaq Composite put on 1.1 per cent to 2,815.The markets saw little reaction to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting in April which yielded no major surprises.The markets have been in a correctional phase since the beginning of the month, with the S&P 500 falling 1.7 per cent in the past few weeks. Sentiment has been weighed down by commodity price swings, European debt woes and worries about the end of QE2.The concerns have led to a classic “risk off” trade, with investors rotating away from cyclical stocks and into more defensive sectors.The S&P healthcare and utility sectors are up 3.2 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively this month while the energy and materials sectors are down 7.4 per cent and 5 per cent.The utility sector saw the day’s worst losses as the broader markets ticked up, prompting commentators to suggest this defensive rotation was coming to an end.“The defensive names have been overbought in the past few weeks and the riskier names have been oversold,” said Quincy Krosby, strategist for Prudential Financial.The retail sector was in focus after mixed results.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen fashion retailer, were up 3.4 per cent to $75.69 after the company reported a bigger than expected swing in first-quarter profits as margins and international sales improved.The stock is up more than 30 per cent so far this year.Target, the discount retailer, reported a 2.7 per cent rise in first-quarter profit thanks to better than expected results in its credit card businessBut the stock was 1.6 per cent lower to $49.96 as investors worried about the softer sales at its stores.Shares in Staples were hit by a strong reaction to the office-supply company’s first-quarter earnings.The stock was down 15.4 per cent to $16.63 after the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results and lowered its full-year earnings forecast by 15 cents a share to $1.35-$1.45.Staples posted a profit of 28 cents a share or $198.2m, short of the 32 cents expected.The S&P retail sector was down 0.3 per cent.Shares in Analog Devices were up 5.9 per cent to $42.60 after the chipmaker reported a 45 per cent jump in second-quarter earnings and lifted its forecasts for the current quarter above expectations. The company raised its dividend.John Deere, the top manufacturer of farm equipment by revenue, reported healthy earnings and raised its full-year outlook due to growing demand for tractors from farmers benefiting from the commodity boom. But investors were hoping for more, and the stock was down 0.5 per cent to $86.50.
17;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2011-05-17T21:14:09Z;Wall Street slips on poor US housing data;;Hewlett-Packard fell sharply after the technology group lowered its full-year earnings forecasts, while the wider markets fell for the third consecutive session after disappointing housing and industrial production data.Shares in the largest maker of personal computers by sales fell 7.3 per cent to $36.91, the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, after the group scaled back its revenue and profit forecasts for 2011.The company blamed the Japanese earthquake, slow sales of personal computers and reduced profit in its services business for the lower outlook.The stock was not helped by a degree of confusion surrounding the results. HP reported a day earlier than planned after a leaked memo from Léo Apotheker, its new chief executive, in which he warned that the company was facing “another tough quarter”.The disappointing results affected related technology stocks. NetApp, a provider of data storage, was down 1.5 per cent to $52.28 while SanDisk lost 3.4 per cent to $46.34.The S&P technology index was down 0.2 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down fractionally lower to 1,328.98 as sentiment was weighed down by data showing a sharp drop in US house construction.The number of houses built in April fell 10.6 per cent from the previous month, according to the US Department of Commerce, as oversupply sapped demand for new buildings.New building permits, a gauge of future construction, dropped 4 per cent in an indication that the sector will remain a drag on the economic recovery.This news weighed on homebuilding stocks. DR Horton, one of the largest US housebuilders, was down 1.7 per cent to $11.47 while Lennar lost 0.5 per cent to $17.50. The S&P homebuilding index declined 0.8 per cent.Data from the Federal Reserve showed an unexpected drop in manufacturing output last month. The 0.4 per cent fall was the first in 10 months and was led by an 8.9 per cent drop in autos.Industrial output remained static in the month, which was worse than the slight increase economists had been expecting. The news weakened stocks across the industrial sector. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, was down 3.1 per cent to $102.81 while Joy Global fell 2.5 per cent to $86.19. The S&P industrial index was down 1.3 per cent, the worst performing sector on Wall Street.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.6 per cent to 12,479.58 and the Nasdaq Composite flat at 2,783.21.The broader markets have been in decline since the start of May as sentiment has been weighed down by sharp commodity price swings, European sovereign debt woes and worries about the end of quantitative easing.“The path of least resistance may be to the downside near term,” said analysts at Citigroup. “With traditional summer seasonality and some significant uncertainties … it does not appear likely that equity markets can bounce higher this summer.”The retail sector was in focus after mixed results from Walmart and Home Depot.Walmart was down 0.9 per cent to $55.54 after the world’s biggest retailer reported that sales in US stores that had been open more than a year had dropped for the eighth consecutive quarter. Net income rose 3.1 per cent to $3.6bn in the quarter, which served to limit the losses on the stock.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, was up 1.1 per cent to $37.40 after it raised its earnings outlook for the year and reported a strong gain in first-quarter income.Energy and material stocks lost ground as commodity prices softened.Materials was one of the worst performing sectors.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, fell 2.8 per cent to $16.45 and Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 1.1 per cent to $46.83. The S&P materials index was 1.1 per cent lower.In the energy sector, Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, declined 0.2 per cent to $82.06. Cameron lost 2.3 per cent to $47.77. The S&P energy index was down 0.2 per cent.The financial sector was one of the few to gain in the session, led by Wells Fargo, which put on 3.2 per cent to $28.75.The S&P financial index added 0.7 per cent.
18;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2011-03-10T21:43:33Z;Tech stocks drag down Wall St;;A pull-back in technology shares matched a broad decline in US stocks as confidence in the economy was hit by troubling data.The Nasdaq Composite index, weighted towards tech groups, dropped 1.8 per cent to 2,701.02, below its 50-day moving average, a key technical marker.Especially troubling was a report from China that Hewlett-Packard, the personal computer maker, was considering spinning off its PC business.HP said the unit was not for sale, and many analysts discounted the likelihood of such a move.But HP shares were off 1.4 per cent to $41.48, their lowest level of the year. Rival Dell was off 1.2 per cent to $15.24.The moves followed a report from analysts at JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday that supply of “tablet” PCs, like Apple’s iPad and Motorola’s Xoom, could outstrip demand by 36 per cent. Shares in Apple were off 1.7 per cent to $346.67.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2.5 per cent, adding to its 3 per cent drop on Wednesday, to below its own 50-day moving average.“Semiconductors are the best indicator, because they go into everything, from toasters to aeroplanes,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of US equity trading at Canaccord Adams. “The shares always top out first and bottom out first.”Micron Technologies fell 3.8 per cent to $9.93 a share and NXP Semiconductor was down 4.6 per cent to $26.51 a share.NetApp, a provider of data storage, fell 6.1 per cent to $48.41 after it sold its external data storage unit to LSI, a rival. LSI rose 3.1 per cent to $6.32.The broader S&P 500 index was 1.9 per cent lower at the close, at 1,295.11. The Dow Jones Industrial average was also off 1.9 per cent to 11,984.61. Both were, like the Nasdaq index, below their 50-day moving averages.A negative jobless claims report was received as evidence emerged that rising oil prices were a threat to the economic recovery. The US labour department reported that 397,000 people filed unemployment claims last week, against a consensus forecast of 378,000.Trade data were also troubling. China reported a $7.3bn deficit as its exports, a key measure of global economic activity, declined. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit, widened to its highest level in five months in January. “To the extent that this surge reflects the strength of domestic demand . . . it isn’t necessarily a disaster,” said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics.“Nevertheless, it is a concern, particularly when we know that the latest surge in the cost of imported oil will drive the deficit above $50bn over the next few months.”Energy shares pulled back as US oil prices fell, though they remained above $100 a barrel.The S&P 500 sector fell 3.6 per cent, its worst one-day decline since last June. Chevron, the oil group, fell 3 per cent to $99.08, and rival ExxonMobil fell 3.6 per cent to $81.38.Materials and industrials groups were also hit hard. Caterpillar, the producer of industrial equipment, fell 3.9 per cent to $98.39 a share. Alcoa, the aluminium group, lost 3.1 per cent to $15.80.Shares in General Motors, the US carmaker, fell 2.6 per cent to $31.42 after it said that Chris Liddell, chief financial officer, was leaving the company.“Now [GM has] talented people in all the right spots but they don’t seem to want to hang around,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group. He said it was reassuring when Dan Ammann, the incoming CFO, said he planned to stay indefinitely.HCA, the hospital group that went public in a $3.8bn deal on Wednesday night, opened at $31.02, a 3.4 per cent rise from its issuing price of $30 a share.Starbucks, the coffee and beverage retailer, was the top gainer in the S&P 500, hitting an all-time high.Shares were up 9.9 per cent to $37.97 after it made a deal with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, makers of the Keurig single-cup serving system, to allow it to use Starbucks brands. Shares in Green Mountain soared 41 per cent to $61.71 a share following the deal, a record high.Iron Mountain, which handles data storage for companies, saw its shares jump 5.2 per cent to $27.66 after Elliott Management, a hedge fund, nominated four members to the board.Elliott has argued that Iron Mountain could unlock value if it spun off its warehouses used for storing documents into a separate property company.
19;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2011-02-17T22:45:05Z;Manufacturing data lift Wall Street;;Cliffs Natural Resources jumped on strong quarterly earnings while the wider markets edged to new 30-month highs as blockbuster manufacturing data outweighed disappointing employment numbers.The iron and coal miner’s record fourth-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, sending the shares up 7.2 per cent to $100.55. The company reported net income of $384.4m, or $2.82 per share, ahead of the $2.18 Wall Street expected.That lifted the iron and steel sector by 2.6 per cent, with Allegheny Technology, the speciality metal manufacturer, adding 1 per cent to $69.16.Indices fell in early trading after employment data showed that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits had risen by 25,000 to 410,000 in the second week of February – economists had expected the total claims to come in at 400,000.Data also showed that consumer price inflation had risen more than expected in January. Headline CPI was up 0.4 per cent while core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent.But losses on the S&P 500 were pared later in the session after data from the Philadelphia Fed showing that US manufacturing had risen strongly in February, surging unexpectedly from 19.3 in January to 35.9 in February.“The Philly Fed number was extraordinary,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. “It just blew away expectations.”That helped the S&P 500 to close up 0.3 per cent to 1,340.43, a fresh 2½-year high. In the previous session the index reached the point where it had doubled from its March 2009 low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher to 12,318.14 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2 per cent to 2,831.58.The industrial sector saw healthy gains after the release of the manufacturing figures.Masco, the US building products group, was up 3 per cent to $13.20 while the S&P construction and materials index added 1.3 per cent.The data managed to outweigh concerns over global political instability as unrest continued to spread throughout the Middle East, lifting oil and gold prices.The turmoil did help certain sectors and stocks, however. The oilfield service sector gained from the higher oil prices, rising 1.7 per cent with Noble up 3.5 per cent to $41.33 and Halliburton adding 2 per cent to $48.43.Newmont Mining, the gold miner, was up 1.7 per cent to $58.96 as gold prices spiked up.In earnings news, CBS said net profit had risen 78 per cent to $319.4m in the fourth quarter.Earnings for the media group were boosted by local advertising revenue as television, radio and billboards proved popular with advertisers rebounding from the recession. This lifted the stock up 1.1 per cent to $22.35.Williams, the energy group and gas pipeline operator, added 8.4 per cent to $30.08 after announcing that it planned to separate its exploration and production businesses into two independent, publicly traded groups. The company also said it would boost its quarterly dividend by 60 per cent to 20 cents a share for the first quarter of 2011.That helped lift El Paso, another pipeline owner, by 3.9 per cent to $18. The stock was also helped by news that Raymond James Financial had raised its rating on the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”. The S&P pipeline index was up 6.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the energy sector, Duke Energy said fourth-quarter profit had risen 23 per cent, boosted by asset sales, sending its shares up 2.4 per cent to $18.12. Duke agreed to buy rival Progress Energy in a $13.7bn deal that would create the largest power utility in the US.Disappointing results from NetApp weighed on the technology sector.The data storage technology company fell 6.5 per cent to $54.77 after its third-quarter figures showed that revenues had fallen because of component shortages. The computer hardware sector was down 1.2 per cent.Weight Watchers International, which provides services and products for dieting, surprised the markets by issuing a 2011 guidance that far surpassed investor expectations, sending its shares up 45.6 per cent to $65.39.Skechers, the shoe company, was down 0.1 per cent to $22.06 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings had fallen by 88 per cent.
20;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2011-01-25T21:46:32Z;Merrill Lynch to settle SEC trading probe;;"Merrill Lynch has agreed to pay $10m to settle allegations that its proprietary traders misused client information for their own strategies.The settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission comes as US regulators craft rules to limit financial institutions from investing on their own account, a practice known as proprietary trading. Several financial groups have begun spinning off their “prop” desks in anticipation of the new rules.The Financial Stability Oversight Council of leading regulators issued a study earlier this month acknowledging concerns that banks could disguise proprietary trading through market making activities, in which they facilitate buy and sell orders for clients.The Merrill settlement depicts frequent communication between its proprietary and market-making trading desks.Merrill agreed to settle, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. “Merrill Lynch adopted a number of policy changes to ensure separation of proprietary and other trading and to address the SEC’s concerns,” said spokesman Bill Haldin. The company “voluntarily implemented enhanced training and supervision to improve the principal trading processes”, he added. Bank of America acquired Merrill in 2009.In reaching its settlement, the SEC said it took into account remedial measures taken by BofA. “This was a complex case involving complicated trading that took time to investigate thoroughly,” said Scott Friestad, a senior SEC enforcement attorney.The SEC alleged that Merrill’s proprietary traders on its Equity Strategy Desk, which managed $1bn for the company’s own account, sat on the same floor as market makers.From 2003 to 2005, they sent instant messages about client trades in violation of agreements to keep the information confidential. Merrill market makers were also given incentives to share order information with proprietary traders and were promised higher bonuses for“trading ideas” that turned out to be profitable, the filing alleged.In one instance, a trader sent a message to a market maker stating “always like to do what the smart guys are doing”.After a customer placed orders to buy 120,000 shares of Harmony Gold Mining, a
market maker sent an instant message to a proprietary trader saying the customer was “buying hmy”, referring to the company’s ticker symbol. The SEC alleges that 19 minutes later, the proprietary trader placed an order to buy 60,000 shares.The SEC also alleged that from 2002 to 2007, Merrill’s market makers improperly charged their clients by marking up or down the price of stock they bought or sold instead of charging only a commission.In one instance, it alleged Merrill executed an order to buy 300,000 shares of NetApp for a client, then marked up the order by filling it at a higher price than what Merrill paid for the securities in the market. When executing an order to sell 5m shares of Novell, Merrill filled the order at prices below the price the broker executed it at in the market."
21;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2010-11-18T21:43:24Z;US stocks jump on GM IPO;;General Motors’ initial public offering and hopes that Ireland will be bailed out boosted investor confidence, helping US stocks rebound.GM rose 3.6 per cent to $34.19, after earlier jumping as much as 7 per cent, in the automaker’s first day of trading since it was rescued. The carmaker raised $20.1bn in the largest American IPO, allowing the US government to reduce its stake.The offering priced at $33 a share, higher than the initial range of between $26 and $29. GM also increased the size of its offering from 365m to 478m shares. A high volume of shares were traded.Shares in rival US car company Ford, which have surged 67 per cent this year, fell 3.4 per cent to $16.12.Trading in the two carmakers accounted for about 5 per cent of total volume.“It’s quite fascinating that GM was able to raise such a large amount of money,” said Steven Roge, portfolio manager at RW Roge & Co. “The market is just itching to get money invested. When the Treasury yield is 1 to 2 per cent people want something with the potential to grow over time and distribute dividends.”The S&P 500 closed up 1.5 per cent to 1,196.69, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.6 per cent to close at 11,181.23 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.6 per cent higher at 2,514.40. All 10 principal sectors of the S&P 500 were trading higher, with eight rising by more than 1 per cent. But the S&P 500 was still lower by 1.7 per cent over the past five days.Investors have been shaken this week by Ireland’s debt problems. However, Ireland’s central bank governor calmed markets when he said Dublin was “definitely likely” to ask for a loan of “tens of billions” of euros from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.In technology, NetApp fell by as much as 7.8 per cent on Wednesday, after its results were released just before the closing bell. The drop triggered the circuit breaker put in place after May’s “flash crash”. But the shares rebounded on Thursday, by 7.9 per cent to $53.12, leading the S&P500.Investors had been concerned when the company followed Cisco in warning that the rise in technology spending was tailing off. But the maker of computer storage systems had more positive news for the market on its conference call, saying it expected to take market share and was considering share buy-backs.Mark Moskowitz, an analyst at JPMorgan, recommended buying after the sell-off, saying NetApp remained “one of our top picks” and expected the company’s revenue to grow faster than its peers. as the enterprise reinvestment cycle continues to gather steam.In deals news, Walter Energy bid $3.3bn in cash and shares for rival miner Western Coal, in the latest in a series of coal industry deals. The offer values Western Coal shares at C$11.50, a 55.8 per cent premium from the close on Wednesday. Shares in Walter Energy rose 2.3 per cent to $96.86 while US-listed shares in Canadian Western Coal jumped 46.5 per cent to $10.59.In a busy week for retail earnings, chains continued to issue positive outlooks.Limited Brands, the owner of lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret, raised its forecast for 2011 earnings to a range with a top limit above the average analyst estimate. The retailer declared a special dividend of $3 a share and announced a $200m share buy-back scheme.The shares, which have surged 72 per cent so far this year, added 4.4 per cent to $33.26.Dollar Tree also raised its earnings forecast for 2011 as customers bought more groceries and beauty products at the stores. But its shares fell 1.7 per cent to $53.81.However, Sears broke with its fellow department stores, reporting a wider quarterly loss than the same period a year ago, and a drop in sales, when its competitors have been posting strong earnings. Shares in Sears fell 3.8 per cent to $63.70.Elsewhere, data released before the opening bell showed fewer people than expected claimed unemployment benefit last week, and the number continuing to claim jobless benefits fell.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s index of manufacturing activity in the region was better than expected, adding to optimism.
22;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2010-11-17T22:13:19Z;Consumer stocks lead the US risers;;More positive forecasts from retailers including Target helped the consumer discretionary sector lead the risers but overall gains were limited as data showed that prices in the US stagnated and housing starts fell.The consumer discretionary sector rose 0.7 per cent buoyed by a 0.8 per cent rise in the S&P 500 retail index.Target, the discount retailer, beat expectations and issued a positive forecast, repeating Walmart’s strong performance on Tuesday.Target said it expects this Christmas season to be the best in three years and it is hoping to lure shoppers with a new credit card, which offers 5 per cent off all purchases.Shares in Target jumped 3.9 per cent to $55.62.BJ’s Wholesale, another discount retailer, beat expectations and raised its earnings forecast for the year. It was reported this month that the warehouse operator had hired Morgan Stanley to run an auction for the company and explore strategic alternatives. It shares, which have risen 45 per cent so far this year, rose 3 per cent to $47.54.Strong retail earnings and upbeat outlooks were overshadowed on Tuesday by concerns about eurozone sovereign debt and potential inflation risk in China.But investors paused for thought after Tuesday’s sell-off and the S&P 500 closed up a fraction at 1,178.59. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1 per cent lower at 11,007.88 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent higher at 2,476.01.The gains were limited by two weak reports on the US economy.Core consumer prices – excluding food and energy prices – rose less than expected in October and the year-on-year increase was the smallest on record. The price of recreation, education and apparel dropped during the month.“While we’ve been on the sceptical side on the Fed’s new asset plan [quantitative easing mark two] these sorts of numbers only help their defence,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global.But he added that low inflation that helped retailers issue positive outlooks.“Inflation is pretty tame which is helping real spending power as wage income has been accelerating as the labour market is gradually improving,” he said.Construction began on fewer houses than forecast in October, a separate report showed, pushing the S&P 500 homebuilder index down by 2.4 per cent.Lennar lost 1.7 per cent to $15.50 and DR Horton dropped 3.1 per cent to $10.68.Elsewhere, NetApp declined sharply in the late afternoon when its results were released before the closing bell.The maker of storage equipment sunk 6.5 per cent to $49.25, and was followed lower by other data storage companies, when it said that there had been a slowdown in computer spending by corporations.Financials led the fallers as the Federal Reserve issued guidelines on how it will decide in banks can increase dividends and buybacks. The S&P 500 financials index lost 0.6 per cent with Morgan Stanley down 2.1 per cent at $25.09 and Wells Fargodeclining 1.2 per cent to $26.86.Deals and initial public offering activity continued. Dynegywas up 0.8 per cent to $5.06 after Blackstone raised its bid for the energy company at the last minute.The private equity firm offered $5 a share, valuing the company at $602m, after Dynegy’s two largest shareholders, activist investor Carl Icahn and hedge fund Seneca Capital, were fiercely opposed to the deal.The two shareholders said the new offer still undervalues the company but it was reported that Blackstone felt confident that it had the shareholder support needed for the increased bid.Shares in Dynegy have gained 8.8 per cent in the past five days but are lower by 44 per cent for the year to date.In a busy week for initial public offerings, including the General Motors IPO due on Thursday, Booz Allen Hamilton had its market debut on Wednesday.The consulting firm, majority-owned by private equity firm Carlyle Group, raised $238m selling 14m shares at $17 each. Its shares climbed 13.2 per cent to $19.25.
23;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2010-09-03T18:42:36Z;HP says cost for 3Par deal worth it;;Hewlett-Packard’s victory over Dell this week in a rapid-fire bidding war for storage technology company 3Par, should secure its lead over its long-term rival in the increasingly important data storage segment, according to the company.Its offer of $33 a share beat Dell’s final bid of $32. Dell’s first publicly disclosed offer of $18 had launched an intense contest for 3Par, a California-based company run by a former HP executive.HP reasoned that a price of more than three times 3Par’s stock valuation was worth it to stay ahead in a fast-growing market.Storage and analysis tools are vital as businesses shift towards cloud computing, in which data are housed remotely rather than on users’ PCs. The amount of data being amassed is doubling every 18 months, analysts say, and companies need cost-effective access to it from an increasing variety of devices.HP’s final price worked out to nearly nine times 3Par’s projected revenue for 2011 and left many industry experts shaking their heads. A top official at EMC, the leading data storage maker, said 3Par was clearly overvalued even during the earlier rounds of bidding.In the short term, 3Par will not do much for HP’s revenue. For that reason, Shaw Wu, analyst at Kaufman Bros, said: “While we understand and appreciate 3Par’s technology, we continue to find the price paid very rich.”In the second quarter of this year EMC had more than a quarter of external disk storage sales worldwide. IBM was second with about 14 per cent of the market, research group IDC said, with HP and NetApp in a statistical tie for third with more than 11 per cent apiece.HP is increasing its bets on storage. Dave Donatelli, a former EMC executive, has been running the company’s storage effort, as well as sales of big servers and networking gear, since earlier this year.Even before securing 3Par, HP sold more storage than Dell. Dell resells storage gear made by EMC, providing about 20 per cent of the latter’s revenue in the sector. Dell sold about $1.6bn worth of external storage in 2009, according to estimates from IDC.HP, by contrast, sells about $3.6bn in storage, Mr Wu said, and this figure could now grow to as much as $6bn in a few years, while remaining less than 5 per cent of HP’s overall revenue of $115bn last year.Worldwide sales of disk storage grew 21 per cent in the second quarter to $6.8bn, IDC said on Friday.
24;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2010-08-23T18:45:33Z;Big tech hunts for profits in data mountains;;The second move in about a year for a little-known data storage company highlights how big technology companies are scrambling to help their larger customers do more with the massive amounts of information they are collecting.Hewlett-Packard on Monday launched a bid for Silicon Valley company 3Par, which specialises in high-end data management gear that saves buyers money on power expenditures. In doing so, HP hopes to break up a $1.15bn offer from rival Dell.“3Par is probably the best high-end storage asset you can get right now”, says analyst Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital. “This is the technology asset to go for.”HP’s $1.6bn offer is not only a third more cash but could be more attractive on strategic grounds. Analysts pointed out that the two companies are geographic neighbours and HP has a larger salesforce that could spread 3Par’s wares further.With technology companies sitting on more cash than some groups in other industries, the sector’s leaders have been able to pursue acquisitions throughout the downturn because they are less dependent on debt markets to fund purchases, bankers said.That has been most on display in data storage, where the buying spree has gone on for years. The intensifying competition in the segment came into broader view last summer, when in the trough of the recession top storage group EMC outbid rival NetApp and bought Data Domain.But the largest companies, including HP, Cisco Systems and IBM, are also keenly focused on capitalising on the boom in storage as companies move towards virtualisation and cloud services.As the computing framework inside big companies becomes larger and more sophisticated, data storage is being removed from hard drives to remote storage locations, leaving servers to perform more specialised processing.Also, customers want that data to be easily accessible from multiple locations while being responsive to a greater number of analytical demands, providing an opportunity for makers of sophisticated gear and software.“Data storage has gotten increasingly more important and the big guys haven’t kept up on the innovation side,” says Jayson Noland, Baird analyst.Total data collection doubles every 18 months: telecommunications companies now collate information on every call, retailers track sales, and stock exchanges keep tabs on every trade.The big computer sellers want to take advantage of that and add sales of storage solutions and analytical tools to the servers, PCs and networking equipment.The rapid growth in the sector has made even generous takeover offers pay off, analysts say. When Dell paid 10 times revenue for EqualLogic in 2007, many said it had overpaid. But annual sales at the division have since soared to $800m from $140m and it looks like “Dell’s deal of the century”, Mr Noland says.Dell’s success probably gave it the confidence to offer an 87 per cent premium for 3Par. But HP was already on high alert, because its own storage offerings were a weak spot and because recently departed chief executive Mark Hurd had set the company on a course of acquisitions in related areas.“We’re very good at bringing in new technologies and growing them rapidly though the base,” says Dave Donatelli, HP’s storage, networking and services chief – himself a recent recruit from EMC.Financiers in Silicon Valley say HP has scouted out other potential storage acquisitions recently. The biggest prize would be EMC but only a select list of companies could afford it. They include Cisco, IBM and, again, HP.Additional reporting by Richard Waters and Helen Thomas

US producer prices also rose faster than expected in January, partly because higher gas prices and cold weather boosted overall energy prices.Wall Street, however, shrugged off most of the negative sentiment surrounding the day’s news and closed up for the third consecutive session. The S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to 1,106.75, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 10,392.90 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent to 2,241.71.However, S&P 500 futures fell around 7.8 per cent in extended hours in reaction to the Fed’s decision to raise the discount rate it charges banks for emergency loans to 0.75 per cent from 0.50 per cent.Walmart shares lost 1.1 per cent to $53.47 following disappointing fourth-quarter results. The world’s largest retailer by sales recorded comparable-store sales that trailed estimates.

29;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2009-10-23T12:08:50Z;EMC earnings beat expectations;;EMC, the world’s largest data storage maker, reported better than expected third-quarter earnings on Thursday, adding fresh momentum to the recovery being led by technology companies.In a familiar pattern for companies cutting costs while coming out of the recession, profits were down steeply even as revenues were more stable.Earnings for the quarter were $298.2m, or 14 cents a share, down from $393.4m, or 19 cents a share, during the same period last year. Revenue, meanwhile, dropped 5.3 per cent to $3.52bn.EMC said it forecast an uptake in fourth-quarter demand. It projected next quarter’s earnings to be 30 cents a share on sales of $3.98bn, compared with 28 cents expected by analysts.“Customers are signalling more comfort spending their IT budgets,” said Joe Tucci, chief executive.EMC’s sales were helped by two of its recent acquisitions. Data Domain, which it bought for $2.1bn in July after a bidding war with rival NetApp, performed well as customers look to its cost-saving de-duplication technologies.VMWare, a virtualisation company EMC bought a majority stake in for $635m in 2003, beat revenue forecasts on Thursday on the back of strengthening sales.EMC’s sales have dropped for three straight quarters as enterprise customers cut back IT spending. However, in signalling an improved fourth quarter, EMC joined a parade of big tech companies that are optimistic about the months to come.IBM, Intel and Google have all reported better than expected earnings in recent weeks and raised their forecasts. Together, the strong tech earnings suggest that after a sharp downturn that corresponded with the worst of the economic crisis, the technology industry could be recovering faster than other sectors.
30;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2009-10-19T22:18:30Z;Return of boutique advice;;Frank Quattrone is conservatively dressed in a suit and tie, and a little nervous. He does not want to talk about himself, not even about his low golf handicap. It is only when discussing technology mergers that he relaxes and becomes animated.He muses over what companies Dell and Hewlett-Packard should buy to protect themselves from Cisco’s encroachment into their server businesses, and wonders where this will leave IBM. More than golf, this “three-dimensional chess” is his game of choice.Mr Quattrone, a former star banker at Credit Suisse, returned to Silicon Valley dealmaking last year. He left the bank in 2003 and stayed out of the deal business for five years to fight legal charges that were ultimately dropped. Now, he has re-emerged at the helm of Qatalyst, the boutique technology advisory firm, which he started in March 2008.In spite of his long absence from the market and the lack of a big bank on his business card, Mr Quattrone has popped up recently as an adviser on a handful of prominent deals in the technology sector, thanks in part to a “golden Rolodex”. He counselled Google on Microsoft’s proposed takeover of Yahoo in early 2008, and in the summer he helped Data Domain, the data storage company, negotiate a tricky bidding battle in which both NetApp and EMC vied for ownership of the company.More broadly, Qatalyst is part of a broader trend in the sector of boutique technology advisory firms that is trying to draw business away from the more established players in the technology world.Mr Quattrone sees it as a return to the early days of technology in the 1990s, when a handful of West Coast boutiques handled the bulk of technology IPOs. These have now all either closed or been subsumed into larger companies.In the US, the new wave of technology boutiques includes Allen & Company, which has traditionally focused on media, Greenhill & Co, one of several New York boutiques to set up shop in Silicon Valley, and Moelis & Co, run by former head of the UBS investment banking arm Ken Moelis.In the UK, Arma Partners, a company specialising in technology, media and telecoms advisory work, has handled a big share of European technology deals over the past year, closing 11 deals since the 2008 market crash. Qatalyst also opened a London office earlier this year and both Thomas Weisel Partners, the San Francisco-based investment banking firm, and Piper Jaffray, the US mid-market investment bank, have recently bolstered their technology teams in the UK.Technology teams at many big banks have thinned out in recent years, as stock market debuts and the pace of deals have slowed. For the smaller technology boutiques this has presented an opportunity to build on what they claim is their deep specialist knowledge of the industry.“When I was taking companies public at Credit Suisse, we were taking only the top 10 per cent of companies,” says Mr Quattrone. “The technology world is under-served at the moment. Existing firms can service the top clients, but 50 to 75 per cent of the market is under-served.”Arndt Zinnhardt, chief financial officer of German technology company Software AG, who used Arma Partners during its $680m acquisition of IDS Scheer earlier this year, says specialist understanding is a powerful tool. “You are talking with specialists, with a deep understanding of technology, and when we deal with Arma we can select the individuals working on the assignment,” he explains.Boutique technology banks have always had their place. In the UK, Regent Partners, for example, has been handling a steady stream of small deals for technology customers for 21 years.The difference now is that some boutiques are increasingly trying to challenge the bulge bracket banks for work on bigger deals.Paul Guely, a former technology banker at Goldman Sachs who set up Arma Partners in 2003, says he has seen big banks as his competitors right from the start. Even the company’s first mandate – the $210m sale of Suse Linux to Novell – was won against serious blue chip competition. “We pitched against Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brothers and Citigroup,” he says. “Our firm had just opened for business, we were two partners with no announced deals, and our visiting cards had probably been printed the previous day. But as individuals, we each had 15 years experience and we got the business.”Many smaller clients like the individual attention that a boutique can give them. “If you think about the big household names in banking, they are interested in doing sizeable transactions,” explains Mr Zinnhardt. “The lower end is not their sweet spot, and you would not normally get their ‘a’ team.”Boutique bankers claim that the willingness to do small deals gives them an advantage. “If you only do the big deals you become just another bulge-bracket firm. If you don’t do the small deals, you are not in the flow,” Mr Guely says.The new breed of boutique bankers bristle, however, at any suggestion of being a cut-price option. “A boutique is not a corner shop. It is a high-end designer shop like Prada,” says Mr Guely. “We don’t see not being a financial supermarket as something to be ashamed of. In the last few years, the financial supermarket model has been completely discredited. Being a boutique is a badge of honour.”In some areas, however, boutiques find it harder to compete. Initial public offerings, where there is a need for underwriting capacity, for example, may work better at a one-stop shop. Having a large bank manage a market flotation can also be reassuring for potential investors. Entrepreneurs at London’s Seedcamp event for technology start-ups, for example, repeatedly told the Financial Times they would pick “Goldman Sachs or someone like that,” if they were planning an IPO.Boutiques may also lack the political clout. “Big banks can leverage relationships on more political deals – where the chairman is friends with the finance minis-ter of a country and can make things run more smoothly,” admits Mr Guely.Frank Slootman, chief executive of Data Domain, says that today’s boutique trend could force big banks to rethink how they handle their star technology advisers. After all, there are only a handful of bankers in the industry with enough clout to be able to run a boutique.“If a no-name banker that has started up on his own thinks he can just step up to a deal, you can forget it,” he says. “But Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have individuals who could go out on their own. It might be a message to the banks to treat those people well.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,350.05 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1 per cent to 1,989.22.Ryan Jacob, president of Jacob Asset Management, said: “Now that we are through earnings season, all the attention is on economic numbers, especially forward-looking indicators. Investors understand the jobs numbers will probably be the last to move.”But Eugene Profit, chief executive of Profit Investment Management said: “The data is probably a little bit more negative than the market seems to suggest. High unemployment remains a headwind.”Metals stocks also moved higher, boosted by commodities prices, which held on to most of the gains made during a surge in prices
on Wednesday on the back of figures showing oil inventories were surprisingly low.Nucor was up 1.2 per cent to $46.61 while rival steel maker AK Steel gained 2.7 per cent to $20.47.Worries about unemployment were exacerbated by concerns over the US consumer after results from Sears Holdings, which operates the Sears and Kmart retail chains.The company swung to an unexpected loss after failing to cut costs sharply enough to compensate for falling sales and market share. Its shares dropped 11.9 per cent to $65.Gamestop, the video game retailer, also dropped sharply after reporting quarterly earnings below what analysts expected.The company forecast continuing falling sales and said its full-year earnings would be significantly below current consensus estimates. Its shares gave up 7 per cent to $23.41.There was better news from Limited Brands, which owns the Victoria’s Secret underwear brand, after it beat estimates and raised its full-year forecast.But investors had hoped for better, after a bullish analyst call sparked a 4 per cent rise in the shares on Wednesday, and they gave back 1.6 per cent to $14.35.Two food companies also announced their quarterly results. HJ Heinz rose 2 per cent to $38.71 after higher prices for its products and lower costs helped mitigate falling sales.Meanwhile Hormel Foods, which makes Spam, also found gains with the company’s profits surging nearly 50 per cent from last year as the cost of animal feed fell. Its shares picked up 0.5 per cent to $37.44.“Even though revenues aren’t as bad as we might expect, we are still seeing the majority of profits come from expense cuts,” said Mr Profit.In the technology sector, data storage company NetApp fell 5.9 per cent to $21.55 in spite of reporting revenues and profit that were ahead of estimates.Investors avoided the shares after the company failed to provide an outlook for the rest of the year and replaced Dan Warmenhoven, chief executive, with Tom Georgens, chief operating officer.But there was optimism elsewhere in the sector after Goldman Sachs rated Google a “conviction buy”, saying it expects buoyant revenues from Europe, where growth opportunities should put the company at an advantage over some of its rivals. The shares gained 3.7 per cent to $460.41."
32;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2009-07-12T21:35:50Z;NetApp weighs up move after bidding war loss;;When NetApp announced it would purchase Data Domain in May, the company looked to be muscling its way into big leagues of the storage industry.Instead, a bidding war ensued, and NetApp lost. Last week EMC announced that it would be acquiring Data Domain, leaving its smaller rival looking outgunned and unprepared.The drama comes amid a round of consolidation in the data storage industry. Large vendors such as Hewlett-Packard and IBM are developing more full-service offerings, leaving smaller companies either to expand to catch up, or be left to serve increasingly niche markets.NetApp says it has signed a record number of new acccounts in the past year, but the loss of Data Domain is still viewed by observers as a blow.“NetApp always had this ambition of catching up with EMC, but now this is one more thing that NetApp doesn’t have,” said Juergen Urbanski of TechAlpha, a research firm.The deal was important to NetApp for two reasons. Data Domain produces popular “de-duplication” software that makes storage systems more efficient and there was very little overlap between the two companies’ customer bases, meaning that NetApp could have used the new accounts to sell more of its core storage products.But now it is EMC that has Data Domain’s lucrative technology (revenue at Data Domain more than doubled last year to $274m). Perhaps more importantly, EMC will use its purchase to try to steal market share from NetApp. “They’ll use Data Domain as a carrot to attract new customers,” said Rajesh Ghai, an analyst with ThinkEquity.In the wake of the lost bidding war, NetApp is putting on a brave face. Tom Georgens, chief operating officer, said NetApp had its own de-duplication technology, and that its core business – selling disc-based storage systems to large customers – was secure. Revenue at NetApp was $3.4bn for the last fiscal year, and has dipped only slightly during the recession.The question now for the company is, “what next”?Mr Georgens admitted it might look elsewhere for companies to buy. NetApp also has some extra cash to play with – it received $57m from Data Domain as a break-up fee.It could itself become an acquisition target. But the logical acquirers – including Cisco, Hewlett-Packard and IBM – may not have much incentive to pursue a deal since the first partners with EMC while Hewlett-Packard offers a similar range of products to NetApp and IBM already resells NetApp’s products.Mr Georgens said the company had not received any offers recently.NetApp may also be too big to acquire easily. Mr Ghai of ThinkEquity said it would probably fetch between $8bn and $9bn.These questions are raised amid a big shift as large companies and governments switch to disc-based systems from backing up data on tapes. “Most people are still on tape,” said Peter Bell, a partner with Highland Capital Partners who specialises in storage and worked at EMC for 10 years. “There’s a huge market opportunity here.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent up at 8,183.17 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.3 per cent to 1,752.55.“People are looking for a reason not to sell stocks right now, rather than to buy them,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Cannacord Adams.Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets, wrote: “The overall rebound appears to be somewhat muted, suggesting this bounce may be more of a pause in selling for now rather than the start of a new upswing,”Merck exerted significant pressure on the Dow amid speculation its cholesterol medicine fared poorly in a clinical trial comparing it with a rival drug from Abbott. Its shares lost 3.7 per cent to $27.01.But there was support from financial stocks after the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time last week was shown to be much lower than expected.Banks were particularly strong gainers, supported by the economic data and by signs of progress with the government’s latest plan to clear balance sheets of toxic assets.The Treasury announced on Wednesday evening the nine fund managers with which it will work to purchase those securities under the Public-Private Investment Plan, and committed up to $30bn to it.Citigroup rose 2.7 per cent to $2.69, while Bank of Americaclimbed 1.1 per cent to $11.97.Goldman Sachs climbed after BofA recommended buying the shares, saying second-quarter earnings would be better than previous estimates as trading and investment banking delivered strong revenues. Shares in Goldman gained 3.4 per cent to $143.21.The economic optimism was tempered however by renewed talk of a second stimulus plan, as billionaire investor Warren Buffett added his voice to those calling for the government to consider such a move.But George Feiger, chairman of Contango Capital Advisers, said this should be a bullish sign for stocks. “The first stimulus hasn’t begun to work yet, so the impact will be impressive if lawmakers vote in a second,” he said.Retailers were mixed as they reported their same-store sales for June.Target, the discount retailer, reported a steeper drop than predicted but the shares jumped 3 per cent to $38.39 after the company said its second-quarter profits would meet or exceed analysts’ estimates.But there was worse news for other retailers, including Limited Brands, whose shares fell 4 per cent to $10.89 after sales at its flagship Victoria’s Secret chain fell 14 per cent.Elsewhere, investors were betting that the possible sale of American Life Insurance Company by AIGto Metlife, its rival insurer, reported in the Financial Times, could be a better deal for Metlife than its competitor. The unit is regarded as one of the jewels in AIG’s crown, and the news sent Metlife’s shares up 2.7 per cent to $27.63 while AIG tumbled 27.6 per cent to $9.48.In the technology sector, NetApprose 3.4 per cent to $19.01 after it pulled out of the bidding for Data Domain, its rival data storage company, saying it could not match an increased bid made by competitor EMCthis week.Analysts said NetApp could now become an acquisition target itself. EMC’s shares gained 1.9 per cent to $12.76 but Data Domain fell 1.4 per cent to $33.44.
34;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2009-07-08T22:51:12Z;EMC wins tussle for Data Domain;;EMC will acquire Data Domain following NetApp’s withdrawal from the bidding war for it, ending a month-long saga that is set to reshape the data storage industry.The acquisition will give EMC, already the world’s largest maker of data storage systems and software, a fast-growing company with important new technology, while leaving the smaller NetApp exposed.“EMC is consolidating its position as a market leader,” said Juergen Urbanski of TechAlpha, a research firm. “It’s not clear what’s next for NetApp now.”Data Domain produces “de-duplication” software, which makes large disc-based storage systems more efficient. The company has grown quickly in recent years, as more enterprise and government customers switch from tape-based storage systems, to more powerful disc systems.Customers including AT&T and the US Army use Data Domain products to reduce their storage costs. Data Domain’s revenue more than doubled last year to $274m. In the first quarter of this year, the company reported $79m in revenue, a 50 per cent jump from the same period a year earlier.NetApp was the first to bid for Data Domain, saying it would acquire the company for $1.5bn in cash and stock in May. But just days later, EMC, NetApp’s larger rival, responded with an all-cash offer of $1.8bn. NetApp then matched that with another hybrid cash and stock offer.Data Domain surprised Wall Street saying it would accept the NetApp offer. Though the cash and stock mix appeared less lucrative than an all-cash deal, analysts said there were valid reasons Data Domain might prefer to be a part of NetApp rather than EMC.NetApp, like Data Domain, is based in Silicon Valley, while EMC is based in Massachusetts. And at NetApp, Data Domain would have been a bigger fish in a smaller pond, whereas EMC has a large portfolio of companies.But on Monday, EMC upped the ante once again, offering about $2.2bn, or $33.50 a share. This bid put Data Domain out of NetApp’s reach.“NetApp applies a disciplined approach to acquisitions, one focused intently on creating long-term value for our stockholders,” said NetApp chief executive Dan Warmenhoven. “We therefore cannot justify engaging in an increasingly expensive and dilutive bidding war that would diminish the deal’s strategic and financial benefits.”Data Domain’s board of directors approved the sale to EMC, and the company recommended that its stockholders sell EMC their shares.NetApp said it received a $57m break-up fee from Data Domain as a result of the broken deal.

36;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2009-07-06T21:14:07Z;Wall St defensive stocks provide support;;Defensive stocks spurred a late rally on Wall Street to turn US equities positive on Monday following the previous session’s heavy falls.Multinational brand names fared well as investors remained in a cautious mode ahead of the start of earnings season this week.Philip Morris gained 2.8 per cent to $44.15 and Colgate-Palmolive picked up 3.2 per cent to $74.38.But energy and materials stocks were a significant drag as investors continued to worry about the pace of economic recovery.Those concerns triggered a fall on Thursday ahead of the long independence day weekend after a worse than expected jobs report, and were further heightened by words from Joe Biden, the US vice-president, over the weekend.Mr Biden said the Obama administration had “misread” how bad the economy was when forecasting 8 per cent unemployment, which took a further toll on commodities stocks as investors worried about demand.The price of oil tumbled to a five-week low, weighing on ConocoPhillips, which lost 0.3 per cent to $40.83, and Schlumberger, which fell 2.1 per cent to $51.45.Metal producers also suffered and, with Deutsche Bank warning that demand for copper could fall 3.9 per cent in 2009, shares in Freeport McMoRan, which mines the metal, gave up 7.6 per cent to $45.94.Alcoa the aluminium maker that is due to start the earnings season on Wednesday, dropped 6.1 per cent to $9.26.“We could see a defensive rotation here as investors wait cautiously for the start of earnings season,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished 0.3 per cent higher at 898.72 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 8,324.87. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.5 per cent to 1,787.40.Many big name banks were also lower with Citigroup down 3.1 per cent at $2.79 and Bank of America3.9 per cent lower at $12.15.The financial sector was near its lowest level since the results of the government’s stress tests on bank balance sheets sparked a rally in May.American Express was one of the few financial stocks to find significant gains after Stifel Nicolaus, the brokerage group, said it may benefit from new legislation restricting teaser rates, which analysts said AmEx did not rely on.AmEx’s shares picked up 5.6 per cent to $23.52.The economic negativity was punctuated by promising signs from Ford and FedEx two companies that provide early signs on consumer and corporate health.Ford’s shares lost early gains after sales at the company’s joint ventures in China rose 14 per cent to record highs. They closed 2.4 per cent lower at $5.75.Meanwhile, Michael Ducker, head of FedEx’s international business, told a German magazine that he saw signs of a turnround in the second half of the year. Shares in FedEx were up 3.2 per cent to $56.04.Data from the Institute of Supply Management also provided a glimmer of economic hope, showing that business activity in the non-manufacturing sector was marginally better than expected in June.But analysts warned economic data would need to show more positive signs to trigger another rally.“For the market to continue to rally, the news will have to go from negative to neutral or positive, and investors have started to realise that,” said Matt King, chief investment strategist at Bell Investment Advisers.EMC provided some impetus to the technology sector after the company said it would increase its offer for data storage company Data Domain to $33.50 a share.This puts EMC in a head-to-head battle with NetApp, Data Domain’s rival, which received regulatory clearance for its own bid for the company.EMC picked up 0.9 per cent to $12.89 while NetApp was 0.6 per cent lower at $18.85. Data Domain rose 2.6 per cent to $34.06.In the telecommunications sector, Sprint Nextel rose as analysts at Auriga upgraded the stock, citing continued demand for the company’s Boost pre-paid mobile telephone contracts, which have sold well during the recession.Its shares gained 3.5 per cent to $4.47.
37;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2009-07-06T17:54:48Z;EMC raises offer for Data Domain;;EMC upped the ante in the battle for Data Domain on Monday, offering $2.4bn, or $33.50 a share, for the innovative data storage company that had agreed to be purchased by NetApp.The bidding war, rare for the technology industry, reflects the perception that Data Domain’s technology will be especially important as the storage industry evolves.EMC and NetApp have been trading bids for Data Domain since May, when NetApp announced it would buy the de-duplication company for $1.5bn in cash and stock. EMC responded with an all-cash offer of $1.8bn that analysts viewed as superior.But last month the Data Domain board surprised Wall Street when it rejected EMC’s offer, saying it would prefer to be acquired by the nimbler NetApp which, like Data Domain, is based in Silicon Valley.EMC is based in Massachusetts.EMC, however, has always been seen as the likely victor in this bidding war. The giant of the storage industry has more than $6bn in net cash, compared to NetApp’s less than $2bn.Data Domain shares rose on Monday, suggesting that Wall Street expected NetApp to respond with yet another bid. But some analysts said NetApp was fast approaching the limits of what it could spend.“NetApp doesn’t have the cash on the balance sheet,” said Rajesh Ghai, an analyst with Think Equity. “It’s going to hit its limit in terms of how much cash it can use for this deal.”Both EMC and NetApp’s desire to add Data Domain to their portfolio reflects the young company’s position as an emerging leader of the storage industry. Just eight years old, the company makes disc-based appliances designed to store data for large companies and governments for the long term.Its most valuable technology identifies duplicate pieces of data and removes the excess copy before it is written on to the back-up disc, increasing the system’s efficiency.Major Data Domain customers include AT&T and the US Army, which use the products to reduce storage costs. Revenue at Data Domain more than doubled last year to $274m. The company reported $79m in revenue during the first quarter of this year.NetApp had said that an acquisition of Data Domain by EMC would hurt competition in the emerging de-duplication market, and said Monday that it would weigh its options before providing an update “shortly”.EMC said Monday that it had won approval from the US Federal Trade Commission to pursue the deal.In a letter to Aneel Bhursi, Data Domain chairman, EMC chief executive Joe Tucci said: “Since June 1st, when we submitted to you our prior proposal, we have received wholehearted support from many of your stockholders and customers.”
38;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2009-06-18T00:26:01Z;Quattrone back in spotlight over Data Domain battle;;The bidding war that has broken out over data storage company Data Domain has put Frank Quattrone, once Silicon Valley’s most prominent banker, back at the centre of one of the tech industry’s most controversial financial battles.The deal has raised questions about how effectively Data Domain, advised by Mr Quattrone’s Qatalyst Partners, has handled the process, in particular its acceptance of an initial, relatively low, offer and its advice to shareholders this week to reject one of the nearly matching bids on the table.But if the process unfolds as Wall Street investors now hope, the company could eventually be sold for nearly double its price before the bidding war broke out, or more than $2bn, adding an important feather to Mr Quattrone’s cap as he attempts to put himself back at the forefront of deal-making in Silicon Valley.Mr Quattrone refused to comment, except to say: “I can assure you the Data Domain board is very focused on its fiduciary responsibilities.”The former star banker ruled over Valley dealmaking during the tech boom of the 1990s, thanks to his masterminding of initial public offerings such as those for Netscape and Amazon.com. He later faced obstruction of justice charges arising out of a probe of dotcom excesses, and eventually reached a deferred prosecution agreement, without admitting any wrongdoing, rather than face a third trial.Since reemerging on the Silicon Valley scene a year ago, Mr Quattrone has already been cast publicly in at least one other controversial battle. He advised Google chief excutive Eric Schmidt on his response to Microsoft’s attempt to buy Yahoo. That eventually led to Google’s own attempt to seal a partnership with Yahoo, which was dropped after opposition from the Department of Justice.Qatalyst was called in earlier this year to advise Data Domain, a fast-growing maker of storage technology, on a bid from larger rival NetApp. The companies agreed a cash-and-stock offer worth $25 a share, a 40 per cent premium to the market price, with Mr Quattrone’s firm providing an opinion that the deal was fair to Data Domain’s shareholders.News of the deal later prompted storage group EMC to pitch in with an unsolicited $30-a-share cash bid of its own. Wall Street is anticipating a final buy-out price of about $35 a share – 40 per cent more than the deal Qatalyst first ad­vised Data Domain to accept.Earlier this week, the company also advised its shareholders to reject EMC’s offer, even though the all-cash nature of the bid arguably made it superior to the NetApp’s own revised $30 a share offer.Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York University, added it was impossible from the outside for investors to know at this stage how open Data Domain is to an EMC deal. “They are giving a kind of weak reason for [rejecting EMC],” he added. “The EMC offer is being subjected to a bit of an obstacle course and they might go away.”Mr Smith predicted, however, that Data Domain would eventually be sold at a higher price, and said it appeared the company’s directors were doing all they could to manage the task of holding on to the NetApp deal while also trying to illict higher bids.In a regulatory filing with SEC, Data Domain said its board had decided not to look for bidders other than NetApp out of concern that the information would leak and damage its business. But it sought an agreement that would still leave it free to accept a higher offer if one emerged, subject to paying a $57m break-up fee to NetApp.
39;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2009-06-15T21:47:28Z;Data Domain rejects EMC bid;;A fresh round in the bidding war for Data Domain, a fast-growing company on the leading edge of data storage technology, looked imminent on Monday as the company rejected an all-cash $1.9bn bid from EMC.Wall Street did not expect the snub to deter EMC, the giant of the storage industry, from continuing its quest in competition with NetApp, a rival storage group that has already won Data Domain’s backing for its own cash-and-stock takeover offer for the company.Data Domain’s shares were changing hands on Monday at $33, a 10 per cent premium to the rival bids.With a stronger balance sheet and greater cash reserves, EMC is widely seen as holding the stronger cards in the rare tech industry bid battle, should it choose to continue to push its offer.EMC has already forced NetApp to raise its own offer from $25 to $30 a share, though the offer only guarantees shareholders that price if NetApp’s own stock stays within a relatively narrow 10 per cent price band. However, the current stock price already values the company at 85 times its expected earnings this year, and about six times its revenue.The bidding war reflects Data Domain’s position at the forefront of a technology shift under way in the data storage market. Set up eight years ago, the company sells disc-based appliances for holding data that companies and governments want to back up for the long term, replacing the tape systems that have traditionally been used. Its key technology involves software for de-duplicating data held on the discs, increasing the efficiency of the overall system.According to NetApp, a combination of EMC and Data Domain would hurt competition in this emerging part of the back-up business, giving EMC an unshakeable lead in a new technology architecture at just the moment that it is starting to gain traction.The claim comes days before a deadline for US antitrust regulators to decide whether to take a closer look at the EMC offer and issue a second request for more information on the proposal.Laura DuBois, director of research for storage at IDC, disputed the NetApp claim, calling Data Domain “one of three to five” leaders in the field. An EMC acquisition would create a “formidable force – in the same way that Data Domain and NetApp would be a formidable force”.In its own regulatory filings, Data Domain calls its markets “highly competitive”, listing existing tape-based companies and others as rivals.

41;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2009-06-04T14:50:12Z;Battle for Data Domain;Why NetApp and EMC want more storage;"The backing-up of data only reaches the forefront of most people’s minds when they hear a hard-disk drive go into its death throes. But businesses, under regulatory and commercial pressure to retain information, have turned this humdrum corner of the technology world into a profitable niche. Fireworks are flying as EMC and NetApp fight a bidding war for smaller peer Data Domain.The excitement is over software and hardware designed to reduce duplication. Data Domain specialises in identifying and removing multiple copies of files when a back-up copy of data is made. As IT departments move to using hard disks for storing archives, instead of densely packed rolls of metallic tape – which can be difficult to access – “deduplication” helps to cut costs. And as the volume of data that companies must process explodes, Data Domain is growing fast – analysts forecast sales growth of 28 per cent this year.Such prospects have translated into a rich price. At the $1.8bn enterprise value implied by the offers from its two suitors, Data Domain is valued at four times sales and a hefty 45 times earnings estimates for 2010. But EMC justifies its $30-per-share cash bid on the basis of more optimistic assumptions for growth were it to sell Data Domain’s products through EMC’s much larger sales force. The group has good form here: EMC bought VMware for $635m in 2003 and still owns 90 per cent, and VMware now has a market capitalisation of $12bn.Smaller rival NetApp sparked the Data Domain battle by first offering $25 per share, and has matched the $30 price, but in a mixture of cash and shares. With a determined EMC sitting on a $6bn net cash pile, and Data Domain’s share price still indicating a higher bid, NetApp looks to be outgunned.EMC entered a bidding war with rival NetApp over Data Domain, making a surprise $1.8bn all-cash offer for the smaller data deduplication company.EMC, the world’s largest maker of storage systems and software, is interested in Data Domain’s fast-growing deduplication business. Data Domain makes products that recognise multiple copies of the same document and delete the redundant ones.Large enterprises, including AT&T and the US of defence department, use Data Domain products to reduce storage costs. The company’s revenue more than doubled last year to $274m. In the first quarter of 2009, Data Domain reported $79m in revenue, a 50 per cent jump from the same period a year earlier.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

43;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2009-06-03T23:16:35Z;Rivals in bidding war for Data Domain;;The fate of the lucrative technology company Data Domain has set off a bidding war between two data storage rivals as they vie to control the emerging market for “deduplication” products.Data Domain on Wednesday agreed to be acquired by NetApp for $1.9bn, or $30 a share in cash and stock. The offer from NetApp matched an all-cash bid from EMC made on Monday. NetApp and Data Domain originally agreed to a deal at $25 a share on May 20.EMC is well positioned to take the bidding higher if it chooses, and analysts expect the larger company to win in the end. The world’s largest maker of storage systems and software, EMC had $6.3bn net cash at the end of March. NetApp had just $1.7bn net cash at the end of January.“At this point it’s really just about NetApp trying to make it more painful for EMC,” said Rajesh Ghai, an analyst with ThinkEquity.“At the end of the day, given that EMC has so much cash, it will prevail over NetApp.”Yet late on Wednesday, Data Domain accepted NetApp’s offer, signalling that it may prefer to be acquired by the more nimble NetApp than EMC. “We are pleased with the revised terms of NetApp’s acquisition,” Frank Slootman, Data Domain chief executive, said.Joe Tucci, EMC chief executive, said: “EMC’s all-cash tender offer remains superior to NetApp’s proposed part-stock merger transaction.” But he refrained from increasing his company’s offer.Such bidding wars are relatively uncommon in the technology industry. After Oracle agreed to buy Sun Microsystems in April, IBM, which had been in talks with Sun, did not produce a counter-offer.EMC and NetApp are both interested in Data Domain’s fast-growing revenues and skilled team. Data Domain makes products that identify duplicate copies of documents and eliminates the redundant ones, reducing its customers’ storage costs. The need for deduplication products is growing as enterprise customers produce ever-larger reams of digital data.Major Data Domain customers include the US Army and TiVo, which use the products to reduce storage costs. Data Domain’s revenue more than doubled last year to $274m, and Data Domain reported $79m in revenue during the first quarter of 2009.While both EMC and NetApp want the fast-growing Data Domain to provide a spark to their core business, the acquisition is also a productive way to use their idle capital. “Interest rates are so low, they’re not making much money on cash balance,” said Mr Ghai. “They might as well put the money to work.”

Data Domain makes products that recognise multiple copies of the same document and delete the redundant ones.Large enterprises, including AT&T and the US Department of Defence, use Data Domain products to reduce storage costs. The company’s revenue more than doubled last year to $274m. In the first quarter of 2009, Data Domain reported $79m in revenue, a 50 per cent jump from the same period a year earlier.Joe Tucci, EMC’s chief executive, said it would operate Data Domain as a separate unit within EMC, and also increase research and development in the company. At the same time, he said EMC would use its extensive sales and marketing organisation to sell Data Domain products.“This is a sign of the times,” said Rajesh Ghai, an analyst with ThinkEquity. “Asset values are cheap and these larger system vendors have a lot of cash.” EMC had $5.8bn cash on hand at the end of 2008.The acquisition of Data Domain would be the largest in EMC’s history. The company has long been an aggressive purchaser of companies, buying VMware for $635m in 2003. Today it operates as an independent unit within EMC and is valued at $12.6bn.Analysts said that while Data Domain has not responded, EMC is likely to prevail in the bidding. “I don’t think NetApp can beat EMC’s all-cash offer,” said Mr Ghai.Data Domain shares rose 16.5 per cent to $30.69 in after-hours trading.

It climbed 8.1 per cent to 31.39, its biggest daily rise since April 20.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 1.7 per cent at 888.33, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5 per cent to 8,292.13 and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 1.9 per cent to 1,695.25.“The uptrend was broken a week and a half ago. It may feel like a major pull back but when you think that we rallied from 660 [on the S&P], it doesn’t look so big,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.Regional banks performed particularly badly, with three of the largest selling new shares to boost their capital positions.Regions Financial fell
16.2 per cent to $4.10 after the company priced the stock sale announced on Wednesday at $4, an 18 per cent discount to Wednesday’s closing price.Meanwhile, Fifth Thirdwhich the government said needed an extra $1.1bn to survive a severe recession, filed to sell $750m worth of new shares. The stock lost 9.9 per cent to $6.95.Huntington Bancshares also said it would issue new stock in an effort to raise $675m in “capital actions”. The shares dropped 10.8 per cent to $4.30.Three companies that provide technology to businesses all beat analysts’ estimates, giving a generally positive snapshot of how corporate America is faring compared with expectations.Intuit saw sales of its TurboTax tax preparation programme boost revenues and lift earnings above predicted levels. Its shares gained 8.1 per cent to $27.27.Meanwhile, Computer Sciences saw its profits more than double, even as revenue fell, helped by tax benefits. The shares climbed 7.5 per cent to $39.95.NetApp also beat earnings estimates and the stock rose 3.1 per cent to $17.88. The company also announced it would buy Data Domain, its rival data storage company, for $1.5bn. Shares in Data Domain surged 34 per cent to $24.There were some positive signs on consumer activity as Limited Brands and Hormel Foods reported better earnings than expected.Limited Brands made a surprise profit, and raised its full-year outlook, sending its shares up 0.9 per cent to $11.76. The company, which owns the Victoria’s Secret underwear line, said cost cuts had mitigated the impact of falling sales.Hormel Foods, which owns Spam and other food products, also beat analysts’ expectations with higher profits. The company said customers were choosing to eat at home rather than restaurants, which helped stabilise revenues. The shares gained 2.1 per cent to $33.65.But Gamestop, one of the world’s largest video game retailers, gave up 15.5 per cent to $22.38 after slumping sales caused the company to miss analysts’ estimates.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned investors should not get carried away with the marginally positive signs on consumer and corporate health. “Economic growth is not as strong as the market is pricing – the retail environment is still tough, and the industrial and technology sectors are uneven,” he wrote.General Motors jumped 32.4 per cent to $1.92 after the United Auto Workers Union agreed to cut its labour costs and changed the terms of $20bn in debt for retiree healthcare."

I remember a sales call with the CIO of a large Wall Street firm. She started the meeting by saying: ”I think I know your story. You’re half the price and have amazing new features besides, right?”It seemed like an auspicious start, but she went on to say: ”Sorry, but my current vendor meets my needs, and cost isn’t an issue because we’ve got plenty of money.”She was polite but completely uninterested. She didn’t think anyone else on Wall Street would be interested either, and she was right. When there is no pain, there is no incentive to change.Two years later, after the dot-com crash, we had a completely different encounter. This time she said: ”I’ve got to slash my budget. If you can really help me save money, I’d love to hear about it.”After that first meeting, I was baffled. How could she not care about saving money?In retrospect, though, she was probably doing the best thing for her business. In a high-growth company – and investment banks were certainly doing well in the late 1990s with all those IPOs – it makes no sense to make changes that might jeopardise the top line. Why put 40 points of growth at risk just to cut a point or two out of the expense stack? That’s a risk not worth taking.In boom times, she would be a rock star as long as she kept things operating smoothly through the growth. But after the crash, she had to make radical changes. If she couldn’t slash costs, then her successor would.This same dynamic repeated itself in company after company, industry after industry, and as a result, NetApp used the downturn to re-engineer itself. Those were painful years, but looking back, there is no question that the downturn left us much stronger because of the new opportunities that it exposed.To find hidden opportunities in hard times, keep three simple words in mind: “Good enough considering”.Think about how this works in your personal life. You might love a filet mignon, but given the economy, perhaps fish and chips would be good enough considering.Even in hard times, customers still have problems, and they still have some money. If you can solve their problems for less, even if it isn’t the exact solution they had in mind, the crisis can leave you stronger.Our vice chairman Tom Mendoza has a saying: ”Customers only open their wallets when they are in pain.” The good news for some is that economic downturns create lots of pain.
50;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2008-10-17T08:57:27Z;Innovative technologies mitigate environmental impact;;Virtually everywhere I go, companies are focusing on initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change.For most companies, a major source of carbon emissions is the power used in their daily operations. The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that data centres consume 3 per cent of the power in the US and that this will double over the next five years. Corporate data growth is exploding, resulting in a growing storage footprint in the data centre. More storage means more power and more cooling, thereby adding costs and making environmental responsibility more challenging.Understanding that there are two dimensions to data growth helps decipher what we can do to address it. The first driver is the new data that is being created – new database transactions, e-mails, images, documents, and intellectual property. The second driver is the subsequent copies of that data that get proliferated for disaster recovery, developing new applications, compliance requirements, and data mining, to name a few. It’s not uncommon in major enterprises to have 25 copies of the original. Every single one of these copies contributes to the constraints our data centres are faced with.Clearly we have to focus on better ways of managing this growth. Simultaneously we need a keen focus on maintaining and improving the service levels we provide. There are technologies that are fundamentally changing the economics of the data centre and that are significantly improving our ability to accomplish these tasks. These technologies are helping companies dramatically reduce the amount of physical storage needed to meet business objectives and are delivering savings in budget, space, power, and cooling.Thin provisioning is a technology that allows storage to be allocated and procured on demand, thus reducing the need to purchase and operate excess equipment. The net result is increased equipment utilisation rates and reduced costs, space, and power.Deduplication technology searches through all data looking for recurring patterns. It then stores that data once and deletes the duplicates. Deduplication has proved to be one of the most rapidly adopted technologies in the storage industry. Data reductions for back-up typically exceed 90 per cent, but broader adoption in general application areas such as database, virtualised server, and file services frequently realise reductions in excess of 50 per cent.One of the rationales for making copies of data is to make information more accessible throughout the enterprise to facilitate better decision-making and to accelerate time to market for new products and applications. Often, the cost of procuring, operating, and managing these copies limits their use. Thin cloning technology creates multiple logical copies of data without duplicating the physical space and mitigates this concern by enabling the instant and broad dissemination of data at a fraction of the cost. The result is that companies achieve a competitive advantage by better monetising their information assets and bringing products to market faster.Each of these technologies has a big impact on the economics of storage and, cumulatively, it’s even greater. By implementing server and storage virtualisation, a large telecommunications company in the UK slashed the number of its physical servers from more than 3,000 to less than 150, increased storage utilisation from 25 per cent to 70 per cent, and achieved a power savings of 2MW. A major software developer transformed its storage environment and increased its utilisation rates from 40 per cent to over 90 per cent. In both cases these companies cut the unit and power costs of storage by more than 50 per cent while increasing service levels to their businesses.Data proliferation is a fact of life. But by leveraging storage efficiency technologies, we can better manage the growth of data, better utilise the equipment we have, defer new purchases, and mitigate costs and the impact on the environment. These technologies are key elements of an IT strategy for reducing carbon emissions and alleviating budget constraints while achieving greater competitiveness
51;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2008-07-08T15:33:07Z;Valley view: The IT world pokes its head in the cloud;;Mixed with the usual fog rolling off the Pacific into San Francisco at this time of year, there has been a heavy haze and distinct smell of smoke caused by more than a thousand fires burning in northern and central California in the tinder-dry conditions.The atmosphere is being recreated in the tech world with a smoky haze hanging over the rolling concept of cloud computing – just a buzz phrase or perhaps the biggest thing to happen in computing since e-commerce?In a report published two weeks ago, Gartner, the research firm said cloud computing heralds an evolution that is no less influential than e-business.On the same day, Yahoo announced a reorganisation that included “developing a world-class cloud-computing and storage infrastructure” and Microsoft said cloud computing was behind its acquisition of MobiComp, which offers back-up technology for mobile data.Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the Structure ’08 conference discussed how the internet infrastructure needed to be renewed for cloud computing, and start-ups were told the technology offered them pain-free scaling, as they grew into the next eBay or Facebook.If cloud computing sounds a bit nebulous, here are a couple of definitions.Gartner defines it as “a style of computing where massively scalable IT-related capabilities are provided ‘as a service’, using internet technologies, to multiple external customers”.Merrill Lynch, which published a 90-page report on “The Cloud Wars” in May, describes it more simply as “delivering personal and business productivity applications from centralised servers”.Sounds familiar? Yes, this is Application Service Providers (ASPs) and the Software as a Service (SaaS) model that we’ve been talking about for years.But cloud computing does not appear to be a new label pasted on an old bottle to generate fresh sales. What seems to be different this time is the far greater scale that is being attempted. Big companies are involved and they are offering not just services but platforms on which they are encouraging developers to create services and applications.What is being planned is expected to encompass everyone from major enterprises to small start-ups and individual consumers. Hardware companies will vie for the business of equipping massive data farms around the world, while fearing for their PC businesses.Merrill Lynch says the shift harks back to the days of centralised mainframe computing, implying the retreat of its successor, the client-server model.While it is easy to imagine enterprises replacing employees’ desktop PCs with dumb terminals running applications from the cloud, there are also signs of how consumers will opt for this model. Look at how everything can be done in the browser now and stored in the cloud, from e-mail to word-processing and photo and video editing and storage.Nicholas Carr, in his book The Big Switch, compares the rise of utility computing with electrification in the 19th century. Power production switched from in-house generating plants to centralised utilities.Google, with its web-based services and massive infrastructure, seems certain to be a cloud-computing leader, but there are also less likely candidates. The online retailer Amazon has shown others the way in cloud computing, selling its expertise in infrastructure through its Amazon Web Services for the past two years and developing its Elastic Compute Cloud, Simple Storage and database services.Gartner says a company such as Wal-Mart, with its supply chain expertise, could lease its core competencies as a cloud-computing service in similar fashion.Merrill Lynch says the economics are compelling, with business applications made three to five times cheaper and consumer applications five to 10 times cheaper. It sizes the market opportunity at $95bn for applications, with another $65bn coming from online advertising.Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, believes a super-group of technology companies will dominate cloud computing. He expects his company to be one of them. It has its own twist on the concept with Live Mesh, where cloud data is synchronised with every kind of device.Apple, too, hinted at its cloud ambitions when it unveiled the new iPhone last month and a MobileMe web-based service.Merrill Lynch says that only Microsoft and Google have offerings in all three core categories of infrastructure, platform and applications, but other significant players in one or two are Amazon, EMC, IBM, NetSuite, Salesforce.com, Sun and Yahoo.Then others such as Akamai, Dell, HP, NetApp and VMware are enabling cloud technologies with their hardware and software.Fears about reliability, security and performance levels remain as barriers to adoption by businesses.They are likely to be the main arguments used by IT departments to justify their continued existence and to warn their bosses not to put their heads in the clouds too soon.
52;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2008-07-07T20:44:48Z;Wall Street falls as financials sell off;;US stocks fell on Monday in a volatile session of trading as a rout in the financial sector left broader equity markets poised on the brink of bear territory.The S&P 500 briefly dropped more than 20 per cent from its peak – the definition of a bear market – before recovering slightly. The index has now fallen more than 14 per cent for the year to date.The benchmark S&P 500 gained as much as 0.9 per cent and lost as much as 1.8 per cent before closing down 0.8 per cent at 1,252.30 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5 per cent to 11,231.96 points while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,243.32 points, taking both indices back into bear market territory.In financials, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities, led the retreat. They fell as much as 26 per cent and 29 per cent respectively after analysts at Lehman Brothers said that an accounting change could force them to raise extra capital. By the close, Fannie and Freddie were down 16.2 per cent to $15.74 and 17.9 per cent to $11.91.The banking sector took blows across the board as investment banks and regional banks were hit by more analysts downgrades.An analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey pointed to a number of banks, including SunTrust Banks and First Horizon, as having significant exposure to problematic residential construction loans.Lehman also came under pressure after reports that Platts, the energy-pricing company, had put the firm under a review that excludes it from trading some oil contracts. Lehman dropped 8.8 per cent to $20.84.SunTrust dropped 9.1 per cent to $31.74 and First Horizon tumbled 11.3 per cent to $6.27.The banking sector as a whole dipped 3.2 per cent touching its lowest level since October 2002 along the way while an index of investment banks lost 4.1 per cent.Richard Parker, managing director of institutional sales and trading at Stanford Financial, said: “Everyone is looking for any sort of reason to sell . . . There are just no catalysts that could take this market higher while anything negative leads to a knee-jerk reaction.”The day began in positive fashion with a $4 fall in crude oil prices helping carmakers and other consumer-facing stocks to advance.Ford rose 1.1 per cent to $4.47 while Dillard’s added 3.2 per cent to $10.48 and JC Penney gained 1.7 per cent to $37.30.Deal news also provided positive momentum. General Electric added 0.7 per cent to $27.10 after NBC Universal, its media unit, agreed to buy the Weather Channel along with two buy-out groups.Technology was the only sector to make significant gains, however, adding 0.8 per cent on news that Microsoft would consider reopening talks with Yahoo if activist investor Carl Icahn succeeded in replacing the board.Yahoo shares surged 12 per cent to $23.91 while Microsoft rose 0.2 per cent to $26.03.A round of analyst upgrades and positive writeups for the likes of Broadcom, NetApp and Apple, added to the advance. Broadcom rose 7.1 per cent to $28.09, NetApp added 5.5 per cent to $23.15 and Apple climbed 3 per cent to $175.16.Heavily sold industrial and materials stocks also made something of a comeback.In industrials, heavy goods manufacturers Terex and Cummins added 3.7 per cent to $47.60 and 3.8 per cent to $64.05 respectively.In materials, steel stocks led the way after Goldman Sachs said fundamentals remained strong in the industry.US Steel rose 1.3 per cent to $157.75 while Nucor rose 5.6 per cent to $66.07. Energy stocks fared less well, falling as oil prices slipped.Exxon Mobil fell 1.5 per cent to $86.95 while Chevron lost 1.8 per cent to $96.82 and the sector slipped 2.3 per cent.This week marks the un-official start of second-quarter earnings season with Alcoa due to report its results on Tuesday.Analysts currently expect earnings to decline 12.4 per cent compared to last year, according to Thomson Reuters.Should that happen, it would be the first time the S&P 500 has recorded four consecutive quarters of negative growth since 2002.
53;NTAP;Netapp Inc;2005-05-25T17:46:49Z;Network Appliance continues to defy trend;;Shares in Network Appliance slipped 5 per cent on Wednesday morning after the fast-growing data storage company shaved a little from its aggressive near-term revenue forecast and reported a rise in inventories during the latest quarter.However, Wall Street analysts maintain that the forces that turned NetApp into one of the strongest growth stories in Silicon Valley remain intact.NetApp, one of only a handful of big tech companies increasing sales by more than 30 per cent a year, has risen on the back of a new wave of low-cost storage technology. Founded in 1992 and chaired by Don Valentine, the veteran venture capitalist who helped to nurture Cisco Systems in its early days, the storage company has recovered from a 20 per cent collapse in sales the year after the tech bubble burst to record a new boom in orders.Revenues grew 37 per cent, to $1.6bn, in the year to April, NetApp reported late on Tuesday. Earnings in the latest quarter rose 74 per cent to $63m, or 53 per cent excluding certain one-time items, in line with expectations.The company expected revenues this quarter to be 30-33 per cent higher than a year before, slightly below expectations. That echoed the marginally more cautious view it gave when reporting its last earnings three months ago and, together with a rise in inventories, contributed to a retreat in its high-flying shares on Wednesday.Despite that, the company maintained its growth forecasts for the next fiscal year and continued to stick with ambitious investment plans intended to support continued high long-term growth. Bucking the broader trend of flat employment levels in Silicon Valley, NetApp, with 3,200 workers, is expected to hire another 1,200 people next year.The higher costs would depress the storage company's operating profit margin this year, in spite of strong revenue growth, Laura Conigliaro, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said.
